7,Everything You Need to Know About SPA Framework Vue.js,computers-technology," Over the last decade, the usage of javascript has increased rapidly. Eventually, this has made a way for many innovative Javascript libraries and frameworks. One such Javascript framework is Vue.js. It is a newer Javascript framework that has been used by many developers and in such a short amount of time, Vue.js has become quite a popular framework around the world. Here, in this article, we are going to discuss everything about Vue.js. But before that, let's discuss what is a Javascript framework and why these frameworks are important. Consider that you are running a social networking website where you have used Javascript heavily. On this website, there might be various features like Profile pic, commenting on another post, creating your post, and several others. On your website, if a person has changed their profile picture, then all the places where the person has commented and all the posts that the person has liked should contain a new profile picture. Doing this stuff on a basic Javascript website is difficult. For that reason, developers have introduced Javascript frameworks. These Javascript frameworks are difficult to understand and learn but once you learn these frameworks, they make your work easy. Based on these concepts, there are many JS frameworks have been introduced all around the world. Few famous JS frameworks are Vue.js, React, js, Angular.js, Node.js, and many others. In this article, we are going to discuss the Vue.js framework. What is vue.js? Vue.js is a single-page application framework used for front-end development purposes. It is much more similar to the other major front-end frameworks like React.js and Angular. Vue.js has many similarities with both of these frameworks. For example, React has its library called redux and Vue.js has a similar kind of library called Vuex. Along with that, other major similar features of these frameworks are robust, light-weight, and easy to implement. However, react.js is powered by Facebook which has a huge community backing while Vue.js is a relatively new framework. Advantages and disadvantages of vue.js: Vue.js is an easy-to-learn framework that has one of the best documents compared to other major frameworks. Along with that, it has a huge member of an active community that helps Vue.js become a great Javascript framework. Vue.js has a library called Vuex. it makes it easy for the developers when it comes to the state management in Vue.js. State management is very important for large applications. State management enables a developer to reduce the size of a code and make the app look more simple. Vue.js also has similar features called props. With the props, a developer can easily pass a value from one component to another with just one line of code. Say, for example, if a user signs in and is redirected to another page and you want to show their name without using a database then you can simply use a prop component. With prop, you can get a user's name from the signup page and show it on another page. Vue.js has its frameworks for server-side rendering purposes. Server-side rendering is a huge requirement if you are willing to rank your website on Google. Vue.js has not one but two different frameworks for server-side rendering. One is Nuxt.js and another is Quasar. If you are planning to rank your website on google then selecting any of these frameworks can be the right option. Talking about the disadvantages of Vue.js, it is a new framework and it is not backed by any big names. For example, Angular is backed and used by Google while React is used and backed by Facebook. There are fewer jobs for the Vue.js developers. If you are a Vue developer then you might need to try harder to get a full-time job because many companies are working on the react.js and Angular frameworks. So, this is all the information that you need to get started with Vue.js. If you have any questions regarding not only Vue but any other Javascript framework then do let us know by dropping a comment. We would be glad to hear from you and solve your problems in the least amount of time."

10,Supply Chain Cyberattacks On The Rise,computers-technology," Cyberattacks on supply chain companies are particularly devastating to the economic infrastructure. Any supplier of goods, digital or non-digital, counts. Breaches from IT security vulnerability have hit an estimated 93% of supply chain companies. Each one counts as a “one to many” attack, in which the effect extends far beyond the initial target. Ransomware shut down Colonial Pipeline, a major gas conduit, for a week. Kaseya, a software company, got infected with ransomware that spread to 1500 of its small business customers before it was caught. Ransomware shut down food production plants in three different countries when JBS, beef and pork supplier, got hit. Supply chain attacks rose 42% in frequency during the first quarter of 2021. The threat is growing, and the trajectory shows no sign of slowing. 97% of companies were impacted by a supply chain breach, and 93% suffered successful direct attacks. It’s imperative that business owners analyze supply chain risks and formulate a plan in the interests of business continuity and risk management. Even if one company’s security is tight, we all rely on suppliers to get us the materials and tools we need to do business. What happens when any one of them goes down? First, check the risk.  Make a list of all suppliers and vendors  for both goods and services.  Everything from paperclips to the phone systems to the raw materials needed to run the business needs to be on that list. Review each one to see how they’re handling their cybersecurity.  It may help to get an IT person in to help with this review. Are they doing anything? If so, is it sufficient? How bad would it be for the company if that supplier went down? Create a set of minimum cybersecurity standards.  If a supplier or vendor doesn’t meet or exceed them, don’t do business with them. The risks are too high, and that vendor is saying they aren’t professional enough to do business with through their actions. Get the business itself audited for cybersecurity.  Security audits ought to be scheduled at least once per year. Each company should know where it’s vulnerable, how to address that, and how to make their systems strong enough to prevent a breach or attack. Get backup vendors wherever possible.  If doing business requires a particular part that only one vendor makes, then the risk of downtime if that vendor goes down skyrockets.  It’s safer and more flexible to have at least two vendors who can supply the company. All data kept in cloud services or storage should be backed up by a 3rd party tool. Microsoft itself encourages businesses that use its MS365 service suite to get a third party app or platform to back up data.  A business without its data is a business that’s not working. At NoContractVoIP, we provide full, custom business telecom services. Our security and customer service both are top notch.  Our hosted PBX services use six different servers that are geographically scattered for maximum resilience, and our cybersecurity is continually upgraded. In addition, we can provide softphones that work on smartphones, tablets, or computers so if the main office goes down, other devices can pick up the load."

12,Why a small business needs a website,computers-technology," We work with small businesses that are just starting out and don't have a website yet. We hear them say things like ""I don't need a website"" or ""I don't want to spend the money."" But we've found that there are many reasons why even the smallest business should have a presence online—and one of those reasons is because it's easier than ever for them to do so! If you're not sure whether or not you need a website, here are good reasons why you should think about getting one: Reach a wider audience If your customers are looking for the services you offer through Google searches and social media searches, they're going to find your competitors before they find you. You may think that because your business is small and local, people will come see you when they need something or want something done—but that's not always true! If someone is looking for something specific in their area and they can't find it on Google Maps or Yelp, they might just assume it doesn't exist—and then go elsewhere. Get more leads on your website Your customers will be able to contact you directly from their phone or computer if they need anything from you or would like more information on something in particular.

13,Top Ten VoIP Questions Answered,computers-technology," Top 10 VoIP Questions VoIP stands for Voice over Internet Protocol, and it’s the process by which a telephone call can be made using an Internet connection. It transforms the voice signal into a data signal that is carried over the Internet lines like any other data, then translates it back on the other end. So long as the phone you’re using is VoIP enabled, you make it like you make any phone call. The biggest part of it is getting a VoIP phone hooked up. In addition, if you have the right software, you can also make a phone call using your computer and a microphone/speaker combination. A VoIP enabled phone or an adapter for analog phones, or the right software on a computer, tablet, or smartphone, and VoIP service through a provider is all you need for VoIP phone calls. Well, yes and at the same time no.  Rates and limits vary wildly, so do pay attention to the fine print from the VoIP provider. However, one of the things that VoIP enables is creating a local number for a geographically distant location, which then counts as a local call.  So, for instance, if you’re calling from a NYC number, and calling NYC clients, but you’re in Montana, then you still count as “local” to NYC. Anyone who has a telephone. VoIP works fine with existing telephone services, so whoever you’re talking to does not have to also use VoIP. There are loads of advantages to using VoIP call services.

14,"The problem of cryptocurrency and energy consumption, how Elrond's Network comes to the rescue",computers-technology," Recently, there has been considerable focus on Bitcoin's alarming environmental effect. Although efforts are being made to reduce the cryptocurrency's carbon footprint, it is critical to understand why cryptocurrencies consume so much energy? The Elrond Network, a new wave of blockchain technology, has launched a new trend in the industry. Find out more by reading the full article. What is the reason for the high energy consumption of cryptocurrencies? Did you know that the ""mining"" process that creates bitcoin uses more energy than Serbia, according to Digiconomist? Bitcoin mining is accomplished by solving cryptographic problems, also known as Proof of Work (PoW). The miner who finds the answer first earns a Bitcoin reward. While the race to find a solution is resource-intensive and requires a lot of energy, it consumes a lot of energy as well. Bitcoin mining now consumes 58.93 TWh per year. More significant is Bitcoin's carbon impact. The Bitcoin network emits 22 megatons of CO2 per year due to its energy consumption. Carbon footprints of metropolises like Kansas City may be compared to this one. What are the steps to go green with crypto? The most well-known cryptocurrency employing PoW is Bitcoin, but it is far from the only one. Several cryptos employ different kinds of PoW. Ethereum, one of the three most popular cryptos, uses a PoW algorithm. While Bitcoin alone consumes a lot of power, if other PoW cryptos gain popularity, the situation might worsen much faster. Despite the fact that potential solutions range from theoretical to practical, the bitcoin community is aware of the problem. However, here are some solutions that can be implemented to fix this problem: Given the abundance of various consensus algorithms, let's examine some of the most efficient ones. Proof of Authority is an alternative to Proof of Work. To validate new blocks in the network, every validating node must expose its true identity. Additionally, it is a reputation-based consensus method that does not rely on intense mining. It is the least energy-consuming of the consensus methods. There are a variety of approaches that can be used to produce more energy-efficient blockchains. Energy efficiency simply means that we can transmit and complete more transactions while using the same amount of energy or less Sustainable mining solutions come in many forms. Solar power, for example, may be used to mine bitcoins in areas with abundant sunshine, such as Texas. Solar energy is often too large for the grid to manage, so it must be discarded. Elrond Network: The First Carbon Negative European Blockchain Elrond is the first carbon-negative European blockchain, ushering in a revolutionary era of sustainable innovation by European climate policy, as well as a new age of highly scalable, energy-efficient blockchain technology. Elrond has achieved carbon neutrality by offsetting more CO2 emissions than it can account for. Elrond's current capacity of 15,000 transactions per second, which can be expanded to 100,000 TPS, can result in a 1000-fold increase in throughput and execution speed, while the energy required to perform a transaction can be reduced by up to 6 million times. Offset's sustainability experts analyzed the Elrond blockchain's carbon footprint, measuring the energy consumption of over 5,000 servers throughout 30 countries on six continents. They also measured the network that connects them, as well as the additional impact of product development and operations. Elrond reported 6M kg CO2 footprint carbon units, corresponding to 7.4M kg CO2, resulting in a 25% impact on the environment. With the first in a series of investments in certified green initiatives, the network has become carbon-negative. The environmental damage sustained by the existing financial system and most blockchain implementations may ultimately have a detrimental effect over time. Elrond's carbon-negative actions, on the other hand, open up a whole new horizon. It has the potential to provide a strong and sustainable basis for development, as well as one that will protect the planet for which it makes progress.

Find Out More about Local SEO Services SEO is already a term that many are familiar with. They heard about it, but the idea is still complex, and it involves so many factors that it is hard to keep up with everything. Businesses have a lot of aspects to look into, they need to manage their activity, focus on products and services, train employees, they must develop pricing policies, distribution, delivery, and so much more.

Increase relevant traffic It is one thing to have plenty of traffic on the website, and another thing to have relevant traffic. When people need something, they type keywords, and once your website pops up, it means they trust it, they will browse through it, until they find what they want. Prospect buyers evaluate the functionality and speed of the platform, and if they like what they see, they will eventually buy. The click-through rate is essential, and once you are on top positions, you can double it. If you want your site to be seen by customers, then it needs to rank high in search engine results. Think about your behavior as well, and how often you visit the next pages of results, how much do you trust those platforms, and how likely you are to buy from them. Improve the web experience Local SEO services will let you know that the web experience matters greatly to visitors and prospective buyers. So, you made it on top positions, people click on the site, but they don’t like what they see. They don’t enjoy the interface, they don’t find the website user-friendly, and they abandon it, going to the next result. The success of your online business depends on many other factors, such as backlinks, page speed, content, interactivity, and such. If you follow the rules of search engines, then you need to keep the site in good health. This way, you obtain more exposure, and users will trust you more, believing that you do something right since you manage to be in top positions. Local SEO Services Improve Brand Awareness Perhaps you have some amazing products and services, and you want to show the world your portfolio.

17,How Businesses Can Benefit from Website Content Writing Services,computers-technology," Online businesses have many more opportunities at their disposal to advertise their services and products, and especially to interact with consumers on various channels. On the other hand, the pressure is high as well, and the competition is fierce, and brands need to come up with ways to keep users engaged. Website content writing services make sure you have quality content throughout all communication channels. Perhaps many don’t think about these types of services when they want to promote their businesses online, but they are essential and any experienced SEO agency will tell you the same thing. In fact, specialists working within the field have a dedicated team of writers that manage solely this aspect. This way, others can focus on other tactics, and everyone will help your business boost its online presence and attract more relevant traffic. What Are Website Content Writing Services Creating content regularly takes a lot of time and effort, and not all businesses have a dedicated team that can take on the job. Not to mention there are some structures and keywords involved, and not everyone can simply write articles, blog posts, content on websites, social media, and such. The good news is that website content writing services exist, and those specialized in the field will take care of every aspect, posting content regularly on various sources. One major advantage is connecting with the target audience. Only a few blog posts now and then will not make a lot of difference, because it takes regular posting to attract prospective buyers. Through it, they will have more trust in your brand, and they will help generate more sales. Business owners have a lot on their minds, and they need to worry of business processes, sales, figures, employees, and such. They are not able to manage the content writing aspect, which is why they decide to outsource everything. This means finding a high-quality provider that offers complete digital marketing services, making it possible to optimize your website, rank high in search engine results, and improve brand visibility. Afterwards, plenty of traffic will be generated, and you need to engage with your potential buyers. Rank High on Search Engines This is the dream of many online businesses, to improve their organic rankings, and have a good position on the first pages of search results. However, this is a long process. It takes much effort and plenty of knowledge and skills. it is not impossible to achieve, but it is particularly easier for someone that already have experience in this field, and can provide direct services, without having to learn everything from the basics. Search engines are very complex and have many algorithms. It is often difficult to keep up with everything, but not for someone that does it on a regular basis. Having consistent and unique content definitely improves ranking, especially if it features relevant keywords, topics, and backlinks. Once you collaborate with marketing and SEO agencies, you obtain these great services. Focus on existing content Website content writing services don’t focus on new content, but also optimizing the existing one. Considering that search engine algorithms change constantly, online businesses have outdated content on their platforms, and these eventually affects the rankings. The negative impact on the business is obvious, and soon enough, they find out they don’t have a top position in search results. Agencies that provide website content writing services have a team of SEO professionals that work there, and can take in plenty of tasks, write relevant content for businesses in all fields. On top of that, they have additional optimizing services, including website audit, and link building, to help your business grow online, and attract as many potential buyers as possible. Conversion rate Perhaps you believe anyone can write some content, that they can copy paste data on blogs and websites, but it is not the case. Website content writing services are professional, and they help improve the conversion rate. This is because they focus on persuasive content, with call to action to convert users into leads. Every business wants this, to convert a user into a buyer, and there are some ways to succeed this. The main idea is to attract viewers, to engage them into reading the content on the website, and then invite them on your website, to discover what you have to offer. The landing page is crucial and it should be highlighted throughout the article. A marketing agency will make sure this happens, because it has all the necessary knowledge and skills to assure this. How to Locate the Right Agencies When it comes to putting your business into someone else’s hands, it is not an easy task, and this is what many business owners face. Some believe it is better to hire dedicated personnel, but it is not the case, because not everyone is experienced in digital marketing, and you still need to train them. It will take some time until they are prepared to take over challenging tasks. Perhaps this is a luxury that you cannot afford, and you want everything to happen as soon as possible. Instead, outsourcing services makes more sense. From the minute you sign the contract with the agency, you benefit from their level of expertise, team of specialists, and they will take over the website, analyze it, propose improvements, and focus on other strategies to boost your online presence and grow the business. You don’t have to wait around too much until you see results, and you pay for the desired packages, which means you have better control over costs. Websites that have blog posts and relevant content are better seen by viewers, they have more trust in them, because they get to know more about the business, and about what represents it better. A website that has no quality content, no relevant pictures, does not load fast, and has many bugs, will not be perceived very well by potential buyers, and they will close the pages to look somewhere else for what they seek."
18,A SEO London Agency that Handles Digital Marketing,computers-technology," The online world is the key to the success of a company, but there are quite a few twists and turns along the way. People who want to get the best returns on the resources they invest in the online activity must know how to set their goals and how to achieve them. The best option they have at hand for this purpose is to work with a SEO London agency with knowledge and experience. The First Steps Are not the Only Steps A lot of people are used to investing a certain effort into something and reaping the benefits of their labor at the end. The online world is not the same and there is a lot of work that goes into any online activity. It is important to build a solid website that will represent the interests of the company, but the work is not over when the site is launched. This is just the starting point for it. There are quite a few things that must be done once the site is up and running. First it must be made more popular over the web and the best way to do that is by optimizing it for search engine algorithms. Once it has reached a certain level, it will be a constant struggle to stay at the top. It is not easy to achieve success over the web and it is important to use every bit of help available. Use the Right Methods at the Right Time How can companies make their sites more popular? Popularity over the web will consist of how many people visit the site. The more visitors it will have, the more exposure it will get and the easier it will be to achieve the success the site deserves. Making the right choice is not easy when the knowledge of how the online world works is not as well developed as it should be. When a site is starting out and the main goal is to have as many visitors as possible, pay per click methods can be a solution. This is a solution because it will help search engines see that the site is visited, but this will only happen as long as there is a budget for it. If the funding stops, the clicks will no longer be available and thus the popularity of the company site will also plummet. Even if pay per click is useful at the start, an organic method must be used at the same time. Link building strategies will provide a long lasting solution to improve the popularity of a site. This implies publishing new and original content over the web with links that trace back to the site of the company. This is the best way to achieve success over the web that will last for a long time. Setting Goals with the Help of a SEO London Marketing Agency Investing resources in online marketing is the most important move any company can make, but it is important to set the right goals. Attracting visitors to the site is the first goal that will have to be achieved, but this must lead to other results as well.

Brands are the building blocks that create success and a company must use all the tools it has at hand to build a brand that people can trust. A SEO London agency can offer the guidance needed to create a brand that people can trust. Search engines can help, but the main channel they are going to use for this is social media because this is where people express their opinions and trust. Even if two main online marketing goals are achieved, this does not mean the work is done. Any business relies on sales to generate income and profit, but the number of visitors and the brand name does not guarantee this. They are going to help, but the ultimate goal is to convert visitors into paying customers and a SEO London marketing agency is going to provide the solutions. Online Success will Pave the Road to Real Results Boosting sales and the company income is going to make the activity a lot more profitable and this is the goal any business strives for. The financial benefits open the door for investments and the growth of the business in many other areas.

This happens because they are going to offer guidance so companies can set the right goals in terms of online marketing, they will help businesses analyze the progress they have made and how to manage it properly. It is easier to reap the benefits of all the hard work invested in the company with the right help. Outsourcing – a Cost Efficient Solution for Achieving Goals Keeping a full time team on the payroll to handle digital marketing is viable for big companies, but outsourcing is better for small enterprises that are just starting out. This happens because the companies can benefit from the experience of an entire team of experts. These guys will put in the time and the effort to be sure their clients will succeed and all their goals will be achieved. People can use the web to explore the market for the best SEO London marketing agency. This is where they will find a lot of options they can turn to and they can learn more about the activity of the experts. The more they learn, the surer they will be about the help they can provide for the success of the company and the areas they will be able to cover from start to finish."
19,The Difference Between Biomethane and Biogas,computers-technology," What is the difference between biomethane and biogas? That's a good question and one that is more and more often being asked. So, let's dive in and answer that question. Both are renewable gas derivatives that are produced from the fermentation of discarded organic materials during the anaerobic digestion process. Biogas is produced where anaerobic digestion occurs naturally in landfills and from digesters which are used to reduce the volume of the sludge produced during aerobic sewage treatment. We explain why biogas products cause the emission of fewer greenhouse gas than others. Biomethane is nothing other than biogas which has been purified in a way which removes the impurities (mostly carbon dioxide and water vapour) in the raw biogas output from the digester tank. In fact, biomethane is usually synonymous with ""natural gas"" because it is pressurised and given a calorific value almost identical to natural gas. The only real difference is that natural gas is a fossil fuel and causes climate-changing carbon emissions when it is burnt while in large, in the bigger scheme of things over a 3 to 5-year timescale, biomethane is not. Biomethane is a renewable fuel and can be made in truly sustainable ways. Because biogas and natural gas have the same methane molecule, it can be used in LNG engines among others. Biogas is regarded as being clean during combustion, but LNG is better because it is made up of 99.9% methane and is created from organic waste. Biomethane and its main source which is ""biogas"" are destined to become big players as key components of the energy transition. The energy transition is a pragmatic strategy to move toward reduced greenhouse gas emissions and diversifying energy matrices as soon as possible while using technology already proven to work. Although today, biomethane accounts for only a fraction of natural gas demand, this will grow as more biogas plants are built and commissioned. Generally, in most nations, biomethane suppliers provide biogas at rates below 10% of the available natural gas supply. Nevertheless, this percentage is rising fast. The difference between biogas and biomethane is that the former is produced through the fermentation of biomass, and the latter is the end product after upgrading. The anaerobic decomposition and fermentation of organic matter to produce methane gas is a natural process that has existed for millions of years, before the emergence of fossil fuels. It is nature's way of recycling waste alongside aerobic decomposition. The first human use of biogas dates to at least 3,000 BC, when the Assyrians burned it for baths. Biogas is a renewable fuel that can be used for a variety of purposes, including generating electricity, and heat, and when it has been cleaned-up  as a low air-pollution transport fuel. In the United States, biogas is mainly extracted from where it is produced in landfills, and from the anaerobic treatment of livestock manure on livestock farms. About 90% of biogas produced in the US comes from landfills unti;l 2020. In the United States, however, biomethane is also produced from agricultural waste from large farms. In fact, livestock carbon emissions account for one-third of the US nation's methane emissions. Due to state and federal support, the United States is the global leader in the use of biomethane for transport. Biomethane is an energy-rich gas that is created during the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter. It is composed primarily of methane and carbon dioxide. In its raw form, biogas may contain between forty and sixty percent methane and only small amounts of water vapour and other gases. After undergoing refinement, biogas can be used as a substitute for conventional natural gas. While biogas and biomethane have similar qualities, there are some differences between them. Biogas generally contains more hydrogen than biomethane but because of the other impurities present, it is not usually seen as being compatible with conventional fuels. Biogas has the same methane molecule as natural gas, so it can be used in LNG engines. Because it is 99.9% methane, biogas is considered cleaner than LNG and is produced from organic matter. Biogas also emits fewer greenhouse gases. In addition to being the raw material for producing biomethane, biogas also has some benefits. But biomethane wins out as experience in biomethane plant ownership it can help prevent emissions throughout the value chain. Biogas is produced naturally in an atmosphere-controlled environment. In addition to reducing fossil fuel use, biomethane also produces biofertiliser, which returns organic carbon back to the soil. That process also helps reduce the need for mineral fertilisers. These are all positive steps in a sustainable energy supply chain. The use of organic materials in biomethane production improves hygienic conditions in rural areas. The process also decreases the risk of watercourse pollution. Biogas and biomethane contributes to the economy of rural communities and preserves nature. There are many similarities between biogas and biomethane, and a better understanding of their different roles will help you make a decision on the best option for your needs. A common biogas upgrade involves the use of a scrubber. It captures the biogas produced by anaerobic digestion and removes the hydrogen sulfide (H2S) present in it. By injecting air into the scrubber tank, the bacteria oxidise the H2S compound further and convert it to elemental sulfur. Some common methods of removing hydrogen sulphide (H2S) from biogas include introducing some air/oxygen to the digester biogas which is added using lagoon aerators and adding iron chloride to the feed slurry."
20,Things to Know About Online Coding Boot Camps,computers-technology," Before pursuing an online coding boot camp program, consider a few things to consider. One important aspect is the availability of career-focused mentors and tutors. While an in-person boot camp will likely have on-site tutors and instructors, online coding boot camps will often feature virtual interaction via Slack. In addition, online coding boot camps will usually have similar admission standards as their physical counterparts. However, these requirements may vary slightly from one program to the next. Disadvantages of coding bootcamps One of the main advantages of online coding boot camps is the convenience of self-paced learning. These programs mimic classroom-style instruction, but students can complete coursework on their own schedule, requiring no classroom attendance. The disadvantage is that students may not have the benefit of interaction with a real mentor. However, online coding boot camps are becoming increasingly popular as they offer an array of advantages, including a convenient scheduling option and virtual instructors. Another advantage of coding boot camps is that they are less expensive than traditional college courses. Although they require less time to complete, online coding boot camps may not be for you. Online programs often require ten to sixteen hours of study and at least six days of coding. However, you may not receive as many job offers or earn the same salary as a college graduate. Another disadvantage is that online coding boot camps may not be suited for you if you don't like being immersed in a learning environment. Cost of attending a coding bootcamp The cost of attending an online coding bootcamp may vary widely depending on the program and the location of the school. Many bootcamps require personal computers or laptops capable of handling program activities. In-person bootcamps typically cost around $11,750, although many offer discounts for early applicants. Online programs generally mimic their in-person counterparts and use online collaboration tools such as Slack and Zoom to meet students. Because online bootcamps are remote, they must understand the best way to deliver content to students. Some programs require that students have a high-speed internet connection and headphones. While attending an online coding bootcamp may seem like an expensive investment, it's not as expensive as you might think. Many programs offer career preparation services, including mentorship sessions with experienced tech industry professionals, networking events, and internship opportunities. The cost of attending a coding bootcamp is comparable to the costs of an undergraduate degree at a four-year college. However, there are a few drawbacks. Career placement services offered by coding bootcamps Career placement services offered by online coding bootcamps can be useful for students who have a specific industry in mind, but do not have the time or money to go to a traditional classroom. The services offered can be in-person or virtual, and may offer more personalized services. An online coding bootcamp may not be as interactive as an in-person option, but it can be helpful if you're interested in getting hands-on training. One of the most important things to look for when selecting an online coding boot camp is how many companies offer these services. While some of these programs may offer only part-time work, others may specialize in contract, freelance or part-time roles. While online coding boot camps don't offer full-time positions, they do offer other career-related services, such as help with interview preparation. Some online coding boot camps even offer financial assistance if you cannot pay the full tuition. Requirements for attending a coding bootcamp If you're looking to learn to code, you've probably heard that coding bootcamps are a great way to learn the necessary skills for a high-tech career. However, what are the requirements to attend a coding bootcamp? Before you apply, you should consider your background in technology. Some coding bootcamps require students to complete a coding challenge or small project to demonstrate their skills. Other bootcamps offer tutorials that teach you the basics of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and more. Generally, a coding bootcamp is a full-time program, though part-time options are also available. This option is often better for students with a demanding schedule or those with small children. You can also choose the type of learning experience you prefer, whether you'd prefer to learn in a classroom setting with a small group of fellow students or one-on-one with a mentor. Depending on your experience and the requirements of the bootcamp, you should begin the application process a few months before the start of the bootcamp."

1,5 Popular Types of Web Hosting Services Explained,computers-technology," Multiple websites can use a same server with shared hosting. Typically, you will have no idea who or what websites are sharing a server's resources with you. Each client often has a restriction on the overall amount of server resources that they may use, however this is determined by your hosting package. Shared hosting is perhaps the most cost-effective and inexpensive option for your needs. However, the low price comes with some limitations, which we'll discuss further below. Because most hosting firms provide the same amount of space and storage, it's critical to select a business you can rely on. Advantages of Shared Hosting Shared hosting is by far the most affordable hosting option. Most hosting firms offer different tiers of hosting, so you may gradually improve your hosting service. As a result, shared hosting is ideal for launching a website. Shared hosting often has a built-in cPanel that is simple to use and maintain. Shared hosting is an excellent choice for website owners on a tight budget. Disadvantages of Shared Hosting Shared hosting is inexpensive and simple to administer even without technical knowledge. However, it has several downsides. The load time might be sluggish, and the server can get overcrowded due to other sites using the same server. When your website begins to receive more traffic, you will notice that the load speed of your website becomes noticeably slower, and now is the time to improve. Shared hosting lacks specific choices for optimising your website's performance. VPS web hosting is a newer form of web hosting that has just recently gained popularity. Virtual Private Server (VPS) is an acronym for it. Many individuals and businesses seeking a web host for their Internet endeavours are bewildered by VPS hosting. Because it is a hybrid of shared and dedicated hosting, this is the case. A virtual private server has its own operating system, storage space, and bandwidth. A physical server in a data centre used for VPS hosting is separated into different areas, each of which creates its own virtual server. The server administrator sees just their virtual environment and may utilise or reboot the server as if it were their own dedicated server. Many hosting customers prefer VPS hosting because they have more control over their environment than shared hosting. VPS hosting is a suitable beginner option for consumers who desire dedicated hosting but are unsure about the technological know-how required. They can try it out and expand their skill set without having to invest as much money up front. Advantages of Virtual Private Server (VPS) A virtual private server (VPS) may be configured to perform optimally for your website. Because of the more advanced settings, a company that uses managed VPS will immediately see hosting benefits such as enhanced performance. A VPS is normally more expensive than shared hosting, but it is not more expensive than dedicated hosting. A high-performance VPS is not much more expensive than most shared hosting options. It is easy to understand why a VPS is a much better bargain. In terms of security, VPS is more secure than shared hosting since it has a closed environment with no shared resources. For example, if a virus infects any of the websites housed on a shared network, it may quickly traverse the directory structure and infect everything in its path. Disadvantages of Virtual Private Server (VPS) Virtual private server hosting are usually more expensive than shared hosting. While the cost is greater, you receive more bang for your buck when compared to shared hosting. Dedicated servers are frequently regarded as the best web hosting solution. This is because you get a lot more benefits with dedicated hosting, such as greater uptime and faster speeds. On the other side, dedicated servers are the most expensive type of web hosting. Websites that are hosted on a dedicated server have complete control over the server setup. You have the option of selecting your favourite software and customisations. If you buy a dedicated server, you should expect it to have an extremely high uptime and lightning-fast loading rates. You will never have to worry about other websites' traffic interfering with the operation of your website. However, a high degree of technical skill is necessary for the server's installation and ongoing operation. Advantages of Dedicated Servers Dedicated servers are one of the most reliable and stable hosting. It guarantees that you are not sharing your space with a malicious software or a spammer. Dedicated servers give more security, which is why they are necessary for firms that undertake FTP or SSL transactions. Dedicated server hosting usually includes a 24x7 support team to deal with technical issues to ensure high uptimes. One of the most often held beliefs about dedicated hosting is that you have complete control over your server. As the site admin you can custom all the tools and applications, as long as the hosting provider supports them. Disadvantages of  Dedicated Servers To maintain a dedicated server, you must have strong technical knowledge and be able to troubleshoot any technological difficulties that arise. This might be time-consuming at times. You will also need to employ an expert to address these problems at times. As a result, maintenance expenses will be substantially greater than with shared hosting. Cloud hosting is a server and network architecture that divides a single physical server into several virtual servers using software. These devices are frequently referred to as virtual machines. To suit their daily demands, businesses have begun to migrate to cloud hosting. These servers may be used for a variety of purposes, including web hosting, application development, and remote-accessible desktop work environments. Unlike typical shared hosting, Cloud Hosting allots dedicated resources to each Cloud Server, rather than vying for computing resources among many distinct users' websites and apps. Each Cloud Server is given a partitioned disk with storage space that can only be accessed from inside their own operating instance. Each server is given a set quantity of RAM and CPU cores. In addition to the resources you pay for, your Cloud Server might burst to utilise more resources during off-peak hours. Advantages of Cloud Hosting One of the primary reasons why businesses are shifting to cloud hosting is because it is more cost-effective than on-premise technology. Companies would have to pay money on disks or other storage devices, as well as an IT crew to manage these equipment, with traditional hosting. However, with cloud hosting, you just pay the provider from whom you are purchasing the resources. This saves the firm resources, money, and time. Disadvantages of Cloud Hosting One of the most serious difficulties with Cloud hosting may be security vulnerabilities that may develop if a person without technical understanding attempts to utilise the service. To take use of the service, you will constantly require technical help. Because cloud hosting firms share resources, this might be another source of security concerns. A colocation hosting solution is comparable to dedicated hosting in that it provides several methods to improve your website and its resources. It is safe and dependable, but you will need some technical understanding to get the most out of it. Colocation does not employ the hosting company's servers; instead, you purchase or rent all of your own gear and software and place it in a data centre. Colocation hosting is appropriate for high-traffic websites. Colocation hosting is also appropriate for beginning hosting firms who have not yet built their own data centre. When you choose colocation hosting, you have significantly greater protection than with other types of hosting, as well as total control and flexibility over the hardware and software. Advantages of Colocation Hosting When it comes to network security, colocation hosting is always the best option. This is because data centres contain top-tier network security, such as the most recent firewalls or intrusion detection systems, to identify and block unauthorised network access. Colocation hosting also provides power redundancy through the use of several power grids, diesel generators, double battery backup systems, and good maintenance procedures. It enables you to extend your infrastructure to meet the demands of your company's expansion without incurring capital expenses. Disadvantages of Colocation Hosting Colocation hosting requires a greater initial investment in both hardware and software, as well as upgrades and maintenance in terms of time or resources."

3,5 Most Common Http Errors Explained,computers-technology," This is the most typical error message encountered by online users. This is a generic error that might occur whenever a web server encounters an internal problem. Error 500 is most commonly seen when the web hosting server is overcrowded. You can resolve this error message by refreshing the page, clearing your your browser's cache, removing all of your web browser's cookies, or restarting the web browser. If you get this problem on your website, contact your web hosting provider; if it's a wordpress website, it might be a conflict with one of your third-party plugins. Try deleting these plugins one by one to in the cPanel to verify which is the one that casing the conflict. A 401 unauthorised error is a http status code message that often occurs when a user tries to visit an unauthorised website or after an unsuccessful login attempt to an unauthorised website. The webmaster normally protects these unauthorised websites with a password using cPanel. This error message indicates that something went wrong with your web browser in response to your request. This usually signifies that the data transmitted by the browser does not follow the rules of the http protocol. The server is unable to handle a request with incorrect syntax. This might indicate that the user's internet connection is unreliable, that there is a security vulnerability inside the operating system, that there is a caching issue, or that the browser is malfunctioning. If you try to enter a restricted directory on a web browser, you will encounter this error notice, which indicates that there is no login option on the page. The most typical reason a user would receive this error message is if the website does not allow users to browse the site's file directory structure or if the individual file requested is not allowed to be accessed via the web. You may enable 403 protection on your own site for security purposes by masking the directory structure or files that contain susceptible information. This is a fantastic technique to safeguard your site from being hacked. Although many web servers provide this feature by default, you may add an extra security layer to your site by opening your cPanel account, navigating to the Advanced menu box, and selecting Index Manager. By selecting 'No Indexing' on the directory you desire to protect, you may customise how your users view a certain directory on your website. A 404 not found error message will show whenever a user attempts to visit a non-existent web page. This warning is typically displayed when a user exits the browser, presses the stop button, or clicks on a link too rapidly - however, it may also occur when a file is excessively big or a server is working too slowly. You have most certainly encountered a 404 error when exploring the web. If the server cannot discover anything on the requested location, a 404 message will be shown. This is frequently due to a mistyped URL, but it can also occur when users attempt to access deleted or temporarily inaccessible pages. You should try to decrease the amount of 404s on your website as much as possible because they will almost always boost your bounce rate. It should be observed that the 404 message and the 410 error page are quite similar. While both show that the server was unable to locate the requested file, the 410 implies that this is a permanent condition, implying that the resource was most likely purposely rendered inaccessible."

6,How De-Packaging Equipment Can Benefit Your Food Waste Business,computers-technology," If you produce, or receive and wish to pre-treat an organic waste such as food waste and are interested in de-packaging equipment, then you are in the right place. In this article, we will discuss how de-packaging equipment can benefit your business. If you are considering investing in de-packaging equipment, you need to consider several factors. In addition to the equipment's performance, it's also important to consider the cost and maintenance. Below are some of the key merits of de-packaging equipment plus we list a selection of manufacturers. Hammermill-based De-packagers The first de-packaging machines were based on the hammermill that is often used in wood-processing operations. This process separates the packaging from the food by smashing it up under that action of the rotating hammers in the mill. Newer models are designed to separate packaging while using minimal force. They use fine adjustments to the angle of small paddles or plates mounted on a rotating shaft. Once separated, the separated packaging is conveyed out of the machine in two output streams. These are the organic fraction or ""pulp"" which has the consistancy of a thick soup, and the reject stream. Paddle Based De-packagers Other models use paddles but these can also berak up the various materials of the packaging very small especially when combined with a shredder. Inevitably this also creates a lot of small plastic pieces known as microplastics. Microplastics are increasingly being recognised as a hazard to the environment, and are also getting into our bodies and are found in human blood. Food-waste De-packaging Machines Large and Small Food-waste de-packaging machines all provide a process that separates organic and inorganic waste from packaging. The types of packaging processed and the rates of generation of this waste vary enormously. Although the manufacturers supply a range of depackager sizes the rate of processing may vary depending on the exact nature of the organic waste.  Despite being available in many types and capacities the manufacturer may suggest configuring their machines with special modifications and many suppliers offer modular systems enabling the addition of further process units for subsequent settlement, for sand and grit removal, and/ or for example a strainer/ dewatering stage. Scott Equipment Company For example, one de-packaging machine, the Scott Equipment Company's model T42 Turbo Separator, can process anywhere from 10 to 30 tons of packaged food waste per hour. It has 56 flat paddles that work together to split, separate, and convey the waste. Organic materials are collected and conveyed to holding areas, while inorganic wastes are pumped into a compactor. These machines use rotating paddles and flails to break open packages. The MEGA-THOR has a capacity of 40 tons per hour. TWISTER De-packagers and Separators These models allow for the separation of organic materials from packaging and Twister has been credited with supplying one of the best de-packaging systems on the market. They are capable of recovering 90% or more of the materials inside the packaging and may satisfy the Swedish inert content standard. They can even separate sticky solids, which are difficult to remove from the packets and wrappers. An optional screw press can dewater the rejected packaging. The best model to choose depends on the size of your project. And be sure to check with the manufacturer for any warranties and technical support. Atritor Turbo Separators The Atritor TS3096 is capable of separating wet and dry materials, handling both wet and dry waste. Avoiding the need to add water can be essential for an efficient waste-to-energy-plant. Customer feedback has attested to the fact that the Atritor they bought enabled the company to expand its vehicle fleet bring in more organic waste and invest in an even bigger de-packaging system. Tiger DePack Machines Designed for efficient and productive operation, Tiger DePack machines are ideal for processing food waste. They are the front-end of the AD process and offer excellent throughput capabilities. Blue Group, the supplier of Tiger Depack machines, has an excellent support network. They are also available from stock in the UK, making it a crucial part of your de-packaging plant's uptime and efficiency. Brask Xtractor An advanced piece of waste-management equipment, the Brask Xtractor depaks packaged liquids. It is good at separating the liquid from the solid materials and is also described as highly durable and maintenance-free. The Dominator The Dominator is credited with being able to handle wet or dry metal tin can products. It can even separate plastic bottles. Mavitec The Mavitec depackaging machine is a horizontal shaft-based machine with paddles and flails mounted on it. The angle of the paddles can be adjusted to accommodate the feedstock. The machine rotates at approximately 800 rpm. The capacity of the Mavitec depackaging machine depends on the complexity of depackaging. This equipment will remove 99.9% of the organic material from the packaging and will be a great benefit to the county."
7,Analysis of the Causes of Cable Joint Failures in Cross-linked Cables,computers-technology," Due to different modes and operating conditions of cable joints, different technical levels of construction personnel and uneven quality of cable accessories, the reasons for cross-linked cable joint failures also vary. Failures of cross-linked cable joints are mainly concentrated in two areas. (1) Connecting metal tool contact surface is not handled well. Due to the production or storage conditions, there are impurities on the terminals or the wall of the connecting tube, burrs and oxide layer. The impact of conductor connection quality is quite serious. Especially the surface of aluminum is very easy to produce hard and insulating alumina film layer. Therefore, the connection process of aluminum conductors is much more rigorous than that of copper conductors. (2) Damage to conductors. The cross-linked insulating layer is tougher and more difficult to peel and cut. Construction personnel ring cut with an electrician's knife left scratch right cutting, sometimes simply use a ring saw cut deep marks, often poor grip and make the conductor damage. (3) The conductor wire is not laid well. Conductor connection when the insulation stripping length required to crimp the gold hole depth more 5mm, but because the product hole depth is not standard, easy to cause the stripping length is not enough or because of crimping when the string position so that the wire end of the formation of voids, resulting in increased contact resistance, increased heat generation. (1) Crimping machine pressure is not enough. Crimping machine production plant more, but there is no uniform standard, some mechanical pressure pliers narrow pit and crimping in place after the upper and lower pressure die does not match. (2) Has large gaps in the connection fittings. Most cross-linked cable splices use connecting fittings or oil paper cable by producing fan-shaped cable lugs and pressure tubes. In theory, the effective cross-section of round and fan-shaped wire cores is the same, but by the actual operation of the two the crimping effect is very different. Since the conductors of cross-linked wires are tightly stranded round cores, with the commonly used inner diameter of the metal tool has a large gap, crimp does not achieve sufficient compressive strength. The contact resistance is inversely proportional to the applied pressure, so the resistance increases. Insufficient cross-section of the connection fitting is a very important reason for heating of cross-linked cable joints."
8,Email Spoofing - What Is It & How to Protect Yourself,computers-technology," Email Spoofing – What Is It & How to Protect Yourself Within days of being hired, a new employee in our accounting department received an email from our CEO asking them to place an order for much needed equipment.  Excited to be part of the team and show responsiveness our new champion almost fell victim to a growing type of cyberattacks. The email seemed appropriate and looked legitimate – we were just a few clicks away from being hacked and compromised by a spoofed email.  This wasn’t the first time we received a suspicious message.  In fact, cybersecurity experts say attacks are up 300% in this past year. What is email spoofing? Email spoofing is a technique used by hackers to trick you into thinking a message came from a person or organization you know or trust – most commonly your CEO or colleague, though often vendors or brands. Can you tell the difference between paypal.com and paypaI.com? Spoofed emails look legitimate – often creating a sense of urgency or need for action.  If pretending to be from someone in your organization, commonly from a person of authority but could be a peer.  If from an external source, even clicking links in them take you to landing pages that look just like the real vendors landing page (branding, logos, layout, etc.) – put next to the real site, they look nearly identical. Email spoofing statistics •	Over 3 billion domain spoofing emails are sent each day •	More than 90% of cyberattacks start with an email message •	43% of cyber attacks target small and medium sized businesses •	69% of hackers say they were never detected by a company’s security measures •	It takes over 6-months on average to detect a breach (they’re in your business for a long time) How to prevent from being spoofed During a recent Cybersecurity Insurance webinar, local experts discussed steps to drastically reduce the risk of being compromised and shared recommended actions to take if you receive a suspicious email.  As Steve Szubinski, president of PCA Technology Group shared, it’s all about layers of protection. Enable Multi-Factor authentication (MFA).  Microsoft 365 includes MFA with the service; however, it is turned off by default.  If you are not sure it has been enabled for your company, contact your trusted IT provider.  According to Microsoft, MFA can block over 99.9 percent of account compromise attacks.  While MFA won’t prevent you from receiving a disguised malicious email, any compromised accounts will be difficult to use. Enable External Email Notification.  When this service is enabled with your Microsoft 365 subscription, a notification banner will appear across the top of any email that originated outside your company.  In the case of our new employee in the accounting department, it would have been obvious that the email did not come from our CEO. Cybersecurity User Awareness Training.  1 out of every 3 people would fall for a spoofing email without regular training.  Effective programs require at minimum annual training.  PCA offers complimentary sessions each month - check our Events page for dates & times.  Tools such as KnowBe4 have proven to reduce the risk to less than 5%. Confirm Requests.  Our attorney partners recommend that you always confirm requests via phone prior to taking any action asked in an email.  Do not follow the instructions in the message, rather use the phone numbers and web address you know for your colleagues, vendors, and customers. If you think an email is suspicious Contact your IT team or your IT service provider, even if the email is urgent or time sensitive.  They will verify if it is legitimate and can even move the email to a “sandbox” where it will not be able to impact your organization.  Fear you already clicked something potentially harmful, turn off your computer and contact IT support. Cyber insurance providers like Lawley Insurance require organizations to have proper protocols in place so employees know what to do if they suspect an attack.  Organizations should have a physical copy of their insurance policy handy along with a physical copy of their incident response plan.  The plans should clearly identify who is responsible for managing an incident and who is responsible for communications – both internal and external communications.  There are legal reasons your company should call a potential threat an incident until it has been verified truly as an attack. Take these straightforward steps to significantly reduce your risk Proactive measures will protect you from costs of business interruptions, data or financial loss, and reputation threats. •	Talk with your IT provider and ensure your layers of cyber security are working for you, •	Ensure all staff at your company attend regular cybersecurity user awareness trainings (consider a service like KnowBe4 for added protection), •	Review your cyber insurance policy with your provider, plus •	Update your Incident Response Plan and prepare your team to follow it when needed. Unsure of your organization’s overall cybersecurity posture, use a Free Cybersecurity Self-Assessment Tool like the one available on PCA's Cybersecurity page or contact our experienced team at info@pcatg.com (by phone at 716.632.5881)."
9,Reasons Of Why Bangladeshi Businesses Need To Redesign Their Websites,computers-technology," Websites are digital representations of businesses, and if they are properly presented, they can bring you extra business and build your reputation. Isn't it worthwhile to invest in a website that leaves a great first impression? Every Bangladeshi business owner will at some point realize that they need a professional website for their business, a website designed by an experienced team of professionals. You Reflect Your Company's Identity Through Your Website Stanford University researchers found that 75% of people judge a business's credibility by its website alone. As a result, your website should be mobile-friendly, easy-to-use, up-to-date, visually pleasing, and represent you and your brand well. Optimize It For The Search Engines Is your website having trouble ranking on Google's first two pages? This may be due to outdated SEO on your website. The SEO landscape is constantly evolving since Google's algorithms are updated daily. In that case, it may be hurting instead of helping you if you haven't updated your SEO for quite some time. You can remedy this by redesigning your website. You will be more likely to rank in the first two pages of Google if you redesign your website and improve its SEO. Being one of Bangladeshi top SEO agencies, Online Solutions has the know-how and expertise to improve your SEO. Mobile Responsive Website Over 82 percent of internet users in Bangladeshi and the world own and regularly use smartphones. Having a mobile-friendly website is, therefore, more important now than ever before, and if your website does not provide the functionality to function on a mobile device, you may be losing customers. Your website may not be mobile-friendly even if it was built 5 years ago. A large number of users (61%), who cannot use a mobile site properly, leave the site and go to a competitor's site. If you want to keep 61% of site visitors, you need a mobile-friendly site. If you don't? Redesign it. User-Friendly & Easy-to-Navigate Mentioned at the beginning of the blog that your business' website is often the first thing customers will see - so you want to make sure that they have a positive experience with it. A good and easy layout page structure and Solid navigation Good presentation, easy to read information, common keywords Stand-out media and images Brand consistency and messaging There is a lot of meaning to details - and if you add all of them up they add up to a lot. Users are trying to stay on your page for as long as possible, so your description could determine whether someone stays on your site longer, or whether they leave right away. Ensure It Is Up To Date When compared to a competitor's website that might be more up-to-date, even a three to a four-year-old website might appear outdated. Using simple patterns with clean, modern lines is the latest design trend for 2021/2022. This look can be applied to mobile devices as well as desktop. Companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Starbucks, etc. have incorporated these design elements. Unlike other countries where competition is fierce, Bangladeshi does not have as much of it, so being on top of it gives you an advantage. Extend Your Services And Capabilities On Your Website Your website must reflect whether your services or your business have grown or changed. Because they aren't aware you offer the service, they will go elsewhere to find it. Customers in Bangladeshi will not have trouble finding a competitor. A redesigned website allows you to clearly explain what services you offer, so that customers and visitors will know what services you don't provide. Update Your Website With Greater Control What if you could update your website yourself every time you offered a new service? Additionally, you can start marketing campaigns at any time and you do not need to wait for someone to change it. The back-end of websites become more user-friendly every year, so updating and changing an old website can prove challenging. The Loading Time Improve Are you aware that 47% of consumers expect web pages to load within 2 seconds of clicking? Furthermore, if the web page takes longer than 3 seconds to load, approximately 40% of visitors will leave the website completely. When your website loads slowly, you risk losing potential customers by the second, while also suffering from poor SEO. Improve Website Security Cybersecurity is one of the foremost concerns of today's digital world, perhaps even the greatest. If businesses fail to update their websites, they are vulnerable to hacks and viruses. Websites that are older are more vulnerable. Third-Party Plugins Many third-party plugins and tools get outdated, particularly if the owner of the website doesn't maintain their own site and doesn't provide ongoing support to the builders. They often have a difficult time using them, or they frequently fail to work, resulting in your website being abandoned eventually."
10,Examining complete education and technologies: The impact of newly emerging technologies on complete education,computers-technology," An emerging technology in education is a technology that is currently uncommon in education sector but has the potential to be widely adopted to support improvements in learning and teaching. Several of these technologies have been emerging for many years, are evolving at an increasing rate and may remain in a continuous evolution for years to come. Some are in the process of being prepared or have found their way into mainstream education, but others may still be a long way from being mainstreamed. The consensus is that these technologies can be used to improve the quality and efficiency of teaching, curriculum, learning, and assessment. There are many new forms of emerging technology being developed for the education system. These include virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, and more. Emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) have made their way into the mainstream education sector. These are now being used to enhance learning and teaching experience. The impact of this emerging technology on the entire education system will be profound and completely transform the current way of teaching. Whereas, when adopting emerging technologies, it is important to identify their likely evolution, the likely problems that may arise in their adoption, and the potential for a gap between those who are using them and those who are not. Artificial Intelligence is becoming the future of education, and it's being looked at in all educational fields. This includes elementary schools to higher education, and institutions around the world are taking advantage of AI integration. The use of AI in the education classroom is still new, but it is steadily gaining traction. AI-assisted teaching assistants are already being used in classrooms to provide personalized feedback to students, and to help them learn at their own pace. AI-assistive technologies are also being used in assessment as well as grading. Automated essay scoring is now a reality and has been shown to be more accurate than human graders on certain types of essays. There are many different use cases for AI assistants in education, such as: •	AI assistant in the classroom: AI assistants can provide students with personalized feedback, help them improve their skills and provide teachers with valuable data about student progress. •	AI assistant in an office: AI assistants can assist workers by taking care of mundane tasks and providing them with insights on how they can do better at work. •	AI assistant in a hospital: AI assistants can help doctors by providing accurate diagnoses based on medical history, symptoms and other factors that could affect health outcomes. The use of AI in education can be categorized into three levels, namely, content creation and interaction, knowledge management, and virtual tutors. AI assistants are being used in the classroom to help students with their studies. They can provide them with information about the subject they are studying, answer questions, and even help them with their homework. They can be used as a tutor for students who need extra help or as an assistant to teachers who want to make sure that all their students are on track."
11,Agile fantasies and harsh business realities,computers-technology," Chronicles from the trenches. Nowadays digital transformation programmes are invariably associated with Agile.  Organizations want to become Agile since they want to increase speed, efficiency, effectiveness, etc. and Agile promises to deliver all that. However, what typically happens on the ground is the quick adoption of a number of Agile ceremonies and tools (the likes of standing crowds in some open space corner, yellow stickers based Kanban boards, the ever present Jira, etc.) and the sweeping away of any deeper organization analysis, let alone alignment. In that sense Agile is remarkably similar to religions. Typically most religions have an exterior part, (i.e. their prescriptive side: Going to the functions at a specific day, do not eat certain food, kneel down at certain moments of the function, etc.) and a substantial or moral part (i.e. behave in a certain way, etc.). The exterior part is far easier to be adopted and “implemented” and usually ends up being identified with the religion itself. Similarly, from the IT trenches you can easily see that most organization cannot even get near at the substantial part of Agile: They just adopt its choreography. The overall result often materializes in a number of recurring anti-patterns that are remarkably repetitive across organizations, and invariably introduce even more inefficiencies and waste. The purpose of this brief article is to provide some insights about some of the reasons why this happens and what are the watch-outs. Basically, far from being tout court derogatory of Agile, this article simply aims at pointing out its many fake implementations, and in doing so, it truly follows one of the Agile key principles, i.e. the one that preaches the need of paying attention to lessons learned and to incorporate remediation actions going forwards. Below is the relevant principle quoted verbatim: “At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly”. So why not reflecting on how Agile is typically deployed into organizations for real? The first and foremost observation is that a so called digital transformation almost invariably involves the construction of a distributed solution or a set of solutions. That is: a solution that is made of a number of components that are required to interoperate seamlessly, some to be built from scratch, some already exiting to be modified/enhanced. In essence, there will be the need of building a UI layer (either native mobile or hybrid or web-responsive) that connects to an ecosystem of APIs (also typically to be largely built) that in turn will provide access to a layer of legacy systems of records typically via a number of different types of connectors. So far there is no rocket science.  However, the scope of what needs be done is typically far larger than the scope that a pizza-size team can crack, in a self-contained and self-organized mode. And the latter implies that a couple of cornerstone Agile principles break down just to start with. Further to that, such a big and complex scope would require, as a mean of technical coordination, an upfront elaboration of architecture (i.e. an engineering focused solution design) that in turn does require some clarity about requirements. And the devil is always in the details: Requirements do not make any exception. Here, on the requirements elaboration front, is where the first and very evident failure typically happens. Agile is almost invariably associated with user stories as the format to collect requirements.  And most of the time what gets produced is a set of high-level hollow statements, almost never mutually exclusive nor exhaustive, that nobody is really able to make sense of, let alone architects or developers, who almost never really bother to read these small sentences in their hundreds. And indeed, in fairness, Agile preaches that user stories are not meant to describe functionalities, but rather serve as placeholders for the self-contained and self-organized team to pick them up and further elaborate them (via team communication) to produce all the required details whilst progressing into their implementation.  Something that might work only in a self-contained and small team. So the first failure is requirements. I have seen or heard of programmes that after many months haven’t yet managed to produce any satisfactory description (i.e. with a meaningful level of detail) of the WHAT, in other terms of the functional requirements end-to-end. Meanwhile the architecture teams, sometimes organized into separate work-streams, each focused on specific  ‘views’ of the whole distributed architecture (i.e. data, security, integration, etc.) engage in rather lengthy and  unfocused debates on potentially needed new capabilities, failing though to converge into a real solution design that the engineering team can read, understand and implement. As implied by its subtitle, this brief article is meant to report experiences collected from the trenches; hence it is not my intention here to delve into a detailed analysis of the various remediation I myself have put forward or seen adopted with success. Its goal is rather to highlight recurring anti-patterns with the aim of awakening pitfalls awareness especially in those non-technical stakeholders who often are the decision makers, so to help them to surely recognize whether their programme has fallen in the same anti-pattern. And believe you me, the level of noise typically coming up from any one’s organization is such that it is very difficult to understand what is really going on at ground level, despite the many reports that are usually produced, all looking very professional, polished and often really impressive from a graphical point of view. So what is the main symptom of such not-so-uncommon anti-pattern? In other terms: how do you recognise that your programme has got stuck at the rather basic level of requirements gathering and elaboration? What do you need to probe to assess whether that is really the case? Naturally enough you would need to check the artefact(s) used to document the agreed requirements and read them to assess if they describe with enough clarity and comprehensiveness what the solution will do in front of its specified category of user.  The latter used to be called an actor and still is within the UML formalism. In other more mundane terms, and assuming, as typically is the case, that your distributed solution starts with a UI (either mobile or web) you should be looking that the requirement clearly describes the sequence of screens, and for each screen its input fields together with associated validation rules, its combo boxes together with its associated choices and action buttons). Also, very importantly, look to see if the relevant server-side calls are described in correspondence of any event or user action that can happen on the specific screen. A server-side call should be documented with a logical name, together with its input and output parameters (again documented at a logical level) and a brief description of what it is required to do from a UI (or front-end ) perspective, again in business terms. There is nothing technical in here. Requirement is about describing what the UI should be doing from a user point of view, both in terms of screen interactions and calls it (i.e. the UI) generates to perform business operations. The reading should be sequentially-friendly. That is the document should be amenable to be read sequentially, from the first to the last page, and, page after page, the reader should get ever more convinced that the ground is covered comprehensively and exhaustively with no gaps or vagueness and it makes sense. This suggestion might look trivial and old-fashion. However, if after months, there is no such description available (with the quality attributes I have just alluded to) it means requirements gathering is still all over the places and your programme has fallen in that not-so-uncommon anti-pattern. Better still: the same exercise can be organized by leveraging independent judges with clearly defined instructions on how to perform the assessment so to assure objectiveness as much as possible. And, if beforehand, a requirement template would have been defined with extreme care and attention (as I often recommend) this kind of programme’s progress measurement would be far easier to execute with reliability. Assessing whether the requirements elaboration process has produced the expected results is important though often overlooked. Requirement is often where most of the digital transformation programmes risk to be wrecked, though that is not widely recognised."
12,The Most Effective Way to Create a Website in 2022 | A Beginner's Guide,computers-technology," Even though there are several methods for creating a website, we believe two are the most straightforward: hiring a web designer or using WordPress. If this is your first time, we recommend hiring a web designer, Squarespace, or Weebly to create your website - it's the best option for IT newbies. WordPress is also a popular option. We'll walk you through both the setup and configuration steps. Regardless of which option you choose, if you follow our seven simple steps, you'll be able to build a website an hour before the end of this post. Option 1: Create a website with a website builder The Most Efficient Way to Create a Website in Easy Steps Choose the best web designer for your needs. Look for a deal that meets your needs and fits your budget. Choose a unique and appropriate space name. Choose a plan format that you enjoy. Make changes to your format strategy. Your substance should be transferred and organized. Choose and install programs. Check out your website and put it through its pages. Distribute your website around the internet. 1: Select the Most Appropriate Website Builder for You A large number of people use web designers to create their websites. Wix alone has almost 100 million users, and Shopify recently surpassed 1.2 million. What makes you think that? Web designers imply that anyone can create a website, regardless of specific knowledge. Making a website in the early days of the internet necessitated a working understanding of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). Then CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) entered the picture, further complicating things. Constructive Visual handles the technical both services web design and logo design in less price, For more info click here: https://constructivevisual.com/small-business-logo-design-perth/ Some achieve it through formats, while others do it through easy interaction points, making building a website as simple as a PowerPoint presentation. That is why we have conducted studies both inside and outside the building. Individual engagement in web designers is great (and we have enough), but we test developers with people who are extremely similar to you. So you can rest assured that when you're building your website, we'll look after you. Our team conducts client testing and meetings and tracks several highlights across various products to give you a unique insight into the market. We need you to find developers who meet your requirements. In light of this, here's a rundown of the best website developers available today. 2: Choose a plan that meets your needs and fits your budget. You'll want to work up a contract when you've decided on a web designer. Web designers frequently offer different plans. Different places have different requirements, and having a plan ensures that you aren't overpaying for items you don't need. This is a tremendous distinction between web designers and web engineers. For format customization alone, a web engineer can charge between $300 and $1,000, and a completely redesigned site that works without any preparation can cost thousands of dollars. Meanwhile, building your site with a manufacturer allows you to get a fully functional site up and running for less than the price of a cup of coffee. Would you be able to create a website for free? You can create a website for nothing, but there are advantages. Much important information about web designers is held back in free records. You won't be able to use custom areas, and your free website will feature advertisements for the web designer. If you're looking to become more involved with site creation, the free options are worth considering. However, if you require a professional, feature-rich site, you will have to pay a couple of dollars every month. 3: Choose a domain name that is both unique and relevant to your business. An area name is a part of the URL (the website address in your program's inquiry bar) that identifies a site page - in this situation, your site. For instance, ours is websitebuilderexpert.com. You can sign up for them on your own at sites like Domain.com, but if you register with a web designer, they will do it for you. The vast majority offer it for free (at least at first), while a chosen handful charges a little fee. 4: Decide on a design template that you like. OK, now comes the fun part: choosing a 'style' or subject to work with to create the layout of your site. After you've joined, your web designer will direct you to this stage. Industry and site types are used to categorize formats. Take a couple for a spin before deciding on your preferred pick. 5: Customize the Look of Your Template It's time to change your format by adding your content and images. This is the type of thing that most engineers will walk you through, but it's very straightforward once you get the feel of it. Your site will start to look like your site in a short time. 6: Use Your Content to Upload and Format Now that your site is starting to take shape, it's a great time to fill it with your photos and written content. You may also 'haul' text and picture boxes across each page to replace any 'placeholder' material existing in your format."
13,FUNDAMENTAL OF AERIAL/AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION SYSTEM,computers-technology," Introduction Air navigation is defined as ""the process of determining the geographic position and maintaining the desired direction of an aircraft relative to the surface of the earth. Navigation may be defined as the movement of a vehicle from one place to another. It is an art of practiced by all who travel but its development is rooted firmly in the fundamental laws of science. In today’s context it can be formally defined as the determination as a strategy for estimating the position of a vehicle along the flight path, giving output from the specified sensors. In the early days, when man-made vehicle where surfaced bound (either or land or on sea) and they seldom ventured per beyond easily recognizable land marks, the act of navigation could be carried out by human using their sense to determine direction distance, speed and position. As vehicle become more sophisticated navigation instrument become necessary. Instead of known landmarks this instruments used information learned from celestial bodies, certain distance objects on the surface of the earth, and many other source of information carry out the job of navigation. Overview Whenever a purposeful change in location has to take place for an aircraft the following questions must be asked and answered; i.	Where is the aircraft now? ii.	(More specifically) where is the aircraft now with respect to where it should have been? These questions are answered by navigation system. These are number of reasons why sophisticated navigation system becomes so important in modern days, some of them are; Time large between measurement and decision to be reduced Number of aircraft in a given airspace has increased manifold in the past few decades Safety requirement have become crucial A navigation system may provide information in a variety of forms, appropriate to the needs of aircraft. If the information is primarily for the benefit of the crew, it involves some types of display. Other output, however may involve steering and signal sent to a central computer. However, in the modern context one would consider this system as navigation-cum-guidance-system. The basic principles of air navigation are identical to general navigation, which includes the process of planning, recording, and controlling the movement of a craft from one place to another. Successful air navigation involves piloting an aircraft from place to place without getting lost, not breaking the laws applying to aircraft, or endangering the safety of those on board or on the ground. Air navigation differs from the navigation of surface craft in several ways; Aircraft travel at relatively high speeds, leaving less time to calculate their position en route. Aircraft normally cannot stop in mid-air to ascertain their position at leisure. Aircraft are safety-limited by the amount of fuel they can carry; a surface vehicle can usually get lost, run out of fuel, then simply await rescue. There is no in-flight rescue for most aircraft. Additionally, collisions with obstructions are usually fatal. Therefore, constant awareness of position is critical for aircraft pilots. The techniques used for navigation in the air will depend on whether the aircraft is flying under visual flight rules (VFR) or instrument flight rules (IFR). In the latter case, the pilot will navigate exclusively using instruments and radio navigation aids such as beacons, or as directed under radar control by air traffic control. In the VFR case, a pilot will largely navigate using ""dead reckoning"" combined with visual observations (known as pilotage), with reference to appropriate maps. This may be supplemented using radio navigation aids or satellite based positioning systems. Route planning The first step in navigation is deciding where one wishes to go. A private pilot planning a flight under VFR will usually use an aeronautical chart of the area which is published specifically for the use of pilots. This map will depict controlled airspace, radio navigation aids and airfields prominently, as well as hazards to flying such as mountains, tall radio masts, etc. It also includes sufficient ground detail – towns, roads, wooded areas – to aid visual navigation. In the UK, the CAA publishes a series of maps covering the whole of the UK at various scales, updated annually. The information is also updated in the notices to airmen, or NOTAMs. The pilot will choose a route, taking care to avoid controlled airspace that is not permitted for the flight, restricted areas, and danger areas and so on. The chosen route is plotted on the map, and the lines drawn are called the track. The aim of all subsequent navigation is to follow the chosen track as accurately as possible. Occasionally, the pilot may elect on one leg to follow a clearly visible feature on the ground such as a railway track, river, highway, or coast.

Occasionally, the pilot may elect on one leg to follow a clearly visible feature on the ground such as a railway track, river, highway, or coast. The aircraft in the picture is flying towards B to compensate for the wind from SW and reach point C. When an aircraft is in flight, it is moving relative to the body of air through which it is flying; therefore, maintaining an accurate ground track is not as easy as it might appear, unless there is no wind at all—a very rare occurrence. The pilot must adjust heading to compensate for the wind, in order to follow the ground track. Initially the pilot will calculate headings to fly for each leg of the trip prior to departure, using the forecast wind directions and speeds supplied by the meteorological authorities for the purpose. These figures are generally accurate and updated several times per day, but the unpredictable nature of the weather means that the pilot must be prepared to make further adjustments in flight. A general aviation (GA) pilot will often make use of either a flight computer – a type of slide rule – or a purpose-designed electronic navigational computer to calculate initial headings. The primary instrument of navigation is the magnetic compass. The needle or card aligns itself to magnetic north, which does not coincide with true north, so the pilot must also allow for this, called the magnetic variation (or declination). The variation that applies locally is also shown on the flight map. Once the pilot has calculated the actual headings required, the next step is to calculate the flight times for each leg. This is necessary to perform accurate dead reckoning. The pilot also needs to take into account the slower initial airspeed during climb to calculate the time to top of climb. It is also helpful to calculate the top of descent, or the point at which the pilot would plan to commence the descent for landing. The flight time will depend on both the desired cruising speed of the aircraft, and the wind – a tailwind will shorten flight times, a headwind will increase them. The flight computer has scales to help pilots compute these easily. The point of no return, sometimes referred to as the PNR, is the point on a flight at which a plane has just enough fuel, plus any mandatory reserve, to return to the airfield from which it departed. Beyond this point that option is closed, and the plane must proceed to some other destination. Alternatively, with respect to a large region without airfields, e.g. an ocean, it can mean the point before which it is closer to turn around and after which it is closer to continue. Similarly, the Equal time point, referred to as the ETP (also critical point), is the point in the flight where it would take the same time to continue flying straight, or track back to the departure aerodrome. The ETP is not dependent on fuel, but wind, giving a change in ground speed out from, and back to the departure aerodrome. In Nil wind conditions, the ETP is located halfway between the two aerodromes, but in reality it is shifted depending on the wind speed and direction. The aircraft that is flying across the Ocean for example would be required to calculate ETPs for one engine inoperative, depressurization, and a normal ETP; all of which could actually be different points along the route. For example, in one engine inoperative and depressurization situations the aircraft would be forced to lower operational altitudes, which would affect its fuel consumption, cruise speed and ground speed. Each situation therefore would have a different ETP. Commercial aircraft are not allowed to operate along a route that is out of range of a suitable place to land if an emergency such as an engine failure occurs. The ETP calculations serve as a planning strategy, so flight crews always have an 'out' in an emergency event, allowing a safe diversion to their chosen alternate. The final stage is to note which areas the route will pass through or over, and to make a note of all of the things to be done – which ATC units to contact, the appropriate frequencies, visual reporting points, and so on. It is also important to note which pressure setting regions will be entered, so that the pilot can ask for the QNH (air pressure) of those regions. Finally, the pilot should have in mind some alternative plans in case the route cannot be flown for some reason – unexpected weather conditions being the most common. At times the pilot may be required to file a flight plan for an alternate destination and to carry adequate fuel for this. The more work a pilot can do on the ground prior to departure, the easier it will be in the air. IFR Instrument flight rules (IFR) navigation is similar to visual flight rules (VFR) flight planning except that the task is generally made simpler by the use of special charts that show IFR routes from beacon to beacon with the lowest safe altitude (LSALT), bearings (in both directions), and distance marked for each route. IFR pilots may fly on other routes but they then must perform all such calculations themselves; the LSALT calculation is the most difficult. The pilot then needs to look at the weather and minimum specifications for landing at the destination airport and the alternate requirements. Pilots must also comply with all the rules including their legal ability to use a particular instrument approach depending on how recently they last performed one. In recent years, strict beacon-to-beacon flight paths have started to be replaced by routes derived through performance-based navigation (PBN) techniques. When operators develop flight plans for their aircraft, the PBN approach encourages them to assess the overall accuracy, integrity, availability, continuity, and functionality of the aggregate navigation aids present within the applicable airspace. Once these determinations have been made, the operator develops a route that is the most time and fuel efficient while respecting all applicable safety concerns—thereby maximizing both the aircraft's and the airspace's overall performance capabilities. Under the PBN approach, technologies evolve over time (e.g., ground beacons become satellite beacons) without requiring the underlying aircraft operation to be recalculated. Also, navigation specifications used to assess the sensors and equipment that are available in an airspace can be cataloged and shared to inform equipment upgrade decisions and the ongoing harmonization of the world's various air navigation systems. IN Flight Once in flight, the pilot must take pains to stick to plan, otherwise getting lost is all too easy. This is especially true if flying in the dark or over featureless terrain. This means that the pilot must stick to the calculated headings, heights and speeds as accurately as possible, unless flying under visual flight rules. The visual pilot must regularly compare the ground with the map, (pilotage) to ensure that the track is being followed although adjustments are generally calculated and planned. Usually, the pilot will fly for some time as planned to a point where features on the ground are easily recognized. If the wind is different from that expected, the pilot must adjust heading accordingly, but this is not done by guesswork, but by mental calculation – often using the 1 in 60 rule. For example, a two-degree error at the halfway stage can be corrected by adjusting heading by four degrees the other way to arrive in position at the end of the leg. This is also a point to reassess the estimated time for the leg. A good pilot will become adept at applying a variety of techniques to stay on track. While the compass is the primary instrument used to determine one's heading, pilots will usually refer instead to the direction indicator (DI), a gyroscopically driven device which is much more stable than a compass. The compass reading will be used to correct for any drift (precession) of the DI periodically. The compass itself will only show a steady reading when the aircraft has been in straight and level flight long enough to allow it to settle. Should the pilot be unable to complete a leg – for example bad weather arises, or the visibility falls below the minima permitted by the pilot's license, the pilot must divert to another route. Since this is an unplanned leg, the pilot must be able to mentally calculate suitable headings to give the desired new track. Using the flight computer in flight is usually impractical, so mental techniques to give rough and ready results are used. The wind is usually allowed for by assuming that sine A = A, for angles less than 60° (when expressed in terms of a fraction of 60° – e.g. 30° is 1/2 of 60°, and sine 30° = 0.5), which is adequately accurate. A method for computing this mentally is the clock code. However, the pilot must be extra vigilant when flying diversions to maintain awareness of position. Some diversions can be temporary – for example to skirt around a local storm cloud. In such cases, the pilot can turn 60 degrees away his desired heading for a given period of time. Once clear of the storm, he can then turn back in the opposite direction 120 degrees, and fly this heading for the same length of time. This is a 'wind-star' maneuver and, with no winds aloft, will place him back on his original track with his trip time increased by the length of one diversion leg. Another reason for not relying on the magnetic compass during flight, apart from calibrating the Heading indicator from time to time, is because magnetic compasses are subject to errors caused by flight conditions and other internal and external interferences on the magnet system. Prior to the advent of GNSS, Celestial Navigation was also used by trained navigators on military bombers and transport aircraft in the event of all electronic navigational aids being turned off in time of war. Originally navigators used an astrodome and regular sextant but the more streamlined periscopic sextant was used from the 1940s to the 1990s. From the 1970s airliners used inertial navigation systems, especially on inter-continental routes, until the shooting down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 in 1983 prompted the US government to make GPS available for civilian use. Finally, an aircraft may be supervised from the ground using surveillance information from e.g. radar or multilateration. ATC can then feedback information to the pilot to help establish position, or can actually tell the pilot the position of the aircraft, depending on the level of ATC service the pilot is receiving. The use of GNSS in aircraft is becoming increasingly common. GNSS provides very precise aircraft position, altitude, heading and ground speed information. GNSS makes navigation precision once reserved to large RNAV-equipped aircraft available to the GA pilot. Recently, many airports include GNSS instrument approaches. GNSS approaches consist of either overlays to existing precision and non-precision approaches or stand-alone GNSS approaches. Approaches having the lowest decision heights generally require that GNSS be augmented by a second system—e.g., the FAA's Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS). A flight vehicle regardless of whether it is a missile, an aircraft, or a launch vehicle needs the help of human intelligence in achieving it mission. This human intelligence manifest itself in various form like information about flight condition, gathering appropriate command to the flight vehicle and designing equipment to interpret these command and translate them into action onboard. Each flight vehicle has a mode or operation which might differ from another. Example, in missile or launch vehicle information is gathered by various sensors and conveyed to a computer which then appropriate decisions. Irrespective of the kind of flight vehicle, the theory behind the design and analysis of all this take eventually emanate from a branch of applied mathematics called control theory. The application of control The application of control theory aerospace may be divided into four (4) areas Flight planning: the determination of normal flight path and associated control histories for a giving flight vehicle to accomplish specific objectives with specified constraints. Navigation: the determination of a strategy for estimating the vehicle along the flight path, giving output from specified sensors. Guardians: the determination strategy for following the normal path in the presence of the normal coordination, wind disturbance and navigational uncertainties. Control: the determination of a strategy for maintaining angular orientation of the vehicle during the flight that is consistent with the guidance strategy, and the vehicle, crew and passenger’s constants However, it should be kept in mind that these categories often overlap and the boundaries between them are not very sharp. Example, consider the aircraft velocity and its angular orientation. These are coupled and so the guidance control of aircraft must be considered together. To move or navigate from one place to another in the aircraft a pilot need to know the following; •	Starting point (point of departure) •	Ending point (final destination) •	Direction travel •	Aircraft speed •	Aircraft weight and balance information With information flight planning can be done and the proper method of navigation can be put to be use Direction is an angular distance from a reference. Direction, stated in whole numbers, is measured from 001° to a maximum of 360°. The reference for the angle can be either True North or Magnetic North. True North is the top of the earth whereas Magnetic North is the point from which all of the Earth's magnetic lines of force emanate. Magnetic North is currently located near Hudson Bay in Canada. A magnetic compass system converts the energy from these lines of force to a cockpit indicator reading. Typical military aircraft have two compass systems: a primary and a secondary/back-up. The aircrew’s primary instrument for determining direction in the cockpit is the Remote Gyro Vertical Compass Card. This instrument is also referred to as a BDHI (Bearing Distance Heading Indicator) or EHSI (Electronic Horizontal Situation Indicator), but may vary by aircraft. In most modern aircraft, the inertial navigation system (INS) produces attitude and heading information for the aircrew through the use of a ring laser gyro (RLG) system and accelerometers. Remote Gyro Vertical Compass Card This data is used for pitch and roll displays as well as navigational computations. The ring laser gyro is a highly accurate way to measure changes in angular position (or angular rate) without the use of any moving parts or magnetic compass inputs. The laser gyros and accelerometers are positioned in the INS so that they are oriented along each of the three axes of the airplane. Strapping three ring laser gyros together with accelerometers on the X, Y, and Z axes of an aircraft, and then doing some math, allows for the continuous calculation of the attitude reference and changes in heading, pitch, and roll. The ring laser gyros are sensitive enough to detect the Earth’s rate of rotation and it uses that information to establish the heading of the airplane. The ASN-50 magnetic compass, also known as a flux valve, was once required to provide measurements of magnetic direction for older INS and mechanical gyro systems. The modern INS and RLG no longer require any external input from a magnetic compass to determine and maintain aircraft heading information (see Figure 1-3). As a backup to the primary system, all aircraft have a Stand-by Compass (see Figure 1-4). This is a direct reading compass in which the measurement of direction is taken directly from a balanced/pivoted magnetic needle. The stand-by compass is sometimes called the ""wet"" compass because it is filled with a fluid to dampen needle movement. This compass is unstable during maneuvering, but it has the advantage of reliability and is independent of the aircraft’s electrical system. Discussion of direction will continue in Lesson Topic 6.2 when charts and plotting techniques are introduced. Time can be expressed in several ways: as the time of day (0815, 1400, etc.) or elapsed time. Elapsed time is written as hours and minutes or minutes and seconds. With elapsed time, the units are separated with a “+” sign (2+30, 3+15, etc.). It may also be expressed in a six digit format such as 09+15+20. Estimated time of departure (ETD) and estimated time of arrival (ETA) can be expressed in four-digit time of day format, while elapsed time, such as estimated time en route (ETE), will be expressed in hours and minutes (or for short distances, minutes and seconds). All aircrew must be able to convert from local time to Greenwich Mean Time (Zulu time) and vice versa. This will be covered in greater detail in Lesson Topic 6.2. Speed is the magnitude of the velocity of an aircraft. It is the distance traveled with respect to time and is stated in nautical miles per hour (knots). Lesson Topics 6.3 and 6.4 will cover speed in greater detail and explain how atmospheric conditions (altitude, temperature) affect it. Speed = Distance Time METHOD OF NAVIGATION There are three method of navigation currently used. •	Navigation by pilotage (visual landmarks) •	Dead reckoning navigation •	Radio Navigation •	Celestials or astronomical navigation PILOTAGE Pilotage or Piloting is the most common method of air navigation. This method, the pilot keeps on course by following a series of landmarks on the ground. Usually before take-off, pilot will be making pre-flight planning; the pilot will draw a line on the aeronautical map to indicate the desired course. Pilot will knows various landmarks, such as highways, railroad tracks, rivers, bridges. As the pilot flies over each of landmark, pilot will check it off on the chart or map. If the plane does not pass directly over the landmark, the pilot will know that he has to correct the course. Navigation fix aircraft position on map by observing non visible land marks. Using compass, the direction to next land mark or destination. Electronic pilotage is also use with the aid of air bone radar. This is called electronic pilotage. The micro search radar provided with a PPD (Plan Position Display) mapped to terrain is used for electronic pilotage. Pilots have various navigation aids that help them takeoff, fly, and land safely. One of the most important aids is a series of air route traffic control, operated throughout the world. Most of the traffic control uses a radar screen to make sure all the planes in its vicinity are flying in their assigned airways. Airliners carry a special type of radar receiver and transmitter called a transponder. It receives a radar signal from control center and immediately bounces it back. When the signal got to the ground, it makes the plane show up on the radar screen. Pilots have special methods for navigating across oceans. Three commonly used methods are: Inertial Guidance; this system has computer and other special devices that tell pilots where are the plane located. LORAN Long Range Navigation The plane has equipment for receiving special radio signals sent out continuous from transmitter stations. The signals will indicate the plane location GPS Global Positioning System. is the only system today able to show your exact position on the earth anytime, anywhere, and any weather? The system receiver on the aircraft will receives the signals from satellites around the globe Advantage: •	Range is high (50 to 100 km) •	Accurate If the ground is visible the navigator can see the principal features on the ground such as rivers, coastline, estuaries, rills etc. and fix his position. Even at night, the light beacons provide information about the position of the aircraft. Disadvantage: •	Navigation by pilotage is possible only under of good visibility. •	Both the method of pilotage requires recognizable features in the terrain •	Cannot be used in the oceanographic regions (it will be useless over the stretch of sea if there are no island in the field of vision •	Pilotage depends upon the availability of accurate maps of the terrain DEAD RECKONING Dead Reckoning is defined as directing an aircraft and determining its position by the application of direction and speed data from a previous position. It is the basis for all types of air navigation. Navigation is both the history and prediction of an aircraft’s flight path. At the heart of DR are its four components: position, direction, time, and speed. Position is a set of coordinates that define the specific location of the aircraft above the earth’s surface. Direction is an angular measurement from a reference, which determines the actual flight path from a known starting point. Speed multiplied by time will produce the distance flown (or to be flown). The combination of these four components will allow the aircrew to determine the aircraft’s current position or to predict its future position. As with any mathematical relationship, if three of the four components are known, the fourth can be determined. Dead Reckoning is the primary navigation method used in the early days of flying. It is the method on which Lindberg relied on his first trans-Atlantic flight. A pilot used this method when flying over large bodies of water, forest, deserts. It demands more skill and experience than pilotage does. It is based on time, distance, and direction only. The pilot must know the distance from one point to the next, the magnetic heading to be flown. Pilot works on the pre-flight plan chart, pilot plan a route in advance. Pilot calculates the time to know exactly to reach the destination while flying at constant speed. In the air, the pilot uses compass to keep the plane heading in the right direction. Dead reckoning is not always a successful method of navigation because of changing wind direction. It is the fundamental of VFR flight. Position is a geographic point defined by coordinates. There are several coordinate systems available to determine a specific location on the earth’s surface. The primary system used in aviation is the latitude/longitude system At the simplest level, navigation is accomplished through ideas known as dead reckoning and pilotage. Pilotage is a term that refers to the sole use of visual ground references. The pilot identifies landmarks, such as rivers, towns, airports, and buildings and navigates among them. The trouble with pilotage is that, often, references aren't easily seen and can't be easily identified in low visibility conditions or if the pilot gets off track even slightly. Therefore, the idea of dead reckoning was introduced. Navigation determines the aircraft position in relation to its last fix a known position. Starting at the fix (position) the navigation draws a line on the chart that represent the direction and the distance traveled (velocity and time are known variables). Most commonly used method same principles applied in later advanced methods like inertial navigation. Dead reckoning involves the use of visual checkpoints along with time and distance calculations. The pilot chooses checkpoints that are easily seen from the air and also identified on the map and then calculates the time it will take to fly from one point to the next based on distance, airspeed, and wind calculations. A flight computer aids pilots in computing the time and distance calculations and the pilot typically uses a flight planning log to keep track of the calculations during flight. Advantage: The position of an aircraft at any instance of time is calculated from the previous determine position, the speed of its motion (i.e. its velocity vector) and the elapsed. Disadvantage: Navigation by dead reckoning over long distance is subject to errors unless intermediate check is possible RADIO NAVIGATION Radio Navigation is used by almost all pilots. Pilots can find out from an aeronautical chart what radio station they should tune to in a particular area. They can then tune their radio navigation equipment to a signal from this station. A needle on the navigation equipment tells the pilot where they are flying to or from station, on course or not. With aircraft equipped with radio navigation aids (NAVAIDS), pilots can navigate more accurately than with dead reckoning alone. Radio NAVAIDS come in handy in low visibility conditions and act as a suitable backup method for general aviation pilots that prefer dead reckoning. They are also more precise. Instead of flying from checkpoint to checkpoint, pilots can fly a straight line to a ""fix"" or an airport. Specific radio NAVAIDS are also required for IFR operations. There are different types of radio NAVAIDS used in aviation Radio/Electronic Navigation; Using Electromagnetic (Radio) waves to find the position of the aircraft. Transmitters located on the ground keep transmitting the radio signals. Air bone receivers received the radio signals from one or more ground station and determine the position, bearing/direction and distance etc. Disadvantage: •	Requires transmitter/receivers not a self-contained (dependent on external aids) •	Aircraft is dependent on external systems •	It requires line sight of communication ADF Automatic direction finder (ADF) is a marine or aircraft radio-navigation instrument that automatically and continuously displays the relative bearing from the ship or aircraft to a suitable radio station. ADF receivers are normally tuned to aviation or marine NDBs (Non-Directional Beacon) operating in the LW band between 190 – 535 kHz. Like RDF (Radio Direction Finder) units, most ADF receivers can also receive medium wave (AM) broadcast stations, though as mentioned, these are less reliable for navigational purposes. ADF systems provide following navigation information; •	Relative bearing to/from the ground station •	Station identification The ground transmitter, non-directional beacon transmits radio waves. A directional antenna points to the beacon to receive the signal and enabler the pilot knows the direction of the ground station. Relative bearing of aircraft to ground station is indicated on the radio magnetic compass. Frequency: medium frequency range (200 kHz to 3000 kHz). Disadvantage: •	Reliable operation possible using ground waves up to few 100 miles The operator tunes the ADF receiver to the correct frequency and verifies the identity of the beacon by listening to the Morse code signal transmitted by the NDB. On marine ADF receivers, the motorized ferrite-bar antenna atop the unit (or remotely mounted on the masthead) would rotate and lock when reaching the null of the desired station. A centerline on the antenna unit moving atop a compass rose indicated in degrees the bearing of the station. On aviation ADFs, the unit automatically moves a compass-like pointer (RMI) to show the direction of the beacon. The pilot may use this pointer to home directly towards the beacon, or may also use the magnetic compass and calculate the direction from the beacon (the radial) at which their aircraft is located. Unlike the RDF, the ADF operates without direct intervention, and continuously displays the direction of the tuned beacon. Initially, all ADF receivers, both marine and aircraft versions, contained a rotating loop or ferrite loop stick aerial driven by a motor which was controlled by the receiver. Like the RDF, a sense antenna verified the correct direction from its 180-degree opposite. More modern aviation ADFs contain a small array of fixed aerials and use electronic sensors to deduce the direction using the strength and phase of the signals from each aerial. The electronic sensors listen for the trough that occurs when the antenna is at right angles to the signal, and provide the heading to the station using a direction indicator. In flight, the ADF's RMI or direction indicator will always point to the broadcast station regardless of aircraft heading. Dip error is introduced, however, when the aircraft is in a banked attitude, as the needle dips down in the direction of the turn. This is the result of the loop itself banking with the aircraft and therefore being at a different angle to the beacon. For ease of visualization, it can be useful to consider a 90° banked turn, with the wings vertical. The bearing of the beacon as seen from the ADF aerial will now be unrelated to the direction of the aircraft to the beacon. Dip error is sometimes wrongly confused with quadrantile error, which is the result of radio waves being bounced and reradiated by the airframe. Quadrantile error does not affect signals from straight ahead or behind, nor on the wingtips. The further from these cardinal points and the closer to the quadrantile points (i.e. 45°, 135°, 225° and 315° from the nose) the greater the effect, but quadrantile error is normally much less than dip error, which is always present when the aircraft is banked. ADF receivers can be used to determine current position, track inbound and outbound flight path, and intercept a desired bearing. These procedures are also used to execute holding patterns and non-precision instrument approaches RMI A radio-magnetic indicator (RMI) is an alternate ADF display providing more information than a standard ADF. While the ADF shows relative angle of the transmitter with respect to the aircraft, an RMI display incorporates a compass card, actuated by the aircraft's compass system, and permits the operator to read the magnetic bearing to or from the transmitting station, without resorting to arithmetic. Most RMI's incorporate two direction needles. Often one needle (the thicker, double-barred needle) is connected to an ADF and the other (generally thin or single-barred) is connected to a VOR. Using multiple indicators, a navigator can accurately fix the position of their aircraft using triangulation, without requiring the aircraft to pass over the top of the station. Some models allow the operator to select which needle is connected to each navigation radio. There is great variation between models, and the operator must take care that their selection displays information from the appropriate ADF and VOR. This instrument display can replace a magnetic compass display in the instrument panel, but not necessarily the gyroscopic Heading Indicator. The Heading Indicator can be combined with information from navigation radios (primarily VOR/ILS) in a similar way, to create the Horizontal Situation Indicator. The HSI, along with the VOR system, has largely replaced use of the RMI, however the HSI's much higher cost keeps the older combination of an RMI and an Omni Bearing Indicator attractive to cost-conscious pilots. VOR Very high frequency Omni-directional range (VOR) [1] is a type of short-range radio navigation system for aircraft, enabling aircraft with a receiving unit to determine its position and stay on course by receiving radio signals transmitted by a network of fixed ground radio beacons. It uses frequencies in the very high frequency (VHF) band from 108.00 to 117.95 MHz Developed in the United States beginning in 1937 and deployed by 1946, VOR became the standard air navigational system in the world, used by both commercial and general aviation, until supplanted by satellite navigation systems such as GPS in the early 21st century. As such, VOR stations are being gradually decommissioned. In the year 2000 there were about 3,000 VOR stations operating around the world, including 1,033 in the US, but by 2013 the number in the US had reduced to 967.[6] The United States is decommissioning approximately half of its VOR stations and other legacy navigation aids as part of a move to performance-based navigation, while still retaining a ""Minimum Operational Network"" of VOR stations as a backup to GPS. In 2015 the UK planned to reduce the number of stations from 44 to 19 by 2020. Very high Omni-directional Range (VOR) provides the following information. •	Bearing information to/from ground station •	Course deviation •	Identification of the ground station Frequency range: 108 MHz – 117.5 MHz Accuracy: it is generally plus or minus 1°-degree line of sight; depends on the altitude of the aircraft. Typically, the range is about 212 NM (nautical miles) at altitude of 30,000 ft. and reduced to 39 MM at 1000 ft. altitude. A VOR ground station uses a specialized antenna system to transmit both an amplitude modulated and a frequency modulated signal. Both modulations are done with a 30 Hz signal, but the phase is different. The phase of one of the modulation signals is dependent on the direction of transmission, while the phase of the other modulation signal is not, in order to serve as a reference. The receiver will demodulate both signals, and measure the phase difference. The phase difference is indicative of the bearing from the VOR station to the receiver relative to magnetic north. This line of position is called the VOR ""radial"". The intersection of radials from two different VOR stations can be used to fix the position of the aircraft, as in earlier radio direction finding (RDF) systems. VOR stations are fairly short range: the signals are line-of-sight between transmitter and receiver and are useful for up to 200 miles. Each station broadcasts a VHF radio composite signal including the mentioned navigation and reference signal, station's identifier and voice, if so equipped. The station's identifier is typically a three-letter string in Morse code. The voice signal, if used, is usually the station name, in-flight recorded advisories, or live flight service broadcasts. A VORTAC is a radio-based navigational aid for aircraft pilots consisting of a co-located VHF omnidirectional range and a tactical air navigation system (TACAN) beacon. Both types of beacons provide pilots azimuth information, but the VOR system is generally used by civil aircraft and the TACAN system by military aircraft. However, the TACAN distance measuring equipment is also used for civil purposes because civil DME equipment is built to match the military DME specifications. Most VOR installations in the United States are VORTACs. The system was designed and developed by the Cardion Corporation. The Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) contract was awarded 28 December 1981. DME In aviation, distance measuring equipment (DME) is a radio navigation technology that measures the slant range (distance) between an aircraft and a ground station by timing the propagation delay of radio signals in the frequency band between 960 and 1215 megahertz (MHz). Line-of-visibility between the aircraft and ground station is required. An interrogator (airborne) initiates an exchange by transmitting a pulse pair, on an assigned 'channel', to the transponder ground station. The channel assignment specifies the carrier frequency and the spacing between the pulses. After a known delay, the transponder replies by transmitting a pulse pair on a frequency that is offset from the interrogation frequency by 63 MHz and having specified separation. DME provide distance from the station in nautical miles with a very high degree of accuracy Frequency: 962 MHz and 1213 MHz Airborne transmitter interrogates: Ground station response Interrogation: paired pulse at a specific spacing are sent out from the aircraft and are received at the ground station Reply: ground station responds (transmits) DME systems are used worldwide, using standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), RTCA, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and other bodies. Some countries require that aircraft operating under instrument flight rules (IFR) be equipped with a DME interrogator; in others, a DME interrogator is only required for conducting certain operations. While stand-alone DME transponders are permitted, DME transponders are usually paired with an azimuth guidance system to provide aircraft with a two-dimensional navigation capability. A common combination is a DME collocated with a VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) transmitter in a single ground station. When this occurs, the frequencies of the VOR and DME equipment are paired. Such a configuration enables an aircraft to determine its azimuth angle and distance from the station. A VORTAC (a VOR co-located with a TACAN) installation provides the same capabilities to civil aircraft but also provides 2-D navigation capabilities to military aircraft. Low-power DME transponders are also associated with some instrument landing system (ILS), ILS localizer and microwave landing system (MLS) installations. In those situations, the DME transponder frequency/pulse spacing is also paired with the ILS, LOC or MLS frequency. ICAO characterizes DME transmissions as ultra-high frequency (UHF). The term L-band is also used. Developed in Australia, DME was invented by James ""Gerry"" Gerrand under the supervision of Edward George ""Taffy"" Bowen while employed as Chief of the Division of Radio physics of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO). Another engineered version of the system was deployed by Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Limited in the early 1950s operating in the 200 MHz VHF band. This Australian domestic version was referred to by the Federal Department of Civil Aviation as DME(D) (or DME Domestic), and the later international version adopted by ICAO as DME(I). DME is similar in principle to secondary radar ranging function, except the roles of the equipment in the aircraft and on the ground are reversed. DME was a post-war development based on the identification friend or foe (IFF) systems of World War II. To maintain compatibility, DME is functionally identical to the distance measuring component of TACAN LORAN LORAN, short for long range navigation, was a hyperbolic radio navigation system developed in the United States during World War II. It was similar to the UK's Gee system but operated at lower frequencies in order to provide an improved range up to 1,500 miles (2,400 km) with an accuracy of tens of miles. It was first used for ship convoys crossing the Atlantic Ocean, and then by long-range patrol aircraft, but found its main use on the ships and aircraft operating in the Pacific theater during World War II. Long range navigation: the plane has the requirement for receiving special radio signal sent out continuous from transmitter station. The signal will indicate the plane location. It is accurate system for long range navigation based on the measurement of difference in time arrival of EM waves from one or more land based transmitters to the receiver of the aircraft. LORAN, in its original form, was an expensive system to implement, requiring a cathode ray tube (CRT) display. This limited use to the military and large commercial users. Automated receivers became available in the 1950s, but the same improved electronics also opened the possibility of new systems with higher accuracy. The U.S. Navy began development of Loran-B, which offered accuracy on the order of a few tens of feet, but ran into significant technical problems. The U.S. Air Force worked on a different concept, Cyclan, which the Navy took over as Loran-C, which offered longer range than LORAN and accuracy of hundreds of feet. The U.S. Coast Guard took over operations of both systems in 1958. In spite of the dramatically improved performance of Loran-C, LORAN, now known as Loran-A (or ""Standard LORAN""), would become much more popular during this period. This was due largely to the large numbers of surplus Loran-A units released from the Navy as ships and aircraft replaced their sets with Loran-C. The widespread introduction of inexpensive microelectronics during the 1960s caused Loran-C receivers to drop in price dramatically, and Loran-A use began to rapidly decline. Loran-A was dismantled starting in the 1970s; it remained active in North America until 1980 and the rest of the world until 1985. A Japanese chain remained on the air until 9 May 1997, and a Chinese chain was still listed as active as of 2000. Loran-A used two frequency bands, at 1.85 and 1.95 MHz These same frequencies were used by radio amateurs, in the amateur radio 160-meter band, and amateur operators were under strict rules to operate at reduced power levels to avoid interference; depending on their location and distance to the shore, U.S. operators were limited to maximums of 200 to 500 watts during the day and 50 to 200 watts at night. TANCAN A tactical air navigation system, commonly referred to by the acronym TACAN, is a navigation system used by military aircraft. It provides the user with bearing and distance (slant-range or hypotenuse) to a ground or ship-borne station. It is a more accurate version of the VOR/DME system that provides bearing and range information for civil aviation. The DME portion of the TACAN system is available for civil use; at VORTAC facilities where a VOR is combined with a TACAN, civil aircraft can receive VOR/DME readings. Aircraft equipped with TACAN avionics can use this system for en route navigation as well as non-precision approaches to landing fields. The space shuttle is one such vehicle that was designed to use TACAN navigation but later upgraded with GPS as a replacement. Tactical air navigation: provides navigation information both bearing and range ground station can be portable and setup at temporarily air fields. The typical TACAN onboard user panel has control switches for setting the channel (corresponding to the desired surface station's assigned frequency), the operation mode for either transmit/receive (T/R, to get both bearing and range) or receive only (REC, to get bearing but not range). Capability was later upgraded to include an air-to-air mode (A/A) where two airborne users can get relative slant-range information. Depending on the installation, Air-to-Air mode may provide range, closure (relative velocity of the other unit), and bearing, though an air-to-air bearing is noticeably less precise than a ground-to-air bearing. A TACAN only equipped aircraft cannot receive bearing information from a VOR only station. OMEGA was the first global-range radio navigation system, operated by the United States in cooperation with six partner nations. It was a hyperbolic navigation system, enabling ships and aircraft to determine their position by receiving very low frequency (VLF) radio signals in the range 10 to 14 kHz, transmitted by a global network of eight fixed terrestrial radio beacons, using a navigation receiver unit. It became operational around 1971 and was shut down in 1997 in favor of the Global Positioning System. It was the first global radio navigation system for aircraft. It enables the aircraft to determine their position by receiving very low frequency (VLF) radio signals transmitted by a network of terrestrial radio beacons, using a receiver unit HISTORY Taking a ""fix"" in any navigation system requires the determination of two measurements. Typically, these are taken in relation to fixed objects like prominent landmarks or the known location of radio transmission towers. By measuring the angle to two such locations, the position of the navigator can be determined. Alternately, one can measure the angle and distance to a single object, or the distance to two objects. The introduction of radio systems during the 20th century dramatically increased the distances over which measurements could be taken. Such a system also demanded much greater accuracies in the measurements – an error of one degree in angle might be acceptable when taking a fix on a lighthouse a few miles away, but would be of limited use when used on a radio station 300 miles (480 km) away. A variety of methods were developed to take fixes with relatively small angle inaccuracies, but even these were generally useful only for short-range systems. CELESTIALS NAVIGATION Navigation determines the location of aircraft by observing certain celestial bodies – the sun, the moon, the stars, like north stars measures the elevation of celestial body by sextant, an instrument that measure the angular distance of the celestial body above the horizon and note down the precise time at which at which the measurement is made with chronometer. The two measurements are enough to the position of an aircraft on a circle on the face of the globe. Advantages: •	Independent of external aids – self contained Disadvantages: •	Visibility should be good to take elevation angles of heavenly bodies •	Horizon should be located TERMINOLOGY USED IN NAVIGATION •	Almanac:  an annual publication containing Tide Tables astronomical ephemerals etc. •	Altitude: the angular distance of a celestial body above the viewer’s horizon. •	Anabatic Winds; caused by warm air rising up a slope to be replaced by cooler air, as opposed to kabatic, descending winds. •	Apparent wind; the wind as felt on board, this will be the actual wind •	Barometer: an instrument for measuring atmospheric pressure. •	Bearing; the compass reading taken of an object in relation to the observer, horizontal direction to the wind grouped stations or from the ground station. •	Course: course is the direction in which the pilot wants the aircraft to go (Line drawn on a chart) also known as desired trades. •	Cardinal points: the four main points of the compass, North, East, South and West. •	Nautical mile: distance aviation is measured in nautical miles •	Headings: actual direction toward which aircraft is headed (nose is pointed) considering the effect of cross wind. •	Air-speed: Airspeed is an important perimeter in aviation. It depends in the density of air and that depends on temp and pressure at any altitude greater than sea level, air will be less dense than sea level. Air Navigation needs Each model as reference A coordinate system to identify position and to compute distance. Navigation aids for reducing the workload of navigator/pilot. Navigation requires determination position of aircraft in which the a/c has to reach the desired destination. Basic Navigation Aids Aeronautic charts Specialized map that shows more than geographic features, chart provide airways which are highways in the air. Location of airports, landmark, mountain, rivers and lakes Magnetic compass A compass is a navigational instrument that measures direction (or point-news) along with intermediate directions. North correspondent to zero degree and the angle increase in clockwise so east is 90° degrees, south is 180° and west is 270° INTERNAL NAVIGATION SYSYTEN INERTIAL NAVIGATION SYSTEM An inertial navigation system (INS) is a navigation device that uses a computer, motion sensors (accelerometers) and rotation sensors (gyroscopes) to continuously calculate by dead reckoning the position, the orientation, and the velocity (direction and speed of movement) of a moving object without the need for external references. Often the inertial sensors are supplemented by a barometric altimeter and sometimes by magnetic sensors (magnetometers) and/or speed measuring devices. INSs are used on mobile robots and on vehicles such as ships, aircraft, submarines, guided missiles, and spacecraft. Other terms used to refer to inertial navigation systems or closely related devices include inertial guidance system, inertial instrument, inertial measurement unit (IMU) and many other variations. Older INS systems generally used an inertial platform as their mounting point to the vehicle and the terms are sometimes considered synonymous. Geometry pig is composed of low-frequency communication system, computer, major probe, cup, odometer wheel. It can inspect pipeline with size of 6” ~ 48”. The probes with deformation ability can be used to detect the pipeline internal diameter change. It can detect dent, orality, accessories causing pipe internal diameter change, etc. During it’s running, the ground marker is used to monitor the accurate position of geometry pig and to collect pipeline deformation. Special data analysis software carried by the pig replays the detection data collected on site so that pipe diameter geometric changes could be showed clearly in the form of data curves. Through data analysis, pipe deformation size can be quantized accurately and meanwhile the deformation points also can be located combined with welding point information of installation and construction records. Geometry pig can identify dents, ovality, change of wall thickness, pipe accessories causing the change of pipe inner diameter, pipe length, valve, T-joint, girth weld, bend, etc. It also helps to find the exact location of deformation point and determine the size to reconstruct pipeline timely, eliminate hidden risks and ensure pipeline operates safely, efficiently and smoothly. It is a self-contained navigation system comprises of gyros accelerometers and navigation computer which provide the aircraft position and navigation information in response to signals resulting from inertial effect on system components and does not require information from external references"

15,10 Benefits of Temporary Email and Why You Should be Using,computers-technology," What are Temporary Emails? A temporary email address, or disposable email address, is one that can be used only once and after it has been used, the address cannot be used again and the data associated with the address cannot be recovered. This type of email address can be very useful in protecting your identity and personal information while using the internet. There are numerous reasons why someone may need to use a temporary email address and in this article we will discuss them in detail so you can see if this form of email address would benefit you as well. Gmail's new feature lets you set an expiration date for your emails—meaning that anyone who receives them will only have a limited time to view them. When your email expires, it's gone forever. If you're not comfortable sharing certain personal information with others (e.g., email addresses), use a temporary address. This way, if you change your mind later on, you can always get in touch with recipients directly through another channel like Skype or Facebook. Here are a few reasons why having an expiring Gmail address is beneficial A common method for cybercriminals is to create a fake email account, complete with a realistic-looking username and password. Then they try logging into various accounts using it, hoping that at least one person uses their password as they've set it up (and, sadly, many people do). If you use a temporary email address as your go-to alias whenever you want to register for an account or sign up for a service online, there's no way your real identity can be discovered by trying to log in with that alias. Even if someone guesses your temporary email address password, it will only take them so far before they run out of places to try. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, etc. But how do you keep your private emails from getting mixed up with them? The answer is a temporary email address. There are many reasons why you should consider using a temporary email service. Here are just a few examples. 1. Avoid spam - A temporary email address will allow you to easily sign up for newsletters and promotional offers without worrying about ending up on some list that sends you junk mail every day. With disposable email addresses, you aren’t limited by how much space your address has. Once it is full, you can simply create a new one. This is perfect for those with large media libraries that need to be sent via email (i.e., pictures). There are many people who use a temporary e-mail address for their resume, just in case they have something embarrassing in there! you just need to visit an online service provider. Sign up for a free email account, get temporary email address, and start sending your messages via temporary email. Whether you are shopping online or sending sensitive information to your clients, you should use a temporary email address to safeguard your personal info. Here are ten good reasons why using temporary email is a good idea Need a brand new email to sign up for websites? Easy. Want an address that can’t get hacked? Done. Use a temporary email address to keep your personal accounts secure and free from spam. No one will have access to your inbox, so you don’t have to worry about spam or other unwanted messages. There are no limits on how many addresses you can create, so it is easy to use several different emails when signing up for sites and services online. If you forget which email you used somewhere, just log in and check out all of your old emails under one login – it couldn't be easier! This is also useful if you want a throwaway email address: If you want to sign up for something but don't want anyone finding out (maybe a dating site), or if you just need an address that isn't linked back to your name, a temporary email is perfect! If you’re tired of people asking if [email protected] is really your address, go with one that looks like your name instead. That way, you won’t have to waste time repeatedly clarifying what your address actually is. Instead, people will just recognize it as your real email—and quickly get to whatever message you sent them. Plus, a personal-looking email address also comes in handy when making new contacts—it just looks more professional than something random or spammy. This helps to keep your emails safe from spam bots. The password allows you to access your email without having it shared with anyone, so you can use that account specifically for communicating with clients. If someone were to get a hold of your temporary email address, they wouldn’t be able to find any personal information on it. This is a great way to protect yourself while also allowing others easy access when they need it. If you are looking to apply for a new job, chances are that your resume will end up in a spam folder. This can make it difficult for hiring managers to find your application, even if you have done everything right. To avoid placing your application in a spam folder, it is a good idea to register for temporary email accounts that expire after 30 days or less. The reason why recruiters can’t find applications from those with temporary email accounts is because those addresses don’t contain valuable information about their owners. If someone wants to contact you via email, they will need to do so from an address that contains valuable information about you (your permanent account). Identity theft is a serious problem that affects millions of people every year. For that reason, it's important to protect your information from prying eyes. The Internet makes it easier than ever to collect large amounts of data from a number of sources, which means that your identity could be exposed if you're not careful about what you do online. When you create an email address with ProtonMail, we route messages through our servers in Geneva, Switzerland so that nobody can track down where you live or work or who you really are. We also support encrypted attachments on our mail client (more on those later) so that nobody can read your messages without access to your private key. But don't worry!"
16,How to Start a Career in Digital Marketing,computers-technology," Digital marketing involves the use of various online and digital technologies to promote products or services. The process is dynamic and requires leadership skills. Here are some ways to start a career in digital marketing: Digital marketing is a form of advertising delivered through electronic devices Digital marketing involves the delivery of advertisements through electronic devices such as mobile phones. Digital marketers refer to advertisers and consumers as sources and receivers. Sources provide highly targeted advertising and messages to their intended audience. For example, McDonald's recently extended its late-night hours to appeal to travelers and shift workers. By targeting travelers and shift workers using their mobile phone, the fast-food chain has increased its visibility and appeal. Many businesses also use mobile applications and text messages to reach their audience. Digital marketing includes advertising delivered through websites, emails, social media, mobile applications, and search engines. These methods are interactive and allow businesses to track the journey of their customers and measure their success. Digital marketing encompasses many different forms of advertising and varies greatly in its effectiveness. Online video marketing, display advertising, search engine marketing, and social media are all examples of digital marketing. In addition to online media, it includes print, radio, television, and online video advertising. The growth of smartphones has created an opportunity for advertisers to reach customers with personalized advertising campaigns. Modern software can allow marketers to cold call subscribers and target them with texts. The use of digital channels like websites, blogs, social networks, and mobile applications are increasing, and this is resulting in a convergence of the offline and online worlds. Traditional devices will eventually be modernized and integrated with digital media, while the Internet will continue to dominate the advertising market. Digital advertising combines modern digital media with offline experiences. Many marketing techniques use both SEO and PPC to attract customers. Email marketing is a popular form of digital marketing, with automated newsletters and social media influencers promoting products. It's not surprising that people are increasingly using digital media to reach their target audience. It's been over 50 years since Marconi first invented radio marketing, and television ads have been on air for more than 50 years. It is a dynamic process Today's consumer expects personalized marketing, and generalized advertising is actively turning them off. In fact, ninety percent of consumers say they are annoyed by non-personalized marketing. Dynamic marketing enables brands to deliver highly targeted, relevant messaging to customers. Ultimately, it leads to more conversions and long-term customer relationships. Here are some of the key benefits of dynamic marketing. Listed below are three main benefits of dynamic marketing. The process of digital marketing is a continuous one, governed by the Test, Learn, Optimise cycle. This continuous testing of various media channels helps marketers to determine which types of content are most effective and which aren't. Once they have a clear idea of which content works, they can refine and boost it accordingly. Other dynamic marketing techniques include using A/B tests to optimise content and minimise risks. In addition to that, it helps companies improve customer engagement. The growth of the Internet accelerated the growth of digital marketing. In the United Kingdom, increasing Internet usage led to a shift in customers' habits: they started shopping online before consulting with salespeople. Moreover, a survey conducted in 2000 in the United Kingdom encouraged marketers to adopt digital technology as a part of market development. Today, digital marketing focuses on raising brand awareness and driving conversions. A well-developed digital marketing strategy allows businesses to reach their target audience instantly. It is a business career Whether you're just starting out, or are looking for an exciting new challenge, a digital marketing career may be for you.

In short, digital marketing is a great option for small businesses. So, go ahead and implement digital marketing today! You'll be glad you did!"
17,5G Technology: Benefits and Challenges,computers-technology," When we believe that the future is still far away, we are forgetting that tomorrow is already the future and that we shall be living it as soon as we open our eyes in the morning. We moved from having a pocket-sized device that could be used to make and receive calls from (nearly) anyplace - 1G technology - to be able to meet that demand by sending a text message instead of phoning - 2G technology - while still having that option on the same device. Later, the ambition to be able to access the internet from any location became a reality, thanks to 3G technology, which allowed us to do so using our mobile phones. This tendency has persisted to the present day, with our insatiable desire for knowledge mirrored in what we now call ""everyday"" internet browsing via smartphones equipped with 4G technology and the ability to view live streaming videos. The tale does not end there; this need continues to grow, paving the path for the development of 5G technology, the next step in our information consumption and manner of being linked and integrated and the objects around us. What is 5G technology? The 5th technology of wi-fi network generation is called 5G technology. After 4G, 5G generation gives a new form of community with faster community speeds, decreased latency, and help for extra customers, devices, and services while increasing network efficiency. 5G generation supports three wide classes of use instances. Enhanced Mobile Broadband (EMBB): Excessive bandwidth services for wi-fi connectivity. Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC): Ultra-reliable communications with low latency for important necessities. Massive Automatic Type Communication (MMTC): Dependable communication for billions of sensors and monitoring devices. 5G technology is designed to offer peak downstream records rates of up to twenty GB per second, which is 20 instances faster than the peak pace of 1 GB per second in 4G LTE. Similarly, 5G is expected to offer a ten - to one-hundred-fold growth in consumer experience data rates, aid 10 - to 100 - fold the wide variety of related devices compared to 4G, and have notable-low latency drawing close to 1 millisecond (ms). The era of 5G technology will move past development in network velocity and performance, offering new progressive and advanced experiences for users. 5G technology can improve the overall performance of industrial applications while allowing new consumer studies and offerings in areas including augmented reality, virtual reality and mixed reality (VR and MR) applications, video conferencing, commercial automation, computerized driving and connected scientific medical devices. How does 5G technology work? To acquire increasing capacity and latency requirements, the 5G era requires additional technical additives: New Spectrum: To reach excessive records speeds, 5G should be able to utilize new spectrum bands above 6 GHz, centimeter (cm) wavebands ranging from 6 to 30 GHz, and millimeter (mm) wavebands ranging from 6 to 30 GHz. 5G may be utilized in spectrum areas under 6 GHz as well. Coverage is supplied by means of the lower bands, whilst ability is provided by way of the upper bands. Massive MIMO: MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) is a technique for growing the potential of a radio connection through the use of a couple of transmitting and receiving antennas. Talking of Massive MIMO on the other hand, it is known to be a MIMO system with a huge number of antennas (for instance, eight, sixteen, sixty-four, one hundred and twenty-eight, and so forth). Community coverage and spectral performance are improved by Massive MIMOs New 5G Radio (5G NR):  The brand new 5G radio admission era is 5G NR, developed by 3GPP for the 5G mobile community. 5G NR is based totally on the ideas of ultra-slim design, which reduces signal and strength intake. 5G NR is also designed with a flexible framework shape to efficiently multiply various 5G offerings and provide superior compatibility for tomorrow’s 5G offerings. Open RAN: This stands for Open RAN Access network. Especially, open RAN is an ongoing variation in cell network architectures that allows telecom operators to use not unusual call subcomponents from a variety of carriers. Proprietary components which include Base Units (BBUs) and Remote Radio Heads (RRHs) are already disaggregated into Centralized Units (CUs), Distributed Units (DUs), and Radio Units (RUs). With the RAN open, new unbundled capabilities can also be virtualized or containerized. 5G core network (5GC):  Based totally on the 3GPP standardization, the 5GC is designed as a service-based architecture (SBA). All core networking capabilities are applied according to cloud-native ideas, which encompass separation of person aircraft and manage planes, stateless networking, open interfaces, and APIs. Core network features can be without difficulty deployed, upgraded and scaled to release new services at a lower fee. 5G transport: To support new 5G use cases like EMBB, URLLC, and MMTC, a transport network that can sustain a huge increase in traffic, as well as a diverse set of network characteristics for each use case, is required. It must be able to support an ever-increasing number of devices, services, and new business models. Transport networks must be capable of supporting 25G, N x 25G at the access/pre-aggregation layer, 100G, N x 100G at the aggregation layer, and up to 400G at the service provider core to provide huge capacity. Furthermore, the transport network must adhere to rigorous timing standards to enable a latency of fewer than 10 milliseconds. Network partitioning: Multiple separate end-to-end logical networks can be run on common physical equipment using network partitioning. For service or application, each division can provide a distinct quality of service (QoS). A network partition can be used to divide a network into multiple sections (access network, core network, and transport network). Edge computing: Edge computing brings compute, storage, and network resources closer to subscribers and end-users. Proximity enhances response times while also reducing bandwidth usage. Edge computing, also known as edge cloud, is a type of computing that may be implemented within a customer's premises, such as a business or a factory floor, and maintained or hosted by a service provider. Telecom Cloud: The Telecom Cloud is an open platform that allows service providers to avoid vendor lock-in and make use of a vast ecosystem of cloud-native features that will improve infrastructure and operations while also allowing for faster service delivery. Telecom operators can unleash a new variety of applications and services that will rejuvenate their business models thanks to the telecom cloud, which allows service agility and quick service innovation. Security: New attack planes arise with 5G, IoT, network splitting, and edge computing. Threats can come from anywhere, and their number, frequency, and complexity are rising. 5G security may become extremely difficult to accomplish if the current security strategy is not changed. Manual response and siloed systems are no longer effective. What is required is a connected strategy that takes a holistic picture of the network and its external ecosystem in order to completely detect threats, dynamically adjust security rules, and enforce them uniformly throughout the network. Management and Orchestration (MANO): With 5G, the number of connected end-user devices, nodes, and services inside a network explodes. It's impossible to manage network operations at the scale and quality required by hand. The only way to cope with the volume and complexity of future cloud and 5G networks is to automate operations, with full support for open APIs that can work across multi-cloud and multi-vendor settings to enable continuous visibility across platforms, AI, and machine learning skills. Benefits of 5G technology For a long time, it has been predicted that the 5G network will transform our lives in the next years. However, as time has passed, they have spawned a slew of occurrences that have sparked a slew of debates over their numerous benefits. Faster Downloads: The 5G network can boost download speeds by up to 20 times (from 200 Mbps with 4G to 10 Gbps with 5G) while also lowering latency (response time between devices). These speeds will improve the browsing experience by easing operations that, while achievable today, are nonetheless challenging. Hyper-connectivity: The 5G network promises to provide a hyper-connected environment, allowing for the creation of the much-desired ""intelligent cities."" The bandwidth of 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT) will determine how well these new dynamics function. Process optimization: 5G technology is projected to change industries like health (for example, remote procedures), autonomous cars and traffic management, as well as its deployment in the construction industry to optimize resources and decrease risks. 5G technology's solutions to problems Telecom companies will deploy 5G technology to accommodate ever-increasing data traffic by lowering the cost per bit dramatically. By allowing new 5G services for consumers, government, and enterprises, 5G technology allows telecom carriers to avoid losses in average revenue per user (ARPU). Businesses are projected to benefit the most from 5G technology, as they will see increased productivity, agility, and scalability in their services. The most significant shift, for example, is anticipated to come in industrial automation, with industries being supplied by wirelessly operated robots. Another major emphasis of 5G use cases is in healthcare. In locations where physicians are unable to access, remote surgery or linked ambulances will help save lives. Retailers will be able to provide novel experiences (such as AR, VR, and MR) while trying on, styling, and purchasing items using 5G-based capabilities, whether in real stores or online. Cloud gaming is a new application for consumers that don't require high-volume gaming customers and delivers games straight from the 5G network's edge. In some early 5G deployments, AR and VR traffic has surpassed 20% of total bandwidth. Fixed wireless access (FWA) is also gaining popularity as a means of delivering 5G internet services to homes. From a government standpoint, 5G technology's capabilities may assist smart cities, public services, and public safety greatly. Automobile solutions and connected autos can help to make roads safer and save lives. Challenges 5G technology Face Immediate obsolescence: Because the move to the 5G network will necessitate equipment that can handle it, present 4G gadgets will become outdated immediately. Technological exclusion: The installation of the 5G network also entails a lack of quick accessibility for ordinary people, as well as a delay in its implementation owing to a lack of means to use it. Inadequate infrastructure: For the 5G network to function correctly, a significant investment in infrastructure to improve capacity and expand coverage will be necessary, which will not be cheap. Due to the large expenses that governments would have to finance for 5G to perform correctly, this circumstance will inevitably create delays in its deployment. Security risks and proper data handling: All of this necessitates excellent data management, which is where the biggest contention exists in terms of benefits against drawbacks. Not only are issues like Big Data approaches studied in the administration of all this information, which comes from organizations, people, and even governments. Legal and ethical standards regulating the handling and use of this data are now being debated in each nation to ensure that privacy is not harmed as a result of this interconnectedness. Pioneers in 5G network technology 5G technology is part of a larger transformation that incorporates cloud and automation technologies to help telecom operators build a stronger and more sustainable platform. Some fear that 5G technology alone will not be enough to revolutionize telecom providers' businesses. Telecom operators must evaluate the cloud, 5G, and automation together to properly realize the value and grasp the potential these technologies provide. These technologies complement one another and, in some situations, rely on one another to work well. Many of the benefits of 5G technology, for example, cannot be realized without the use of cloud infrastructure, whether it's a telecom and NFVI cloud, a distributed edge cloud, virtualized, containerized (VNF/CNF) services, or disaggregated. While 5G and the cloud combined bring massive improvements in scalability, performance, and agility, they also add to operational complexity, which can only be reduced and controlled by network automation. Consumers and organizations may look forward to new experiences thanks to 5G and cloud technologies. Telecom operators need a strategy that simplifies network operation and offers distinctive customer experiences to succeed in today's 5G/multi-cloud services scenario. 5G technology is a reality that will influence our lives in a short time, much like earlier innovations, and it is essential to check into it now to reap the benefits and avoid the pitfalls."

20,The development of warfare cyberspace in the United States of America. By Giancarlo Elia Valori.,computers-technology," Weapons and equipment are the foundation of military combat capability and an important factor in determining the outcome of wars. In the current situation of increasingly fierce competition among major powers and of increasingly evident militarization of cyberspace, all countries have increased capital investment; strengthened the development and deployment of cyberspace weapons and equipment; promoted research and development, as well as transformation, and application of emerging technologies; and sought to shape new technologies for military development and future operations. As a concept for integrating cyberwarfare systems, the US Cyber Command created the Joint Cyber Operations Architecture (JCWA) to guide cyberwarfare acquisition and investment decisions, with the aim of enabling cyber forces to execute command and control decisions, as well as training in having access - through a unified platform - to the broad tasks of the system. Since 2021 the US military has continued to use the JCWA as a guide and rely on various services to develop and improve cyberwarfare systems and tools. The JCWA includes several acquisition programs, as well as cyber tools and sensors to support cyber operations. According to the US Defense Department's 2022 budget, the U.S. Air Force is responsible for requesting to the Joint Cyber Command and Control (JCC2) a budget of 79 million dollars, more than double the previous year's 38.4 million dollars due to a number of programs, including the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) project. i.e. an artificial intelligence-enabled tool that will provide a new way for cyber forces to understand the common operational framework in warfare. Funds will be transferred to the project, and the IKE software development has moved from the planning to the execution phase. The US Air Force is responsible for the Unified Platform (UP) for fiscal year 2022. The research and development budget is equal to 101.8 million dollars. The US Army will also be responsible for the Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE) research and development budget for fiscal year 2022, which amounts to 52.9 million dollars. The budget for the US Army's Joint Common Access Platform (JCAP) has so far been kept secret. The US Army offered the PCTE, version 3, in the second quarter of 2021, following the release of version 2 to the US Cyber Command in October 2020. The PCTE version 3 will provide users with additional response channels and give training managers an overview of the network status. It will also include a content repository to host previous scenarios built by content or training curators. This makes it easier to train or simulate the activities. Security Insider (https://www.secrss.com/) says that the US Army plans to deploy and distribute version 4 of the PCTE platform to the U.S. Cyber Command in the first quarter of this year. The version provides a more intuitive engine for discovering training activities, exercises or modules available to troops, designed to reduce redundancy and enable better individual and team training. The Army also continues to lead the Cyber Innovation Challenge to award contracts and apply new technologies to the PCTE platform. The latest contract, awarded in February 2021, includes ""enhanced assessment"" and ""traffic generation"" features and functionalities that will be incorporated into version 5 of the PCTE. The ""enhanced assessment"" is critical to the US Cyber Command, as it helps improve force readiness reports. On the other hand, the ""traffic generation"" is also a key capability that helps cyber forces in areas including ""friendly space,"" ""grey space"" and ""red space,"" operating in the entire IT and intelligence environment, not just in certain networks. In June 2021 the main annual US Cyber Command exercise, i.e. Cyber Flag 21-2, used the PCTE platform again, thus enabling the US Cyber Command to expand the exercise of activities. The PCTE team is applying the exercise readings to future events for subsequent versions of the platform. The PCTE and project team have developed studies to support and monitor thousands of daily events - even the most insignificant - and make them available to the other major Cyber Yankee service as well. The US Army is also exploring the PCTE integration with other JCWA components to enable the interoperability of the US cyber mission forces. The above integration not only reduces access and accounts for multiple systems, but also seamlessly feeds data response to the combat platform. For example, the US armed forces are conducting initial pilot work to enter and incorporate the PCTE data into the JCC2-Project IKE component. The Pentagon formally handed Project IKE over to the US Cyber Command in April 2021 and it is serving as a reference point for key cyber tools for its cyber mission force. The IKE project is considered a precursor to the JCC2, one of the pillars of the JCWA, available to the US Cyber Command. The JCC2 seeks to integrate data from a variety of sources to help inform and support commanders' decision-making; assess readiness down to the individual level; visualize cyberspace and give situational awareness to all levels of combat forces. The IKE project enables users throughout the chain of command to plan, prepare, execute, and evaluate cybersecurity operations. IKE will be used to map the network and assess the readiness of cyber teams and command forces in cyberspace. IKE enables commanders to understand the status of offensive and defensive teams, as well as friendly and enemy forces in cyberspace, which is critical to its command and control, and to ensure the dissolution of crises in conflicts between combat teams. IKE is already used by the US combat troops and currently has thousands of military users. The US Cyber Command plans to migrate its various service network components to the JCAP. It will provide it with the infrastructure for offensive missions by fiscal year 2024. Service cyber forces will move on crisis platforms, using the separate tools that now operate proactively, and link their respective cyberspace activities more closely. The Army plans to withdraw its current offensive cyber tools in 2024 and then move to the JCAP. The Army is developing the tool for the U.S. Cyber Command and the Army, which will be deployed in four joint mission operations commands: the Army, the Air Force, the Navy and the Marine Corps, which have already signed a memorandum of understanding. The JCAP uses an innovative software acquisition approach and the system is updated quarterly to add new functionalities, thus giving the Army the freedom to continue to repeat and gradually add more functionalities to the system itself. In December 2020 Mattel Technologies announced it had been awarded a 265 million US dollar contract to support the project over 42 months. Furthermore, the US Army awarded a 2.4 billion US dollar contract to 14 companies to provide IT services for the national cyber range complex. The companies will provide incident planning and execution, site safety and security, IT management and range modernization services, as well as operational support for the military in cyber missions. The National Cyber Range is therefore a US Army program focused on improving battlefield resilience by creating an operationally representative cyberspace environment for respective mission testing, training and simulations. As part of the Capability Set 21, the Army plans to implement a tool called Cyber Situational Awareness to prepare units for combat as early as this year. Cyber Situational Awareness is a tool designed specifically for commanders on the ground, not intended for use in cyberspace operations, but to help commanders better perceive cyber and electromagnetic situations to make more informed decisions."

1,Charles Kuen Kao’s Net Worth – How can Charles K Kao’s Wealth be Evaluated?,computers-technology," Meta description: Learn about Charles Kuen Kao net worth and other things about his live such as his early life, achievements and awards in the field of science, siblings and family. Charles Kuen Kao’s Net Worth – How can Charles K Kao’s Wealth be Evaluated? Charles K Kao was a prominent mid-20th Century celebrity in the world of science and technology. Throughout his career as a physicist and engineer, he was responsible for the one technological application that today’s world could not run without, the use of fiber-optics in mass data management.  Charles K Kao’s net worth is about 5 million dollars. Charles Kao also intervened in many scientific studies and conventions, with a particular focus on more effective modes of data transfer across a wide range of digital electronic devices and mediums. Who is Charles Kuen Kao? Charles Kuen Kao was a Chinese-native, British-American engineer who is famed for revolutionary developments in science and telecommunications. Born in 1933, this physicist and electrical engineer also introduced the development and application of fiber optics in 1966, which ultimately enhanced the field of digital data transfer. Fiber optics technology has been of great benefit to mankind since its inception. Together with many other scientific contributions, this invention enabled Charles Kao to amass a number of awards, including a Nobel Prize to his name, and earned him the title “The Father of Fiber Optics” and “The Godfather of Broadband.” The ability to transfer data over long distances without the use of conductive metals and elements has saved much time and resources in the technological world. Charles Kao’s development involved the use of laser beams to transmit electrical signals through a fiberglass tube. The optical fiber technology allowed for higher data transfer speeds and bandwidths than previously thought possible and at a far much lower cost of production and distribution of data. It should be noted that this invention is the reason that mankind is able to enjoy social media, global communication, financial organization, and entertainment today from any part of the world and with a wide range of devices. Charles K. Kao’s Early Life Charles Kao was born in Zhangyan town in the Jinshan district of Shanghai, China, but spent most of his adult life in Taiwan, Hong Kong, where his family relocated when he was 15 years old. He undertook his early childhood education in Shanghai, starting with a private tutor, then went to Shanghai World School for further learning. Charles Kao attained part of his education, technical training, and work experience in Hong Kong, where he would also start a family later in his youth. Here, he continued to high school, after which he progressed to tertiary education at St. Joseph College in 1952. After attaining his diploma, Charles Kao then furthered his education and training at Greenwich University, where he attained his undergraduate certification, graduating with a second class B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering degree in 1957. Charles K. Kao’s Career After a couple of years and being unable to support himself for advanced level education, Charles Kao decided to seek contractual employment at Loughborough Polytechnic. This decision was intended to save some money to enable him to undertake his university studies. In 1964, he was part of a research team in electro-optics from the Standard Telecommunications Laboratory in London, where he was soon appointed as team leader. This position gave him a more significant opportunity to develop and perfect his idea as vital support was easily reachable. The team also enjoyed access to the best materials and equipment for their scientific work. Charles Kao later joined the University of London in 1965. Here, he successfully pursued his doctorate in electrical engineering while gaining further training as an intern at STL. During this term, Charles Kao, together with a group of electrical engineers in his team, managed to develop the first fiber optic prototype, which they had designed as the first optical data transfer option in telecommunications. At the final stage in developing the fiber optics technology, he partnered with his fellow electrical engineer George Hockham in 1966. Together, they managed to finally present the idea to the IEE for approval and standardization of the fiber optic technology as an alternative, more efficient medium for high-speed data transfer. This collection was presented as a paper titled “Dielectric-fiber Surface waveguides for Optical Frequencies,” published in 1966. This breakthrough also involved intensive discussion with a wide range of professionals from both the scientific and commercial fields to identify all ways and means of ensuring that the technology is applicable and viable for commercial production and broad application. Charles Kao’s initial work experience as a professional in the formal sector was in The Chinese University, Hong Kong, where he introduced the field of electronic and electrical engineering as an electronics professor. For almost ten years, he acted as the university’s vice-chancellor till 1996, then moved on to head the Energy Advisory Committee till the year 2000, when he was also pronounced as a prominent figure within the Hong Kong’s Council of Advisors on Innovation and Technology. Charles Kao’s education, experience, and remarkable contributions to physics and electronic technologies enabled him to automatically attain many titles and lead many scientific conventions and organizations throughout his adult and sinister ages. Charles K Kao was finally laid to rest on September 23rd, 2018, at the age of 85, after succumbing to a pre-existing Alzheimer’s condition which he had suffered since 2004. Over the last half-century of his life, Charles Kao managed to achieve major social and academic distinctions in science and technology, 30 of which he amassed between 1976 and 2009. At the height of his career, he also acquired a Nobel Prize among other awards and honors, the most prominent being the following: •	The American Ceramic Society’s Morey Award - Awarded for his exceptional developments in glass science and technology in 1976. •	The Stuart Ballantine Medal of the Franklin Institute of America - warded for the introduction and development of optical fiber communication technologies in 1977. •	A Gold Medal from America’s Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association – Awarded for introducing optical fiber technology for military applications in 1980. •	Alexander Graham Bell Medal of the American Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers – Awarded for founding major concepts of optical fiber communications. •	Foundation for Communication and Computer Promotion’s C&C Award - For conceptual development of optical fiber communications in 1987. •	IEEE, UK’s Faraday Award for exceptional input in optical technology and its feasibility in 1989. •	The International Society for Optical Engineering’s Gold Medal – Awarded for the introduction and further development of optical fiber technology. •	The Royal Swedish Academy of sciences Nobel Prize in physics - For pioneering optical fiber communication in 2009. •	A Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 2010. •	Grand Bauhinia Medal of Hong Kong’s SAR’s in 2010. In 1987, he was elected the third Vice-Chancellor of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, where he would serve for another nine years. During the same period, his former employer, ITT Co, had decided to dispose of all of its technical organizations to a French Telecommunications and Electronics developer, Alcatel. In his term as Vice-Chancellor of CUHK, he managed to streamline the university’s academic faculty and also to initiate the School of Engineering, with a great focus on optical science and telecommunications technologies. With such a long career in the field of science, it is no wonder that Charles K Kao’s net worth is about 5 million dollars. Charles K. Kao’s Personal Life and Family Back in Shanghai, Charles Kao was the third born of 4 children. His father, Kao Chung-Hsiang, brought up Charles and his siblings from a law profession. He had attained his law degree back in 1925. By the time Charles was ten years old, he had lost two of his siblings and was now left with his younger brother, Timothy Wu Kao, who later in life attained Professor Emeritus of Civil Engineering at the Catholic University of America. At this early age, they would start Chinese Classics studies. Later on in life, right after his university studies, Charles Kao would meet his wife Gwen May-Wan Kao, who has also had a British-Chinese nativity and was an electronics engineer as well. A couple of years after his undergraduate degree, Charles worked at Standard Telephones and Cables in North Woolwich, UK, for three years to finance his education. It was here that he met Gwen, who was a fellow co-worker in the company’s sound development section. Charles and Gwen got married in 1959, and besides Charles being Catholic and Gwen Anglican, the two would be blessed with a son in 1961 and a daughter in 1963. Both of their children built their careers in Silicon Valley, California. Charles Lao’s family lived and worked in the UK throughout much of his adulthood. His parents joined them in the UK, where they would spend the rest of their lives. In 1974, Charles Kao and his family moved to Virginia, USA, where he resumed the development of the optical fiber project proposal that he had presented to the IEEE back in 1966. Here, he worked for the International Telephone and Telegraph Company in Roanoke, Virginia, where he was appointed as Chief Scientist and later Vice-President and Director of Engineering for the company’s electro-optical products development. Charles Kao lost his mother while working at ITT in 1976. Four years later living in UK, his father joined them in Hong Kong where they had once again relocated briefly before once again returning to America to work for the Advanced Technology Center in Connecticut, US-ITT Company as the Chief Scientist. During this period, the optical fiber application had already been in use extensively all over the world, which made Charles Kao extremely busy with his work, as he had to move a lot in pursuit of better research facilities and inputs from other optics engineers and scientists across the globe. Charles K. Kao’s Net Worth Charles K Kao’s net worth is quite hard to calculate since most of his contributions were totally non-commercial or business-oriented. His sources of income mainly consisted of royalties, grants, and salaries which would have been remuneration for his involvement around scientific and technological inventions and innovations. However, most estimates today approximate his net monetary worth at over half a million dollars in today’s currency. Some sources estimate his total net worth at between a million and 5 million dollars, mainly from his contributions in telecommunications and fiber-optic data transfer technologies. Part of his earnings was directed to the Charles K. Kao Foundation, which they initiated in 2010, aimed to support Alzheimer’s disease patients to have a better life. The fund was also meant to arouse public awareness on the disease, its effects on the affected population, and how to further research on possible ways of alleviating the condition. Charles Kuen Kao was a world-renowned Electrical Engineer and Physicist who is highly appreciated for his breakthrough and revolutionary invention and development of the optical fiber technology that has immensely changed the way we run our world today. Also known as the father of fiber optics, Charles Kao also made numerous contributions in physics, chemistry, and electronics engineering in different parts of the world and met many influential scientists and researchers in a bid to finesse the application of his ideas and inventions in science. Summary Born in 1933, November 4th, he lived up to the age of 84 years and died as one of the greatest physicists and electrical engineers. The world still appreciates his scientific developments to date. As such, three years after his death, he recently achieved the honor in his name from Google Doddle for his pioneering and development of the fiber-optic technology that’s extensively applied in telecommunications and internet distribution. Charles K Kao’s net worth is estimated to be about 5 million. Even though his success would not rank high in monetary valuation, his scientific and developmental contributions to this world far surpass many of the wealthiest individuals in today’s world by any measure. Consider the fact that his breakthrough invention of optical fiber digital data transfer technology is the same foundation through which the top three wealthiest individuals in the world today have acquired their success, the internet. Fiber optics has enabled more incredible data transfer speeds and thus more applications in internet communications, enabling humanity to save up more in time and mineral resources in the process. This development has, in turn, led to numerous advances in information and technology, thanks to the gradual advances in the original data transfer designs."
2,Computer Operating System Used in Laptops and Desktops,computers-technology," Operating system is the program that runs a computer or laptop. In this article, I will discuss what is an operating system and its versions. I will also discuss who wrote these operating systems. All computers including desktops and laptops use special codes of instructions that dictates the device how to work and process information. These instructions are put together in one program called the operating system. Whether it’s from Apple for their Mac computers or Microsoft or Google, they do the same job that is to run the device. There are two operating systems that are popular these days, one is Mac OS X from Apple Company and the other one is Windows from Microsoft. They both mostly use them in desktop computers and laptops. Microsoft offered a few operating systems in the last two decades. They started with DOS (disk operating system). They offered a few versions in DOS. After DOS, they moved to graphical interface with the introduction of windows. This Windows was very basic. Later on they moved to Windows 95 and then Windows 98. Windows 98 was very successful and kind of smooth version. After Windows 98, they introduced Windows 2000 and Windows ME. Windows 2000 was better version than Windows ME. Windows ME was in the market for a short period of time because of its low popularity. Microsoft then came up with the most reliable version of all previous operating systems known as Windows XP. This operating system was very users and applications friendly. Microsoft introduced some good features in it. The top utility in the list was the system restore utility. With system restore, users could restore a previous good version of the OS in case there was a problem with the operating system. This operating system had one bad feature where it would not load (when moving hard drive from broken computer to a good computer) on another pc in case there was a hardware failure unless an advance repair install could be done successfully. This was a time when Microsoft learned writing better operating systems because the next one they came up was even more reliable. This was Windows 7. This Windows ran for a while until they moved to Windows 10. In Windows 10, they changed the design big time more and made it like a tablet friendly operating system. A lot of users had problems moving from Windows 7 to 10 because due to relocation of the menus and links where users now have to search for features or links. For example, if a user wants to go to Windows update settings, they have to search it instead of looking for the menu. They also removed the start menu which was a convenient way to access many features. Their latest operating system called Windows 11 is based on Windows 10. They added a new launch bar at the bottom of the screen. Apple also have a few operating systems for their devices including desktops and laptops. Their Mac desktop includes iMac, Mac mini, ipad, Mac Pro and laptops are Macbook, Macbook Pro, Macbook Air, Macbook Pro Retina etc. They started with their operating system OS X 10 Kodiak in 2000. They used it in their non-Intel computers. Then they came with up cheetah, puma and Panther and then Tiger. Around 2005, 2006 they had to move from IBM processor to Intel. This era was the beginning of a marathon for them. This was the time when they introduced Leopard and Snow Leopard. In the beginning, users were not accepting to switch to Mac because there were a lot of compatibility issues with most of the applications. All third party applications were fully compatible with windows operating system. With the passage of time, third party developers started to write apps for OS X. By the time Apple introduced Lion and mountain lion apps were slowly getting compatible with OS X. In 2013 Apple came up with Mavericks and then Yosemite in 2014. This was the time, most applications were being written for OS X. This gave a big boost to Mac computers and laptops. Apple continued with a new operating system every year. El Capitan in 2015, Sierra in 2016, High Sierra in 2017, Mojave in 2018, Catalina in 2018, Big Sur in 2020 and then Monterey in 2021. All the new operating systems use encryption by default meaning if someone has a password and their computer dies, there is no way to do data recovery on it if password is not known. Older models did not have this feature turned on by default rather it as an option if user wanted to use it. Over all they got better and better over time. In this article, I tried to define operating systems used in computers and laptops. I also talked about their versions and who introduced these systems."
3,Rank with Mobile-Ready Content!,computers-technology," Scroll Smarter, Not Harder; The customer isn’t always right, but they will have you by the balls when it comes to SEO ranking for your website. Why? Because Google prioritizes when users want and what users want is to use their Smartphones. So, if you are looking for VIP treatment from Google, you’ll need to groom your content and formatting to be mobile-ready. Mobile-friendly website content is not a new concept, and if you are only hearing about this now, you’re already behind in the SEO game. In 2019, “mobile-first indexing (was first) enabled by default for all new websites (new to the web or previously unknown to Google Search).” In 2022, mobile-ready content is even more crucial to achieving a successful SEO ranking due to emerging and developing technology trends. So, if you are willing to work (and scroll) smarter, you might catch up in time to be recognized by Google. It Began With “Mobilegeddon.” If you still have doubts about the importance of mobile-ready content concerning Google rankings, you’ll need to take an SEO history lesson. This Google phenomenon began with the rise and purchases of Smartphones. As more consumers started using the Google search engine on their phones instead of their desktops or laptops, Google decided to reconfigure what they considered high-ranking sites, prioritizing mobile-friendly content. “This led to an event that’s become known in the SEO community as “Mobilegeddon.  (Now) mobile devices now account for over half of all searches on the web.” The fact is that mobile-ready content will always provide a higher SEO ranking, and if you still need convincing, you might as well stop reading and get another career. Because if Google doesn’t recognize your site, no one else will, including prospective customers who would otherwise support your business. Do Better Now! Improve your Ranking with Mobile-First Indexing If you want your site to succeed, stop whatever you’re doing and improve your content now. Because if you own a business and you aren’t making any money or aren’t searchable via Google, then what’s the point? Take our word for it and use these three tips for the best mobile-first indexing practices. Mobile-first indexing Best Practices Sites that offer an intuitive design that can change, depending on the size of the mobile screen. A responsive site layout is essential as “It’s Google’s preferred type of site design, and it’s safe to say that responsive sites will do well in the mobile-first index.” High-speed loading of pages. “it’s ideal to load a page in less than 3 seconds, or by Google’s recommendations, less than 1 or 2.” Design your content for the mobile user. For example, long-form blogs may be fine to view on a laptop or desktop, but lengthy content can be overwhelming for a mobile viewer. It’s All About the Bottom Line Your website reflects your business, and if you want to make money (which, of course, you do!), your products and services must be easily searchable on Google. Considering in 2021, “59% of all organic Google search traffic came from mobile devices,” your site must be mobile-friendly. Given the ruthless competition of online commerce, Google will ensure that their mobile-first indexing prioritizes well-designed sites, taking no prisoners. For the profit price, you must risk going to battle with a mobile-ready site. Otherwise, you’ll be left out with nothing but a desktop and a head full of frivolous dreams. #thinkaboutit"
4,Data recovery from different electronic devices,computers-technology," Operating system is the program that runs a computer or laptop.

5,Hybrid cryptocurrency exchange,computers-technology," Hybrid cryptocurrency exchange The advent of cryptocurrency gave rise to the launch of different exchanges to facilitate the selling and buying of cryptos. Since then, we have had centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges, and now hybrid cryptocurrency exchanges. As a digital asset, cryptocurrencies were met with challenges in their exchange on existing physical networks. This was the reason for the creation of different exchanges. The limitations of both the centralized and decentralized crypto exchanges led to the creation of the hybrid cryptocurrency exchange. This specialized crypto exchange combines the positive features of centralized and decentralized exchanges. The hybrid crypto exchanges address all the shortcomings of centralized and decentralized exchanges. They adopt the usability and liquidity of centralized platforms and the anonymity and security of decentralized exchanges. Here, users have total control of their funds and do not have to hand them over to any custodian. You can trade digital assets directly from your wallets while depositing tokens into the robust smart contract. The hybrid cryptocurrency exchange is undoubtedly the next generation crypto trading marketplace. 2021 has been the year of DeFi hype. To make the most from farming frenzy and crypto rally, traders kept juggling between the CEXs and DEXs. To fill the gaps, services providers are proactively looking for hybrid crypto exchange software that provides the benefits of both CEXs and DEXs into one. This means hybrid exchanges offer traders the liquidity and functionality of a CEX and top it with the security and privacy of a DEX. The idea of BLMSWAP began with a group of traders who aimed to connect the crypto world to the current banking system. This is how the idea of BLMSWAP was born. In the current crypto market, there are two showstoppers for traders. Gas fees and transaction speed. On the other hand, one of the biggest hurdles is that all services are not centralized in one platform, and it takes too long and lots of effort to get where you really want. These are a few advantages of BLMSWAP: · BLMSWAP designed to be faster than DEXs and support real-time service access. · Users seek complete ownership of their funds even when the third parties regulate and operate the exchange. · BLMSWAP provide complete privacy and anonymity to the exchange users. · They are compliant with different digital currency laws in different jurisdictions. · Protect users’ assets from hacks as the assets are stored in cold storage. BLM Swap is a subsidiary of BLM-UK LTD (Company number: 12787128) which Incorporated on August 2020, BLMSWAP is attracting funds to support the development of the first of its kind hybrid cryptocurrency exchange, which will encompass the best features of traditional exchanges and offer blockchain technologies for brokers and investors. BLMSWAP is launching its ICO in early 2022 and aims to attract 3.5 million USD ($3,500,000).  Tokens are available for sale in BNB and you can purchase it from www.blmswap.io .  The initial price of one token is 0.009 US dollar in ICO stage with huge potential. No tokens will be issued after the ICO."
6,Is your RDP Secured?,computers-technology," Microsoft Remote Desktop and Terminal Services (RDP) provide an easy way for users to connect enterprise systems and use shared applications from remote locations. “Yet username/and password-based authentication is not enough now to be security compliant in some companies and in general.” Let us see in details what RDP is, how to protect it, and what are the main features to look at before opting for any service. Where can I deploy? On-premises Microsoft Azure Amazon AWS Google Cloud What is RDP? The Microsoft Windows Remote Desktop Protocol, or RDP, is widely and securely used on private networks to enable users to log into remote computers. Once logged in through RDP, the screen of the remote system is displayed on the local system giving the local user control. RDP is commonly used in enterprise environments to empower system administrators to manage servers and workstations in remote locations, or by the employees, while away from their offices and desks. Increasingly, RDP is used to access virtual desktops. Users can log in using single sign-on, for example, Windows Kerberos within a domain, or with user credentials, usually, a domain username and password, to access an account on the remote system. A Microsoft Study Warns of Dangers Hackers begin using brute-force attacks once an open RDP port is identified on the Internet. They use automated tools that do permutation and combination of username and password to crack the target computer’s login credential. Attacks are metered, often lasting for days to prevent firewall/IDS (Intrusion detection systems) detection that might result in source IP address blockage. After a months-long study into the impact of RDP brute-force attacks on the enterprise, Microsoft reported that attacks last two to three days on average, with about 90% of cases lasting for one week or less, and less than 5% lasting for two weeks or more. According to Microsoft’s research, the one simple action you can take to prevent 99.9% of the attacks on your accounts is to use multi-factor authentication (MFA). Before going for any solution, always check if it provides Two-Factor with all OpenOTP One-Time Password methods and FIDO like: Software Tokens (OpenOTP Token which support Push logins, Google Authenticator) Hardware Tokens (all OATH compliant tokens are supported) Mobile-based SMS OTP (became deprecated in some scenario like for banks) Voice Biometrics (New authentication method) Mailbox Yubikey Token Also, some of the major features to look at is: -Supports NT Domain-style login names like ‘Domain\Username’ -Supports User Principal Names (UPN), implicit and explicit. -Supports LDAP and LDAP+OTP login modes. -Support of Users, groups, clients policies that allow you to design your authentication workflow based on many inputs. -Enterprise deployment with AD automated software deployment tools. -Supports Normal (3 fields presented to the user on the login screen) and Simple login (2 fields presented on the login screen and if an OTP is required, then the third field is displayed on another page) Always, Secure your Microsoft Servers, RDP login and Terminal Services."
7,Unethical SEO-Is it a danger in realistic circumstances?,computers-technology," If you are planning to enlist an expert to improve your site's location on Google, the primary concern you need to fathom is such a Search Engine Optimization (SEO) strategy that your company is expecting to use. Unfortunately, when everything is said and done, SEO specialists use either erroneous or misleading SEO systems. By what method may you know the differentiation? Corrupt SEO strategies use bewildering strategies that are often in opposition to Google's standards to help your page's location until further notice yet can forever hurt your site's reputation once Google jumps on these tricks. Then, Google can either rebuff your site by dropping your location or block it all around. Here are a few corrupt SEO stunts that you should know and avoid: Invisible Text A couple of web locales would implant specific keywords in their destinations and cover them by matching the font with the background. Notwithstanding the way that visitors couldn't see these disguised words, Google's algorithms could at present remember them. This led to having higher page positions some time back. Today, these tricks are rendered insufficient because Google has improvised its monitoring system and has kept an eye on the issue. Cloaking This technique used two exact HTML addresses, one was planned for the visitor, and the other was expected for Google's bot. Regions that used Adobe Flash would have the alternative to do this since Google couldn't see the information in these particular goals, enabling a couple of specialists to show two specific kinds of content. Likewise, visitors will find that the page appears irregular to their essential inquiry, devastating the customer experience. Although Google reliably intends to enable quality collaborations with their web search engine, they rebuffed goals that use this preparation to shield this from occurring. Duplicate Content Some web engineers take articles from notable websites or destinations to control more traffic to their site page and improve their page rank. It is essentially a ""reorder"" process. This task of taking content is denied, and goals that do this will face, for instance, lower page rankings. Instead, Google urges companies to make fascinating and significant content that will benefit the online system. Reworded Content Some Endeavour essentially to change two or three words from a current article lifted from another site with synonyms. Link Farms This procedure incorporates making various locales and links connected back to each other to mislead Google to believe they are reliable wellsprings of information. This gives the visualization that your site is renowned for and elicits vital energy from users. Google can, over time, find these bogus back links considering the way that it can see that these linkages as often as possible have close to zero importance to each other. When it perceives this fraud, it can achieve an enormous drop in your page rank. Black Hat SEO: What is it that implies and why to connect in measures to keep away from it? Black hat advertising may likewise appear to be a straightforward route to improving your web rankings and empowering greater provability in your web search. Reevaluate sooner than being associated with these methods. Black hat procedures can influence the internet searches noteworthily than can improve your business. Black Hat SEO Black hat SEO includes a wide range of strategies and methods infringing upon web crawler indications and the use of degraded ability to upgrade website rankings. Black hat SEO procedures provide no consideration to internet expectations.

8,Digital innovation in risk-averse companies is possible,computers-technology," Over the course of nearly two decades of working with large scale companies, I’ve been fortunate to work with amazing people at the category leaders in the world, including people at Amazon, Google, GSK, Samsung, Airbus, Nike, and more — but there has been a common dilemma facing all these companies — the internal innovation chasm. The design, product, and innovation leaders I’ve worked with have frequently been swimming upstream in their mandate — being told the company demands and supports radical, user-driven innovation, while the reality they face is that innovation of new products and experiences is mostly achieved in non-disruptive, linear approaches. This is not because linearity is what companies or the leaders desire, but because they don’t have the means to prove that taking a leap will pay off. Their reality includes: “We need proof from user research that this is valuable” — but it costs too much to get a meaningful sample size of feedback “You’re asking for too much budget and too much time. Give me something I can ship next sprint.” “These prototypes are just concepts, they aren’t really testable.” “All the developers are assigned to shipping features on the existing product, just make a Figma prototype.” Sound familiar? Design and product strategies may help us establish goals of where we’d like our products to be and what problems they’ll solve, but, more often than not, our path is defined by setting a work-back trajectory of how to include features one at a time rather than visionary strategy. This forgoes a true leap to a version 2.0, and should be seen more as a perpetual march to version 1.x. While serious resources can be spent on creative vision, rarely is anyone given the tools to properly test an idea in-market quickly at high fidelity. Even more rarely can teams figure out how to get their vision to market fast and continue to build and perfect it with the confidence of their company behind them. This all gives context to the questions my team at Noodl and I have been asking ourselves: How can we achieve design-driven innovative leaps in complex, risk-averse organisations? How can teams build entirely new or V2 products driven by real insights continuously? How can we ensure that companies in the midst of digital transformation don’t simply emulate sub-optimal approaches to innovation? What if we could shed the weight that holds us down and float right over the innovation chasm? What if we could empower a new creative class of professionals to create visionary software without the cost or bottlenecks of building expensive engineering teams? If your team is ready, one part of the answer is adopting a design-driven processes to innovation. The next step is equipping team members with design programming skills and methodologies. Cutting out the need for in-sourcing our outsourcing can steer resources (aka time and money) back to iteration with real users. When the most innovative people have the skills to create production-grade MVPs themselves that they can test with users, they can generate insights at light-speed and even take decisions on the fly where appropriate. Together, design-driven mentalities and design programming methods can allow you to own your own vision."

Smart doorbells are a great solution for those who want to make their home more secure and at the same time, have a little fun. They're also a perfect gift for that special someone on your list. In the past, there were two different types of smart doorbells on the market: The first type of smart doorbell had no display whatsoever, so you couldn't see who was at your front door. This type of smart doorbell was not very popular because it was difficult to tell if it's an intruder or not simply by looking through the camera. The second type of smart doorbell has a screen which shows the visitor's face, but it could be difficult to distinguish whether its an intruder or just a neighbor or friend. When these two types of smart doorbells were combined together, they formed what is known as 'smart' video doorbells today. With this technology, you can see who is at your front door and you can also watch what they're doing. The latest smart video doorbells are now the best on the market, but that doesn't mean that there aren't any better options out there. The best choice will depend on your budget and needs. The video doorbells listed below are some of the best smart video doorbells currently available as well as a few of my personal favorites. Keep in mind that you can only get one smart video doorbell with a built-in camera, so make sure to read all of the specs before purchasing. Can smart doorbells be hacked? Yes, they can. The first smart doorbells were vulnerable to hacking, but it was very difficult to do so. Today's smart video doorbells are much more secure, but if someone manages to hack one of them then they could access the camera and take videos of anyone who comes or goes through the front door. The best way to prevent this is by using a video doorbell with a built-in camera which is always connected to your Wi-Fi network (such as Ring Doorbell 2 ). You'll be able to see who comes and goes through the front door at all times without having to worry about hacking a smart video doorbell. If you want a more affordable solution then you can use an existing Wi-Fi setup in your home and connect an external camera that has its own Wi-Fi connection (such as Nest Cam ). By doing this, you'll be able to see who comes and goes through your front door at all times without having to worry about hacking a smart video doorbell. What are the downsides of using a smart doorbell? For one, smart video doorbells aren't always 100% reliable. The first generation Ring Doorbell and Nest Cam had a lot of bugs and problems that made them unreliable at times. These issues have since been ironed out, but I still recommend using them with caution. Also, if you want to install a smart video doorbell then you'll need to purchase one from the manufacturer (Ring or Nest) as most third-party brands don't have their own apps for smartphones yet. What is the difference between an indoor and outdoor camera? An indoor camera is one that's placed inside your home (such as Nest Cam ) while an outdoor camera is placed outside your home (such as Ring Doorbell Pro ). They both allow you to see who comes and goes through your front door at all times, but they're designed for different use cases. An indoor camera allows you to see what's happening inside your home from a separate room. This can be very useful for monitoring elderly parents or other members of the family that live alone. An outdoor camera is designed for monitoring outdoors. This is useful if you want to keep an eye on your property from a distance and make sure it's safe at all times. You can also use it to check on people who may be away from home, such as babysitters or housekeepers, when they're not around the house."
10,Why SpyWarrior is a great anti-malware program,computers-technology," Anti-malware programs are essential but while established anti-virus vendors are great, it’s sometimes a good idea to give new programs a shot. Developed by a Lithuanian cybersecurity company Kibernetinio Saugumo Sistemos, SpyWarrior is a completely new anti-malware program for Windows computers, and being a new player in this field, it has a lot to prove. So does SpyWarrior live up to its expectations? Let’s find out. SpyWarrior malware protection All anti-malware programs promise to protect users’ computers from malicious threats but the reality is sometimes different. So how well does SpyWarrior handle malicious threats? We performed various tests to find out exactly that. First of all, SpyWarrior developers claim the program can detect and deal with threats like adware, browser hijackers, and potentially unwanted programs. A lot of larger anti-virus vendors often overlook these threats because they don’t cause direct damage to computers. But even if they’re not serious infections, they can cause a lot of issues for users. We tested SpyWarrior against a variety of less-serious threats, and it accurately detected 98% of them. SpyWarrior was also tested against serious malware infections like viruses, trojans, keyloggers, ransomware, and other malware. SpyWarrior’s detection rates were even more impressive against these threats, as the program’s real-time detection feature was able to identify 99% of malware threatening to get in. SpyWarrior anti-ransomware feature One of SpyWarrior’s most important, and arguably the most impressive, features is protection against ransomware. This feature is especially important now that ransomware is essentially lurking in all corners of the Internet. But while SpyWarrior’s anti-ransomware feature looks good in theory, it’s important to test it in practice. And that’s exactly what we did. We tested SpyWarrior against 45 different ransomware strains, and the results were rather impressive. Out of 45, SpyWarrior was able to identify 45 attempts to encrypt files. All ransomware strains were blocked from doing any damage, which is quite an impressive result. SpyWarrior interface and customer support SpyWarrior has a pretty standard design and interface. That’s not to say that there’s anything wrong with that, as the design is modern, and the interface is clear and user-friendly. The program isn’t cluttered, everything’s clearly sectioned, and all features are easily accessible. For users who may have trouble, there are even instructions provided on the program’s official website. Users can contact SpyWarrior’s customer support via methods like email, social media, and by filling in a ticket in the program’s Help Desk section. This is also where users can send SpyWarrior technicians a report about issues the program cannot fix automatically. According to the official site, technicians would review the issue, come up with a custom solution, and send it to the program to be applied automatically. While we haven’t tested out this feature, it certainly sounds good. SpyWarrior free version It’s possible to find a free SpyWarrior version but it does not have many features. In fact, it only allows users to scan the computer for threats. But to remove what’s detected, it would be necessary to buy the full program. This is a pretty common practice, particularly for new programs. But for users who want to test the program before committing, they can try the 7-day free trial. The trial gives users full access to the program for 7 days. It’s automatically activated when users purchase one of the long-term SpyWarrior plans. SpyWarrior price Users have three options, two long-term commitments and one monthly plan. Paying on a monthly basis can be quite expensive as the price is €10/month, so it’s cheaper to choose either the 1-year or 2-year plans. With the current 51% discount, users can get the 1-year plan for €59/year (€4.42/month). The 2-year plan is available for €79/two years (€3.29/month) with a 67% discount. Purchasing one of the three plans gives 5 licenses. So, is SpyWarrior good? The short answer is yes. It has a great, user-friendly interface, a nice design, accessible and helpful customer support, affordable prices (especially with the discounts), and most importantly, it provides great protection against malware threats, including ransomware. So if you’re looking for an anti-virus program, SpyWarrior is a great choice."

13,Commercial Security Systems,computers-technology," There are many commercial security companies to choose from, but not all are a good fit for your business. A business is much different than a residence in terms of the requirements of the security system. It's important to choose a security company that installs mostly (or all) commercial systems versus mostly residential. The liability and stringent requirements needed from a business are higher, as well as the skillset is much different than that of a residential-based security company. Commercial security systems typically involve 3 types of systems. We like to call them the ""foundational pillars"" of security. There are a few common security systems that businesses can use in a commercial setting. Because not every business will require every type of system, it's a good idea to consult with an office building security systems installer who can conduct a security audit to determine a space's specific needs. The following are the most commonly used office security systems: Access control—An access control system determines who has access to office buildings and commercial spaces, usually through the use of authorized credentials that can unlock a door. Video surveillance and security cameras—Mounted cameras in commercial buildings allow security teams to see what's going on in key areas and monitor office security via video footage. Alarm systems—Office security alarm systems can deter criminal activity while also alerting employees to a breach. Alarms can be linked directly to locking mechanisms and an office door security system, or they can be triggered by events on the property. Sensors—Door contact sensors are installed in businesses to alert them when a door opens or is left ajar. Some businesses may use infrared, laser, or microwave sensors for more advanced commercial building security in high-security areas. System of emergency and fire protection—To be compliant with current local safety requirements, commercial building security systems must have proper fire safety, such as a business fire alarm system, and emergency detection equipment installed. Cybersecurity systems—Many businesses choose to add network security to protect proprietary information and private data. Anti-virus software, data encryption, traffic monitoring, and firewall protection are all components of commercial cybersecurity systems."
14,DATA VISUALIZATION: WHAT IT IS AND WHY IT MATTERS?,computers-technology," Data visualization is the process of translating data into a visual context, and it is one of the aspects of descriptive analysis. It is the process of visualizing our data using histograms, bar charts, pie charts, and box plots. It displays the information in a graphical or pictorial format. This method allows the user to comprehend the data and gain meaningful insights. The primary purpose of this procedure is to make it easier to spot patterns, trends, and outliers in the data. One of the most critical processes is data visualization, which specifies that after the data has been collected, it should be processed, modeled, and then presented to conclude the data. Radial Bar Chart is one of the most useful tools for visualizing data. It shows how information flows from one set of facts to the next. While there are a plethora of data visualization tools available, some are inaccurate and difficult to use. Sankey diagrams are a type of data visualization that is simple to use and allows you to quickly get insights into data. WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF DATA VISUALIZATION? By distributing data in the most effective way possible, visualization may assist you in any business or activity. Data visualization is an essential phase in the business intelligence process because it takes raw data, models it, and delivers it to conclude. Data scientists in advanced analytics are developing machine learning techniques to help organize crucial data into representations that are easier to grasp and interpret. In data visualization, visual data is utilized for communicating information in a universal, quick, and effective way. This technique can assist businesses in determining which areas require development, what factors influence consumer satisfaction and dissatisfaction, and what to do about specific issues (where they should go and who they should be sold to). Stakeholders, business owners, and decision-makers can better anticipate sales volumes and future growth using graphical data. HOW DO YOU USE THE SANKEY DIAGRAM TO VISUALIZE DATA? Material flow, energy, supply chain management, marketing, and advertising are just a few of the applications for Sankey diagrams. We'll learn how to visualize the customer journey using a Sankey chart in marketing and advertising. Sankey diagrams are the quickest and most straightforward approach to gain insights into your customers' journey since they enable you to examine data through segmentation. You can learn about the top-performing keywords and the sources of traffic. Consider the following scenario: you wish to view a PPC statistic in three dimensions: match type, device type, and impressions. Take the left-hand match type, the right-hand device type, and the middle-hand impression share. ●	Reading The Sankey Diagram A match will occur between a search query and the keywords in this Sankey diagram. If they match, your ad will receive an impression, followed by a device action. As a result, you can see that this graphic can be read both ways. The impression share in Google Ads is expressed as a percentage. If the ratio of impressions is 70%, the ad campaign is missing out on 30% of the opportunity. This implies you'll need to figure out how to take advantage of the 30% opportunities. The total percentage of match types may be more significant than 100%. As a result, the % isn't added to this graph. Why? Each of the percentages is based on a different set of numbers. Similarly, the device kinds' percentages are unrelated. ●	Don't Put Too Much Information On A Sankey Chart. In Google Ads or other PPC Ad campaigns, a Sankey diagram is a helpful tool for visualizing the consumer path. It is, nevertheless, suitable for limiting data analysis to a few brief sessions. Filling the chart with too much information will make it difficult to read or interpret. As a result, it's best to concentrate on only one Ad at a time. You'll be in a far better position to figure out which keywords are bringing in the most traffic and where it's coming from. WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF DATA VISUALIZATION? Data visualization improves an organization's decision-making process by providing dynamic visual representations of data. Businesses can now spot trends more rapidly since they may evaluate data in graphical or pictorial formats. Here are a few more specific instances of how data visualization may benefit a business: ●	Relationship Correlations: Without data visualization, identifying the correlations between the relationships of independent variables is difficult. If we can make sense of those independent variables, we can make better business judgments. ●	The trend over time: While this may appear to be an apparent data visualization application, it is also helpful. Without the necessary knowledge from the past and today, making predictions is impossible. Trends over time show us where we've come from and where we might be headed in the future. ●	Frequency is a concept that is closely associated with long-term patterns. By examining how frequently and when potential new customers buy, we can better determine how they react to various marketing and client acquisition strategies. ●	Examining the Market: Data visualization identifies which consumers to target and which to avoid using data from numerous marketplaces. We can better understand the possibilities of those markets by displaying the data on different charts and graphs. ●	Analyzing value and risk measurements needs skill because we must assess complex spreadsheets and figures without data visualization. After the data has been visualized, we may pinpoint places that may or may not require action. ●	Reacting to the Market: The ability to obtain information quickly and easily, with data displayed clearly on an operational dashboard, allows firms to act and respond rapidly to findings, lowering the chance of errors. Conclusion The Sankey diagram is a handy data visualization that aids in the visualization and understanding of data. It is beneficial in the sales, material management, supply chain, and marketing industries. It's great for illustrating a customer's journey and demonstrating how different factors affect a PPC metric. The most admirable aspect is that a Sankey chart is simple to make. So, go to work on creating a Sankey diagram and evaluating data."

17,10 Reasons to Increase Your Site Speed- Fast!,computers-technology," In November of 2020, Google added three new page experience signals that make up what is now being called Core Web Vitals. They include: Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS),First Input Delay (FID) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP). These three metrics were added into Google's ranking algorithm in mid-June 2021 and have since received a lot of buzz. If this is your first time hearing about Core Web Vitals, you can try Google Pagespeed Insights or alternatively GTMETRIX. Personally, I like to compare the results of both. Well before mobile device use surpassed desktop usage, browser loading speed on mobile devices has been an issue. Recent research done by Google shows that it takes the average website more than 15 seconds to load on a mobile device. The study also noted that conversion rates significantly dropped with every second that it took a website to load beyond 3 seconds. Imagine, your web designer builds you the most amazing website of all time. I mean, this website is beautiful! It checks all of the boxes; from a great site architecture and images to the most perfectly written and optimized content. You're now ready to conquer the world with your brand new, money printing machine. Then, guess what, your website is taking 15 seconds to load. All of your visitors quickly jump ship and click on your competitor's website, who has higher prices and lesser quality products. Chances are they won't be back. If that's not enough I'll give you 10 more reasons why you need to improve the loading speed of your website? In 2016, StatCounter  released a study that found that mobile devices accounted for 51.3 percent of worldwide internet usage Desktop computers typically have better processors and internet connection speeds via wifi or ethernet. Even 5G mobile device data network are slower in most cases . This means that loading sites on mobile devices can be significantly slower than a desktop even when optimized for mobile Google has publicly announced that a fast website helps to rank better. The ‘Speed Update’ made website speed a ranking factor for mobile searches. This was confirmed by a study of 413,000,000 pages at the 2018 SMX in Paris. https://www.slideshare.net/BotifySEO/how-does-google-crawl-the-web-botify-at-smx-paris-2018 Numerous studies have revealed that faster page speed results in better conversions. To put it simply, the quicker a webpage loads, the more likely a user is to carry out the targeted call of action on that webpage. It was observed that at some. 2 seconds, conversion rates were less than 1% At 5. 7+ seconds, conversion rates were in the realm of 0. 6% This one is no secret. If you've been around SEO for any length of time, you've heard how much page speed effects bounce rate. The ultimate goal of any web design project should be to provide the best user experience for site visitors. As part of that, page speed is one of the most important.

1,How Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Shapes People Analytics,computers-technology," Unlike many other areas of human resource technology, the introduction and extensive use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in human resource analytics has resulted in a significant expansion in the scope and impact of the technology's own influence. While AI and machine learning have been employed in a variety of areas of human resource technology, their use in the field of human resource analytics has had a significant impact. In the context of this article, machine learning algorithms can now automate the extraction of crucial insights from enormous volumes of human data, a method referred to as ""augmented"" analytics. Some of these systems are referred to as such by Helen Poitevin, a senior analyst at Gartner who specializes in human resources technology. She notes that some of these technologies are so named because they utilize machine learning to automate the extraction of crucial insights from massive volumes of human data. According to the author, ""useful insights are being recovered from vast amounts of human data in an automated form"" as a result of the use of machine learning approaches. This is known as ""augmented analytics."" ""Augmented analytics"" in this context refers to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to automate the extraction of crucial insights from massive volumes of human data. In this context, artificial intelligence and machine learning are being utilized to automate the extraction of essential insights from massive volumes of human data. Using a combination of augmented analytics and machine learning to prioritize which insights are most important to concentrate on when it comes to a specific individual at a specific time, according to Poitevin's article, may assist in prioritizing which insights are most important to concentrate on. A growing number of companies, like Workday, a human resources software business, are relying significantly on data analytics to help human resource personnel pick the most important signs to monitor. This method eliminates the need for a large data analysis crew to go through tremendous volumes of data. Other firms, such as Workday, are using augmented analytics to assist human resource managers to figure out which performance indicators are the most essential to pay attention to and which performance indicators are less critical to ignore. Mr. Pete Schlampp, Workday's senior vice president of analytics, discusses the lessons he's learned about working with data and providing HR professionals with data insights. Storytelling, according to Schlampp, is a strategy that may aid HR managers in gaining a better knowledge of the cultures and environments in which their businesses operate. Workday employs a technique known as ""story-telling"" to describe the events leading up to those roadblocks in plain English, helping workers to better understand what is going on at their workplace. This is a critical component of Workday's overall growth plan, which is detailed below. A core narrative is delivered to decision-makers in a plain way, according to Schlampp, and it is backed up with supporting metrics and infographics that underline underlying facts and crucial issues that must be taken into account. He believes that decision-makers are provided a simple synopsis of the narrative. If information is presented in an intelligible manner, it will be straightforward for a decision-maker to learn and retain it. Please keep me informed of your thoughts on this until then, as I'd want to observe how this works in reality before making a final decision. Thank you for taking the time to read this and for taking my request into consideration. Please accept my heartfelt gratitude in advance for taking the time to investigate my request. According to Schlampp, you should only go as far as providing a customer with an analytics ""narrative"" on female CEO promotion rates to explain how the firm can assist them. Workday's Schlampp states that when working with a customer on an analytics ""narrative"" the business had generated on female executive promotion rates, the company was able to build a report for them. After that, the customer got the report. According to the statistics, the customer's program was intended to narrow rather than grow the gap, indicating that the client deemed the program a failure. Our client was able to uncover the root cause of the issue as a result of the discovery process and work with its human resources business partners to apply the necessary remedies to bring the situation under control. Artificial intelligence, according to the authors, is influencing people management in a range of areas, including manufacturing and analytics in learning and development. Integrating people's professional goals with the competencies required for their jobs has always been tough, according to Elvis Ha, director of product management at CornerstoneOnDemand, a cloud computing service provider with headquarters in Santa Monica. He thinks the tide is turning in his favor, which is encouraging. He says that investigators' incapacity to make the connections they require during human resources investigations stems from a lack of expertise. The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technology is another important issue. Thanks to advancements in artificial intelligence technology, employees may be able to get learning material that is immediately relevant to the skills required for a certain task in the near future, rather than having to wait. Employees' abilities are tested using this technology, and they are then offered learning materials that are suitable for their level of proficiency. The word ""machine,"" which stands for ""machine learning,"" may be used to characterize the features of this kind of technology. It's also a term for the characteristics of machine learning, which is a kind of artificial intelligence. CornerstoneOnDemand, as previously noted by Ha, employs artificial intelligence to assist in the finding of the most appropriate training methodologies for its customers' requirements. A vendor may utilize historical data to identify the best day to deliver a certain learning program in order to enhance the percentage of participants who finish it successfully. All of this is done in order to increase the number of people who finish the program effectively, which is the program's ultimate aim in terms of completion rates."
2,Can Your Password Stand Up to A Data Breach?,computers-technology," At this point, it’s simply a matter of time before some company somewhere asks you to change your password because something somewhere down the line got hacked. In fact, in June of 2016, Fortune Magazine said, “It’s almost fashionable to become the victim of a data breach these days, or at least you’d think so, given the who’s-who list of companies announcing them.” In other words, everyone from Fortune 500 companies and hospitals to small businesses and tech giants are experiencing the rippling impact of a data breach. Does your password stand a chance? As an individual rudely thrown into the middle of a data breach, the first thing you should do is change your login credentials as quickly as possible. The quicker you change your credentials, the less of a chance a group of hackers has to use your preexisting password to access your account. But this will really only work if your preexisting password has made it through the initial waves of cracking and hacking. What is hacking software? Cyber criminals and hackers have developed a variety of software with the sole purpose of cracking your passwords. This can be done through a Brute Force attack where hackers try tens of thousands of password combinations within minutes. If the credentials are encrypted or hashed, this process can be a little more difficult. However, as we saw with Ashley Madison in 2015, how the data is encrypted or hashed will simply determine how much longer it will take to decrypt the data or match up the hashes with the correct algorithm. As Ars Technica reported, the Ashley Madison passwords were hashed with a rather sophisticated algorithm; nonetheless, this particular hashing involved a number of programming errors, allowing 11 million of the stolen credentials to be hacked in less than 10 days. If those errors were not present, it would have taken centuries to crack as many as they did. How else can your password be hacked? Cracking software is not the only way an account can be unlocked. This can go down in a variety of ways, and it doesn’t always involve a massive data breach. Phishing: You might receive a malicious email. The email will appear to come from a credible source, and it could potentially ask you to login to your account or send your information over for an “account verification.” Once you do this, the hackers will have full access to your account. Security Questions: Just like a password, your security questions can also be hacked. People tend to answer security questions in the same way – simply due to the nature of the question itself. For example, “What is your favorite football team?” only has a handful of legitimate answers, and people naturally want to answer it accurately to ensure they can recall it at a later time. In other words, a person isn’t going to say that his or her favorite football team is Pepperoni Pizza. Malware: If malware has wiggled its way onto your connected device, this could also result in a leaked password. Some malware can track your every movement, and keyloggers can record every letter you type. If they’re tracking and recording at the right time, they could match up the right website with the right credentials. What does a good password look like? When it comes to good ol’ fashioned hacking and cracking, it’s important to have a strong password. Like mentioned earlier, your password needs to be legit enough to make it through the initial waves of hacking and cracking – giving you the time you need to get to your account and change your password. Part of this will depend on how sophisticated the hashing and encryption standards are, but the other part of this will rely on the password itself. Use phrases. The longer your password is, the more difficult it will be to decipher. But, at the same time, this also means that it will be substantially more difficult for you to remember. To make this easier on you, use phrases. These are simpler to recall than a long string of random letters. Don’t use common phrases. Phrases are certainly better than standalone words, but that’s only if the phrase in question is unique and random. People are starting to use phrases as passwords more routinely; however, they’re also using the same phrases over and over again. And usually this consists of a phrase with the word “like” or “love” somewhere inside it. So instead of using “Ilikepeanutbutter,” use something more like “Mytummyenjoyspeanutbutter.” Experiment with capitalizations. Lifehacker asserts that there’s a huge difference in time when it comes to cracking a password with all lowercases versus cracking a password with all types of characters. For example, a password that does not use a word out of the dictionary, that has eight characters and all lowercases should take around 2.23 hours to hack with a basic computer. If you throw a capital letter or two in there, then that period of time should bump up to 2.21 years. Quite a bit of a difference. Now, if you did use a word out of the dictionary and you had a computer with some serious computing capabilities, this time would substantially decrease – however, a capital letter will still provide you with the solid buffer you need. Throw in a character or number. If a capital letter increases the strength of your password that much, consider what it does for your password if you add in a few numbers or a special character (like an exclamation point or an asterisk). However, just as it is with using common phrases, make sure you aren’t using these numbers and special characters in obvious ways. For example, just because you put “123” on the back of a word doesn’t mean this password is more secure. In fact, these combinations are attempted in hacking software automatically. But this also goes for letter replacements. For example, replacing an “E” with a “3” or an “a” with an “@”. These are obvious, and hackers will look for it. If you’re going to throw in a number or a special character, make sure it counts. Is there another way to protect your account? Passwords will only take you so far, especially if you’re subjected to sophisticated social engineering. These attacks rely on the human element to dupe you into dropping standard security procedures and releasing private information – like passwords. For this reason, you should consider implementing 2-factor authentication on any sites that offer it. 2-factor authentication requires two separate methods of authentication before you’re allowed to login to your account. This might consist of your password and a code given to you via a text message or email. This could even be your password plus a security question. Most major websites have adopted 2-factor authentication. On top of 2-factor authentication, some websites (like Facebook) offer login approvals or login notifications. This means that if someone tries to login to your account from an unrecognized browser or device, you’ll be sent a notification (usually through an email). If this attempt was not made by you, then you will have the opportunity to change your password. If you want to protect your data and online accounts, then 2-factor authentication and login notifications are a necessary step. They create an additional layer of security and provide a much-needed facelift to a system of verification that’s outdated and out of touch with modern society. How can we help you?

4,"Apple Watch 8 in 2022: larger design, a thermometer, and more..",computers-technology," Every year since the Apple Watch debuted in 2015, a new edition of the high-tech watch has been released. That’s why, even though the next Apple event is still months away, it’s probable that a successor to the Apple Watch Series 7 — presumably dubbed the Apple Watch 8 — is already in the works. Apart from feature enhancements like a bigger screen, quicker charging, and enhanced durability, Apple didn’t make many substantial modifications to the Series 7, which was announced alongside the iPhone 13 series in September. That might imply the firm is laying the groundwork for a more significant redesign of the next-generation Apple Watch, particularly in the health sector. Apple Watch 8 Apple had long-term health objectives for its popular wrist accessory years before the epidemic, with CEO Tim Cook declaring health as Apple’s “biggest contribution to mankind.” However, according to the Wall Street Journal, Apple is working on a variety of health features, some of which might be included in the Watch Series 8 (or whatever Apple decides to call it) as early as this year. A thermometer, which may be used to aid with fertility planning (but it might also be used to identify fevers in the future), as well as a blood pressure monitor, are among the features. According to the Wall Street Journal, the latter would function by employing sensors to measure the speed of the pulse a heartbeat transmits through a person’s arteries. Apple Watch 8 might have a thermometer and blood pressure monitoring feature. It will not offer baseline systolic and diastolic blood pressure values, unlike typical blood pressure monitoring cuffs that are normally wrapped around the upper arm. According to the research, it will instead inform you how your blood pressure is trending. A comparable blood pressure function was previously included in Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 4, which is accessible in select countries and regions, including South Korea and Europe, where it has acquired regulatory approval. Aside from the thermometer and blood pressure monitoring, there have been solid claims that Apple is working on non-invasive blood glucose monitoring, sleep apnea detection, and vehicle collision detection in secret. We shouldn’t hold our breath for these additional health capabilities to emerge on the next Apple Watch, according to Bloomberg’s seasoned tech correspondent Mark Gurman. In his PowerOn email, he wrote on the Series 8’s purported ability to sense body temperature, monitor blood glucose, and blood pressure: “None of these are likely to happen anytime soon. Body temperature was on the agenda for this year, but talk about it has halted recently. Blood pressure monitoring will take at least two to three years, and I wouldn’t be shocked if glucose monitoring doesn’t arrive until later in the decade.” Apple Watch 8 might go bigger in terms of design. Since the initial Apple Watch made waves in 2015, the overall look of the device has stayed mostly unaltered. While it appears that a makeover to a flat-edged timepiece for next year is unlikely, reports claim that Apple may expand the display of the Watch Series 7 once again. According to display analyst Ross Young’s tweets on Twitter, a third Apple Watch size might be released this year, in addition to the existing 41mm and 45mm models announced with the Watch Series 7. The tough Apple Watch is a new model. Apple is considering launching “with a durable case” and a rubberized exterior meant for usage in more harsh settings than everyday use, according to Gurman. According to the article, Apple is aiming its product towards sportsmen, hikers, and other people who would use it in harsh situations. It will have the same functionality as a conventional Apple Watch, but with superior protection and impact resistance, according to the report. In 2022, Apple is likely to release the tough Apple Watch. The top Apple Watch 7 features, everything new in Apple Watch 7 vs. Apple Watch 6, what we want to see in the future Apple Watch, and when the next Apple event will take place are all listed below. In addition, the iPhone SE 3 is said to be on the way."
5,Computer - based technology and student engagement: a Critical review of the literature,computers-technology," Conceptual PC based innovation has penetrated numerous parts of life and industry, at this point there is minimal comprehension of how it tends to be utilized to advance understudy commitment, an idea getting solid consideration in advanced education because of its relationship with various positive scholarly results. The motivation behind this article is to introduce a basic audit of the writing from the beyond 5 years connected with how web-coe, wikis, informal communication destinations (Facebook and Twitter), and advanced games impact understudy commitment. We introduced the discoveries with a meaningful outline of understudy commitment definitions and pointers, which uncovered three sorts of commitment (social, enthusiastic, and mental) that educated how we grouped articles. Our discoveries recommend that advanced games give the most extensive impact across various kinds of understudy commitment, trailed by web-conferencing and Facebook. Discoveries in regards to wikis, sites, and Twitter are less decisive and altogether restricted in number of studies directed inside the beyond 5 years. By and large, the discoveries offer primer help that PC based innovation impacts understudy commitment, notwithstanding, extra examination is expected to affirm and expand on these discoveries. We close the article by giving a rundown of proposals to rehearse, with the goal of expanding comprehension of how PC based innovation might be intentionally executed to accomplish the best gains in understudy commitment. Presentation The advanced insurgency has significantly impacted day by day living, obvious in the omnipresence of cell phones and the consistent coordination of innovation into normal undertakings like shopping, perusing, and tracking down headings (Anderson, 2016; Smith and Anderson, 2016; Zickuhr and Raine, 2014). The utilization of PCs, cell phones, and the Internet is at its most significant level to date and expected to keep on expanding as innovation turns out to be more available, especially for clients in agricultural nations (Poushter, 2016). Likewise, there is a developing number of individuals who are cell phone subordinate, depending exclusively on cell phones for Internet access (Anderson and Horrigan, 2016) rather than more costly gadgets like workstations and tablets. More noteworthy admittance to and interest for innovation has introduced one of a kind open doors and difficulties for some businesses, some of which have flourished by successfully digitizing their activities and administrations (e.g., money, media) and others that have battled to stay aware of the speed of mechanical advancement (e.g., instruction, medical services) (Gandhi, Khanna, and Ramaswamy, 2016). Incorporating innovation into instructing and learning is certifiably not another test for colleges. Since the 1900s, overseers and workforce have wrestled with how to adequately utilize specialized advancements like video and sound accounts, email, and remotely coordinating to expand or supplant customary educational conveyance strategies (Kaware and Sain, 2015; Westera, 2015). Inside the beyond twenty years, nonetheless, this challenge has been considerably more troublesome because of the sheer volume of new advances available. For instance, in the range of a long time (from 2008 to 2015), the quantity of dynamic applications in Apple's App Store expanded from 5000 to 1.75 million. Over the course of the following 4 years, the quantity of applications is projected to ascend by 73%, adding up to more than 5 million (Nelson, 2016). Further intensifying this challenge is the restricted time span of usability of new gadgets and programming joined with critical inner authoritative boundaries that obstruct colleges from proficiently and adequately coordinating new advances (Amirault, 2012; Kinchin, 2012; Linder-VanBerschot and Summers 2015; Westera, 2015). Numerous authoritative obstructions to innovation coordination emerge from contending pressures between institutional arrangement and practice and personnel convictions and capacities. For instance, college managers might see innovation as an instrument to draw in and hold understudies, while personnel might battle to decide how innovation matches with existing instructional method (Lawrence and Lentle-Keenan, 2013; Lin, Singer, and Ha, 2010). What's more, some staff might be reluctant to utilize innovation because of absence of specialized information as well as distrust about the adequacy of innovation to further develop understudy learning results (Ashrafzadeh and Sayadian, 2015; Buchanan, Sainter, and Saunders, 2013; Hauptman, 2015; Johnson, 2013; Kidd, Davis, and Larke, 2016; Kopcha, Rieber, and Walker, 2016; Lawrence and Lentle-Keenan, 2013; Lewis, Fretwell, Ryan, and Parham, 2013; Reid, 2014). Hierarchical obstructions to innovation reception are especially tricky given the developing requests and saw benefits among understudies about utilizing innovation to learn (Amirault, 2012; Cassidy et al., 2014; Gikas and Grant, 2013; Paul and Cochran, 2013). Overviews propose that 66% of understudies utilize cell phones for learning and accept that innovation can assist them with accomplishing learning results and better set them up for a labor force that is progressively reliant upon innovation (Chen, Seilhamer, Bennett, and Bauer, 2015; Dahlstrom, 2012). Colleges that neglect to successfully coordinate innovation into the opportunity for growth botch valuable chances to further develop understudy results and measure up to the assumptions of an understudy body that has become used to the reconciliation of innovation into each aspect of life (Amirault, 2012; Cook and Sonnenberg, 2014; Revere and Kovach, 2011; Sun and Chen, 2016; Westera, 2015). The motivation behind this paper is to give a writing survey on what PC based innovation means for understudy commitment inside advanced education settings. We zeroed in on PC based innovation given the particular sorts of advances (i.e., web-conferencing programming, sites, wikis, informal communication destinations, and computerized games) that arose out of an expansive inquiry of the writing, which is portrayed in more detail underneath. PC based innovation (from this point forward alluded to as innovation) requires the utilization of explicit equipment, programming, and miniature handling highlights accessible on a PC or cell phone. We additionally centered around understudy commitment as the reliant variable of interest since it incorporates a wide range of parts of the educating and learning process (Bryson and Hand, 2007; Fredricks, Blumenfeld, and Parks, 1994; Wimpenny and Savin-Baden, 2013), looked at smaller factors in the writing, for example, last grades or test scores. Besides, understudy commitment has gotten critical consideration throughout recent a very long time because of movements towards understudy focused, constructivist informative strategies (Haggis, 2009; Wright, 2011), mounting tensions to further develop educating and learning results (Axelson and Flick, 2011; Kuh, 2009), and promising examinations recommending connections between understudy commitment and positive scholastic results (Carini, Kuh, and Klein, 2006; Center for Postsecondary Research, 2016; Hu and McCormick, 2012). Regardless of the interest in understudy commitment and the interest for more innovation in advanced education, there are no articles offering an exhaustive audit of how these two factors cross. Likewise, while many existing understudy commitment reasonable models have extended to incorporate variables that impact understudy commitment, none feature the clear job of innovation in the commitment interaction (Kahu, 2013; Lam, Wong, Yang, and Yi, 2012; Nora, Barlow, and Crisp, 2005; Wimpenny and Savin-Baden, 2013; Zepke and Leach, 2010). Our survey intends to address existing holes in the understudy commitment writing and tries to decide if understudy commitment models ought to be extended to incorporate innovation. The audit likewise addresses a portion of the authoritative obstructions to innovation coordination (e.g., staff vulnerability and distrust about innovation) by giving a complete record of the exploration proof with respect to what innovation means for understudy commitment. One constraint of the writing, in any case, is the absence of insight about how instructing and learning rehearses were utilized to choose and coordinate innovation into learning. For instance, the procedure segment of many investigations does exclude an educational support for why a specific innovation was utilized or insights concerning the plan of the learning action itself. In this way, it regularly is muddled what educating and realizing practices might have meant for understudy commitment levels. We return to this issue in more detail toward the finish of this paper in our conversations of regions for future examination and proposals for training. We started our writing audit by leading an expansive quest for articles distributed inside the beyond 5 years, utilizing the catchphrases innovation and advanced education, in Google Scholar and the accompanying examination information bases: Academic Search Complete, Communication and Mass Media Complete, Computers and Applied Sciences Complete, Education Research Complete, ERIC, PsycARTICLES, and PsycINFO. Our underlying hunt uncovered subjects in regards to which innovations were generally common in the writing (e.g., long range interpersonal communication, computerized games), which then, at that point, lead to a few, more designated searches of similar information bases utilizing explicit watchwords like Facebook and understudy commitment. After both expansive and focused on look, we distinguished five innovations (web-conferencing programming, sites, wikis, person to person communication locales, and advanced games) to remember for our survey. We decided to zero in on advances for which there were different examinations distributed, permitting us to distinguish areas of intermingling and uniqueness in the writing and reach determinations about certain and adverse consequences on understudy commitment. Altogether, we distinguished 69 articles applicable to our survey, with 36 relating to interpersonal interaction destinations (21 for Facebook and 15 for Twitter), 14 relating to advanced games, seven relating to wikis, and six relating to online journals and web-conferencing programming individually. Articles were arranged by their effect on explicit sorts of understudy commitment, which will be depicted in more detail underneath. In certain examples, one"
6,Crunchyroll Not Working? Check Your Geolocation,computers-technology," If you’re a newcomer to the Crunchyroll anime streaming platform and immediately find that the Crunchyroll app or website isn’t working at all, it could be your geolocation that is the issue. In this article, I’ll explain how to determine if that is the case and how to get around that issue with a cheap VPN. Table of Contents Dang! We couldn’t connect to Crunchyroll error Why is Crunchyroll not working? How to determine if your geolocation is supported How to Access Crunchyroll from geo-blocked locations Dang! We couldn’t connect to Crunchyroll Error [Solved] Being a hardcore anime fanatic, I’ve always been looking for the best places to watch anime online. Now that I’m no longer a high-school student, I can afford the streaming platform memberships and have used Netflix for the longest time. However, depending on your location, the Netflix anime selection might not be the best. I had avoided Crunchyroll for the longest time and finally decided to pull the trigger to see what all the hype was about. So I signed up, started a free trial, and loaded up the Crunchyroll mobile app. But as soon as I did… Dang! We couldn't connect to Crunchyroll screenshot Dang! We couldn’t connect to Crunchyroll Error If you see this error check: If your internet/wifi is working If other apps are working, like YouTube or Netflix If you do the above checks and they all pass, I’m sorry to tell you that Crunchyroll is probably not supported in your country. Why is Crunchyroll Not Working? Answer: You’re in a country where it is not supported. So if you’re new to Crunchyroll and immediately see the above error in the app, or if you log in to the Crunchyroll website on PC and don’t see any anime titles available here, then the issue is most likely your geolocation. This means Crunchyroll isn’t supported in your country. If you’re wondering why, it is because of licensing issues. Do you remember this famous story when it was announced that you could watch Ghibli films on Netflix? The reason these areas don’t have access to the films is that licensing agreements are based on country. Netflix might be allowed to stream a certain film or show in America, but not in Canada. Similarly, Crunchyroll anime title availability differs by region. You might be able to watch Attack on Titan on the platform in the US, but not in the Philippines, for example. How to determine if your geolocation is supported Unfortunately, Crunchyroll doesn’t have a list of supported countries (no idea why). But the easiest way to check is to a. see if Crunchyroll is even in your app store (on mobile) or b. open the Crunchyroll anime list on desktop and see if anything pops up. If no anime titles pop up, then the reason why Crunchyroll isn’t working is that it’s not supported in your country =( For example, this is what I see in Japan (a country where it’s not supported): How to access Crunchyroll from geo-blocked locations But don’t worry, you can still access Crunchyroll even if you’re in a geo-blocked location. The process is simple: Get a cheap VPN (some even have free trials) Connect your VPN to a country with a good Crunchyroll library (like the UK or the US) Clear cache on your Crunchyroll app or open your desktop browser in incognito mode Open Crunchyroll (via app or desktop) Select your desired anime and start watching!"

8,What will be the digital actions shortly in the future?,computers-technology," Place, price, product as well as promotion. The core principles of marketing have been the same over time. Digital advancements have opened many more avenues than before. However, the core principles continue to be the same. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND AUTOMATION via a leading SEO Company in Toronto Artificial Intelligence (AI) was initially a promising technology but did not have a practical use in marketing. However, since my first day in the business, it has evolved from science fiction to actuality, and companies use it to perform various marketing-related tasks. For example, it can help companies identify audiences, retarget customers, monitor buying and browsing patterns, and many other things. Instead of making rules for computers to adhere to, AI discovers the characteristics of your clients and develops profiles that allow you to tailor and advertise things that are most likely to please everyone. While AI creates waves, businesses that do not have the money to invest in machine learning depend on automation for similar tasks. Automation improves the effectiveness and timing of email marketing. It allows companies to respond quickly to pre-planned situations, which reduces the chances of being missed and enhances engagement with the brand. OMNICHANNEL > MULTICHANNEL Alongside AI is the capability to track your customers across all channels. Omnichannel implies that your clients can interrelate with your corporation through any of your media and get seamless service, regardless of whether they use the same platform for all interactions or switch devices or channels. How many times did you receive a response on social media, and later another response when you call or email a company? Connecting the various strands of the web, social media applications, mobile, marketplaces like eBay and Amazon, and even the physical shop, omnichannel lets you stay in touch with your customers. At the same time, they browse and purchase in the way they prefer. While a traditional multichannel strategy will see them begin again each time they take a new stage and then re-start again, omnichannel makes sure you know where they started forming and improves the probability of a successful purchase. VOICE SEARCHES You've probably heard of my trusted family members Google, Siri, and Alexa. They aid me in researching information, purchasing books, and even turning the lights in my house on or off. Sure we're all lazy, but with the growing popularity of home assistants, voice search is now a brand new avenue for digital marketers. And this is the right time to find out how they function. People around the globe are increasing their use of these devices to organize their lives and homes. Instead of sitting at a desk or pulling out their smartphones, they are just asking their assistants to ask a question. That means that websites must think more thoughtfully about how they can improve their content. The queries entered into a search engine are quite different from how people use their assistants. This aspect makes it more crucial than ever to ensure that the content you choose to use provides the answers and details that are more than only keywords. CRO AND IMPROVING WEBSITE EXPERIENCES The user experience is a crucial element of the marketing equation, and it is the key to turning the traffic into sales. With the advancement of technology on the internet and data speed has increased, advances in compression of web pages have enabled page loading times to be incredibly rapid. ACCELERATED MOBILE PAGES (AMP) AND PROGRESSIVE WEB APPS (PWA) The majority of the traffic to Google is now generated by mobile devices, making page load times more critical than ever. Speedy mobile pages (AMP) have a loading time of 5 seconds or less. Although AMP isn't an element in ranking, website speeds and engagement rates are, and speedy pages result in fewer users who are frustrated and fewer abandoned sessions. A progressive web application (PWA) is a hybrid between regular web pages and computer applications. It is a speedy, user-friendly platform, regardless of OS or hardware, and offers a better user experience than traditional websites. NATIVE ADS As we grow more sophisticated and mobile browsing continues to beat desktop browsing, our tolerance for pop-ups and content blocking ads diminishes. I'm constantly clicking the ""back"" button to leave a site with live chat widgets, pop-up boxes, and countdown times for footers that obscure the essential things. The native ads are incorporated into the website's design, similar to an old-fashioned newspaper column, and don't take the entire screen. They aren't often recognizable as ads, either. Instead, they sit in the background of the website's content and the paid results that appear at the top of the Google search results webpage. Through the use of styled ads that make them appear more elegantly positioned and less overbearing, they can eliminate the tackiness the majority of banners and pop-ups can bring to a site. CONTENT MARKETING IS STILL A POWERFUL FORCE A key element to any marketing plan that is digital content marketing is evolving with the changing landscape. Each year, the bar for ""good content"" is raised as agencies and businesses produce better and more extensive written, visual, and audio content in larger quantities. In the past decade, I've seen the standards increasing exponentially as previously challenging to access media such as video have now become accessible to almost anyone. Content marketing is expected to continue to evolve and grow as marketers discover new ways to connect with ever-larger specific audiences using technology and devices that are becoming better and better each day. VIDEO Video remains the most enjoyable type of content available, and high-quality video content offers flexibility and sharing. These short, well-made videos are ideal for reaching a wider audience across a broader range of devices at the perfect time of day. Do you remember how you could block the advertisements on TV? Nowadays, people are searching for something to watch during their commute, wasting time at work, or taking time off. In the past, TV was the simplest medium that could reach the most people possible without doing more than looking at the screen. Today's modern marketing videos benefit from the same convenience while providing convenience and mobility. AR AND VR VR and AR took some time to achieve accessibility and cost-effectiveness, making them an indispensable marketing tool. Still, the technology is now more advanced than ever. Augmented Reality (AR) overlooks CGI over the physical space you see through your smartphone or glasses, while virtual reality (VR) includes fully computer-generated images and settings. FINALLY, If there's one thing I can say about marketing via digital channels, the age of technological innovation via a leading SEO Company in Toronto is present and well. No matter the size of your company or sector, it's essential to incorporate the latest innovations into your marketing strategies to stay ahead of what your customers are looking for, without forgetting what has been successful before. There are numerous avenues and niches to study and target that the minor details and personalizations could make a massive difference in the way customers interact with your brand."

10,5 Points to Create Digital Marketing Strategy for Your Brand,computers-technology," The online industry is now extremely competitive and saturated, with a plethora of enterprises and brands. You'll need to develop an excellent digital marketing plan if you want your business to stand out in such a crowded market. The beauty of digital marketing is that it provides everyone an opportunity to succeed, regardless of how well-developed or funded a business is. To put it another way, with the correct strategy in place, your company can compete with some of the industry's biggest names. However, developing such a marketing strategy needs a significant amount of time, planning, and thought. You'll be back to square one if you make a mistake. As a result, advertising a brand entails much more than simply slapping your logo on everything. It all comes down to giving the correct message to the right people at the right time. With that in mind, consider the following points when developing a digital marketing strategy for your company. Analyze your target audience The first step in building a genuinely effective digital marketing campaign is to conduct extensive research. Market research can provide you with all of the information you need to design your marketing initiatives. This is especially true when it comes to determining who your target market is. The truth is that you can't develop a successful marketing strategy without first determining what your target audience wants, likes, and expects, among other things. As a result, prior to developing a digital marketing plan, it's critical to conduct extensive research on your target demographic. Here are a few suggestions for you to consider. Determine your audience's preferences, needs and expectations. Analyze their demographics. Determine their purchasing habits. Identify their pain points. Create buyer's personas. Conduct a competitive analysis Competitive analysis is an important part of market research and of developing a digital marketing plan for your business. You must be informed of what your competitors are doing if you want to succeed in marketing. The last thing you want to do is follow in their footsteps. Instead, you should figure out their strengths and shortcomings so you may exploit market gaps to establish a competitive advantage and eventually outrun your rivals. When performing a competitive analysis, there are a few points to keep in mind. Determine who your competitors are. Analyze their products or services. Research their sales tactics and results. Analyze their pricing and specialized offers. Learn about which marketing strategies they use and how effective they are. Analyze their content. Observe their social media presence. Set a clear goal It's time to create a realistic goal for your marketing plan when you've effectively researched both your target demographic and your primary competitors. As a result, consider what you want to achieve with your digital marketing plan. You can always use the SMART criteria if you're not sure how to proceed. Here's an example of what your objective should be. Specific Measurable Attainable Relevant Timely A goal that is relevant to your brand is required when developing a digital marketing strategy. You may wish to increase your exposure, brand awareness, sales, or conversions, among other things. These are all realistic goals that can be reached through digital marketing, but you must determine the most effective manner of accomplishing each one. Create a killer website A website is the focal point of every digital marketing plan. People will flock to your website regardless of what you do, either to make a purchase or to learn more. Furthermore, they anticipate a flawless surfing experience once they arrive on your website. Otherwise, they'll just bounce off. As a result, even if you have the most effective marketing approach, if your website is unable to offer leads with the information they require, it will all be for naught. That's why every company, including yours, needs a fantastic website. Branded websites, for example, must have a perfect design. Your website's layout, color palette, and even fonts must all exactly reflect your brand's identity. If you don't, your viewers will pick up on discrepancies and won't appreciate it. That said, when building a website for your business, it's critical to seek professional advice on how to design it properly. After that, you can rest assured that any customer who arrives on your site as a consequence of your marketing efforts will stick around to learn more. Produce awesome content In most cases, the goal of a digital marketing strategy is to send the appropriate message to the right people at the right time to get the intended results. There is no greater medium for communicating that message than content. Content is essentially what everyone wants, and it can be included into any marketing strategy you devise. Furthermore, high-quality content might help your digital marketing initiatives work more effectively. As a result, content is critical for a variety of marketing initiatives, including SEO, social media, email marketing, PPC, blogging, and so on. The primary reason that content is so powerful and effective is that it gives actual value to consumers. You can easily use material to simultaneously educate, enlighten, and entertain your audience. As a result, every company should have a well-thought-out content strategy to go along with its digital marketing strategy. Final Thoughts It's not easy to come up with a digital marketing strategy for your company. There are numerous factors that must be carefully evaluated, and there is little room for error. That is why it is critical for your brand to undertake extensive research and gather all relevant data in order to make more educated and strategic decisions. As long as you have the correct strategy in place, digital marketing will level the playing field for you and help you to pave your road to success."
11,How Has the Pandemic Affected Software Development,computers-technology," Due to the pandemic, the demand for digital products and software solutions has grown significantly. Many companies are planning significant investments in the digital transformation of their businesses. How else has the pandemic affected business and people's lives, what applications or programs have become important due to the pandemic? Leobit, a software development company from Lviv, Ukraine, asked these questions to experts in the IT industry. Harriet Chan, the co-founder and marketing director of Coco Finder. The pandemic had knocked the business to remote working culture, thereby increasing collaboration tools usages to enhance work from home strategy. Apps like Slack, GoToMeeting, WebEx are a few applications that provide video conferencing and file sharing in a safe space. The demand for software development increases because all business processing is digitized. The cloud storage strategy with efficient collaboration applications is in great demand in processing the remote business works successfully. The role of mobile devices is increased in this lockdown because many employees use the mobile to connect flawlessly in video conferencing for crucial meetings. Many applications are compatible with Android and iOS platforms, thereby providing comfort to the users. These remote working concepts will extend even after the pandemic is over. Few organizations will opt for a hybrid workplace that requires efficient software to connect with the other remote employees in their team. It infers that even when the pandemic ends, the demand for software development increases significantly. Jonathan Tian, Co-Founder of Mobitrix The biggest and the newest thing Pandemic has introduced to the world is a lockdown, and due to lockdown, Work From Home concepts has been taught. So meeting apps, online learning software, virtual tutoring, interactive health management software, virtual reality, online gaming, metaverse, and cloud computing are some apps, software, tools, and programs that have become more important after the pandemic. The demand for software development has never decreased and will not fall in the future also. This is the era of technology, and software development offers users the latest technology. The demand for software development increased in digital marketing, virtual reality, remote work, cloud computing, cyber warfare, and health assistance. No mobiles are still the best use and example of latest and modern technology. Yes, various other gadgets like Laptops have gained attention in the pandemic, but still, the most popular device in the contemporary world is mobile. As mentioned above, the need for software development will never go down. It will only increase in the future. There are still a lot of sectors where software development has to play a significant role. Also, to assist and help humanity, their need will grow continually. Stephen Walker, CEO of Spylix Since the start of the pandemic, many systems have not functioned as they used to. Working from home and online classrooms would be more difficult without virtual meeting apps like Google Meet and Zoom. Consequently, the demand for these applications has increased many times over this time. If we talk about the demand for software development, then yes, the demand has grown to an unprecedented level. This is because companies need better software to deliver better online experiences. Development should be done as soon as possible so that their work doesn't stop. It is estimated that by next year, the demand for software development will grow by 3.5%. Despite the fact that the trends will be different, the market is always high, and they will only need periodic changes. CarlaDiaz, Broadband Search The Remote Work Future: As remote work and work from home become one of the new norms for business, many software developers have made a point to include remote collaboration features into their platforms. With the pandemic forcing offices to take on new public health measures, such as social distancing, businesses had to find ways to continue operating outside of the office. This has actually led to the revitalization of many platforms as they began to rework their purpose for an adapting corporate landscape. There was an increase in video conference software like Zoom and Microsoft Teams. Software suites from both Google and Microsoft Office began to add remote work features, like collaborating on the same document and view sharing for multiple accounts on one project. Mobile devices have also become integral as a form of communication with conference-style messaging applications becoming the go-to for small or large remote teams. Emails are still used for larger company-wide announcements and important communications, but platforms like Slack and Discord have actually become quite convenient for small teams as they communicate on project timelines and updates. Even as companies make their way back to the office, remote work has been quite beneficial for not only the company but for the workers as well. The software will inevitably continue to develop for both regular on-site work and remote work far into the future. Patricia Graciano, Mind Meld PR Inc Collaboration tools like Slack and Zoom, as well as management tools like Monday.com and Trello, have become indispensable for companies since the pandemic. While many roles are becoming automated, AI cannot replace the entire human brain. Tasks and positions that require critical thinking and complex problem solving are growing and in demand. For example, we are seeing an increase in demand for software development to implement vaccine management systems and online ordering systems. Even when the pandemic is over, the digital transformation it has brought will continue to evolve. Now that telecommuting is the norm, new collaboration tools - perhaps within the metaverse - will grow with the demand for software developers."

Making Choices However, like any role-playing game, you have agency. You aren’t simply reading an exciting fantasy story, you are in the story and you have choices to make. This is where your character traits are put to use. Some choices in quests are exclusive to certain classes. For example, if you enter a battle scene the actions available to you can depend on both your character’s race and class. If your foe is a dwarf and you too are a dwarf, perhaps you can use your kinship to talk them down. Or if you’re a wizard, sorcerer, or warlock, your character might have spells and abilities to cast in battle that other characters don’t. In Ethermore, the possibilities are only limited by our imagination. With countless race variants, classes, and backgrounds to work with, quest options can be tailored to any number of characteristics. Your Choices Have Consequences Most importantly, like in any good RPG, your actions have consequences. Each action can affect your character’s affinity between good and evil and contribute to chaos or order within the world of Ethermore.

16,Safe way to make Deepfakes,computers-technology," What is AI video? When you hear AI video, what comes to mind? Probably a number of different things, or maybe even none. The most recognizable synonym for AI videos is probably “deepfake”, and although some might have a negative association with that phrase, AI videos are a lot more and provide value in many areas of business and life. AI videos are a subdivision of Synthetic Media, which is an interconnected field of AI-generated media content - it doesn’t stem from reality as we know it. Some example include digital art, animated characters or what we’re all familiar with from Hollywood – CGI. AI videos can be any form of moving picture you want it to be, but these days it allows for innovation in professional as well as home studios. Reducing cost and enabling fast turnaround for video production.  Imagine writing a blog post but wanting to add some visual appeal to increase engagement, well now you can simply copy and paste your text and you have a human face reading out what you just wrote. “Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.” https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence How it came to be? Artificial intelligence has an interesting road that was started in the first half of the 20th century when the world started to be introduced to concepts such as robots and portray revolutionary technology in mainstream media such as movies and cartoons. With the idea of of artificial intelligence, Alan Turning, a young British scientist and polymath theorized that if humans can solve problems with available information, why can’t machines? The road was long and expensive, but fast forward the end of the 20th century and start of the 2000s, when AI was reaching milestones and blooming. “In 1997, reigning world chess champion and grand master Gary Kasparov was defeated by IBM’s Deep Blue, a chess playing computer program. This highly publicized match was the first time a reigning world chess champion loss to a computer and served as a huge step towards an artificially intelligent decision making program. In the same year, speech recognition software, developed by Dragon Systems, was implemented on Windows. This was another great step forward but in the direction of the spoken language interpretation endeavor. It seemed that there wasn’t a problem machines couldn’t handle. Even human emotion was fair game as evidenced by Kismet, a robot developed by Cynthia Breazeal that could recognize and display emotions.” https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/history-artificial-intelligence/ How to create AI videos One innovative use of AI is the ability to have a human presenter in your video, without ever having to film someone saying what you want them to. This type of technology also offers immediate editability, if you want to change the way something is said or if you have to change information for the video. This is complex text-to-video technology made simple and easy for the everyday user. Colossyan is one of the leaders in the current market when it comes to that, with their online self-service software you simply choose and actor and decide what kind of voice they are going to have. You can choose various accents from more than 50 languages as well. The system also allows for everyday editing such as adding media and text, producing a seamless AI video in the end. A real studio quality video with a real person saying whatever you can imagine in whatever language you desire, in less than 10 minutes. How the tech works The actors in AI Videos aren’t synthetically produced. They are real people that were filmed for 20 minutes saying specific phrases. Machine learning then takes those clips, learns their lip movements and replicates them later when processing the text-to-video generation. In this way, companies like Colossyan can make anyone into an AI Actor that can be used in AI Videos. The technology is advanced also by voice cloning, being able to replicate someone like a news anchor instantly for emergency broadcasts. This is the same principle as with any AI product. The systems take in large amounts of data, in this case the lip movement. It then collects correlations, patterns and other data that it can use in future generations. This is the same base process that machines use for AI Videos, automated chat systems (Siri, Alexa), language recognition, image recognition and a growing amount of other examples from modern technology. “AI programming focuses on three cognitive skills: learning, reasoning and self-correction. Learning processes. This aspect of AI programming focuses on acquiring data and creating rules for how to turn the data into actionable information. The rules, which are called algorithms, provide computing devices with step-by-step instructions for how to complete a specific task. Reasoning processes. This aspect of AI programming focuses on choosing the right algorithm to reach a desired outcome. Self-correction processes. This aspect of AI programming is designed to continually fine-tune algorithms and ensure they provide the most accurate results possible.” https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/definition/AI-Artificial-Intelligence What’s the future for AI video They say that the sky’s the limit. Artificial intelligence is moving rapidly and new advances on the field are made every day. For AI video specifically we can imagine new features being added and in coming years the video generations being even more realistic and controllable. You will be able to control the AI Actor’s emotions, hand gestures and various other movement, bringing them to life even more. And artificial intelligence what is the limit for technology in general? The answer remains the same and is limited only by the human imagination, and perhaps ethics. “So what is in store for the future? In the immediate future, AI language is looking like the next big thing. In fact, it’s already underway. I can’t remember the last time I called a company and directly spoke with a human. These days, machines are even calling me! One could imagine interacting with an expert system in a fluid conversation, or having a conversation in two different languages being translated in real time.” Asking the creators directly – are AI Videos and deepfakes safe? Colossyan replies - As with almost anything in life, the answer is – it depends. At Colossyan ethics and security are our main priority and also the brain child of the company. Colssyan was created from Defudger, a product that detects artificial media and distinguishes it from AI created content. We realize the impact our product can have with creating AI videos, that is why we use special technology to track all generated content and prohibit unintended use. We realize we carry the responsibility not only to our clients, but also to the actors we use in our videos. People are our focus and priority. It might sound funny that our software isn’t #1, since we are a tech company, but in our eyes it’s the only acceptable way to be present in this space now and also in the future. Saying that, there are people in the world that want to use technology in a malicious manner and companies that don’t have restrictions on what can be generated. Even worse, technology being developed with malicious intent in the first place. We obviously do not support products that are intended for that sort of use. When talking about malicious use, we have to keep the big picture in mind. Any industry, food, technology or retail, has ways to help people thrive and a small percent of those who want to tear others down or even worse, hurt them. You can feed someone an apple the same way you can give them poison. With our product, we hope to encourage the ethical uses of AI and promote the amazing ways we can now engage with people that was never before possible. We believe that the core of it is brilliant and we are lucky to live in a world where technology like this is now possible, when in the past people weren’t even able to imagine something like it being reality."

A pinned Tweet can lead to a site. If you want to pin Tweets, click the dropdown arrow next to your Tweet, and then select ""Pin to your profile page.""

This factor will ensure that the content gets out at the best timings and is seen by the largest of your fans. Create new or evergreen posts or landing pages via Twitter at least once every week. As long as you share content in conjunction with other content, your readers won't think they see the same content every day. This factor allows you to determine which strategy will resonate with your customers. Suppose you test using the headline of your article and an image or with a quote along with your link. You'll discover which one resonates with your readers most effectively and draws visitors to your site. You've worked hard to create the content.

Explain what your content is about, and then ask for their permission to ""Share if you agree!"" or ""Click below to learn more."" It gives your followers a particular option to follow up on your tweet. ""Click the like button"" or ""Retweet if this helped you"" These are two fundamental ways to encourage your followers to interact with your posts and to share them.

Are you sharing posts on your blog for your business? One way to draw the interest of your readers and encourage them to click and then convert it to provide important snippets of the blog's content. We're not looking to be all clickable; however, sharing the most compelling aspects of a blog article can be a fantastic way to entice someone's attention and get them to click. Conduct some research to determine the best hashtags to promote your business and integrate them regularly into the Twitter strategy. For a balanced approach to achieve a balance, use a single specific hashtag in Tweets along with links, and add at least two hashtags in the remainder of your content to create as much buzz as is. Since the tweets are targeted to a specific group of people, the likelihood of the traffic being converted increases, too. It's not a good idea to advertise any tweet at all, though. Be sure that the promoted tweets you're putting out will lead to pages that convert well and high-quality content is proven successful for your company. Begin to send more traffic via Twitter to your site, particularly good quality conversion-oriented traffic. Please make use of Twitter to increase traffic to your website and revenue and conversions using these strategies that we've described. Please keep track of shifts in your engagement with your audience and observe how it impacts the traffic on your site."
18,How to Rank Better for Local Searches on Google,computers-technology," Local SEO is of much significance for any business. Almost 50 percent of overall Google searches look for local information.

It quite resembles organic SEO but has an extra geographical aspect to it. Optimizing your site for it helps you to gain a better rank in the search engine results pages for local searches. Have you ever observed how, when you type the name of a service in your local area, the first three blocks above the maps appear distinctly? It is also called the 'Google 3-Pack.'

So how do you optimize your website to get into this coveted pack? Given below are five critical techniques you can use to boost your local SEO. As a business owner, you should waste no time implementing these techniques to your advantage. Set up and Optimize Your Google My Business For ranking locally, the first step you should take is creating a Google My Business (GMB). Do you know that it exerts the number one influence when it comes to ranking locally? After you set it up, Google showcases your services quicker in local search results. You also gain more chances of being showcased in the Google 3-Pack. Apart from the search results, the search engine also utilizes your data from GMB from Maps and Google Assistant. Setting up a GMB page isn't difficult. You might even have one. But is it complete? View the visual that signals how complete your profile is. It is best to complete it 100 percent and fill out all the necessary fields. While you are at it, pay close attention to your business address and contact information.

Respond to customer reviews. Track the GMB results. Put Your Organization Name, Contact Address, and Number in Your Website Footer It is an easy yet overlooked thing by many business owners. You can enhance your chances of being found locally by placing your company's name, phone number, and address in your website's footer. You should do this in the footer's HTML. However, keep in mind not to use an image. It's because the search engine is not able to see images and will thus not able to include you in its search results pages.

Use local keywords and location names when doing so. Add local keywords on different pages. Use them in text, header tags, and meta titles. But do not go overboard. Be mindful of the keyword density. Your content will never be shown on local search if it becomes high. Create Distinct Destination Pages Making unique destination webpages for local businesses can give you the online visibility you need. But you need to ensure that every landing page consists of unique content and relevant keywords according to the location. Duplicate content will not help you to improve your ranking. When you are making destination pages for varied locations, remember to put the location name in the URL. Final Words When you start optimizing your business website for local searches, you'll be surprised to discover a significant increase in local traffic. Start implementing the simple tips given above to improve your ranking online. Consistent efforts at optimizing for local searches is what will yield you the desired outcome."

Know the customer needs The goal of the digital marketer is to solve customer problems and deliver a superior customer experience. Digital marketers are responsible for making sure that customers are kept happy. They do this by analyzing their data and providing them with personalized solutions to their problems. A digital marketer must know their customer needs in order to provide them with the best possible experience. If they understand what exactly the customers need, they can better serve them. Maintain social engagement It's important for any company to keep its social media profiles active. But, it's even more important to maintain engagement with the right audience. Social media management services are not just for big brands anymore. Smaller companies can take advantage of these services too to better communicate with their customers and develop a brand identity in the digital world. Create personalized experience Customer experience is a major concern for many businesses. And the key to a good customer experience is personalization. Digital marketing services provide you with ways to create a personalized customer experience. They use various digital marketing tools and techniques to give your customers the personalized experience they want, as well as what they need. Create a story through your brand Most marketers and companies who want to promote their products or services launch a digital marketing campaign. A digital marketing campaign is a large-scale promotion of an organization, product, service, or idea using one or more online channels including social media, search engine optimization (SEO), e-mail marketing, and other web-based channels. Digital campaigns can also be designed as ‘gated content’ to collect email addresses from website visitors—an increasingly valuable commodity. We can create a story through our brand by telling the stories of our customers and how we solved their problems with our product. The stories should be interesting and relevant to the audience that we are trying to reach. Create content related to customer Content marketing provides a great way for brands to interact with their existing and potential customers. To achieve this, brands need to create content in a way that is engaging and resonates with the audience in order to build a community around their brand. Brands can create content related to customers’ needs, wants or problems they have in order to engage them and show that they care. It also helps the customer in decision-making by providing information about the product or service of the brand. This section discusses how digital marketing services create content for their customers. They do so by focusing on what’s best for their customers and understanding what the customer wants from them. Create Long term strategies Strategies in digital marketing services must be in place in order to make sure that a business is successful in the long term. The digital world is constantly changing and what was best for a business last year might not work this year. Digital marketing service providers need to be aware of the latest trends and stay up-to-date with all the changes that are happening in the industry. They should also pay attention to what existing customers like and dislike about their product or service, as well as take into consideration any feedback they might have for improvement. Establish relationships with influencers Influencer marketing is a form of marketing that uses social media influencers to generate a feeling of trust and familiarity with a product or service in potential customers. Influencers are people who have the power to make decisions about what they purchase and what is worth sharing with others. They can be in all shapes and sizes, from micro-influencers (a person who has up to 10,000 followers on social media) to celebrity influencers (a person who has tens of millions of followers). Conclusion The digital marketing industry is changing rapidly and companies are looking for help to keep up. Since it is impossible for one person to know every aspect of the industry, it's important to hire a company that can help you with your marketing needs. If you are looking for the best digital marketing services, Callbharat is the leading name in this field. They have gained tremendous experience in these areas over the years and they know what techniques work best."

1,How Blockchain and A.I. Will Affect Businesses in the Next 10 Years,computers-technology," Two disruptive technologies are gaining more and more prominence that will shape the course of people’s lives and culture over the next ten years: blockchain and artificial intelligence (A.I.). Both are experiencing expanded use and innovation, but not without some worries concerning how these technologies will be wielded. In a 2020 World Economic Forum report on the future of jobs, it was reported around one of ten of every business surveyed was considering making investments in either blockchain or A.I. by the year 2025. A recent Facts and Factors market research report showed the global A.I. Market size and share revenue is expected to grow from $29.86 billion in 2020 to $299.64 billion in 2026—a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35.6% annually. Likewise, the global blockchain market size is expected to grow from $3 billion in 2020 to $39.7 in 2025, making a CAGR of 67.3 percent over that time period. These two technologies are only going to increase in importance over the next ten years. So, what are blockchain and A.I.? Why do they matter? Why would savvy companies be considering an investment in either technology in their 10-year plans? These are important questions to answer. Blockchain technology The best way to think about blockchain is to think of it as a database, but the data is stored in ledger blocks that are chained together, one after the other. In blockchain’s most prominent association, Bitcoin, the database is decentralized. This means that an exact copy of the blockchain ledger appears on multiple computers, making it virtually impossible to destroy or alter. So long as over 51 percent of these blockchain files are identical, any fraud that would potentially be added to the blockchain would be resolved out of the system upon synchronization. Cryptocurrency has a shadow over blockchain, but it is not the only use for this technology. One of these uses is Smart Contracts, automated programs embedded in the blockchain able to complete information like insurance forms and real estate contracts and send copies to all parties, saving money and paper in a form that can’t be altered and therefore legally secure. One advantage of smart contracts is that they dispense of the need for middlemen to complete legally binding documents. Any place where data transfer of validation is required is a growth opportunity for blockchain. Some of the pushback on blockchain is the “anonymous” nature of the transactions since user accounts are reduced to obscured alphanumeric keys. This perceived anonymity is what makes it seem desirable by bad actors. Blockchain is not anonymous, however, since users can be tracked using unique ids given by the technology, making such transactions not only more visible, but permanently recorded for all history. Artificial intelligence (A.I.) Artificial intelligence is a broad concept that needs to be distinguished from technologies that are subsets such as machine learning and deep learning. Machine learning is projected to grow from $7.3B in 2020 to $30.6B in 2024, while deep learning led the A.I. market in 2020 with a 38% share of global revenue in 2020 The basic concept of A.I. is to create a system that can mimic human intelligence. A strong A.I. like this is still a developing technology, so most of the innovation in the next ten years will likely be in machine learning and deep learning. These technologies are used to analyze vast amounts of data to extract useful, actionable information. Today, there are deep learning systems that are employed in custom-built models to help companies detect fraud with much greater accuracy. Machine learning is also used in recommendation engines, such as those employed by Amazon and Netflix. As users watch and interact with these services, they continue to feed data into the recommendation engine, increasing the accuracy over time. Weaker forms of A.I. will also be encountered in such things as driverless cars, sophisticated video games and website bots, and voice-processed language translation. Another big push in A.I. is the automation of existing jobs. This is the biggest danger concerning the technology and why A.I. should not be ignored. The World Economic Forum report on the Future of Jobs stated that around 85 million jobs could be lost across 15 industries and 26 economies. The biggest drop will be in roles such as data entry, accounting and administrative support. The caveat here is that many of these lost jobs will be offset by increasing demand in emerging technologies such as A.I. and blockchain. The next ten years Blockchain and A.I. are two technologies that are only going to increase in importance over the next ten years. As such, companies and workers will benefit from as early an adoption as possible if they want to maintain an edge over the competition. Blockchain and A.I. are complex subjects but are easily demystified with a little effort. Any new or unfamiliar technology can seem daunting at first, but as it becomes more widely adopted it becomes more commonplace, just like any other tool to be employed. The guideposts to the future are clearly marked, and those who don’t leap ahead will be left behind."
2,How To Choose the Best Web Development Company in Egypt?,computers-technology," There are many great options in the industry in Egypt but then again, when it comes to the web development company in Egypt, it isn’t a one-size-fits-all type of situation. You need to assess your needs and do adequate research before choosing the best web development company for your brand. Also, it ideally should also be a web design company. Below are a couple of questions you have got to have the answers for before making a commitment: Quite often we receive an “I need to build a website” request and, you guessed it, our first question is typically what type of website? and what is the best web development company in Egypt? Knowing what you need is going to make the process easier for both parties. A website falls under one of the following categories: The categories Are: Non-editable brochure website, often referred to as static site, this type just informs users about the ‘who’, ‘what’ and ‘where’ of your business. Editable brochure website, practically the same but more dynamic as it requires a content management system which is a web-based tool to allow any authorized user access to edit the website at any given time. Editable, dynamic website, with more user engagement such as login areas, etc. These are typically self-managed through a content management system. eCommerce site usually integrated with a payment gateway such as PayPal or local/international banks. Web Application Category, A progressive web application, this is the most advanced type, and a great option if you need to do more than just host information about your organization or collect user contact forms you are probably looking at a web application. When a website requires lots of functionality or processes it generally falls under the web application category. For website development or application development, you are typically going to need tools that enable you to add new or update existing content on your website pages, even for adding new features to the website. A reputable web development company in Egypt is likely to provide a level of on-going support, but it is important to outline the type of support you are going to need during longer-term periods before contracting. In any case, the support plan is most likely to be tailored to your specific needs, also, something you need to discuss with the company in advance. Also, there is other criteria of choosing the best web development company in Egypt: Portfolio It goes without saying that the size and quality of a website development company’s portfolio is a key indicator of its level of credibility. A company’s portfolio is typically showcased on its website. Not just the number of clients it has served but also clients across which sectors? For example, are they specifying in a specific industry or do they do more cross-cutting work? Do they serve startups and multinational corporations alike? Are their clients reputable and known? The Answer is,, Because if they are and their website is a contributing factor then the company obviously did a great job on their website. Most website development companies in Egypt specialize in web development and web design across multiple industries and for different company/organization sizes. The Services That Company Offers As you may have concluded from subsequent sections, the web development service comprises of multiple sub-services. It is essential to familiarize yourself with the services the company offers pre-contract, during and even after the contract period so you better understand what you are entitled to as of your package. Different companies operate differently but either way, you should do good research about what a company can and cannot offer you before doing business together and assess that based on your needs and budget. The Company’s Search Appearance If the appearance of web development company in Egypt on different search engines, primarily Google, is significantly low, then that is a red flag. For one, it could mean that the company hasn’t been in the industry long enough for it to be trustworthy. For another, if the company is unable to optimize its own website for SEO, it is very unlikely to succeed in doing that for the website they are developing for your brand? So, the higher the search appearances, the better. You need a company with a skilled staff that is well able to manipulate the search engines to your benefit. Unique Design Web development goes hand in hand with web design. A good website has good UI/UX, that is user-friendly, true to your specific brand and has the right aesthetic to it. A web developer without taste is not good enough. Not just the content has to be attractive to your target audience but the layout and design as well. So, make sure to check out the website development company’s own website and their portfolio, especially if you’re looking for application development too. The main checkboxes are: The interface is user-friendly and easy to navigate Each design is unique to the specific brand it is made for No redundancy Continue Reading: https://www.techno-ways.com/2021/11/11/web-development-company-in-egypt/"
3,Your Online Activity Could Be Monitored,computers-technology," It is possible for someone to see what you are doing online due to a stubborn flaw in the Domain Name System (DNS). This system translates complex numbers into simple names. ""IP Leaking"" and ""DNS Leaking"", are persistent problems that can be difficult to eliminate at the highest levels. However, it could be avoided locally. Every device that connects to the Internet has a unique number known as an ""IP address."" Computers use these numbers to identify and find each other online. Humans, who primarily use the Internet for their daily lives, cannot remember random numbers strings. Therefore, the Domain Name System was established to store IP addresses (ones that opt-in) and to assign them a simple name (such as privadovpn.com). If you use an unsecure DNS server, as many ISPs default to, hackers and your DNS provider can see what you do online, and even keep track of it. What is an IP Leak or DNS Leak? An IP leak occurs when your computer divulges private information despite being protected by security measures. This happens most often when you use a lower-quality VPN that doesn't require your computer to use secure server. Many default servers your ISP connects with don't offer very high security and can be monitored by threat agents. PrivadoVPN is a reliable VPN that protects your privacy and prevents any detection. DNS leaks are IP leaks where your VPN does not have secure Domain Name Servers. This will allow your computer to look up the right information. You run the risk that your true IP is visible if you use the default servers. It is important that your VPN uses secure DNS to handle all web requests. How do VPNs protect YOU online? A VPN protects your privacy and increases your online security in two crucial ways. For better privacy, connecting to VPN servers will mask your IP address. This means that any personal information that is normally associated with that number are hidden behind these VPN servers. A VPN encrypts your data. This means that data is systematically encrypted before it leaves your computer. The information is then encrypted and sent through the VPN to its destination. A ""private key"" will be used to decrypt the files and make them usable only after the transfer is completed. The world's fastest computer would take 27,337,893,038,406,611,194,430,009,974,922,940,323,611,067,429,756,962,487 years to break 256-bit encryption by brute force. Another way to put it: 27337,893 trillion trillion trillion billion trillion trillion years. This encryption is the best on the planet, and it's the gold standard for online security."
4,FILE ARCHIVING at Anytime,computers-technology," File archiving didn't start with digital technology, of course. In its infancy it meant carving hieroglyphics into Egyptian limestone and etching Jia-gu wen (Oracle Bone) script into Middle Shang Dynasty turtle shells. Today, the array of formats is admittedly dizzying. We now use document scanning, ASCII and Unicode text, embedded digital signatures, automated optical backups, PDF and DWG file structures, metadata, full-text indexing, user demographics, and quite a bit more. The vast amount of information we generate, thanks to this technology, is staggering. It means developing file archiving systems to manage trillions of binary records and multiple formats. Digital data is not only amazing but efficient. Look at the alternatives. Think about the keepers of the Dead Sea Scrolls rolling sheets of papyrus into clay jars and storing those in caves at the end of each day. File Archiving: The Advantages of a Digital System. You're weighing the relative merits of paper filing against digital imaging. There's no contest. In a paper-based system, statistics indicate most documents are copied 19 times. Employees, professional or clerical, spend about 50 percent of their time looking for information but only 10 percent reading. About eight percent of all documents are lost. About three percent are misfiled. What's more, approximately 90 percent of corporate and organizational memory is on paper. Paper takes up space, burns, gets damp, and disintegrates. Look at the 1890 federal census. In 1921 the government had no archives building. That particular census sat on pine shelves outside a Commerce Department vault, for want of space. A fire broke out. Firemen poured 20 streams of water into the building. Twelve years later the charred and sodden remains were officially destroyed. The flip (digital) side of the file archiving picture shows a two-tiered system of shared documents, active and archived, retrieved in seconds by many users at the same time in different places. Duplicate electronic backups are stored in multiple facilities and maintained on an ongoing basis, meaning that there's virtually no chance of lost data. Storage space is minimal: approximately 23,000 text documents can be stored on just one low-cost CD and about seven times that on a DVD. File Archiving: The Need for Retrievable Data. The cornerstone to managing all this information is making it readily accessible as well as secure. Whatever the system of file archiving you opt for, if you can't get to the data, you've got a major problem. On a shelf right behind me, for example, I've got a Zip drive with 17 years' worth of letters from the early 19th century. This is daily correspondence, and the originals are long since lost. Yet, I can't get at them. The disk is encrypted and the encryption is hardware, not software, based. This means that there's no way to unlock the disk and the data on it without the password that wasn't written down. Otherwise, it was a neat bit of file archiving. The letters, however, might just as well have been in a courthouse that burned to the ground during Sherman's march to the sea in 1865. Accessibility is critical. When it comes down to deciding among the alternatives for a record keeping and file retrieval system, you, as a planner, need to consider both the types of records and user needs. Would you rather have a file archiving system that requires an IT expert to maintain it? Or would you rather have one that someone with only basic computer skills can handle and that's capable of sustaining a bandwidth for hundreds of users at the same time? These and many other considerations must be decided before you choose a file retrieving system."
5,What are speaker tracking and auto framing?,computers-technology," Whether it is working from home during the COVID or having business meetings with people from other countries, distance is no longer a restriction - thanks to advanced video conferencing equipment. Video conferencing cameras allow us to easily get connected and make communication more efficient. Using video conferencing cameras with AI technology, every meeting participant in the room can be seen and heard clearly. No one needs to worry about the improper framing to include either too many or too few people. This is because the AI-Powered video conferencing equipment we use has speaker tracking and auto framing functions. Video conferencing cameras can accurately capture and track the speaker in time no matter where he/she locates, which is the result of these 2 functions working together. In this article, we will explain in detail what is speaker tracking and auto framing video conference camera. What is speaker tracking? Speaker tracking means that the camera will identify the person who is currently speaking in the room, and keep focusing on him until he stops. The speaker tracking function makes the video conference smoother and every participant can see the expression and body language of the speaker clearly, just like he is talking in front of you. What is speaker tracking doing is that when the speaker stops talking, the camera will continue to focus on him for a few seconds until it captures a new speaker, and the camera will switch the focus to the new speaker. If no one speaks for a while, the camera will automatically zoom out and frame the entire team or meeting room. What is speaker tracking required to work? The beamforming microphones and cameras need to work together for optimum results. The microphone firstly detects the source of the sound and guides the camera to focus there. Then the camera will pan, tilt, and zoom physically or digitally according to the location of the sound source. No matter how far or close you are to the camera, you can have the total focus in the room when you talk. The video conference cameras we used in the past can also capture the entire conference room and all the participants, but the far-away participants will appear to be very small on the screen and can’t be seen and heard by the other side behind the screen. This is what speaker tracking with AI video functions has resolved with current technology. The situation is very common especially in medium and large conference rooms. Speaker tracking video conference cameras can solve this problem, allowing all participants to experience a smooth and cinema-level video conference improves work efficiency and reducing communication costs. If you can’t imagine how this function works based on the just text description, let me introduce a cost-effective product on the market as an example. Nexvoo N110 is an all-in-one video bar equipped with a 4K UHD camera, a 120-degree FOV, and a 6-meter pickup distance. The N110 utilizes advanced AI algorithms to achieve intelligent speaker tracking, ensuring everyone in the meeting room can be well captured and included. More delicate details and textured images make you enjoy more during the meeting. What is auto framing? Auto framing combines face recognition, a composition algorithm based on the principle of thirds, and pixel-wise super-resolution to create a portrait with the best composition from the image with the detected face. The auto framing function automatically recognizes all participants in the conference room and adjusts the camera based on the quantity and location of participants using real-time face detection and location tracking to cover every participant in the conference. For example, when you use the Nexvoo N109, participants can be detected when they enter or leave the judgment area. If you are alone in the meeting room, the auto framing function will keep the camera focusing on you, and follow you once you change your position to keep you in the center of the frame. When you move from the front of the camera to another corner of the meeting room, the camera will change the focal length to capture you in the corner and frame you in the center of the screen. If a new participant joins, the camera will zoom out to include the new participant. This will avoid moving the camera which is already all set just to make the view more complete with all participants. The auto-framing function increases the level of auto-focus. When you are in a video conference, you will be free from worrying about adjusting camera angles and focusing on communication. The auto framing video conference equipment function can be applied to meeting rooms of various sizes. In medium and large conference rooms, when the number of participants reaches a certain level, the auto framing function will increase its recognition range to capture more participants. You can't force all participants to be completely fixed in one position and keep a fixed distance from the camera, so you need the auto framing function of a  speaker tracking video conference equipment to save you from this embarrassing situation. In this case, the camera needs to have a longer focal length and a wider wide-angle to frame the participants in all positions in the field of view as much as possible. For example, Nexvoo N120, a dual-cam video bar with a 6-meter long focal length and a 120-degree FOV can make video conferences in medium or large conference rooms go smoothly. Speaker tracking and auto framing work together to achieve intelligent tracking Although the speaker tracking and the auto framing functions are in different principles, they are not completely independent and can work collaboratively. Auto framing function enables an instant capture of people in the conference room and detects their real-time location, and based on this, the speaker tracking function can identify the speaker in real-time and enlarge the frame and center the speaker in the view. Just like Nexvoo N110 and N120, both have speaker tracking and auto framing. The N120 is equipped with dual cameras, a long focal length, and an ultra-wide FOV. It can also automatically optimize the brightness according to the light conditions, effectively avoiding the meeting room from being too dark. The negative effect brought about allows the detailed actions of all participants in the conference room to be more clearly seen by the other party."
6,"Why Facebook changed its name to Meta, according to a leading tech expert",computers-technology," Yesterday’s announcement that Facebook is changing its name to Meta might come as a surprise to many people. In this article, Alexa Greaves, CEO at AAG-IT.com provides an overview of the change, including why it happened and what it means for most people. Firstly, it’s worth clarifying that before this week ‘Facebook’ was really the name for two things: ‘Facebook’, the social media platform ‘Facebook Inc.’, the parent company which owns Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and more. The name change refers to the parent company, which will now be known as ‘Meta’. Why has Facebook changed its name? There are many reasons Meta has likely chosen to make this change now. The cynical view is that this is part of a PR move to distance the parent company from the recent issues faced by ‘Facebook’ the social media platform. That’s probably only a small part of it. The parent company owns dozens of smaller entities. Most famously Instagram and Whatsapp, but also many technologies that help Meta to improve data processing and provide ground-breaking virtual reality and augmented reality services. The name change is unlikely to be a spur-of-the-moment decision or a knee-jerk reaction to some bad press. More likely it’s a way of making the parent company a distinct entity, free from the associations with the social media platform. It gives a clearer picture in the eyes of the general public (and investors) that Facebook is just one part of Meta’s arsenal. It will make any future acquisitions in the tech space feel much more natural and sensible. This mirrors the decision by ‘Google’ to rebrand as ‘Alphabet’, separating the parent company from the public image of the search engine. What does it mean for me? For the vast majority of people, the name change doesn’t mean anything. Facebook the social media platform is still called Facebook. It’s just owned by a company with a different name. Why Meta? Meta is a very neat way of explaining how the parent company sees itself. Many of the company’s recent acquisitions have been in the virtual/augmented reality space. The highest-profile purchase in recent years was Oculus, the VR gaming equipment. ‘Meta’ is most commonly used as a way of indicating something that ‘sits above’ something else. For example, ‘Metascience’ would be scientific research into scientific research. ‘Metanews’ is news about the news. ‘Metapolitics’ is the politics of politics. In this way, Meta is reflecting that the parent company sits at a higher level than its assets. A company that owns and runs companies. However, ‘meta’ also likely refers to the additional layer of experience which is provided by virtual and augmented reality technology. Mark Zuckerberg has suggested that this move is the first step towards his company creating a ‘Metaverse’ (where users can attend virtual concerts, virtual meetings, and more). How successful ‘Meta’ will be in creating a ‘Metaverse’ will depend on adoption. Virtual reality is still a fringe technology, despite growing popularity. However, they are the best-placed company in the world to achieve the ambitious task."
7,Digital Transformation Vs Digitalization,computers-technology," Using digital solutions to transform your business. Every enterprise is going through a massive digital transformation. In the past few years, the term digital transformation has taken over the entire world. Every company is trying to make its mark in the digital space using technologies and solutions to fulfill the needs of its customers, partners, and suppliers.Enterprises also must reimagine their existing business model to reap digital benefits. Customer expectation is changing rapidly due to the availability of a vast amount of information and dynamic demands. There is a value gap created between what the customers want and what the enterprises can fulfill.Companies must work hard to close this value gap or it creates risk for the entire business. The born-digital players are already disrupting the traditional business approach. Every enterprise must start to think like them to stay relevant or competitive. If you look at the reason behind the underlying success of these born-digital players, they can imagine their business on a platform business model.A platform business model is a radical shift from the traditional pipe business model where the operation was linear. Here the platform business engages the larger ecosystem of the customer, partners, and suppliers and can leverage the underlying value of data through digital technologies.The old ways are coming to an end and, it is paving the way to the new ways of doing business. Traditional enterprises must start to think like technology companies. Part of that has to be the imagination of the business by itself. It needs some critical questions to be answered such as: What changes and improvements in the business process must be done? How can value be created with help of the ecosystem by involving customers, suppliers, and partners? What are the current technology gaps that need to be addressed to accelerate the digital processes? Companies must be able to distinguish between digitalization and digital transformation. The two terms are often used interchangeably but they carry a different meaning when comes to shaping your digital enterprise.Digitalization is a silo approach of using digital technologies to increase productivity and efficiency of the business process without changing the existing one. While digital transformation is changing the business completely using digitalization.At Sonata, we help customers reimagine their business with the help of Platformation™ and help them in their digital transformation journey.

9,The necessity of an ERP System within Educational Institutions,computers-technology," The evolution of modern technology has drastically shaped our day to day lives, making us unable to function without it. This shift can be seen everywhere—from offices, hospitals and now even schools. Progressive institutions have begun to ditch physical books in exchange for tablets, and traditional classroom whiteboards are regularly being replaced by electronic smartboards. With the current technological climate, it’s essential that educational institutions are able to keep up with the fast-paced technological advancements both within the front office and the back office. Though the adaptation of modern technology is more visible within the front office (such as the use of tablets and smartboards), back office advancements have been stagnant in comparison. However, advancing the back office is as crucial if not more for the development of the educational institution. This article will elaborate on the importance of ERP Systems within educational institutions for the development of schools. What is an ERP and what does it do? To understand how an ERP System can assist an organization requires one to understand what an ERP system is. In simple terms, an ERP system, which stands for Enterprise Resource Planning, is a software system that manages different aspects of an organization. For example, a school-based ERP system will include basic company modules such as Human Resources, Accounting, Student Management and Inventory Management. However, different ERP systems will provide different, unique features. For example, certain School ERP systems provide features such as canteen booking, student management and online fee payments. The ERP system will automate most school-related activities, such that there will be no necessity for the use of traditional files to store documents, and the back office of schools will essentially become paper free. All the information will be easily stored and can be easily retrieved within the system. Why is it important and how is it helpful for educational institutions? The automation of activities such as administration, attendance, recruitment and payroll will ease employees from performing the repetitive and mundane tasks and will allow them to focus on more important aspects that machines cannot replicate. As a result, teachers will be able to pay more attention to students, focus on teaching, and increase overall efficiency within the school. In addition, since all school related information is stored within the system, the school management can oversee and supervise students and teachers more easily as the system will provide a birds eye view of tasks and performances. The system will automatically update information and parents can also access their children’s performance and grades through the portal designed for them. Conclusion In conclusion, ERP systems are essential for developing and modernizing educational institutions. It allows greater efficiency and organization within the school, as it stores all school related information as well as automating school related activities. I highly recommend all educational institutions to invest in an ERP System as it will improve overall performance and allow schools to be more technologically advanced and up to date."
10,How To Do Reverse Image Search On Google,computers-technology," Search is pretty much standardized! If you wanted information on the cutest dogs on the planet, all you had to do is key in your search term “top 10 cutest most adorable most amazingly gorgeous puppies ever” and the search engine will return the best results it finds, right? Now, what if in a different scenario, you found the picture of a really cute dog you admired so much? And let's say you didn't know anything about it and so you wanted to find some information on the puppy or even find more of its photos. How would you search for the information? Well, that's where Image Search comes in handy. What Is Reverse Image Search & How Does It Work? In plain speak, a similar image search is a kind of online search in which you upload an image (instead of entering a text-based or voice-based keyword) to find information based on the query. With Google Images you can quickly discover visually similar images from around the web and obtain relative information about a photo including objects or places in it, and its metadata like the name of the object. In technical speak, reverse picture search works by using a query technique called content-based image retrieval (CBIR) — also known as query by image content (QBIC) and content-based visual information retrieval (CBVIR) — to apply computer vision in retrieving digital images from the Internet based on mathematical models. This is the case with Google’s search by image. To retrieve the information, the sample image is what formulates a search query, thereby removing the need for the user to guess keywords. Benefits Of Using A Photo Search Engine You can do many wonderful things with reverse image photo lookup, but here are some: Learn More About the Object of an Image Remember our cute puppy? Through reverse image lookup, we finally found that the puppy is the breed called Shiba Inu, which is the smallest of the six original and distinct spitz breeds of dog native to Japan. We also discovered that that cute little thing is pretty agile that it can cope very well even with mountainous terrain. Find Visually Similar Images Thinking you need almost the same image but with different styles? Google Reverse image search meta allows you to discover visually similar or related images to the sample one. Find the Original Sources of Images If you want to find an image source to give the proper credit to the owner of the image, but had difficulty in discovering who the original creator is then the image source finder tool is the best solution to your query. Find Plagiarized Photos Photo pilferers may think they are smart, but google image search upload makes you smarter! If you have lots of original photos and want to know if someone is using them without your permission or giving any credits, then a google reverse image tool is your new pal. You'll even be able to see how many other pages have your image. Create Backlink Opportunities Don't just use a picture finder tool to find people who are using your photos without attributing credits, ask them to mention you as the author and link back to your page. Great for SEO! Identify People, Places, and Products Got photos of people, places, or products you don't know? No worries! Just upload them and reverse photo search will help identify those for you as long as there are identical images or information online. Discover More Versions of a Particular Image Maybe your current version of an image is not getting the job done. With reverse image lookup, you can get more versions of a particular image, whether that means a different size, format, or one that's not as blurry. Detect Fake Accounts Thinking you're too cute and someone might be using your photo on a fake social media account? Let reverse picture lookup help keep your personal reputation clean and If you think you are being the victim of catfishing and someone else is using a fake identity on social media account. Performing a reverse scammer pictures search with a reverse photo lookup tool may reveal the real person.

11,Why Casino Bonuses Are Not Always A Good Deal,computers-technology," The number of online casinos available on the web is already impressive, and it continues to grow literally each month. New and old web gambling sites compete with each other, trying to attract customers from other platforms, and entice them to sign up with their platform instead. And the most effective way to do that is to offer a juicy bonus. In fact, the only difference between many similar online casinos may be bonuses offered. All other aspects, like games and software providers, banking options, and even licenses - can be almost the same, and yet, a bigger bonus will attract more customers to the gambling venue offering it. However, is a bigger bonus really a better deal in the long term? Well, not really. To understand why huge bonuses are not always good for the punter, what best casino bonuses are actually good, and how to tell between them, it is necessary to be aware of how gambling venue bonuses generally work. How Casino Bonuses Work First and foremost, keep in mind that no online gambling venue will offer the punter free money - or, in other words, no real online gambling venue that works according to a fair business model. Fraudulent casinos that have no intention of paying you out anything, can offer pie in the sky as large as the moon. Fair online casinos simply can’t afford such a thing - giving away free cash to each and every customer. The first rule of any (fair) online casino’s bonus is that the bonus must be cost-effective. That is, the money that the punter can potentially win by wagering the bonus should be smaller than the money wagered by this punter, or by most players in general, in case some player turns out to be particularly lucky. This is how it works, step by step - the customer signs up and takes the bonus. If this is a No Deposit bonus, the customer does not have to make a real money deposit in order to make bets and win real cash. Enticing? You bet! But the story does not end here. The player has to meet the wagering requirements first - that is, the gambling venue sets the number of times the amount of the bonus has to be wagered before the player is even able to request withdrawal of any funds they win. We will talk about this aspect below. Now, talking about No Deposit bonuses, many casinos still require that the player make a deposit of their funds before the function of withdrawal will be unlocked for them. If we are talking about Deposit bonuses, the promotion is awarded after the customer deposits some real cash to the gambling venue. They get some cash, or Free Spins for slots pitch and toss, or a combination of both, and can start playing for real money. And this is where good news ends, and bad news starts. Games Available If you read Terms and Conditions, you will find out that different games contribute differently to bonus wagering, while some pitch and toss are not allowed with the bonus. In a healthy person’s language it means if you punt on slots, for example, your wagers will be counted towards meeting the playthrough requirements for the bonus; if you punt on scratch cards, the wagerd will not be counted. There is no particular technical reason for the gambling venue to do so; this is done simply to make meeting the wagering requirements harder. Also, jackpot titles and Live Dealer software are not allowed for real money punt with bonus money. Wagering Requirements The wagering requirements are easy to understand - this is a fixed number of times the player has to wager the amount of the bonus received, in order to be able to withdraw their winnings, if any. If the bonus was $10, and the wagering requirements are x30, the total sum that should be wagered is $300. Again, there is no particular technical reason to arrange things like that. These are just the rules. Moreover, the gambling venue does everything to make the punter lose more than win - the maximum bets are limited, so you can’t bet $100 three times, to decrease the risks. In most cases, the maximum bet is around $5. Unless the playthrough requirements are met, withdrawal is impossible. Sometimes, the customer has to make another deposit to continue betting, in order to eventually unlock the withdrawal function. One can ask the Customer Support to remove the bonus, but the winnings will also be removed with it. So, the wagering requirements are a real pitfall. Withdrawal Limits If you are lucky enough to meet the playthrough requirements and still have winnings on your balance that can be cashed out - congrats, there are more limitations on your way! All casinos have withdrawal limitations caused by transaction sizes allowed in different banking channels. However, with the bonuses, limitation is just there - for example, no more than $100, or no more than x5 the initial deposit, and the rest of the winnings will be removed upon withdrawal request. Conclusion These are the rules that work for the majority of online casino bonuses; for other bonuses, even harsher Terms and Conditions are applied. So, before you are seduced by any promotion, sit down and count whether it is really attractive. More often than not, it is better to proceed without any bonuses at all."
12,The Secrets Of An Effective Digital Marketing Campaign,computers-technology," Set and understand the objective and the goal Remember that the purpose of any marketing campaign is to achieve a specific goal or result. In that sense, it is always essentially a means to an end. As simple as it sounds, many people fail to clarify the question: ""What exactly is the end goal of the proposed digital marketing campaign?"" Typically, the ultimate end goal is increased revenue through increased sales. But a digital marketing campaign may be implemented for other 'shorter term' purposes - to increase product branding and market acceptance, for example, or to simply drive more traffic to a target website. The digital marketing campaign is your ship's rudder, and clearly understanding the objective will then establish the tone and style for the overall campaign. Who exactly is your market? With the overall objective or end goal of the proposed marketing campaign now clear in everyone's minds, the next logical question becomes: ""Who exactly is the marketing campaign targeting?"" Surprisingly many campaigns fail to reap results because this basic factor is ill-considered, or in some cases completely unknown! The target audience - their age bracket, socio-economic standing and demographics ultimately sets the tone for your marketing ""style"" - importantly the type of language and media used in the campaign. Knowing the target market will also directly determine where exactly you will place your on-line marketing efforts. How to ascertain just who your target market is For many new business start-ups, the early digital marketing campaigns serve to test the waters, so to speak, and gain a better understanding of just who the target market is. A range of on-line tools can be employed to achieve this end: • the use of advertising (either free or paid) on social media platforms casts the net widely. • Blogging articles and posts can establish branding and business tone. • Podcasts and/or multimedia posts are dynamic and potentially hold greater interest. • Email campaigns can provide wide market coverage. • Free giveaways can be used in the start-up stage in return for customer information, such as age, location, interests. Track the metrics and measure performance The ability to analyze marketing metrics becomes incredibly important. A good suite of web analytics tools can further assist in honing more concentrated future campaigns. Monitoring progress and having the capability to subsequently adjust or fine tune digital strategy is a further tool to the success of a campaign. In summary The importance of an effective digital marketing campaign cannot be underestimated when considering on-line business success. Regardless of campaign scale or reach, follow these basic fundamentals to build a highly effective digital marketing program."
13,India .vs. USA,computers-technology," By: Namoh India and the United States of America India and the USA are two different and similar countries in a lot of ways. It is easier to identify the differences than identifying the similarities. India and the USA are different and similar in their culture, government, and the way they celebrate their special events like Christmas and Diwali. The Government Both India and the USA were colonized countries. In fact, they were both colonized by the British. Just like the Indian government’s political figures are for the people, USA political figures are only for the people and their care. Both governments care about their people and their society. They wouldn’t want to betray their own country. The US government promotes peace and compassion for their country. Similarly, the Indian government does not like violence and tries to keep its country safe. Both the Indian government and the US government think about the future, well-being, and development of their country. Last but not the least, both countries hire qualified officials and well-selected leaders to make the country better. Although India and the USA were colonized by the British, the USA got freedom before India. The USA got its independence on the 4th of July 1776, while India got its independence on the 15th of August 1947. On one hand, there are two major parties in India, the INC (Indian National Congress) and the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party), there are other hundreds of regional parties. However, in the US, there are only two major parties which are: the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. In India, the elected head of the government is the Prime Minister, but in the US, the head of the government is the president. The USA has a presidential form of government, whereas there is a parliamentary form of government in India. In India, there is only one constitution for the whole country, meanwhile, in the US, the constitution and the federal system depend on the state to state. The Culture The cultures in both countries are the same and also different. First of all, there is a lot of celebration at both festivals. There is also a lot of respect given to the elders. Both countries have a specific tradition and rituals that is mandatory for them to follow. Things have to go according to their plan. Both countries are competitive regarding their culture. Most importantly, both countries give value and respect to their culture. On one hand, the Indian culture is very unique and has its values and special importance. On the other hand, the American culture is a mix of other cultures which does not make it unique enough. India is still a developing country. It still needs improvements. On the contrary, the USA is already a well-developed country. The Indian culture is very old, unlike the American culture which is just a modern culture. In the Indian culture, the family is very oriented to each other, whereas the family in the American culture is more individually oriented. Finally, in the Indian culture, a person may give up his or her wishes and happiness for the sake of the family, but this trend is not visible at all in the American Culture. The festivals The main festivals in India and the USA, which are Diwali and Christmas, differ and are similar to each other. Starting with the similarities, in both festivals, there is a big feast prepared. A variety of main courses and desserts are made. In both festivals, families come together and ding with each other. Children get excited at both festivals as they are given presents at both festivals. Like in India, the whole USA celebrates these special festivals. Fireworks are used to celebrate Diwali like at Christmas. There are different decoration items used to decorate the house in both cases.  On Diwali, there are special candles used. These special candles are called “DIYAS.” They are used to decorate the house. At Christmas, people decorate the Christmas tree and put it in their houses. The Christmas trees are usually big and lightened up. Rituals are very different in both festivals. On Diwali, it is not allowed to eat meat and or drink alcohol. Meanwhile, at Christmas, it is fine to drink wine and meat. Diwali falls on different dates. It varies from year to year. It is different at Christmas where there is a fixed date. Christmas falls on 25th December every single year. These are the major differences between the USA and India. According to my, both countries is well civilized and good. They equally vary in their similarities and differences. By: Namoh"

15,Blockchain for non-DeFi products,computers-technology," Blockchain technology appeared on the market in 2009 in the form of the first cryptocurrency, bitcoin, and since then has almost completely developed in the form of various kinds of DeFi solutions. Even though decentralized platforms based on a distributed ledger have existed for twelve years, only recently products based on them have begun to appear in other areas, including trade, data storage, logistics, games, medicine, etc. Our article is devoted to such non-financial blockchain-based applications, how they differ from the usual centralized solutions, and the benefits they can bring to users. What is blockchain today? There are 5th generation platforms on the market now, for example, Relcitum PRO. The developers managed to solve several problems typical for systems based on a distributed ledger, including increased power consumption, low bandwidth, complex interface, problems with scale, the need to buy powerful machines for mining, etc. All these are the things of the past. At the same time, the use of smart contracts and distributed applications made it possible to significantly expand the functionality and introduce products for the real sector of the economy. What are these products? Let's take a look. A brief review of blockchain-based products As an example, we can consider the products of the already mentioned Relictum PRO platform: Distributed data storage. The files are not stored on a single server, as it is usually done, but on storage devices of several users in an encrypted and divided form. This arrangement allows you to get super protected and secured storage at the lowest cost. Secret chat. The impossibility of blocking and restricting access to the system, plus complete anonymity and confidentiality, make it possible to state that chat based on a decentralized platform is the best possible solution in terms of security. NFT marketplace. The ability to organize all stages of NFT token trading on a single platform, including the creation of the token itself and its storage, the organization of the transfer of ownership rights, and all this in an automated mode makes this product indispensable for all parties, both buyers and sellers. Lottery and casino. 100% transparency and honesty of the drawing process (thanks to the distributed ledger), ease and speed of withdrawal of funds and the ability to earn on bonuses from invited friends – these features distinguish decentralized gambling from any centralized online game. In addition to the systems described above, there are also solutions on the market for: Logistics. A single blockchain can perfectly describe the movement of goods along logistics routes with the ability to instantly track the position and protect against counterfeiting/fraud. Medicine. Transferring a patient's record to a decentralized storage facility will provide the following advantages: reliable protection of personal data, the ability to access them at any time from anywhere, and protection from loss or accidental damage. A patient will be able to use his ""single card"" without any problems in any institution, anywhere around the world. Voting process. The ability to combine identification systems and the transparency of the voting process with complete anonymity is an ideal combination for an online voting system, and this has already been proven by the experience of some countries, for example, Estonia. Accounting for land resources. Land plots, like any other products, are bought and sold, and the use of a distributed ledger will make the process of registering and transferring property rights simple, fast, reliable, and protected from fraud. Development prospects The application examples described above are far from a complete list of possible applications of blockchain technology. If we take into account the advantages of a distributed system, including reliable protection, confidentiality, speed, and uninterrupted access, the ability to implement everything in a single platform, along with a payment system with a minimum commission of 0% (like in the Relictum PRO ecosystem), we can say that very soon blockchain solutions will become real competitors for typical centralized solutions on a global scale."
16,Omni-Channel Loyalty Programs: A Strategic Imperative for Seamless CX,computers-technology," The Traditional Approach Traditional loyalty programs prefer to reward spending rather than for engagement. They are uni-channel and card-based in which customers receive tangible benefits, such as a discount or a free product. With this approach, traditional loyalty programs appear as cheap currency to the customer. These benefits are only available to return customers who entered the store and made a purchase. They rarely reward behaviours that lead them to the store. Once customers have their wallets full of different loyalty cards, the loyalty effect nullifies. The Omni-Channel Approach Omni-channel loyalty combines technology and innovative customer experiences to deliver relevant offers at the right time, bringing customers back to the brand regardless of where, when, or how they shop. “A good customer experience can be defined as seamless and a rewarding interaction with a brand at every touchpoint. It goes beyond one-dimensional discounts and instead offers deeply personal and authentic customer experiences that yield stronger engagement and higher spend among customers,” says the technology mega-corp Oracle in their research focussing on Omni-channel Loyalty. Omni-channel loyalty maximizes cross-channel loyalty through real-time campaigns. It integrates all customer transactions and engagements into a singular, unified brand experience. Redesigning the entirety of an experience rather than only maximizing their point value is the key to create a truly seamless customer experience with brand loyalty at the core. ""According to McKinsey, 75% of shoppers tried a new retailer, brand, or behavior during the pandemic with up to 83% expecting to continue those new traits post-pandemic. This means loyalty is up for grabs and retention now becomes mission critical."" How to design an Omni-channel Loyalty strategy? Be Where Your Customers Are When your loyal customers are looking for your product or service, you should know where they are most likely to begin their search. Customers expect to be addressed on their platform of choice. Remember they may not have the other channels set up or know how to use them, so it is always a good idea to engage them where they are. Digitize your loyalty program so you can extend promotions across websites, mobile, and social media, allowing customers to transact and interact with your brand. Customers expect to contact your company in whatever way is most convenient to them. Find out how Canada’s most recognized loyalty program increased member reward redemptions by 30% by launching a modernized website and focusing on user experience. Personalize interactions using Data Insights from a Gartner survey show that brands risk losing 38% of customers because of poor marketing personalization efforts. Use the customer data collected across all channels to identify trends, behaviours, preferences, and segments to personalize communications, experiences, and promotions for your loyal customers. Rewarding prospects with incentives for their information, such as first name, birthday, preferred communication channel, phone number, and list of products they’re interested in is a good approach to collect relevant data on new prospects. Check out how a perks-based loyalty program revamped its digital platforms to handle a larger volume of users, optimize their experience resulting in 2x request speed, and 6 seconds startup reduction. Reward Social Engagement With a large number of social media users, earning reward points for social engagement will give customers the impression that reaching a certain number of rewards points is achievable. These attainable milestones will increase their likelihood of participating in your program. Connect with and reward customers for social interactions. Expand loyalty beyond transactions and focus on an expansive emotional engagement. Engage social influencers as your brand ambassadors to further your reach and engagement. A Strategic Imperative Developing an omni-channel loyalty program is not an option, but a strategic imperative. As many brands adapt to the omni-channel way, traditional loyalty programs need to evolve to meet ever-rising customer expectations. Successful omni-channel loyalty programs find opportunities to reward customers at multiple touchpoints across every channel through seamless integration. They deliver convenience, relevance, and value for customers across all channels. An omni-channel strategy helps retailers collate data and form a holistic view of their loyal customers, enabling them to build meaningful relationships, improve engagement, and enhance satisfaction.

This will give your website authority. It shows search engines that you are trustworthy and your content is useful for the audience. One of the most important ranking factors when it comes to SEO is authority. If your website is not trusted by other websites, then it’s not trusted by search engines.

1,5 Best Practices and 1 Tool for Mitigating Open-Source Vulnerabilities,computers-technology," ""Then again, my case was all about the misappropriation of source code because I wanted to become the best hacker in the world and I enjoyed beating the security mechanisms.""   – Kevin Mitnick, cybersecurity consultant, author, keynote speaker Open-source software originated over 30 years ago, roughly the same time the world wide web became mainstream. Since then, technology has advanced from cell phones to cloud computing to emerging technologies such as AI and the IoT – all have adopted clear security standards. Yet, open-source software (OSS) remains an outlier because of its “open,” accessible nature. The good news is, open-source code is open for people and businesses to use, distribute, and modify. The bad news is hackers are people too, whose motives are not for the betterment of code, who introduce open-source mayhem. Because of their source code, all IT applications have security vulnerabilities. So, it’s imperative to recognize which applications are open source or have open-source components. Open-Source Code Is Open to Risk You’ve probably heard of open-source front-end programs or languages such as Mozilla Firefox, GIMP, Python, PHP,  Apache Spark, and various CRM applications like Odoo, Hubspot, or ConcourseSuite. But Wireshark, TCPflow, Ngrep, and other network protocol and packet analyzers, back-end tools employed to troubleshoot security anomalies, are also open-source applications. Shopworn tools such as these often fall off the security radar. Many organizations fail to consider the prevalence of open-source code and components. Over 95 percent of all applications in the global market contain open-source code, and 90 percent of IT leaders rely on enterprise open source for network support, “infrastructure modernization, application development, and digital transformation.” Although most leaders believe enterprise open source is as secure as proprietary software, threats persist. Over 85 percent of applications contain at least one vulnerability. More alarming, WordPress, Wikipedia, and other common PHP-based applications are the most frequent to have “very high severity flaws.” Some developers borrow non-commercial open-source code and often get more than they bargained for – security flaws and all. Such folly can be detrimental and costly in a world where more than 80 percent of cyberattacks occur at the application layer. If you’re part of the five percent of developers who don’t use open-source code, you’re already ahead of the game. Why? Open-source software vulnerabilities can place your organization and its stakeholders at risk of downtime and loss of sensitive information, impacting revenue, reputation, and rate of progression. When exploited, open-source code can expose trade secrets and personally identifiable information of both clientele and employees, as was the case with the 2017 Equifax breach, which compromised the personal data of nearly 150 million consumers. Failure to provide “reasonable” network security cost Equifax $425 million in federal fines and lawsuits. CIA – Three Words to Sum Up Your Open-Source Security Goals Data confidentiality, integrity, and availability, popularly referred to as CIA, are the cornerstones of all information system security initiatives. Fundamental to security policy, CIA aim to protect intellectual property, ensure business continuity, provide employee access to company resources, and deliver accurate, reliable, and reachable data. When left unpatched, unchecked, or, in Equifax’s case, outdated, open-source software can compromise data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. 5 Best Practices to Secure Your Organization, Data, and Stakeholders By its very nature, open-source software will have programming loopholes and backdoors, making it easy for hackers to misappropriate source code, especially since security vulnerabilities are listed on the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and other public forums. While disclosing code and its security vulnerabilities helps developers fix bugs and create patches, it does not reveal all potential security threats. However, organizations can stay informed and follow simple protocols, policies, and best practices to avert all known threats. Implement secure software analysis tools to identify, track, and monitor open-source threats and vulnerabilities across your environment and generate critical alerts. Make intruder penetration, system compromise, and malicious activity difficult. Create a Q&A policy to prohibit the copying and pasting of code snippets from open-source repositories into internal components without first auditing the snippets for vulnerabilities. Develop contingency plans, continually update and test security policies for flaws, and be prepared with forensics to investigate the aftermath of a security breach. Discover and map all open-source software to known vulnerabilities, work with Q&A, and provide ongoing education for developers on internal policy and external security risks. Track the open-source software and components for potential intellectual property infringement. Educate developers, legal advisors, and Q&A on open-source license compliance to avoid litigation and the compromise of intellectual property.

4,How Should You Optimize Images for Website?,computers-technology," When posting images on websites, two things are of utmost importance – image quality and website requirements. The balance between them dictates website image optimization. This type of image would load in websites very fast, not keeping you waiting at all. According to studies, many people leave entire sites just because the image took a second too long to load. It is also because the image dimensions do not match the website, resulting in weirdly cropped or stretched images. In addition, low-quality images can negatively hurt the company and site as you can lose sales and views. Correct dimensions for each website, load times, and image quality are essential to keep the viewer on your site. Good images catch the viewer's attention immediately; low-quality images would make people leave your site. Optimize website images for your site to make your sales and views grow and decrease bounce rates. Luckily, retouching services know how to make images look their best and load their fastest on your website to give your viewers a great impression. Let's see how they do it. Things We Will Cover In this article, things that are crucial for optimizing images for the web will be discussed. Depending on the website, photos would be viewed differently and have different criteria for processing it. We would go through the following: Image Format Image Size Image Dimensions Image Quality With all of that being said, let's get started! Image Format One of the core aspects of website image optimization is the format of the image. On the web, the most popular image formats are JPEG, PNG, and GIF. However, some formats are better than others under specific circumstances. •	JPEGs are the de-facto for most of the internet's photos. It's like the image standard for the web. This is because of its excellent compression capabilities (which results in compressed file sizes) while retaining decent picture quality. •	PNGs are higher quality than JPEGs but cannot be compressed as much as JPEGs. Thus, the file size is larger. The PNG-24 file format is much larger than the PNG-8 format. Cannot retain colors as well as JPEGs under severe compression. •	GIF images are often used to show animations. Unfortunately, GIFs don't show colors and PNGs or JPEGs, so it is only suitable for producing simple images with few colors. Image formats are essential to do their own thing. For example, using JPEGs for logos is a big no-no because of the white background that they would leave. On the other hand, PNGs have transparency, so logos go best with this format. GIFs also have their place in showing animations. Similarly, JPEGs are used to load picture content fast, which can be a major convenience for customers, especially on e-commerce platforms. However, a second too late, and you may just have lost a sale. The retouching service professionals know what image formats you need to optimize website images depending on how and where you want to use them. Image Size Now that we know about the file types and their differences, it should come as no surprise that lowering its size – a.k.a. compression – will make it quicker to load. But how small should you go? Making the image too small makes the colors all weird. You don't want that for your site because it will scream low quality. Some formats handle compression better than others, like JPEGs. Even if you shrink a JPEG image to, let's say, 25 KB, it would still retain some quality compared to PNGs and GIFs. Using images with mangled colors will undoubtedly make people not want to visit your website a second time. If you sell products online, what will people think about your company if you upload unedited images? They may also get the wrong idea about your products. Optimizing website image size is crucial because finding the delicate balance between quality and size is what photo editing experts know the best. Image Dimensions In layman's terms, the resolution is basically how sharp and detailed the image looks in general. The aspect ratio of pixels makes the image dimensions, as the length and width form its composition. The ratio of the length and width is the aspect ratio. These two are essential to optimize website images for the end-user to give the best experience. Pictures with high resolutions will appear sharp and detailed even when you zoom in, compared to lower resolution pictures. Most of you may have already figured it out – higher resolution equals a bigger file size. A bigger image file will take longer to load and can likely tarnish your site's reputation if you carelessly put the highest resolution image. Also, many websites have specific resolution requirements. For example, Amazon’s highest resolution cap is 10,000px and lowest is 500px. A 10,000px resolution image will have an extreme level of detail. Facebook's cover photo resolution cap is 640 x 480 pixels. Aspect ratio is the relationship between an image's width and height. It is often denoted in ratios following the size of each size. For example, if the image is a square, the ratio is 1:1. If the image is twice as wide as its height, the ratio would be 2:1. Many websites denote aspect ratios by its resolution, as in 1920 x 1080 pixels for a 16:9 aspect ratio. This is especially important in places where a specific size of the image needs to be placed. Images that are accurately produced and placed on websites look excellent and appealing. The images would look like they naturally belong on the website, making viewers want to consume the website's contents longer. For example, Amazon prefers square 1:1 images, whereas a Facebook cover photo's aspect ratio would be 16:9. This is complicated stuff, as we can see. However, having a reliable retouching service to optimize website images is the easy way out. Image Quality Technicalities aside, let's talk about image quality. Having good quality photographs is the most important thing – the sizing, formatting, and other things can come after the best shot has been picked for processing. Good photography is well appreciated, but that alone is not enough. Many things in photography need to be accounted for. Luckily some photographers are capable enough to take the right shots. However, what comes after photography is post-processing. This is where you should look for professional photo retouching services to get the job done. As we all know, retouching services provide outstanding quality photos in bulk and get done with their job very fast at affordable prices. On websites and many places, vectors work better. These are primarily used to make illustrations and drawings to make your site look more attractive. You have most likely noticed many different kinds of illustrative and stylistic drawings on sites.

5,"How to get house number, street, postcode from a free-form address string",computers-technology," If you have a service related to maps and addresses, parsing and standardizing become necessary for development. There are many difficulties in this process, so as ways of overcoming them. In this article, you’ll find the basics of standardization methods and a bit of detailed advice on choosing the right one. When clients of your website enter their address, it will probably be presented as a stroke. To check if the address is correct and exists, this stroke must be divided into components. Also, all entered addresses must look the same. Different methods for proceeding with this operation are called parsing addresses from strings and standardizing them. The main problem is a human factor. People rarely enter their addresses the same way, and programs sometimes make it look like an unreadable combination with many classes. Another difficulty is in many variants of addresses. Many countries have standards and many abbreviations meaning the same (does ‘St’ mean ‘Street’ or ‘Saint’?). To help you solve this task, we collected and analyzed ways of how to process addresses. Here is a list of popular technologies below. They are listed from the most primitive to the most complicated and versatile ones. Before you’ve read that, dealing with addresses with regular expressions is not effective. Still, it can be useful in some situations. For this method, you need a pattern with meta-symbols and symbols. For example, a stroke looking like ""NAME_FOR_CITY XX, NAME_FOR_STREET YY"", and addresses in this format can be parsed like city:  ""NAME_FOR_CITY"",  postcode: ""XX"", street: ""NAME_FOR_STREET"", house number: ""YY"". Just select the regexp and find the preferable expression. Compiling this method: the most effective technology for strictly structured strings, when standardizing is not required; no need to use external libraries or address parsing APIs; completely ineffective with freeform addresses; may cause performance, debugging, and maintenance problems. NPM is a cross-platform package manager included in the Node.js system. On its website, you can search for external libraries for address parsing. They vary strongly and fit certain country postcodes, local specifics, and address standards. For example, if you are processing Australian addresses, you should search for an Australian parsing package. Some popular ones are: US Street Address Parser, that understands suffixes and abbreviations, 5 to 9 digit ZIP-codes, etc.; Property Address Parser (addresser), that has a helpful function .getRandomCity to simplify testing; humanparser, helping to deal with names, salutations, and prefixes, and also address parsing functions. To work with each one, you should enter ""npm install "". Shortly summing up for this method: convenient for local services; difficult to find a 100% suitable library; a license may not allow commercial usage. If you don’t standardize many addresses daily or have a small number of them, look at this useful online tool. It allows to parse, standardize, and verify addresses online in minutes. The mechanism is quite simple: A user uploads a file with addresses (it can be Text, Excel, or CSV). Map components (street, city, state, and others). Tap ""Start"" and wait until addresses get parsed with the Geocoding API technology. Download standardized and verified addresses. However, you cannot verify large packages of addresses this way. Now let’s look at the most versatile and strong instrument for working with locations. Geocoding API provides the full cycle of operations: parsing, postal address normalization, validation, and verification. The Geocoding APIs purpose is to show the most suitable existing place for each one entered. It is much more than just parsing, allowing to save time and effort for developers and improve the quality of operations. For example, let’s look at a service from Geoapify. A useful basic feature is providing the level of confidence for each location. CONFIRMED — for fully correct existing addresses with all required information; PARTIALLY_CONFIRMED — up to a certain level, the address is correct, but there are mistakes; NOT_CONFIRMED — the location does not exist, and you’ll receive the most alike one instead. Also, you’ll see all related information: coordinates, all address components - house number, street, city, postcode, etc., and standardized address. The address entered initially will be tested and parsed, and verified. Summarizing this method: provides the most checked and full information, requires almost no additional attention; still, working with non-confirmed addresses needs additional work and logic from developers; performs all needed operations and works versatile with most of the countries, multi-language support; usually is not free for large datasets. All stated technologies are different and suit various situations. If you have many free-form addresses, choose the Geocoding API to match all purposes at once. For certainly local projects, NPM-packages and regular expressions are also great. Also, try different ways of working and find the preferable one."
6,Top 5 WooCommerce payment gateways,computers-technology," In a world of the digital era, it’s critical to keep up with the latest technology trends. And e-commerce is not an exception to this rule. Given how significantly the payment technology evolves each year, new and new advanced features are becoming almost inseparable from a seamless e-commerce experience. Thus, even an average online store now features at least one payment gateway that streamlines the purchase process. And given that most of all websites run on WordPress, WooCommerce payment gateways take a vast niche in contemporary e-commerce. While being a powerful tool for making the customer experience more smooth and the purchase process more optimized, WooCommerce payment gateways appear to be the most popular ones. In a nutshell, a payment gateway is a merchant service that helps retailers to process electronic financial transactions. A payment gateway serves mostly for online stores, but it also applies to the physical stores that accept credit card or e-Wallets payments along with the cash. The working principle of each payment gateway is more or less the same. It gets the payment data from the shopper and then transmits it to the issuing bank that approves the payment. After, the payment amount is deducted from the shopper’s account and then transferred to the merchant’s bank account. When choosing the best WooCommerce payment gateway for your online store, it might be useful to know different types of payment gateways: iFrame-based payment gateways These are the payment gateways that allow buyers to conduct the purchase directly on the seller’s website. iFrame-based payment gateway generates the checkout form on the website, meaning the consumers don’t have to go to the external site to complete the transaction. Form-based payment gateways Unlike iFrame-based payment gateways, the form-based ones take shoppers to an external web page while conducting the transaction. Thus, the consumers are redirected to another site. Here, all the security issues are completely handled by the service provider. Also, the payment data is safely stored at the third-party site, meaning online stores are protected from hacker attacks. Integrated payment gateways An integrated payment gateway ensures a coherent and holistic experience to the consumers as it is directly built within the seller’s website. It means that shoppers don’t need to take any extra steps as with the form-based payment gateway. However, if you want to use an integrated payment gateway, you need to take additional security measures, including an SSL certificate and PCI Compliance. Once you know the main types of payment gateways, it is easier to choose the one for your online store and meet your personal needs. Also, it might be helpful to get acquainted with the most popular payment gateways. With the help of these examples, you will be able to easily make up your mind and know what an excellent payment gateway includes. These are the top 5 best payment gateways: PayPal PayPal is probably the most notable payment gateway. It is easy to integrate as it comes with many extensions available for everyone. PayPal allows retailers to accept credit and debit card payments as well as money from users' virtual balances. The service allows payments with and without accounts on the platform. Like all the contemporary payment gateways, PayPal uses the latest encryption technology that keeps vulnerable data secure and protected. PayPal is free to acquire, but it charges fees for transactions. Stripe Another powerful WooCommerce payment gateway is Stripe. It has a user-friendly interface and is customizable – so you can design it according to your website theme. The same as PayPal, it comes with multiple free extensions but carries a transaction fee. The Stripe payment gateway processes transactions made in different currencies, using 3D secure for better data protection. Authorize.Net What makes the Authorize.Net payment gateway powerful is that it is compatible with other service providers, including PayPal payments, eWallets, etc. That allows retailers to combine different payment methods within one online store. What is more, Authorize.Net uses a powerful fraud detection technology, which makes it one of the most reliable WooCommerce payment gateway. WooCommerce Payments WooCommerce Payments works seamlessly with any WooCommerce website. This payment gateway accepts all major credit cards. WooCommerce Payments requires no setup or monthly fee, but it charges for transactions and takes an additional fee for the cards that are outside the US. Paysafe Paysafe is a WooCommerce payment gateway that guarantees high security and protection to its clients. The service follows PCI compliance and encrypts all the payment data with the help of the latest technologies. Also, the Paysafe payment gateway allows subscriptions and pre-order payments. Paysafe is not free as it charges a subscription fee annually or monthly. Now, when you know more about WooCommerce payment gateways, you can make an informed decision and enhance your sales. Also, you can select one from the list above. It might be hard to choose between these robust payment gateways, but you can combine multiple solutions at once. That way, you will significantly broaden the choice of payment methods for your consumers, improving the overall customer experience and leveraging your performance."
7,How to Increase Site Traffic by Pinterest SEO,computers-technology," Pinterest has been around since 2003. It was launched as an Android app in 2012 and became an app for iOS in 2014. It's easy to use and allows anyone to pin any image on their profile. The service also offers a blog where users can share content and tips. Popular content can earn a high number of pins depending on how heavily it is shared. Pinterest is a robust social network with an incredibly active user base. Users are sharing the most relevant pieces of content from a variety of providers. This makes the job easy to find the right audience for your business or product in a matter of minutes. In addition, the power of Pinterest can be applied to your own website in ways that can help build traffic. This article will discuss using Pinterest SEO to dramatically increase your traffic while improving your site’s visual design and overall experience. Pinterest SEO Pinterest SEO is optimizing your Pinterest account for search engine relevance. It helps you get more visitors from Google by showing relevant pins to users looking for related topics. This can help you grow your business organically by acquiring new customers who aren’t searching for your brand directly but are interested in similar topics. How does this help you get more clients? Because people are looking on Pinterest for inspiration and want to find things related to your business. This can be useful for you to stand out from other sidebars on Pinterest and get more exposure. Every small business needs Pinterest to grow, whether it's for promotion or awareness. But there’s a lot of marketing involved in Pinterest, so understanding how it works can help you grow your business organically without having to spend a lot of time on it. How Pinterest SEO works are simple. Keyword research is the key element. When creating content for your Pinterest boards, focus on your target audience's most popular topics and interests. Then, using the free tools available, such as Bing and Google Keyword Planner, identify keywords related to your industry or niche. Then, begin combing the web using these keywords and taking advantage of direct dovetail opportunities with resources that will help support your efforts—website design, social media promotions, ad buys, etc. If you want to rank well on Pinterest, you should optimize for the numbers — or at least try to replicate what people are sharing and following. Once you get going on Pinterest and start pinning and following productive people, you'll begin to see a change in how your organic search ranking looks. Like all social networks, Pinterest is constantly evolving, so the rules for what works for one network might not work for another. When it comes time to optimize your Pinterest site for search engines, you need to consider many things. Optimize your images, titles, and descriptions; add a description around each pin, and change your colour scheme if you're using any stock photos. Make sure you have all the info before Pinning! Before you can use Pinterest for business, you need to convert your account into a business one. This is critical because business users have more followers and drive more traffic to your website (and get free pins). The simple way to perform this is by creating a new personal Pinterest account and giving it a personal name. From then on, when you use Pinterest for business, your personal account will be in the “business category” of pages where users can see the featured boards. The main benefit of Pinterest for Business is the ability to grow a following and build a brand association without ever leaving Pinterest. To change your personal Pinterest account into a business account, follow these steps: Log into Pinterest. Click on sign in. Click on the account icon- top of the screen. Click change profile. Enter in your personal details and select the appropriate category for your business. Click save, and you're done! Now your new account will show up on Pinterest. There are many ways to submit your website to Pinterest without having to code it yourself. For example, you can download an HTML tag file and fill it in with the code you want to submit. Or, if you have a blog and are looking to create pins for that blog, you can download an HTML file and save it as a local file included in the submitted site Tag Set. You can also learn how you can submit a site to Pinterest through different tools. Pinterest is easily one of the most popular social bookmarking sites on the internet. It may be used to share art, coupons, inspirational quotes, and many other things. It's also one of the easiest ways to grow your blog and website traffic. It’s so popular because it’s free, and you can use it to showcase just about anything you want. There are many themes to choose from -- graphic designs, photos, videos, and more -- and you can build your pin based on various social interests or topic areas. You can also drag and drop various content pieces, including blog posts or articles, onto it to serve as other types of pins. You can use Pinterest to boost your blog. More people will see your posts and stick around, and that means more traffic to your site. However, it's simple to get overwhelmed by the pins and other social media channels — especially if you're new to Pinterest — so it's best to set up a daily budget and stick to it. Here's how: When you create a new Pinterest board for your blog (or any other social media channel), pin every image on that board at least once. This will make your board visible to other users (and likely lead them to click through to your site), but it won't take up any additional space on your Pinterest page. To use Pinterest effectively for SEO, you should figure out how to make the most of the platform's features. The great way to do this is by using keyword research software such as Ahrefs. If you're looking for ways to determine which keywords to focus on for SEO purposes, these three steps will help you get started. Then you can use these strategies to grow your new-found followers and website traffic! In addition to using ad groups and boards, you can use Pinterest's built-in community features to get your fans excited about your boards and replying to comments, likes, and shares. This is a compelling set of features when used with SEO."
8,Keywords Optimization For Online Businesses,computers-technology," Learning how to optimize keywords for your online business is crucial. Optimized keywords will help you achieve top search engine rankings in the major search engines. Top search engine rankings can bring in more visitors to your site. The more traffic you bring to your site, the more money you make. And the more money you make, the more motivated you are to keep up with the ever-changing trends and demands on the Internet. If you want to succeed online, you need to learn how to optimize your keywords. Not only do you have to optimize your content to maximize search engine optimization, but you must optimize your keywords. Keywords are the words that people put into the search engine to find what they want. To understand how to optimize keywords for your online business, you must first understand what keywords are and what they stand for. Let's get to know more about keywords. A keyword is simply a word or phrase that someone enters into the search engine. For example, if you were looking for a movie, then you might enter the keywords movie in the search box. That search engine will then gather all the information about movies that match your keywords. Once the search engine finds the movie you want, it will display it on the result page for you. So now that we have that cleared, let us move on to how to optimize your keywords for an online business. You need to use keywords that are descriptive of your business. This means that your keywords should tell a searcher what kind of information you provide. After all, the words you choose for your keywords should tell the searcher something about your product or service. A good example of a keyword is ""poker."" For online business success, you want your keywords to be related to your online business. For example, if you sell online poker, then use poker in your keywords. That will ensure that people looking for poker also see your online website. Make sure your keywords are descriptive and specific. One way to accomplish this is to think like a search engine. For example, type in a word or phrase in the search bar and press enter. What will happen? When the search returns websites that are relevant to your keywords, the website will be displayed on the right-hand side of the search results. It will be listed right above the ads for the similar products and services that you are selling. This is how to optimize keywords for an online business. By using specific keywords that accurately describe your online business, you will be on the fast track toward finding the best web pages and ads on the Internet. Of course, just because you get more traffic does not always mean that these ads will be good. Poorly designed ads with spelling mistakes will not draw in customers. How to optimize keywords for an online business is important because of the large amount of competition that there is on the Internet. However, there is more to it than just knowing the correct keywords. If you don't have the correct keywords, then you can't achieve a high ranking on the search engine results pages. You must get the proper keywords so that your website appears at the top of the list for the specific words you are trying to target. If you can achieve this, you will attract more visitors to your site, which will increase your chances of making sales. Another way to boost your site's rankings is to learn how to use the apt keywords in the copy that is being written. Many people fail to do this, and end up with articles filled with irrelevant keywords that do little to enhance the content. Keywords need to be relevant to the content for them to be effective. If the keywords are not relevant, the reader will not understand what the writer is trying to say and will click away from the article. When this happens, the traffic that was meant to be generated through the traffic from the article is gone. Once you know the proper keywords to use, you need to learn how to optimize keywords for an online business. The right keywords can make the difference between having a successful website or one that is never seen by your potential customers. A new business needs to learn how to use these keywords to get the most profit for their efforts. The basics of SEO can also be used to optimize keywords for an online business. You may have heard from many people that to find out how to choose profitable keywords you need to do market research. This is completely true. It would be wrong for you to think that market research is not needed. The reason why it is so wrong is that you as a surfer will surely know what the majority of the surfers in your niche are looking for. The right keywords and keyword phrases will bring you traffic and help you earn a good income. The first step to find profitable keywords is to sign up for a free keyword tool such as Google's Keyword Elite. When you have done this then you can start typing any word or phrase you want to research on the search engine. When it comes to profitable keywords, the more times your keyword appears on the page, the more traffic you will get. However, this does not mean that the longer your keywords appear, the better it is. Sometimes, the shorter keywords are more profitable. For you to find the most profitable keywords, you will also need to learn the on-page optimization techniques for your niche. On-page optimization means optimizing your site for your targeted keywords. There are numerous places to go to learn about on-page optimization. Some of the places include: Keyword Positioning - Many search engines look at the keywords first and the keyword positioning second. If you get a site to the first page of a major search then you are in luck. It is also more likely that if you have a second page then you will rank high. The reason for this is because the search intent of the surfer is looking for something on the page and then finding your site on the third page because of the keyword c is pareto. The importance of keyword research cannot be overstated. Without researching keywords you may miss out on opportunities for making money with your website. The great thing about keyword research is that it can also be very time consuming. A beginner's guide to keyword research should be able to walk you through it step by step. Google's Magnifying Box - You should also know about the Google Magnifying Box. If you have the correct set of anchor texts in your meta tags then Google will allow you to rank much higher with the search engine results pages than you could with the main keywords. The Google Magnifying Box shows you the exact statistics that Google uses when calculating the page rank of each web page. This information is extremely helpful when learning how to choose profitable keywords. Backlinks - One of the most important things that people fail to realize is that having many backlinks does not necessarily mean that you will rank better in the search results. Google looks at the quality of your backlink profile. In other words, the number of incoming links that point to your site. You will want to focus on only a handful of quality high PR links. It is also important to make sure that your backlinks are from relevant sources and that the links do not belong to black hat SEO cheats. There are other tools on the market that will help you discover some of the best seed keywords that will help you with your online marketing efforts. However, the information that you receive from Google's main keyword tool will get you started in the right direction. Google is by far the largest search engine and it is very important for your online business to rank well with Google.

12,BRIDGING THE DIVERSITY GAP – A NEW MINORITY-OWNED CPA FIRM – AUDIT PEAK,computers-technology," NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES, August 17, 2021 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Audit Peak, an innovative and unique Certified Public Accountant (CPA) firm, reaches far beyond providing exemplary services to its clientele. This new minority-owned CPA firm moves a step closer to bridging the diversity gap with similar progressive organizations. The firm’s vision is to expand employment and career opportunities for everyone, providing opportunities for individuals with the aptitude and drive, especially minorities in the auditing and cybersecurity space. Audit Peak offers a comprehensive suite of services, including System and Organization Controls (SOC) 1, SOC 2, SOC 3, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Agreed-Upon Procedures, and Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA) compliance services. Studies reveal that less than 1% of minority-owned CPA firms in the United States provide advisory and assurance services. Audit Peak endeavors to improve this statistic by inspiring more people, especially minority-identifying people, to create and explore auditing and cybersecurity opportunities while the firm redefines the quality standards of the sector. How will the firm make a difference? This question came up during the company’s planning phase. The answer was to form a minority-owned CPA firm to provide representation, inspiration, and empowerment to professionals and business owners alike. The Audit Peak team has at least 25 years of combined audit and cybersecurity experience. The firm brings together CPAs and consultants who were previously employed by Big 4 and boutique CPA firms and who collectively have completed hundreds of audits for start-ups, mid-caps, and large-cap companies. Inspiration to make a difference was driven by observing the buzzwords “diversity” and “inclusion” being tossed around for many years and witnessing first-hand the lack of representation and opportunity. Beyond expanding employment and career opportunities, Audit Peak intends to provide internships and mentorship to upcoming professionals and work with businesses and organizations that support advancing minorities in auditing and cybersecurity. Where does change begin? According to NABA, the National Association of Black Accountants, only an estimated 5,000 of the 650,000 CPAs in the U.S. are black. Audit Peak believes that established social mores and practices at some companies make it challenging for these firms to create a genuine sense of diversity, inclusion, and opportunity for minorities. Instead of just adding icing to a cake, the firm believes that the only way to tackle this lack of diversity and opportunity is to “bake fresh cakes and pay attention to the ingredients.” As part of its ingredients (“mission”), Audit Peak intends to maintain a healthy work culture where every employee truly has a voice, feels genuinely appreciated, and is celebrated and inspired to achieve their goals. To this end, Audit Peak intends to employ a recruitment strategy that includes recruiting from mixed and historically black colleges; educational establishments which have been historically excluded from targeted recruitment by prominent firms. Why should firms choose Audit Peak? In addition to providing CPAs and consultants with Big 4 experience, Audit Peak has a much fairer pricing structure, a culture of quality without compromise, and an ethos of “pride in one’s work.” The team has led audits for companies across many industries and countries, ranging from start-ups with less than ten (10) employees to more established companies with over fifty-thousand (50,000) employees. The team has also led audits for companies with market capitalizations ranging from several hundred thousand to several billion dollars. Audit Peak’s consultants have audited many legacy environments and even more cloud environments, including Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google GCP. Amongst the suite of services, Audit Peak will push its SOC 2 services as its primary line of business. The team has completed over 200 SOC 2 audits. With technology-driven collaboration and growth in outsourcing, the demand for SOC 2 reporting is likely to grow as companies seek to manage their risk posture, including cybersecurity risks. The Audit Peak team also has experience with HITRUST, PCI DSS, and ISO 27001 and plans to offer these and other compliance services in a phased format. According to a recent Bloomberg report, “The Consulting Business Booms Just as Consultants Disappear,” nearly 2-in-3 consulting firms say they are short-staffed. At the same time, the risk and threat landscape has evolved significantly as many companies migrate from on-premises to cloud infrastructure. This shift has created additional security, operational, and compliance challenges for many companies and increased the demand for consultants. Audit Peak aims to create more opportunities for employment and help supply the shortage in the talent pipeline, adding to a team already imbued with excellence. Audit Peak is committed to driving actual change and creating a standard of excellence to support and propel its clients’ compliance strategies. About Audit Peak Audit Peak is a minority-owned firm of CPAs & consultants providing cybersecurity, consulting & risk advisory services. We are a distinctive brand that focuses on representing and inspiring people while bridging the diversity gap. Our team has a healthy mix of specialists from the Big 4 accounting firms and boutique CPA firms.

13,The Art Of Cold Calling [Mastery In Seven Simple Steps],computers-technology," The Art of Cold Calling is so much more than purchased industry contact lists and lots of caffeine. The definition of a cold call is calling someone you don't know who isn't expecting your call, as summed up perfectly by Aaron Ross of Predictable Revenue. This guide will teach you how to research your prospects, give them advanced heads up of your call, and call them at the optimal time...which makes this less of a cold calling guide and more of an outbound sales strategy primer. Table of Contents Research Contacts Email Finding Software Email Template Phone Script Outline What is a Premail in Outbound Marketing? Call At The Right Time How Many Follow Up Emails Should You Send? Conclusion Want To Learn More? The reason outbound sales is so effective is because it's the clearest way to find out where you stand in your sales pipeline. It's one of the few sales techniques that, in certain industries, a business can be successful solely on mastering the art of reaching out to potential clients before they reach out to you. Who should use outbound sales? While anyone could benefit from telling people about their business, this marketing channel takes research, strategy and style which may be a better fit for items or services where the customer lifetime value is less than the cost of your salesperson's time. The following is the Art of Cold Calling for business to business (B2B) where the commodity you are trying to sell is a meeting. In this example the pitch is saved for the actual meeting when the prospect is giving their full attention. There's a direct correlation between how much you know about your business to how actionable the contacts will be in your funnel. The important questions to ask when narrowing down your prospects are: 1    What industry or industries are most likely to be interested in your product? 2    What qualifications would your ideal customer need to have in order to do business with me? i.e. company size, maturity, ability to afford your product...etc 3    What title would your target decision maker have in their company? i.e. Would your product or service be decided on by the CEO, marketing manager, IT director...etc 4    If you don't know what their title might be, ask. Don't be afraid to call someone at the company like a receptionist or an assistant to the CEO, many times they are happy to help if you sound friendly or important. Now that you've done your contact research, your list should look something like the table below with two extra columns on the right for an email and phone number. Organize your table to have the first name, last name and company website, in that order, as it's optimal for most email finding software. The next step is to load the first name, last name and company website into any one of the many email finders online. Find That Email is great because of it's bulk search ability and Voila Norbert has a go-to Chrome Extension when doing an email lookup for a single contact. There are at least a dozen other email finders available online, some with better success rates than others. Typically you'll have success calling the company phone number listed on their website as long as you make the right ask with the person answering the phone. See phone script outline below. Now that you have a first name, last name, email address and company phone number, it's time to create your email template and phone script outline. When creating a email template, you'll want to create three variations for contacts that you (a) talked to directly (b) you left a voicemail for and (c) you left a message with another person. They'll all look similar with minor changes based on your circumstances. Here's an example of an email template where the prospect didn't answer so I left a voicemail. Instead of sending a new email, I like to hit ""reply"" to the premail I sent earlier to keep an easier conversation trail. I always recommend making an outline on your main points but don't worry about coloring outside the lines. Once the groundwork has been laid with your research, premail & phone call, I'm never shy to ask to set a meeting right off the bat. I'm always be prepared with an intro, attention grabber & follow up questions nevertheless. Intro ""Shai, thanks for taking my call. This is Brian with Advertising á la carte, I sent you an email yesterday. I know this interrupting your day so I'll be quick. Would you be available to set up a 15 minute phone call in the future to talk about ways we can save Virgin Airlines on PPC costs?"" Hook or Attention Grabber ""We've saved hundreds of thousands of dollars for other airlines in your industry through optimizing Google Pay Per Click Ad Budgets"" Prepare Yourself with follow up questions ""how are you currently using adwords?"" ""do you manage adwords in house or with an agency?"" ""what is your biggest pain point with your current adwords campaign?"" Gatekeeper Etiquette: When calling, you'll probably speak to an assistant or other who's job is to filter calls like yours. Instead of asking to speak to the CEO of Virgin Airlines, re-frame the question to ""I wanted to follow up on an email I sent to Shai yesterday, can you transfer me to his voicemail please?"" Now that you have your contact list, email template & phone call outline, it's time to start the outreach. The difference between cold calling and premailing your prospect before a call is that your contact is now expecting to hear from you. There's no surprises, so the major friction point is gone. The Cold Calling Premail was intentionally placed at number five on the list because once you send it, the time is ticking. That's why it's important to create your email template and phone script beforehand so you're ready to dive right into calling. According to a 2017 article by Call Hippo (infographic below) the best day of the week to promise a phone call would be on a Wednesday and the best time to call would be between 4-5pm. While there are plenty of other days and times to schedule your calls, there's was a significant difference between the first attempt conversations on a Wednesday (195) versus first attempt conversations on a Friday (60) so timing is definitely something to consider. [Infographic] best time to make business call After you make a call, assess how it went whether you contacted the prospect directly, left a voicemail, or talked to an assistant. Always send a follow up email so the prospect is aware you tried to reach them. There's no universal law of how many follow up emails you should send to your prospects. Woodpecker.co says 2-3, Autoklose.com says 5, and Theloopmarketing.com says 8. You may never have a hard and fast rule on how many follow ups to send, what I recommend is that when the replies or other feedback starts to dwindle after 2-3 attempts, it's not a bad idea to start fresh with new prospects. The follow up email and phone call mix is also a ratio I use dependent on the role of the prospect in their company. For example with a CEO, I may call more than email because according to personal experience and also Small Biz Genius, almost 60% of C-level executives value information from phone calls with sales reps. The higher up a person is in their company, the heavier I'll rely on the phone over email because it seems to be more appreciated. Conclusion The element of surprise is good for the sneakiest of ninjas but won't help you in your outbound sales calls. Next time you're thinking of cold calling a prospect, put yourself in their shoes and ask how you'd like to be contacted if you were in their position. Pair the above strategies with a solid offer and you might find yourself giving outbound sales a bigger portion of your marketing mix than you ever anticipated.

I will share how some businesses that are negatively impacted quickly change their businesses model and direction to meet changing demands and how some innovative technologies like robotics, AI, automation, videoconferencing are specifically adopted in education, healthcare, manufacturing. The paper will predict and share how the new world normal will be like and how technologies will be rapidly adopted to mitigate the demand and workforce behavior shift globally. Keywords: COVID-19, crisis, digitalization, economy, innovation, new normal, new industries, revolution, recession, technologies driven strategies, workforce Innovative Strategies for the Post-Pandemic Era Introduction The impact of the current pandemic has been significant, and it is paramount to elaborate these effects to enable key innovative strategies to be effective and ideal. The paper aims to highlight these impacts across various social and economic settings and identify the novel solutions employed in tackling the crisis. The research has been categorized into four chapters. I.	COVID-19: Impact and Comparison to past crisis: In this chapter, a general assessment of notable pandemics across human history, including the pre-history era, was highlighted and compared with the present-day pandemic. The socio-economic impact accompanied by the pandemic was also elaborated in this chapter. II.	Implication on Business and Workforce: The chapter emphasizes the global implication the pandemic has on businesses and the workforce, stating how various industries and businesses succumbed to the unfavorable impact of the pandemic. III.	The New Normal: In this chapter, some activities that have been induced by the pandemic have been discussed and projected to maintain long after the pandemic. These activities include industries, business, and even education, revolutionizing each sector by employing novel tactics that would remain even in a post-Covid era. IV.	Key innovative strategies for future-ready companies: This chapter covers basic strategies and innovations both in methodology and technology that have been influenced (favorably) by the pandemic. COVID-19: Impact and Comparison to Past Crises Since the pre-historic era of modern humanity (before the industrial revolution), civilization has been plagued with varying degrees of pandemics. It can also be argued that based on the geo-specificity of some of the ancient epidemics prior to the twentieth century, most would not be termed as a pandemic in a modern world setting. In regard to this, Dr. Fukuda K., an assistant Director-General for Health Security and Environment (WHO) in 2009, stated that severity of disease plays a major role in the classification of a disease or illness as a global pandemic or epidemic. According to him, earlier versions of the 'Pandemic Planning Guidance' focused on a number of various ideals, which include the evolution of viruses, contagion, severity, etc. He adds that these models are too complicated and phases in their classifications too complex and open to ambiguity in application and interpretations by many countries. Trends in Past and Current Pandemics Most scholarships have supported the claim that the severity of disease goes a long way in classifying an epidemic as a pandemic, with great emphasis on their fatality rates (Carrie et al., 2013).The severity and fatality rate of an epidemic consequently makes it a pandemic (Potter, 2001). and epidemics that occurred broadly and globally before the industrial age may or may not have been tagged as pandemics in our modern age. From the onset of the twentieth century to its end, three major global pandemics were recorded – first, the great 'Spanish Flu' of 1918 (Barro et al. 2020), the 'Asian Flu' (H2N2) of 1957 (Jackson, 2009), and the 'Hong Kong Flu' (H3N2) of 1968 (Starling 2006). In analyzing the trends of epidemics across modern history, one daunting conclusion can be drawn. That is, as civilizations become more advanced due to industrialization and globalization, the means by which these pandemics propagate, mutate, and spread become more favorable. Hence the ever-increasing ease in transportation, globalization, and industrialization can favor the rapid spread of the disease-causing virus during a pandemic. This is evident in the twenty-first century, which has seen over three global pandemics and counting in less than a quarter of the century gone; that is, Bird Flu in 2009 (N1H1) (Lycett et al. 2019), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002 (Smith, 2006), and the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in 2019 (Moghadas et al. 2020). Impact of Pandemics on Socio-Economic Activities Although the Spanish Flu peaked towards the end of the first world war, the economic and social effects the Flu impacted on established activities was paramount; with some authors noting that the impact might have been more substantial than reported (Barro and Ursúa, 2008). Barro et al. (2020) focused on the impacts (disaster) caused by pandemics (mainly the Spanish Flu and COVID-19) on a macro economy. They defined these impacts as a collective deterioration over a well-defined duration by about 10 % in real per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It followed that the first world war, the second world war, and the Spanish Flu grossed the highest impact on the macro economy within our recent era. According to the authors, the Spanish Flu of 1918 may have been the next significant adverse macroeconomic impact globally, but the current pandemic is edging through. Other reports have related the economic downfall from the Coronavirus to World War II (Reuters, 2020). The current pandemic (COVID-19) is unusual, economically, of course. Prior pandemics are mainly felt by countries that are more or less economically frail at the time, but the current pandemic is mainly focused on the economic juggernauts of our current era (Baldwin and Weder di Mauro, 2020). In response to the ever-increasing cases of the virus, economic powerhouses have sort to implement the 'containment' and 'mitigation' procedures (WHO, 2009) as a means of 'flattening the epidemic curve' (Nicola et al., 2020). These include the general lockdown of public activities, travel restrictions, border closures, isolation, and quarantine, creating concerns about imminent economic downfall and recession (Ozili and Arun, 2020). Figure 1: Flattening the pandemic curve Source: Detmer et al. 2021 (https://relief.unboundmedicine.com/relief/view/Coronavirus-Guidelines/2355041/all/Epidemic__Epi__Curves_for_Coronavirus_COVID_19) Figure 1 illustrates the importance of the mitigation and containment measures amidst the pandemic. Although these measures help limits the maximum number of cases, and hence the number of deaths accompanied by the pandemic, they, however, prolong the duration and hence the socio-economic impact of the pandemic. From previous experience of earlier pandemics, scholars have reported that anxiety and isolations accompanied with these sorts of the outbreak has adverse impacts on economic and social activities (Bermejo, 2004; Arndt and Lewis, 2001) such as agriculture, education, mental health, etc. Impact on Agriculture According to a report by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO, 2020), the organization maintained that COVID-19 is upsetting agricultural activities via two important modes; that is the 'supply' and 'demand' for food. The pandemic has taken a deep toll on the food supply; due to the anxiety accompanied by the virus on the public amidst lockdown and quarantine, the agricultural industry witnesses a global rush in terms of panic buying and stocking of long-lasting food, such as cereals, pasta, flour, etc. (Jámbor et al. 2020). Thus, creating a negative impact and scarcity of essential commodities towards the mid-2020, which was almost the peak of the first wave (Bochtis et al. 2020). As domestic restrictions were relaxed in many of these nations, the circulation of domestic agricultural produce and staple products began to stabilize, and the availability of these products became more apparent (Siche, 2020).  The same cannot be said for nations that rely heavily on imported products since most state borders were closed, and international trade limited (Pulighe & Lupia, 2020; Bochtis et al. 2020). On the other hand, the negative impact from 'supply' of food as a result of general public restrictions encouraged a worldwide drop in food 'demand' in major food service industries, which include markets, restaurants, cafeterias, hotels, etc. (Berg-Weger & Schroepfer, 2020). Consequently, food demand diminished as a result of the unpredictability of the disease and the minimization of individuals spending ability due to the economic impact of the virus. Impact on Mental Health Due to the precarious nature of the virus, its threat to livelihoods, the rising global death toll, and the significant number of confirmed cases worldwide, the fear of contracting the disease, depression, and insomnia amongst the public has been reported (Wang et al., 2020). From the emergence of the virus, governments and international bodies have been more concerned with mitigating the economic impact of the virus and curbing the spread of the virus by enforcing policies such as social distancing, isolation, quarantine, restriction of mass gathering and activities, etc. This protracted seclusion from the public and the absence of any form of physical contact from friend and relatives outside an isolation cycle betrays and disrupts the fundamental disposition and characteristic of human nature; which coupled with panic about the uncertainties of the virus, financial burden, and other psychologically traumatic aspects paints a volatile setting (Lin et al. 2020). Of the myriad misconceptions and misinformation circulating the internet about the pandemic, researchers at Cornell University concluded that the former US President Donald Trump was linked to about 38 % of the total 'misinformation conversation' ('infodemic') (KHN, 2020). Furthermore, Aksut (2020) stated that about 200 individuals died with numerous more poisoned from alcohol overdose in Iran, stating that the claims circulating the internet that alcohol consumption cures the virus propagated these events. Studies have acknowledged regular exposure to social media/news relating to COVID-19 as a cause of anxiety and stress symptoms (Gao et al., 2020). Impact on the Global Economy In an article on 'Anxiety about the global economy in Davos' by David Dollar and Douglas A. Rediker, they suggested that key factors such as the selection of the next World Bank and World Trade Organization leaders, U.S-China trade war, the case of Brexit and the EU and the United States presidential elections would take center stage in the key issues that would impact the world economy in the next decade (Dollar and Rediker, 2019). The emergence of the coronavirus pandemic changed the entire global economic setting, creating a center stage for new economic precedence. The economic impact during the pandemic is unprecedented. Cases of financial loss due to an outbreak have been reported extensively. During the SARS epidemic in China, it was reported that countries in Asia lost about 12 to 18 billion USD as the epidemic affected economic activities (Wishnick, 2010). The worldwide economic impact caused by the SARS outbreak amounted to about 30 to 100 billion USD (Smith, 2006). While in 2003 alone, the virus provoked a decrease of 1 % in China's GDP and 0.5 % in southeast Asia (MacKellar, 2007). Similarly, in the case of the coronavirus pandemic, in late February of 2020, when the first cases gripped Europe and the Americans, about $6 trillion USD in wealth was erased by global stock marketers; also, approximately  $5 trillion in value was lost in the United States around the same time from the S&P 500 index, with the ten largest firms in the S&P 500 taking a totalized loss of about $1.4 trillion (Randewich, 2020; Ozili and Arun, 2020). As a consequence of these downtrends in the global economy, the IMF predicted a global recession that would be similar to the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, with an economic resurgence in 2021 (Georgieva, 2020). As a result of pressure on various governments by the pandemic to create a swift response and react to an already precarious disease, most nations enacted policies that have both positive and negative impacts on the global economy, leading many countries into recession. Figure 2: Global economic impact of the pandemic Source: Lee (2020) (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/28/5-charts-show-covid-impact-on-the-global-economy-in-2020.html) Figure 2 shows the change in the economic measure of activities (GDP) across some selected regions corresponding to the largest economics and, similarly, the most affected regions by the pandemic with respect to affected cases. Additionally, it depicts a clear comparison between the global financial crisis of 2007/2008 and the current pandemic, showing how the economics of these regions plunged to a record low. The impact of the current pandemic has surpassed health defects and transcends other sectors and activities. Unlike pre-historic and other epidemics that have ravaged the world in previous eras, the current pandemic has affected most dominant world nations, and the socio-economic downfall accompanied by the crisis has been unprecedented in the recent era. The crisis has triggered a global quarantine, affecting all activities from agriculture, education, mental health, etc., drastically altering the livelihood and activities of individuals and governments in the world at large. Implications on Businesses and Workforce A century ago, a lot of questions and hindrances towards global business circled about means of minifying business failure and growth opportunities (Amankwah-Amoah & Syllias, 2020). Before now, these issues seemed like the utmost challenge surrounding a business scope; however, the current turn of events such as global warming and presently the coronavirus has changed the scope of business sustainability. Walsh (2020) noted that small and large firms are yielding to the impact of the pandemic, with the author predicting a surge in 'mega bankruptcies.' Approximately 7% of small and medium businesses (SMEs) in the UK were closed for good as a result of trends by the pandemic, with as many others on the brink of crumble. In addition to these challenges, most businesses initiated numerous palliatives which include, fewer hours, locked workplaces, distant working or working from home, and severances (Amankwah-Amoah et al. 2020). Implication on business activities Ozili and Arun (2020) described the implications of the global pandemic on businesses and the workforce in general as primarily a result of the global economic shock in both demand and supply and the 'spillover' of these effects on business within the economy. The International Civil Aviation Organization (2020) suggested that at its peak, the pandemic may result in cutbacks and slips of about 71 % of passengers and approximately 1.5 billion travelers globally by the year's end. This decline in seating capacity in the aviation sector affected the financial capacity of many airline companies, causing the closure of a few (Amankwah-Amoah et al. 2020; Ozili and Arun, 2020). This financial crisis led the firm to sort for a $58 billion USD bailout package (Muller, 2020), typifying the perilous impact of the coronavirus on aviation businesses. Hotel businesses and restaurants have also suffered the impact of the restrictions caused by the pandemic, with executives laying-off workers and pay-cuts on staffs' income. This led the hotel sector to seek a bailout of $150 billion USD for its businesses, a number of which are owned by franchisees or small business owners; also, for another $100 billion USD for businesses such as shops, restaurants, etc. (Muller, 2020). Likewise, in the workforce, basically in the agricultural industry, the pandemic has gravely affected the agricultural workforce, primarily the number of seasonal agricultural labor. Most of which are basically migrants, and as a result of border closures, international restrictions, and social-distancing policies; there is a drastic decrease in the amount of available worker force available (Bochtis, 2020), with sometimes age been a major setback in the workforce availability (Berg-Weger & Schroepfer, 2020). Hence, the effects of the pandemic range from job losses, pay cuts, bankruptcies, and closures, as well as massive business debts and bailouts. Figure 3: Unemployment rate across regions Source: Lee (2020) (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/28/5-charts-show-covid-impact-on-the-global-economy-in-2020.html) Figure 3 illustrates the effects the pandemic has on businesses and the workforce in general, showing how the unemployment rate has been highly altered by the crisis across various regions, with the highest being reported in the United States. The Next Normal: Trends That Will Define the Future One common claim is generally accepted, that is, the preceding era would be ideologically and fundamentally different from the pre-covid 19 eras (Bonacini et al. 2020). Therefore, it is only logical to analyze these changes and common trends that would define this new era. As stated earlier, Ozili and Arun (2020) reported that the global economic impact of the pandemic would ripple into other sectors and industries, creating a crisis as a 'spillover.' The ripple can be measured, studied, and quantified with respect to the business or industry it is affecting.  The effect of the current pandemic created an effect on the economic and social livelihood of individuals, and these effects would ripple as we transition toward a post-pandemic era ushering in a new normal. The New Normal The 'new normal' has often and always been a well-stated fact and sometimes a contentious one too. As the wave of the pandemic is shifted, with series of vaccines been produced and international restrictions accompanied by the pandemic been eased across the nation (Berg-Weger & Schroepfer, 2020), some common questions remain. What is the new normal, and do we return to the conventional normal? (that is, the way it has been done). In all these queries, one thing is clear, that is, the global economic and social spillover makes the 'conventional normal improbable. These values are vivid in the zeal and attention towards forthcoming occurrence; that is to say, reacting to a future crisis is becoming cardinal in the mentality of present and future generations (Buheji and Ahmed, 2020b). One other means in which this new normal value is evident is in the knowledge industry. Academic materials usually take a while to be accepted and issued; but presently, this requires just a few weeks to be processed. Therefore, this massive transition is showing the urgency in which circulation of information and knowledge has become paramount amidst the surge of the pandemic, characteristics which are likely to the maintained as a 'new normal value' in a post-pandemic era (Gianola et al. 2020). The clearest changes in this 'new normal' are likely to be in healthcare and safety institutes globally. Changes in health and safety attitudes in both government and individuals are expected to be more rigorous. This new normal will experience an increase in health safety budget and emergency readiness by most nations and international bodies. Safety equipment such as PPEs, prevention, and detection devices would be available and assessable, having higher trends starting from 2020 till 2023 (Buheji and Ahmed, 2020a). The new normal would be entirely revolutionary and unprecedented since the pandemic would have affected both trivial and primal activities of our livelihood. Trends Defining the New Normal Tourism According to Benjamin et al. (2020), the current pandemic has created a chance or even an urgency not only for massive financial and marketing recovery but also for immense reformation and transformation of an already crippling industry, which was made evident by the pandemic. Specifically, in tourism transformation, the equity should be the primal aim. The 'new normal' that accompanies this transformation would identify the predicaments dominating the tourism industry well before the pandemic started, together with a cognitive and introjected pro-equity plan (Benjamin et al. 2020). Brouder et al. (2020) maintain that when it comes to tourism, there has always been a 'normalized' method of approach in regard to activities instead of a 'normal.' According to the author, the respite as a result of restrictions caused by the pandemic on Tourism has actually depicted signs of institutional changes towards 'socializing tourism,' with the change instilled in the new normal for the foreseeable future. They added that the possibility of this transformation in the ideology with cause a paradigm shift in activities of social tourism and spread across countries as world leaders are responsively seeking for job increment to palliate the accumulated and already deepened joblessness. Glasmeier (2020) noted that policymakers and government would contemplate the advantage of raising the poor minimum wage to an actual 'living wage' as a means of safeguarding the tourism industry and its staff in case of another global crisis. Education Since the onset of this new decade, the world is edging towards a new era of electronic learning (eLearning). A global age that is reliant on electronic learning equipment now more than before; this reliance is not primarily attributed to innovations and technological advancements of this modern age but also as a result of the pandemic impact. This drastic and sudden shift in educational ideology from traditional to more electronic-based learning has been described as a 'forced shift to eLearning' instead of a willing and intended embrace (Ray, 2020).. According to the author, 44 % of the group are not familiar with eLearning activities prior to the outbreak, whereas about 70 % of the group only became conversant with such a platform after the coronavirus outbreak, with about 67 % of the population stating that eLearning was easier than conventional learning. This trend is becoming a new normal, which is expected to continue long after the impact of the pandemic has receded. The effect of the pandemic and its outcome is expected to cause a paradigm shift in activities and ideology in a post-pandemic era. Prior disasters (pandemic, epidemic, war, etc.) have altered the activities of businesses and individuals, which has been maintained to the present day. So also, it is expected that the activities of the post-pandemic era will be different from the pre-covid era, ushering in a new normal. This new normal will be spread to all sectors, including education, finance, tourism, etc. In as much as this trend may or may not be generally accepted by the public, factors such as adaptation, surviving, and even globalization due to industrial advancements would vastly favor the survival and eventual persistence of this trend in the world. Key Innovative Strategies for Future-Ready Companies Scholars have reported that a vast amount of present and previous innovations and technological advancements are produced as a consequence of distinct occurrences or disasters, allowing or creating novel technological prospects (Taalbi, 2017). For instance, the internet was invented by the United States Department of Defense at the peak of the cold war due to fear of Soviet supremacy in space technology (Lemonaki, 2020). Drastic improvements in the healthcare system, changes in protective equipment and housing scheme were all noted after the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, and innovations in great art and music as a consequence of ancient plagues/pandemics (Mcdonald, 2020). And also, following the impact of the second world war, innovations such as the commercialization of penicillin, medical advances in trauma treatment, skin grafts, blood transfusion, and technological advances in microwaves, radar technology, ENIAC computers, etc., were also accomplished (National WWII Museum). The emergence of the coronavirus outbreak appeared at a technological boom era, which is as a result of modernized studies in areas that include robotics, advanced production, digital technologies, artificial intelligence, and also the integration of their equivalent applications into conventional activities and sectors (Zimmerling & Chen, 2021). Restrictions as a result of the pandemic have influenced daily lives, discontinued educational activities, affected both small- and large-scale business and governmental organizations. In view of these effects, researchers have predicted that the pandemic would be an impetus to innovation globally and trends driving the new normal, with a number of these innovations showing possibilities for lasting changes (Zimmerling & Chen, 2021). Innovative Shift for Future-Ready Companies Presently, the global community is showing signs of acclimatizing to the new normal. Be that as it may, it is paramount it analyzes present innovations in various industries and businesses capable of causing a long-term technological shift which has been evident from past pandemic and crisis (Zimmerling & Chen, 2021). 4.1.1 Digital Technologies By means of the restrictions and guidelines compelling workplaces, firms, schools, and other non-essential organizations to retire, a general pressing need to maintain a sense of sanity and normalcy during the lockdown propelled the innovative implementation and utilization of digital technologies (Hsiang et al. 2020). One digital tool that has benefited from these events is Telemedicine (Ohannessian et al. 2020). Telemedicine, once defined as a shared virtual communication involving a patient and healthcare provider using visual and audio devices and software, has advanced to become a solution to the delivery of sustained healthcare while curtailing hazards accompanied by the pandemic (Ohannessian et al. 2020). The emergence of the pandemic has propelled innovative methods to broaden the scope of telemedicine, such as mental health, virtual visits, etc. (Ohannessian et al. 2020). A combination of these ideology with digital platforms and devices has improved the mitigation and monitoring of the virus (smart wearable healthcare, SWH). Governments in countries like China, Israel and Italy has employed these technologies during the peak of the pandemic; with China using smartphones, facial recognition cameras to monitor and detect virus with a population (Brem, 2020). So also, digital technologies have greatly improved internet streaming and virtual communicating applications, causing a shift in both videoconferencing, distant learning, e-exams, e-commerce, and e-gaming, etc. (Brem, 2020). Figure 4: Innovation in Telemedicine Source: Zimmerling & Chen (2021) The Figure 4 above shows the innovative working principle via digital technology in medicine – a combination of smart devices, artificial intelligence, data collection, and monitoring, as well as distant medicine. The process displays how Smart wearable healthcare operates by means of smart devices to monitor symptoms, checkmate and monitor infected individuals, as well as in contact tracing. Flexible and Advanced Manufacturing The pandemic considerably influenced the demand for vital products characteristic to disease prevention and treatment, such as test kits, PPEs, ventilators, oxygen, sanitizers, etc., warranting these products to be of utmost importance (Tietze et al. 2020). To mitigate this demand shift by consumers, a number of businesses and industries were pushed to switch production methodologies towards essential products, either for philanthropic purposes, health importance, lucrativeness, or governmental policies (Tietze et al. 2020). This created an organizational shift and sense of cooperation amongst diverse industries and even competitors (Zimmerling & Chen, 2021), as well as promoting 'flexible manufacturing technologies' (Brem, 2020). Flexible manufacturing practiced by firms at the peak of the pandemic allowed organizations such as Ford, GM, and Tesla to alter their automotive production itinerary in order to accommodate the production of medical ventilators. Also, various industrial and local spirit-producing businesses and organizations reformed to favor the production of isopropyl alcohol (Brem, 2020). Similarly, the adoption of advanced technologies by firms was evident in this pandemic. Advanced manufacturing systems not only have the potential to heighten the pace and quality of production but the system also reduces the amount of labor needed for production (Javaid et al. 2020). At the peak of the pandemic, when the economic and financial impact was maximum with respect to the restrictions, 3D printing technologies were employed as an innovative means of mitigating various vital material deficiencies (Ishack & Lipner, 2020). The 3D scanning devices made available the means to project a blueprint of a personalized product instantaneously, whereas the 3D printing device provides the creation of materials promptly and available when needed by a variety of industries and establishments due to the availability of 3D technology (Javaid et al. 2020). For instance, health professionals require N95 masks for safety purposes, and as a result of high demand and restrictions, a global scarcity of the product was experienced. 3D printing firms began publishing open-sourced materials for a printable N95 respirator (Sampol, 2020); as a result of this, businesses and firms such as Ford, CoxHealth, and other higher institutes participated in producing various face shields to support health care purposes (Brem, 2020).  In conclusion, the flexibility of a business and continuous adoption of new innovative technology in order to adapt to the uncertainties accompanied by a disaster was evident in this pandemic, strategies that are paramount to be adopted by future-ready business, as this would definitely become the new normal in modern businesses. Conclusion The current pandemic has affected most dominant world nations, and the socio-economic downfall accompanied by the crisis has been unprecedented in the recent era. The crisis has triggered a global quarantine, affecting all activities from agriculture, education, mental health, etc., drastically impacting the mortality and livelihood of individuals globally. Panic triggered by the pandemic and the general restrictions enforced by world leaders and government at the peak of the crisis, the fallout on business has been enormous, surpassing the effect on business and workforce during the global economic crisis of 2007-2008. This fallout has led to the closure of so many of these businesses, with the majority of them failing even with the various bailout financial packages. The effect of the pandemic and its outcome is expected to cause a paradigm shift in activities and altered the activities of businesses and individuals in a post-pandemic era, ushering in a new normal. This new normal will be spread to all sectors, including education, finance, tourism, supply chain etc and factors such as adaptation, surviving, and even globalization due to technology and industrial advancements would vastly force governments, businesses and individual to adopt approaches and changes that was never thought acceptable. A lot of the present methodological and even technological advancements has been as a solution to an emergency; hence, most key innovations have been in response to a crisis. The present pandemic has triggered key innovative responses aiming to tackle or often mitigate the effect of the shortcomings caused by the pandemic. From innovations in the methodology of education, methodology of healthcare, methodology of manufacturing and production (flexible manufacturing) to innovations in technology (AI, smart devices, videoconferencing, etc.), these changes are coupled to be part of the novel trends that would define the future of their individual industries.

19,Top 10 Sensors Types for Industrial Internet of Things,computers-technology," The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a major trend in the processing and manufacturing industry. GE clearly proposed the core concept of the Industrial Internet of Things, which was explained by many people as the development strategy of the British processing and manufacturing industry. And then the popularity of GE’s Predix platform, developing into the release of the Mindsphere, an industrial production network platform, by Siemens PLC. Later, several of China's processing and manufacturing giants have released the first industrial network platform, increasingly drawing attention to IIoT. From 2014 when GE launched the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC) abroad, to the establishment of the IIoT Industry Alliance in China in February 2016, the momentum has become even greater. It has become the focus of attention of government departments, manufacturing companies, Internet companies, Internet of Things companies, communication operators, IT and automation technology manufacturers. In fact, the Industrial Internet of Things is the content of industrial production, which is placed on the network built by the processing plant. The Industrial Internet of Things is closely related to intelligent manufacturing systems, and the key lies in the Internet, data information, and security. Among them, the Internet is the foundation, the data information is the key, and security is the guarantee. The Internet is the support point for industrial production software connection and data transmission in industrial production. Data information is critical to the promotion of intelligent industrial production systems. Security is a safety precaution for the application of the Internet and data information in industrial production. The focus of the Industrial Internet of Things is data information, so the ADSP-21060LKB-160 sensor used to collect data is very first for the intelligent control system of all ecosystems. In order to better integrate into the various application ranges of smart manufacturers, various sensors must be configured, which are most used in optics, temperature, sports, position and visual impact. The o&k group has sorted out the following 10 types of sensors that are used in industrial automation. Dust Sensor Dust sensors have been emerging for a long time, and many applications have been triggered in the industrial automation of the IIoT. They include the HVAC system, construction supervision, safety accidents and industrial equipment with a high probability of vapor leakage. The combination of dust sensors and IIoT solutions can properly handle the slightest steam leakage or minor incidents. Proximity Sensor On the bumper of a motor vehicle, sensors are the most common method to alert the driver of a collision. And in the retail industry, it is the same. When customers approach the product, they can get a discount. Infrared Sensor The key of infrared sensors is to detect the presence of people, which is widely used in national security and national defense. As is known to us, in recent years, infrared sensors integrated with IIoT solutions have been widely used in some other industries, such as electronic components, analytical chemistry, diagnosis and treatment industries. Among companies such as Murata, Renesas, Melexis, and Intersil, Murata and Melexis are very few companies that can demonstrate infrared sensors of IIoT. Piezoresistive Pressure Sensor After being integrated into the IIoT solutions, the piezoresistive pressure sensor can immediately push data information related to pressure changes. Based on the sensors, we can develop an industrialized IoT production system to monitor the key pressure equipment, including heat treatment furnaces, water supply systems, international airlines and oil rig systems. Mobile Sensor It can identify information on operating speed, acceleration, rotation angle, and offset. Industrial equipment such as photoelectric sensors can be used to observe the operating status of AC servo motors carefully. This kind of information is crucial to the accuracy of the operating process of industrial equipment. Temperature Sensor The temperature sensor is one of the most commonly used sensors in IIoT applications. They are used in many industries, including the pharmaceutical industry, biotechnology, and temperature detection. Optical SensorThe basic technology of the photosensitive element is to detect light, electricity, and magnetic fields. Communication, elevators, construction engineering, diagnosis and treatment and their maintenance software are applications of optical sensors in industrial automation technology. For instance, Vishay's VCNL4020X01 and TCxT1600X01 are both optical sensors, which are specifically for the industrial production of IoT applications. In the healthcare sector, photosensitive glasses are used to accurately measure the heart rate of people. According to the changes in the heartbeat within a day, it is helpful to prevent cardiovascular diseases. In the field of transportation, the use of optical equipment is to better prevent train accidents and remind drivers on the same track. Image Sensor Image sensor technology plays a leading role during the whole process of disruptive innovation of industrial automation in multiple industries such as healthcare and transportation. Omron and Invisige are two companies engaged in image recognition technology in the Internet of Things technology and have achieved great success. Machine Vision Technology With the development trend of machine vision technology, optoelectronic applications such as surveillance cameras are increasingly used in the industrial Internet of Things. Especially with the application of service robots, the establishment of 3D visual impact will be more and more ordinary. Therefore, the professionalism of obtaining deep data, such as the optical sensor of voyage time, will also face new upgrade opportunities. Ultrasonic / Millimeter-Wave Sensor When it is dark and the machine vision technology is restricted, the ultrasonic sensor can detect objects in the field of view based on the radar echo on the vertical surface of the detected object, which is a very cost-effective obstacle-avoidance solution. In recent years, with the development of millimeter-wave radar technology, detection schemes based on millimeter-wave communications have been recognized by increasing companies. Although the current price of millimeter-wave communication sensors is still high, they can accurately detect a large amount of object speed, angle and position, which will undoubtedly accelerate the popularity of this type of sensor."

2,Easily Convert and Open QuarkXPress Docs in Different Apps Using QXPMarkz,computers-technology," QuarkXPress has been an industry standard for a long time, especially in major design studios and firms that conduct large-scale print layouts and page construction. It is a powerful software tool comparable to other major software design suits offered by brands like Affinity and Adobe. The only problem is that not everyone is used to working in Quark or opening those files in their own native suites. This makes data communication and transfers a challenge between businesses, private owners, and contractors. Now, a new tool from Quark makes transferring files and opening them in cross-application platforms a breeze called QXPMarkz. This software allows the user to quickly preview the Quark file and then convert it into a format that can be read by an extensive collection of other applications, including Adobe InDesign, Affinity Publisher, older QuarkXPress files, Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Illustrator, and many more. QXPMarkz replaces the older Q2ID program and creates a clean user preview of files when you don't want to open the full Quark suite. Sometimes you just want a simple view of the layout instead of opening a resource-heavy application. The previews use the internal document data instead of the entire suite information resulting in an excellent file allocation. This is essential for sharing data between departments, contractors, and offices. It is also highly usable for showing clients how their layouts will look when seeking stage and final approval. QXPMarkz eliminates the problem of file structure. It can save files in different extensions, including IDML, PDF, TIFF, PNG, JPEG, and GIF. This makes exporting a lot easier. You can even export some of the text stories into the universal format of RTF, HTML, or simple plain text. This makes working with copywriters a lot easier as they don't necessarily need to see the entire layout of their work. Another handy feature is the automated QXP file processing offered. You will be able to configure the automation preferences within the software so your exports will autosave in the formats you want for your chosen applications. This allows QXPMarkz to quickly integrate into most automated workflows on your system. You will really enjoy the document inspector QXPMarkz offers. This gives you insight into the file summary, including details like file type, version, size, creation date, modification date, page count, spread count, page size, font, color, and image data. That quick information layout allows you to categorize files into the necessary folders for print preparation and storage. Using Quark is still a standard in many organizations, design firms, and private contractors. The best way to stay competitive in the open marketplace is to quickly communicate your creative work using a converter that puts your files into an easy-to-read preview. Take advantage of that fantastic ability and download the free version of QXPMarkz at https://markzware.com/products/qxpmarkz/.

4,11 Graphic Designing Trends to Look Out For in 2021,computers-technology," The objective of graphic designing is to turn something ordinary into exciting, eye-catching content. You have to make yourself aware of the ongoing design trends to get the edge in the market by adhering to the latest techniques and styles. Graphic design ideas and trends for 2021 are plenty in numbers, combined with advanced technology and the world's metaphorical standards. Every year, we see revamped and fresh looks in graphical content. The aim here is to examine the trends and their complexity while managing simplicity and fun elements together. Have a look at the below 11 graphic design trends that are reshaping the aesthetics. Organic Design Designers are applying organic design principles in many different areas, including tangible products, the fashion industry, and of course, digital graphics. The visuals and aesthetics incorporate in an organic design are extracted from the nature around us, making the design adaptive and natural-looking. Today, neutral colors are gaining popularity more than ever as they represent our environment. Beige, off-white, light brown, faded green, and sky blue are some of the color palettes use for organic designing. It is up to the designers that either they can go for the one color them or pair it with bright colors to make it attractive. Three-Dimensional Design Designing a 3D digital object is not new, but getting more extraordinary and attractive. Not only in the designing area, but 3D designs have also made a revolution in other technical aspects. The demanding use of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) are also the thrust to the 3D graphics. User interfaces of many websites and mobile applications leverage the 3D design to make their screen content pop up, maintaining a powerful impression upon the user. Use of Emojis The usage of emojis is no longer limited to the message exchange; brands are also making use of them to interact with their audience and trigger their emotions. It serves as an effective marketing tool, allowing companies to encourage their consumers for a more positive response. You can promote the product and services more persuasively if you take social media and other advertising platforms into consideration. Experiment with emojis inclusion in the designs to generate a more meaningful message and communicate with the audience in a more personalized manner. These small elements can make a significant difference. Designing with Gold Colors The trend of metallic design and effects is booming in 2021. The direction was already in the mainstream in mobile phones body design and made its way to the graphic design industry. It is one of the featured design trends of this era. With minimalistic aesthetics, metallic effects blend perfectly with the design, stimulating the user experience. Colors like brass, silver, and copper are implementing successfully in their graphic work, but there is no substitute for Gold here. It is the supreme among all metallic graphics and gains the users' attention. Typography Typography is old but still have its significance and relevance in the graphics industry every year. Designers experiment with a large number of concepts and ideas to which users always respond positively. By analyzing the audience’s response, there is no single reason directing the typography to stop and fade away. In addition to that, the sub-branch of typography is 3D typography leading towards the next upcoming trend. Side-by-side, there are also textures and animations which designers use with the typography to enhance their visual looks. No matter which niche you are working for, typography has its relevance in every other design work. It is not less than the symbolic representation of creativity. Using Monochrome Because of the natural look and appeal to the eyes, the modern design principles are aligned with the minimal palette. It also compensates for the addition of complex graphics and illustrations in a more subtle way. With monochrome, a designer can focus on more complex graphical elements. On the customer side, it simplifies the overall look, so the customer does not have to overuse their brain to understand the concept behind the design. Neumorphism The new trend of neomorphism is getting adopted in many different designs, specifically in the UI design. The underlying concept of neomorphism is to merge different elements from material design, flat design, and skeumorphism. Components designed with neomorphism feel like the 3D design when combined with others expertly. In tabs and buttons of web and mobile interfaces, the neomorphism principle is observed in high usage.

5,WordPress development: an agency or a freelance developer,computers-technology," WordPress significantly outperforms other similar website-building platforms, and there are quite a few reasons for that. First, it is easy-to-use and comprehensive. It doesn’t require any specific knowledge to install or perform basic actions. Also, it is flexible, which allows you to set the platform to your requirements and apply the features you need. Over 40% of all websites are built upon WordPress, which shows that the platform can be used to create any type of site. Another strong side of the platform is that it allows you to produce already mobile-friendly websites. The initial design is oriented on the mobile format first, which then smoothly extends to larger formats. And while mobile conversion rates are much higher than that of the desktop, using a mobile-first approach seems to be a smart decision. However, the WordPress development process might be painful sometimes. If you want an excellent website, you need to focus strongly on functionality. And with so many things to do, WordPress development may take much time and effort. Thus, it makes sense to hire professionals to help you with this issue. You can address a professional development agency or a freelance developer. Before choosing either of these variants, you need to focus on your business needs and your project’s nature. If it is a large-scale project, it’s better to hire an agency. There are many outstanding WordPress development London agencies that provide professional aid. Such companies usually have a broad range of services, which guarantee a competent approach to whatever case. Also, when dealing with an agency you have several specialists to work on a project, especially a big one. It means that you will get more of your requirements covered simply because of the size of the team and the wider professional viewport of the professionals. Also, there is a tested WordPress development strategy to work upon, most companies gained through time and experience. Usually, everything starts with front-end template bootstrapping. It also includes CSS stylings and JS logic for UX. Small projects do not require this step because they consist of few mockups that can be created directly in HTML. Another benefit of the agency here is that it can offer you some design services in case you don’t have any ready-to-go designs. Next step is the server setup for the future website to process and deliver web pages directly to the users. It encompasses all the work regarding WordPress CMS, API, role management, and establishing database. After all the pages are processed, the static website templates are connected with back-end data. Then, the agency provides you with several quality assurance sessions to iterate the final product, eliminating any bugs and inconsistencies. After everything is checked, the developers team transfers the website to the chosen hosting platform and applies a domain name. It is a vital step in WordPress development, as during this stage the website goes live in a web environment. Still, the work doesn’t stop here. Unlike freelance developers that usually end their work after the launch, most agencies provide ongoing support with everything concerning the website’s functionality, including server log monitoring and regular updates. However, if you have a small project and don’t want to spend much budget on an agency, you can hire a freelance developer. They’re more flexible in terms of the working process and can provide you with results much quicker. Also, it’s easier to negotiate with a person who deals with every issue of the WordPress development process than with a team of developers with different responsibilities. There are tons of options for businesses that want to build a fully functionally enhanced website. But the decision you make entirely depends on your business needs and requirements. If you have a large-scale project to work on, it’s better to hire an agency to avoid the headache of dealing with hosting, server setup, and support on your own. The bigger the project – the more issues you will have to address. On the other hand, there is no sense in hiring a WordPress development company if your project doesn’t require any complex and versatile work. You can always find a competent freelance developer to help you with that. Also, there are hundreds of WordPress themes available on the web. You can choose a well-suited one for your business and customize it according to your preferences, then install plugins specifically for analytics. The one thing to remember here is that WordPress development is a vast process. But if done consistently, it may help you to leverage your online performance. Ultimately, it is one of the most important aspects of website building, and if you want long-term positive results, take your time analyzing your decision thoroughly."
6,Artificial intelligence  and eCommerce,computers-technology," AI technology and eCommerce are not new. However, with the advancement of eCommerce, many experts in the field have come out with their opinions about the impact of the technology and whether it is good for business or not. These discussions are nothing new but there has been a recent spike in their intensity because of the rapid growth of eCommerce in the past few years. This technology has affected every aspect of business especially supply chain management. It not only helps businesses survive but also boosts their revenues. AI technology is the application of computer software that operates without human intervention. There are many types of software used for such purposes as artificial intelligence software, superintelligent software, and data mining software. All this software helps business executives make better decisions. Many believe that these decision-making programs will replace employees but that is yet to be confirmed. With all the advancements in the software, artificial intelligence software can perform better than humans. The first artificial intelligence software was developed back in 1993 by professors Georgeomon and Jeffreys. The models used in the research were very simple. They just needed to evaluate the output of the human. However, the results of these tests were very poor and this software was never put to use. This project brought forth the idea of using artificial intelligence to analyze business data. With the help of complex mathematical algorithms, the models can process all the information coming from different business departments and decipher what the company needs to do to increase sales and customer satisfaction. Business executives who believe in artificial intelligence technology are already seeing the benefits in increasing sales and profitability. If they implement the technologies properly, they can create a completely artificial intelligence network that will help them analyze all the business processes and find out the core issues which need improvement. They will then be able to design a solution to these problems using artificial intelligence. These artificial intelligence systems are also known as A.I. machines because they simulate human behaviors for better results. Another use of artificial intelligence technology is in self-driving cars. These vehicles are programmed by an artificial intelligence system to avoid obstacles, pedestrians, and other factors which may affect their ability to function properly. They are also able to take a variety of routes to minimize the risk of getting involved in an accident. The entire operation is made possible by a series of algorithms that allow the cars to communicate with one another and with the centralized control center. In the event of an accident, this system can quickly identify the problem and make the necessary repairs or evasive moves to save the vehicle. These types of systems can be used in many different industries, helping to reduce the cost of operating these vehicles. Another field in which artificial intelligence technology is being used is that of medical transcription. Transcription is the conversion of audio recordings made by doctors into written documents. Because of the nature of the material being transcribed, it is often difficult for doctors to transcribe accurately without the aid of artificial intelligence. Computer software engineer Arpad Nagy developed a program called ParaLite, which is designed to speed up the process of transcribing medical records. This software was later purchased by a company called Ab Initio, which is known for its Artificial Intelligence research and development. The company managed to further refine and expand ParaLite, which is now used in several other companies. AI software also plays a significant role in the process of forensics. This includes such areas as identifying and extracting evidence from digital media, such as digital photographs, video footage, blood spatter analysis, voice samples, and cellular phones. Computers and artificial intelligence will continue to become more sophisticated to help solve complex problems and to increase productivity. This type of technology will undoubtedly continue to improve, as more researchers pour into the field. However, there is no doubt that computers and artificial intelligence will be an integral part of our society for many years to come. The future of the internet, artificial intelligence, and the future of healthcare are all intertwined. Artificial intelligence will undoubtedly impact each of these areas in different ways. We will only have to wait and see what the future holds for artificial intelligence technology."
7,Why is owning a boat very expensive?,computers-technology," Anyone who has ever considered purchasing a boat has felt the sudden intake of breath that comes with seeing the price tag for the first time. There is no escaping the fact that boats are expensive to purchase and maintain. Is the price, however, justified? What are you getting for your money, exactly? Boats are generally handcrafted, resulting in significantly higher labor expenses per item. Many labor-saving technologies are just not cost-effective with such modest production volumes. The purchasers are another major factor in rising boat pricing. As difficult as it may seem, most of us do not require the ownership of a boat. However, the cost of owning a boat is influenced by a variety of factors. We look into the cost of buying a boat and answer the age-old question, ""Why are boats so expensive? Costs of Production The cost of actually building a boat is, in the end, what drives their exorbitant prices. Unlike vehicles, which are almost entirely automated now, boats must be made almost entirely by hand. Large shipyards are necessary, as only a few boats can be manufactured in a few months. Because of their scale and complexity, skilled labor is expensive and scarce. Whether it's teak decks or cutting-edge fiberglass hulls, materials meant to resist the rigors of life at sea are costly in and of themselves. Fittings and Extras There are high-end and low-end boats, as there are in many businesses, and the price will reflect the quality, style, and size. Even the resale value of new boats is factored into the buying price - boats from reputable manufacturers with a reputation for quality and safety will be more expensive. A larger yacht will obviously cost more than a tiny fishing boat, but boats of the same kind can vary dramatically in price depending on the finishes chosen, whether they are limited edition models, have luxury finishes, improved features like as additional seating, or have customized interiors. A Lifestyle of Luxury So far, we’ve looked at the numbers that are concrete and can be factored into the total cost of building a boat. Then there's the luxury effect, which is difficult to quantify but has a significant impact on cost in a variety of ways. Non-working boats are clearly a luxury, something we enjoy, use to make memories with our families, relax on, and travel the world in. Extras & Add-ons Boats, like new automobiles, can come standard (factory built) or with a variety of optional add-ons to enhance the ride experience. Your desire for these extras, as well as your ability to afford them, will be determined by your budget and the amount of money you are ready to invest. Apart from that, after purchasing a boat you will need a vessel management software to monitor your business."

10,The Future Of The CMS: 4 Trends You Need To Act On Now,computers-technology," The history of content management systems came a long way - from brochure-type static content websites to dynamic ones to closed and open-source CMSs introduced in the early 2000s. Now in the 2020s, we face trends that may change how we work with the market and manage the content. Headless CMS In the logic of the traditional CMS, the back-end and the front-end of the website form one system. In practice, this means that each platform uses its own architecture, has its own content created for it, and has its own interface configured. Traditional, monolithic CMS consists of the following: A database to read and write into. An admin interface where editors manage the content. Integration of reading and writing. A front-end, which combines data from the database with HTML. The headless CMS lacks #4.  Instead, there is a RESTful or GraphQL API accessible by other systems to access the data managed in the Admin UI. How This Works And What Are The Benefits Since the front-end is not there, the developers now need to craft the website by themselves and use the REST or GraphQL APIs of their headless content management system to access the content. And here are some of the advantages of it: A developer can use any technology they prefer - they are not forced to work with the technology for a specific CMS. There is no need to deal with the bugs of the existing tech stack. It is easier to make radical tech decisions, relaunch part of the site or optimize for core web vitals and speed. Headless CMS is not restricted to websites, though - it can deliver content via API to wherever it's needed. There is a number of them available, with the following being among the most popular. Contentstack Companies such as Chase, Icelandair, Holiday Inn, Mattel, McDonald’s, Mitsubishi, Riot Games, Express, Sephora, and Shell trust Contentstack to take care of their content. It is a “headless” Content Management System that advocates for Microservices-based technology, API-first, Cloud-native SaaS, and Headless. Its pricing plans start at $995/month, with a free trial available. Cloud CMS It is an API-first, “headless”, cloud-based content management solution available via SaaS or On-Premise. The pricing starts at $200/month for the SaaS version. Among its partners - Docker, Evolved Media, Metaversant, Tenthline. Sanity Unlike the other two, Sanity has a free plan and uses a pay-as-you-go approach. Paid plans start at $99/month. It is a headless, real-time platform for structured content. In addition, it comes with an open-source editing environment called Sanity Studio that you can customize with JavaScript and a real-time hosted data store. Artificial Intelligence WYSIWYG interfaces and drag-and-drop builders were around for a while, but in the future, AIs are going to offer even more possibilities to content creators. An example of this is the integration of API through the AI-powered functionality to enhance the connection between the back-end and the display at the front-end. By adding AI to the mix, headless CMS can make content available on mobile devices via chatbot interfaces. In fact, according to the Driving ROI Through AI whitepaper, senior executives across industries shared that they intend to expand their AI-related budgets by 8.3 percent per year over the next three years. Growing Adoption Of Hybrid And Cloud-based CMS The headless CMS trend is growing, but not everyone buys into its concept - many publishers have issues with the absence of a visual interface there. That’s where hybrid and cloud-based CMS get a piece of the action. Hybrid CMS blends traditional and headless approaches into a single system - achieving both flexibility and context and creative control. This path works with lots of technology - for example, the world’s most popular CMS WordPress got headless traits with the addition of REST API. On the other hand, the cloud-based content management system is nothing new and has been around for a while. Yet it’s not going anywhere - more and more authors and businesses migrate to the cloud - this lets them simplify their content management and adds more efficiency and scalability to their operations. Voice-Based Search Optimization Forecasts suggest that the quantity of voice search assistants will rise to eight billion by 2023.  One of the ways how content management systems can take advantage of this growing trend is to offer optimization for voice search as part of the functionality. The most common type of query here is questions. People care about answers like who, what, where, when, why, and how, and they often look for something particular, for example: “Where is the best beach destination in Europe for an autumn vacation?” Smart devices prioritize different ranking factors and choose answers differently than text-based search. The answers they serve up are derived from SERP features, though, such as: Featured snippets. Knowledge panel, graph, and box. Directory listings. People Also Ask. Answer box. In addition, there are multiple voice search technologies in active use today - Apple’s Siri, Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Microsoft Cortana - so it is essential to keep all of them in mind. All this means that a good CMS needs to meet several requirements: It should make the website convenient for users on mobile. It should make it easy to optimize for voice search. It should make it easy to present your content appropriately: automated use of structured data like Shema.org, social tags like Open Graph, Title Tags, H1s, H2s, image Alt tag, and so on. There should be available integrations with local listings, data aggregators, and directories. It’s best to make life easier with automation: automated checks for broken links, sitemap updates, internal linking suggestions, and so on. Summing Up While going headless or keeping the traditional CMS depends on business needs, the AIs and the voice search are here to stay. Their usage will only grow more prominent with time until website owners have to adapt or go out of business. So why not move to secure an advantage now? Early adopters enjoy weaker competition, a bigger volume of potential customers. It is an excellent opportunity to consolidate the gains before the competitors catch up."
11,What Does Cyclonis Password Manager Do to Protect Your Passwords?,computers-technology," You probably know already that using Cyclonis Password Manager gives you the convenience of having your usernames, passwords, payment methods, and a whole host of other sensitive information available just a few clicks away. You probably know that only you can see it as well. But how does it all work? Encryption is the name of the game. When you save your passwords in Cyclonis Password Manager, they obviously need to reside in a computer file. To make sure that no outsiders can see them, however, they shouldn't be stored in a TXT or XLS document. That's why, Cyclonis Password Manager encrypts them. Some of you may think that encryption is the stuff of spies and clandestine government agencies. Others may think it's just witchcraft. In reality, it's neither of those things. When it comes to passwords, encryption is the action of turning your password into an unreadable string of characters that looks nothing like the original. It doesn't need to be complex. In fact, loosely speaking, just three components are needed for encryption to work: the input text, the key that encrypts and decrypts the information, and the encrypted output. One of the simplest encryption techniques, for example, is called the Caesar cipher. It works by replacing each letter in the plaintext input with one that is a set number of letters further down the alphabet. Although it traces its roots back to the Roman Empire, it still has the three basic components mentioned in the previous paragraph. For example, if we take ""password"" as the input (we sincerely hope that this isn't your actual password) and we use the Caesar cipher to shift each of the letters three positions down the alphabet (that's the key for encrypting and decrypting the data), we'll get ""sdvvzrug"" as the output. The output is unreadable, and, crucially, it doesn't look anything like the input, which is the whole point. Yet, if you know the key, decrypting it is fairly easy. How does Cyclonis Password Manager use encryption to protect your accounts? Obviously, things have moved on quite a bit over the last two millennia, and right now, protecting valuable information with such an ancient technique isn't really a good idea. Cyclonis Password Manager uses something much more modern - AES-256. AES stands for Advanced Encryption Standard, and it was established by the US Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001. 256 denotes the length (measured in bits) of the key that is used to encrypt and decrypt the information. 256 bits is the optimal length for the key because it makes the encryption both quick and secure. This particular form of AES is reliable enough to be used by government, military, and financial institutions across the globe, and if it's good enough to protect their secrets, then it should be good enough for you. The all-important key that is used to encrypt and decrypt your data is derived from the master password you assign. Since nobody else should be able to see your data, your master password is not stored or transmitted in any way. You are the only one who should know it and remember it. As it is used to protect all your information, your master password needs to be strong. At the same time, you shouldn't forget it because there's no way of resetting or recovering it. If you think that creating a strong master password that's also easy to remember is impossible, you can take a look at some of the tips we've given you to do just that: https://www.cyclonis.com/how-to-create-complex-memorable-master-password/ Just in case someone does manage to guess your master password, we've implemented a Two-Factor Authentication system that helps you retain control over your data. Enabled by default, it asks you for an additional verification code which is emailed to you every time you or someone else tries to log in to your Cyclonis Password Manager account from an unauthorized device. From a usability standpoint, there's a clear advantage to using Cyclonis Password Manager when compared to trying to remember all your login credentials. The thing is, you also need to be confident that you'll never lose track of all the data. Thanks to the tried and tested technology we've implemented, you can have the peace of mind you need. Visit https://www.cyclonis.com/products/password-manager/ today to download Cyclonis Password Manager and you will no longer have to use easy-to-remember passwords to protect your online accounts."
12,Windows 11 | A savior or a destroyer?,computers-technology," ""It's all about security, and it's going to be a costly upgrade — because most of us will need to buy new PCs to make it work."" Windows 11's ""why"" has been a mystery to me for a time now. I'm not the only one that has this problem. According to Computerworld, the Windows 11 release news has been largely positive ""Sometimes, it was flat-out incorrect or misinformed. Microsoft's lengthy history of product announcements may have been marred by the most disastrous unveiling."" Amen! Nothing else comes close to covering every Windows launch since Windows 95 came out in Atlanta. Yes, I'm including the Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates dance performance from 1995 as one of my favorites. Why is Microsoft publishing this? Why is Microsoft releasing this? Why are we doing this now? Clearly, it was rushed. Nobody outside of Microsoft saw Windows 11 coming even a month ago. Microsoft had made it clear that it sees the future of the desktop on the Azure cloud with Microsoft Cloud PC. It's not about money at all. For current Windows 10 users, Windows 11 will be a ""free upgrade"". Updated UI or new functionality aren't in the cards. It's wonderful to be able to run Android apps on Windows, but what's the point of releasing a new version? No, I don't believe so. Alors, qu'est-ce qui se passe vraiment? Windows 11 is truly all about security, according to Microsoft and the current ""If it's Tuesday, there must be a new security crisis"" reality. There's another huge Windows zero-day sprouting up as I write this, and it's a real pain in the rear end. PrintNightmare. It is possible for a hacker to take over your computer using the Windows printer spooler service. Security isn't glamorous, but it's necessary. Windows 10 is exactly as much of a security nightmare as ever. There are other factors at play, as well as Microsoft's own mistake. Intel's security is a disaster, too, according to a recent report. Security flaws Meltdown and Spectre are still fresh in your mind. Still around, and still coping with the repercussions from their actions. In WinTel, we get a huge mess. Is that the answer? It's official: Windows 11 won't operate on certain types of hardware. Along the way, it revealed why it is doing this. Yes, it's a matter of security. Virtualization-based security (VBS), hypervisor-protected code integrity (HVCI) and Secure Boot are among the new security features in Windows 11. Combining these characteristics has been found to minimize malware on tested devices by 60%. For this reason, all Windows 11-compatible CPUs include an integrated Trusted Platform Module (TPM), enable secure boot and have VBS and specialized VBS features built in. So, what does this imply for us? It's bad news. The majority of us will not ""upgrade"" our Windows 10 computers. Instead, we'll invest in new computers. Microsoft claims, in particular, that it is ""We're sure that devices powered by Intel's 8th-generation CPUs, AMD's Zen 2, and Qualcomm's 7 and 8 Series will fulfill Windows 11's security and reliability standards, as well as the minimal system requirements. We will test to find devices operating on Intel 7th generation and AMD Zen 1 that may fulfill our standards when we deliver to Windows Insiders and collaborate with our OEMs."" We still don't know anything about 7th-generation CPUs like Kaby Lake processors. (To tell you the truth, I don't think they'll work.) Microsoft has also clarified that your PC must contain Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 hardware — and that your computer's software must be adjusted to enable it. TPM 2.0 generates and protects encryption keys, user credentials, and other sensitive data, preventing viruses and attackers from accessing or tampering with it. Isn't it great that you can use the PC Health Examine software to check whether your current fleet of PCs can run Windows 11? Wrong. While Microsoft admits that ""The PC Health Check app was designed to help people determine if their current Windows 10 PC could be upgraded to Windows 11..., but it wasn't fully prepared to provide the level of detail or accuracy you expected from us when it came to why a Windows 10 PC didn't meet upgrade requirements. As a result, we're deleting the app for the time being so that our teams can respond to the comments. We'll bring it back up in the fall, in time for wide availability."" Now, come on. Inside Microsoft, there was clearly no beta-testing of Windows 11 worth the name. Windows 11 is being pushed out the door as quickly as possible, with Microsoft implying that it will be launched on Oct. 20 and that new Windows 11 PCs will be available in the fourth quarter of 2021. Right. What a stroke of luck. Yes, both Windows and your business require stronger security measures to protect themselves. As I study this issue, I see a hurried operating system that's extremely likely to have regular problems and will force you to acquire expensive new hardware. Let's be honest. As of this winter, Windows 11 will not be ready for regular companies or individuals to use. On a brand-new PC with the newest hardware, since that's what I do, I'll run the game. Why don't you tell us about yourself and your company? Windows 10 is your best bet for now. Prepare yourself to remain with Windows 10 until 2023, if not beyond. Windows 11 might be ready for business by January 2023. In the second half of 2021, maybe? In the year 2022? I don't see it. Written by Senuke Weragama"

14,El Salvador Adopts BitCoin,computers-technology," El Salvador Adopts BitCoin copyright 2021, Steve Burgess El Salvador just passed a law to make BitCoin (BTC) legal tender and is the first country to do so. It did something similar back in 2001, when it made the US Dollar the official currency, replacing the Salvadoran Colón (named after Christopher Columbus), which had been the official currency for more than a century. What’s interesting is that the dollar was adopted because it was a stable currency. It was adopted in hopes of stabilizing El Salvador’s economy. While BitCoin is joining the dollar as legal currency, one would be hard-pressed to find a less stable financial platform. BTC is known for its wild fluctuations, although it also has had a dramatic upward climb in value during its just over a decade lifetime. How did Salvadoran BTC adoption come about? A few things came together. 70% of Salvadorans don’t use banks – whether through choice or through inaccessibility. Many in El Salvador get their income via remittances from family or friends in the US. In fact, 2.5 million Salvadorans live and work in the US and send $4.5 billion dollars in remittances to family and friends in the home country, but there are substantial fees and delays associated with getting that money home. An essential part of the adoption story was born in El Zonte, a small Salvadoran tourist town. It was frequented by Mike Peterson, a surfer and owner of a small concessions business in San Diego, who spent considerable time in El Zonte with his family when his own business was in the off-season. An anonymous Bitcoin millionaire heard about charity work Peterson was doing in El Zonte and offered a gift of $100,000, paid in Bitcoin, for Peterson to distribute there. Peterson worked with El Zonte locals to set up an organization called Bitcoin Beach in order to improve the financial fortunes of the locals while encouraging storekeepers, employers, and others there to accept Bitcoin as payment in this town that had never had a bank. Accessing a bank required a half day, but accessing an app on their phones was more or less immediate. Furthermore, an ATM was set up (again, the only one in town) that handles Bitcoin transactions. Then came the Covid. The country’s tourism industry collapsed and so did El Zonte’s local economy. Peterson started handing out about $35 to each of 500 of the town’s residents and won them over. Now about 90% of El Zonte’s inhabitants interact with BitCoin regularly. El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele, caught the BitCoin bug and found himself pushing his country’s legislature to pass a bill to make BitCoin a new coin of the realm – along with US dollars. A noteworthy line from the passed bill: ""It is necessary to authorize the circulation of a digital currency whose value answers exclusively to free-market criteria, in order to increase national wealth for the benefit of the greatest number of inhabitants."" By September, Salvadorans will be able use Bitcoin to buy goods and services from any Salvadoran business (with some exceptions for those that don’t have the capability) and to pay their taxes in Bitcoin. Here we might wonder about the sustainability of a currency that requires so much power to generate. It’s estimated that the amount of electricity needed to generate one BitCoin is equivalent to about two months of the energy needs of the standard US household, or more than six months for a Salvadoran household. This in one of the first countries to establish recognition of natural forests as a living entity as a part of the Rights of Nature in El Salvador, signed by the country’s National Assembly. Geothermal Power Well, there’s an answer for that. President Bukele has announced the establishment of a clean geothermal power plant run by “100% clean, 100% renewable, 0 emissions energy from our volcanos.” Without burning coal or atoms, and without diverting rivers, the plan will be to establish BitCoin mining within the country run by the existing power of the Earth’s own heat generators. While some are concerned that Bitcoin’s extreme volatility (you might say, volcanic) could dramatically harm El Salvador’s economy, Salvadoran lawmakers hope that this economic policy, along with cheap energy for cryptomining will attract investment and further provide previously unavailable financial resources for the 70% of Salvadorans who are unbanked. Additionally, the design ought to facilitate remittances. Remittances provide about 20 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. Because of Bitcoin’s ups and downs in value, President Bukele has announced that the country will provide a $150 million fund so that people can cash out their BTC for US dollars immediately. Some worry that will make El Salvador a safe haven for criminals hoping to launder their crypto there. Chivo! To promote the Salvadoran Bitcoin transformation, the government is setting up a Bitcoin digital wallet, called Chivo (""cool"" in Salvadoran slang), with $30 for every Salvadoran citizen that uses it. There are certainly some additional potential roadblocks, such as the fact that only about 45 percent of the population in El Salvador has internet access. Will El Salvador overcome these potential problems to become a Bitcoin powerhouse. Will El Zonte be the birthplace of El Salvador successfully surfing a cryptocurrency wave, doing a 360 to a future that will pull many out of poverty? Or is it in for a rough ride, ultimately an economic wipeout? Time will tell."
15,Essential Guide On Interlocking Plenum Armored Fiber Optic Cable,computers-technology," As technology advances, the demand for improved data bandwidth increases. So, fiber optics are gradually replacing copper wires as the network backbone. These cables are installed in overhead ducts, conduits, or buried underground. Hence, they are prone to damage from bending under excessive physical strain or gnawing by rodents and pests. To ensure the cable laid out for extreme environments is protected against them, cable manufacturers also created a special line of Armored Fiber Optic Cable. The fiber core is protected with an aluminum armor helically covering the fiber or kevlar strands to protect the cable from crush force. An armored fiber optic cable with a helically wrapped aluminum armor and usually installed in the plenum area of the building is called Interlocking Plenum Armored Fiber Optic Cable. The Construction Standard fiber optic cables have a glass core surrounded by a denser cladding and a PVC jacket for protection. Armored fiber optic cables go a step ahead and have a fire-retardant Aramid yarn between the cladding and the outer PVC covering. An aluminum covering is helically woven across the PVC jacket. As seen in the image below, the aluminum covering has ridges that offer crush protection to the cable without restricting the cable flexibility. Due to the way the ridges “interlock” with the preceding ridge, these cables are termed ‘interlocking armored fiber optic cable.’ How to terminate the cable Due to the construction of the cable, you cannot implement traditional termination methods directly. Instead, a specialized tool called the BX & Armored Cable Cutter is used to slice the outer aluminum armor to access the inner fiber. Once you have removed the outer jacket, exposing the aluminum armor, the tool is clamped into place. Then, by rotating the spindle, a small circular cutting blade cuts through the armor to make a small slit. By gently flexing the cable, the armor separates, exposing the inner PVC jacket that can be terminated for attaching connectors. Benefits & Applications of Armored Fiber Cables The benefits of using armored fiber optic cable are: Excellent attenuation performances Protected from water or moisture penetration Crush protection Protection against rodents gnawing the cable Flexible yet sturdy Fire-resistant Places where armored fiber cables are best suited are: Surveillance Data centers with underground cable laying. Specialized cables with water block gel are used for underwater networks near shores. Places where the cables need to be run in tight areas such as overhead conduits, ducts, or plenum area. Video broadcasts Fire & safety alarm systems. Wrapping Up Interlocking plenum armored fiber optic cable resulted from the need to have a network that provides high speed and bandwidth of the traditional fiber optic with additional protection measures for the harsh conditions. You buy them in bulk and have them terminated on the field or eliminate extra work by opting for pre-termination from the factory."

17,Hikvision Thermal CCTV Cameras for Perimeter Security in SMEs,computers-technology," It is often believed that technologies such as thermal detection are only affordable for projects with huge budgets; the reality is that this technology is sufficiently developed and widespread to be affordable and very useful for small and medium-sized companies. Many technologies that we can see anywhere today were used for the first time in military fields, for example radars and GPS. However, over time, mature technology and products become more widespread, resulting in significant cost reductions and that these types of technologies can be used in small and medium-sized companies. Currently, small and medium-sized companies have among their priorities to have security systems and technological tools that help them combat insecurity and theft. Although in light of the figures provided by the Colombian Government, between January 1 and April 11, 2019, theft from businesses fell, from 18,059 cases, to 9,962 cases (a reduction of 49% compared to the same period of the previous year), the figures provided by the National Administrative Department of Statistics (Dane) show that 44% of Colombians feel insecure, that is, 16 million people believe that they may be victims of some crime in the national territory. Surveillance cameras have become the preferred choice of organizations for creating safer environments, due to the amount of visual data they capture and allow better and more informed decisions. Hikvision offers a range of thermal cameras affordable ideal for perimeter protection in small and medium applications: residential areas, office buildings, parking lots, factories, shops and even museums. Thermal technology works by using heat sensors to measure the infrared energy radiated by the elements within their field of vision and translating the different temperatures into an image, allowing the detection, in real time, of people or vehicles that violate the perimeter defenses, even in low light and low visibility conditions. This technology, which has been used for a long time in complex security environments, such as border and airport, is not affected by adverse factors such as fog, offering unparalleled performance and a good range of benefits for those who use it. install: The ability to detect intruders in low visibility conditions: Thermal cameras can recognize small changes in temperature, allowing them to detect people or vehicles crossing perimeter boundaries, even under low light or visibility conditions. More efficient perimeter protection: Small and medium-sized businesses can reduce equipment and installation costs for their perimeter protection solutions and use fewer personnel to monitor camera images, as thermal cameras are more effective at longer distances than many conventional cameras. Perimeter protection for SMEs: For SMB managers, intrusion prevention is one of the most important measures in property protection, but business owners and operators tend to focus more on alarm accuracy and CCTV implementation, CCTV, to monitor. And it is that users often believe, erroneously, that thermal technology is only installed in large and expensive projects, without knowing that in recent years, with the rapid development of thermal detector technology and the popularization of the use of thermal products on the application side, the cost of using thermal technology has drastically decreased and it has become possible to implement it in small and medium-sized enterprises for the security of their perimeters. “Hikvision in Colombia has thermal cameras that help protect different industries and spaces. They have built-in specialized lenses that allow you to capture sharp, high-resolution video without requiring any lighting for detection, so there is no need for expensive lighting installations, yet still work with longer detection ranges than CCTV cameras. traditional, which means less cameras, poles and other equipment are needed,” said Rubén Trujillo, Hikvision Pre-Sales Engineer. These cost-effective technological solutions already facilitate operation for many users in their SMEs, thermal cameras are free of special lighting requirements, so they can be used in a wide variety of scenarios, they also have algorithms deep learning that reduce false alarms and the increase in operating costs that these imply."
18,The Best Creative Marketing Strategies for Cannabis Companies,computers-technology," If you have a business for any industry marked by stringent regulatory considerations, you must be achingly familiar with the restrictions in the way your services can be marketed. You can trust me on this as I have been intimately connected with the digital marketing domain for the last five years. It will not be an exaggeration if I go to the extent of calling it my second home! One thing that has become blatantly clear is the tough times that a business operating in the cannabis, alcohol, or tobacco domains are facing regarding their marketing. I will focus on cannabis here, which is federally illegal in many American states. It creates various problems for cannabis brands. A variety of marketing platforms have completely banned advertisements that portray cannabis products. Although such restrictions are unfair on cannabis companies since they operate legally, you cannot escape the fact that today, successful marketing for cannabis businesses has become an uphill battle. But don’t get disheartened. Believe me when I say that there are indeed many people waiting to see posts from you. It is just that you are not able to reach them because of the nature of your business. Did you know that expenditure on legal cannabis in North America is estimated to skyrocket from $9.2 billion to $47.3 billion by 2027? Allow me to divulge some of the intelligent ways your company can effectively market and reach out to a new audience. Here are some proven methods that will help you to recover your petering online and offline presence. Think about regional billboards Today in this era of internet marketing, people seem to have forgotten about billboards and how they can be a valuable marketing tool. In a lot of states where cannabis is legal, billboards can become your weapon of choice to put your brand straight in front of the eyes of your customer. People have become so used to seeing how-to tutorials on the internet that they have forgotten to explore this straightforward way of advertising. However, it is wise to throw some caution here. Certain cities have their own policies about advertisements related to cannabis. So, what can a cannabis company do when it doesn’t have a well-defined audience to start with? Well, make use of sponsorships. You can get sponsorship by negotiating with the company or running the event you desire to sponsor. The different media that cannabis businesses can sponsor include: Local podcast: Cannabis companies operating on a national scale can sponsor podcasts. Currently, there exists close to 850,000 active podcasts, and the number is only growing. A vast majority of podcasts are devoted to cannabis. Thus, legal cannabis companies can get lucrative sponsorship opportunities. YouTube sponsorships: They have become more popular than ever. Sponsorship can be in the form of running a short video ad of your brand at the beginning, in between, or the end of the video. Here again, there’s a word of caution for you. Specific terms of service govern youTube. So, you need to ensure that the sponsorships you negotiate are permitted on this online platform. YouTube sponsorships are a cost-efficient method to enhance your brand reach instantly and engage a broader audience base. SEO is synonymous with effective cannabis marketing. The ideal course of action for you would be to hire an SEO toronto agency that handles the complicated work of optimizing your cannabis business online. Ensure that you have a profile on Google My Business if you own a cannabis dispensary. It will allow Google to make sense of what your brand provides.

19,Digital Onboarding and No-code Platforms,computers-technology," Digital onboarding is still a solution used only by a few in the financial industry and HelloFlow sees the potential of digital client onboarding. We know that developing a company’s own digital onboarding process takes a lot of time and effort, one of the biggest challenges is developing the software and integrating it with the necessary KYC services. It’s not only time-consuming but also expensive. That’s the issue HelloFlow solves. We’ve created a no-code platform enabling companies to build their own client onboarding flows - and our process takes minutes, not months. What Does No-code Mean? The no-code solution enables users to build, adjust and launch the project even without coding knowledge. It uses a drag-and-drop method with an intuitive interface to build the onboarding flow from start to finish. Users can easily adjust the design in the designer tool using the editor bar or decide to add a new step to the process. All that can be done without having to write a single line of code. It means that anyone across different departments can create a new onboarding process within minutes. HelloFlow enables not only your customer experience but allows you to leverage talent from across your organization due to our no-code user-friendliness. Benefits of No-code Agility The main benefit of using a no-code platform is agility. Since such tools use pre-built modules it’s even easier and faster to build an onboarding flow compared to the traditional product development process. Developing your own in-house solution requires many teams to be engaged in different aspects and stages of product creation. HelloFlow’s no-code platform enables just one person to build and launch the entire flow within minutes. Cost Reduction Another benefit of a no-code platform is cost reduction. Developing the entire solution takes a lot of time and money as you need to engage a team of developers. It means that it takes months before the onboarding process can be implemented into your website or product, much less tested, analyzed, and adjusted accordingly. A no-code platform can help you bypass that expense and administrative backlog. It’s especially helpful in the long run. HelloFlow’s platform has plenty of services already integrated into it. It reduces any extra costs related to the implementation of new services, especially while planning an international expansion. Flexibility Finally, there’s also the benefit of flexibility. Traditional coding is very limited when it comes to any sudden changes. HelloFlow, on the contrary, provides a no-code platform that allows you to make changes in a matter of minutes and on the fly. You can update the design or add an extra step to your onboarding process without having to contact an IT team. Easily manage your process through visual real-time modeling, or improve different steps of the onboarding process all in the same breath. No-code and KYC One of the biggest challenges of onboarding in the financial industry is compliance. It’s also an issue that prevents or, at least slows down the process of digital onboarding implementation for financial institutions. With traditional coding, the development and integration of new identity verification services take a lot of time. Considering how often the regulations change, this process may be even longer and more tiresome. No-code platforms offer a range of services for identity verification. HelloFlow’s platform includes both electronic identity verification services and identity verification tools based on document scanning or facial recognition. Besides that, there are also services enabling screening against global watchlists to ensure AML compliance. Moreover, our platform enables an automated channel for client data monitoring, thereby enabling companies to run background checks to ensure KYC compliance. No-code and Security In digital finance, security is as important as it is in the real world. With growing threats, including data compromise, fraud, and account takeovers - financial institutions must increase their vigilance at every step. It usually entails data encryption and lots of coding. But if a no-code platform doesn’t require coding how is it secure? Simple - the security features of our platform are automatically applied to any onboarding flow built on the HelloFlow platform. It means that all data is securely encrypted to prevent any threats, and the platform user ultimately controls how certain data can be viewed internally."

1,On-Page SEO and Off-Page SEO Tips,computers-technology," On-page and off-page optimization are both necessary to optimize any web page. On-page optimization focuses on the use of specific keywords to create a web page. Off-page optimization focuses on building links to the page from other websites and web pages. Ranking algorithms for the top search engines have made links so vital that it is impossible to rank high on search engine results pages if you only focus on keywords. Links Two types of links are used in websites. The navigational link connects pages within a website. Hypertext links are those that provide parenthetical material or footnotes, digression, or parallel themes and can be used to provide information related to the main page content. If not used properly, both types of links can cause disruption or problems in site design. If a paragraph or text contains invitations for readers to visit other pages or websites, it can distract attention. As readers move from one site or page to another, this can disrupt the flow of information. Information can be altered entirely if readers are placed in unrelated areas without any explanation or introduction. Links are used to reinforcing the original message of an author by offering a variety of related materials. The links should point to other resources on the site that uses similar visuals or texts. A reader must be aware of when they link to another website. Good hypertext linking is about maintaining a site's contact with its readers. A simple link works in one browser window. The linked page replaces the original content. You can avoid this by adding the ""main"" argument to your link tags. This will allow the linked page to appear in a new browser tab in front of the original. This allows the reader to access the new material without losing a visual connection with the original site. Frames are another way to preserve narrative and design context. Frames are used to divide the browser screen between site navigation and the content to be displayed. You can provide website navigational links via plain text, JavaScript, PHP, or graphical links. Simple text links are the easiest to implement, and they are recommended regardless of whether other link types are being used for navigation. They are easily accessible by all search engines, but they can be challenging to maintain for sites with more than 50 pages. This can be fixed by paying attention to website design. JavaScript navigation can be used to create complex drop-down menus on large websites. Although it allows for easy changes once implemented, it requires more expertise and knowledge to implement. Search engines do not use this type of link, so the pages referred to by these links may not be indexed without another form of navigation. The Relationship Between Usability and Linking The ability to learn and complete a task confidently with minimal discomfort for the user is called usability. A website designer or developer will consider usability to be the ability to create and use websites that are easy to understand and can be used to accomplish a task. It's about anticipating customers' needs to help them achieve their goals through a true and accurate website to their purpose of providing information or at least access to it. An easily navigable website will reap the rewards of customer satisfaction and conversion. Websites should tell customers what they are all about and explain what products or services are offered. It should also be able to meet both search engines' and humans' needs. Both want to understand a page and know how to navigate to the next page. It is essential to understand and speed up the website's information structure. SEOs' primary goal is to get client websites into search engines and directories and have them ranked high enough to be found, end-users. SEO and marketing should go hand in hand to ensure that site owners have top spots in search engines and convert customers. Website developers must be able to build websites that are useful to people, not search engines. The source anchor and destination anchor are the ends of a link. Link refers to both the source anchor and the destination anchor. The link target is, however, the term used more commonly. A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) can be used on the World Wide Web to refer to a page, web page, or another resource in a document. It can also refer to an HTML element that is added to a webpage. Hyperlinks are displayed in web browsers using a distinguishing method such as a different font, color, or style. A link may be identified in a graphical user interface using a mouse cursor that changes into a hand motif. Most links in visual web browsers will display underlined blue text if they are not cached and purple text if they are cached. Every website owner dreams of having the correct link at the right place and on the right page. Many pages include the main navigation that allows you to navigate the essential sections of the site. You may also see links that point to privacy policies. Many sites use secondary navigation to link to pages within specific departments. Secondary navigation can provide different links within a section, proving very useful to search engines and users. Navigational links are usually found in content-rich areas of a page. Links embedded in text on web pages are widespread, which is beneficial for search engine optimization. This practice can lead to the reader's natural tendency to scan pages, resulting in missed links. Embedded links must be placed in the content so they can be easily seen. Too many links can make it difficult to read text on a page. Limit the number of links that are important to you and only include those links. You can place the rest of the links in other areas of the page."
2,The Different Ways That Internet Usage Can Impact Your Business,computers-technology," Internet has changed the way we do business. Businesses are acquiring more consumer data and engaging in buying behaviors and making marketing strategies according to the study. Innovative new business models are constantly coming up. Everyone is looking for unique internet business ideas. While there are many business concepts that have developed through innovation, some have a much better chance of success when implemented properly. The first concept that we need to look at is that of communication. In order for us to communicate with each other and with our customers, we need to find a way to get our messages across without drowning us in the text. Some people use voice to talk over the phone, but this method is very time consuming. For this reason, short messaging service (SMS) is used for many forms of communication. SMS allows us to send instant messages from our computer to another computer, mobile phone, or mobile device. Text messaging is not only used for communication, but also advertising. The most common form of advertising today is through banner ads on the web page. Other kinds of advertising include pop-ups and advertisements that come up when you visit certain websites. These kinds of advertisements are usually not noticed by passers-by, but when they are clicked, they bring you to a separate website where you will find information about the company that is advertising. The next concept that we need to look at is that of internet use and the relationship between the use of internet and the economy. Most business people realize the value of advertising to increase awareness of products and services. They also realize that a good deal of lost revenue can be offset through careful use of internet. This means that when people are aware of a particular business or product, they will make a purchase. In today's information age, most people rely heavily on the internet for research purposes. When the Internet was first introduced to the world, it was considered a novelty. Fast forward to 2021 and the use of internet in research are commonplace. This means that the use of the internet to gather information about products or services is no longer a novelty. The last concept we need to look at is the impact of social media. Many business people are now more likely to interact with their customers online than they are in person. This interaction can often lead to more sales and, as a result, increased profitability. Social networking sites such as MySpace and Facebook allow people to share information about their lives and businesses with others who are also part of that network. As more people begin to build social networks, the importance of using the Internet becomes more evident. Marketing through the use of blogs is also becoming commonplace in marketing efforts. The blog allows people to express themselves in a sort of diary, and businesses can take advantage of this writing to market their product. One of the disadvantages of blogging is that, if you are not careful, it can easily get out of hand and become a place for people to vent. However, as long as you make sure your content is relevant, you will be able to help your cause and draw traffic to your website. By examining how different elements of internet usage impact your business, you will be able to determine how to use the medium to its fullest potential. By having an understanding of what the different ways are for getting the most from internet usage, you will be able to use it to its fullest advantage. Not only does the Internet help in increasing your company's visibility, but it also allows for greater levels of communication between your employees. It also allows for you to better manage your budget."

4,SEO Services - What Are They? When and How to Use Them,computers-technology," What exactly are SEO Services? SEO services are basically Search Engine Optimization services designed to increase online visibility and subsequently organic search traffic to sites. SEO can be quite a daunting task to do yourself as there is a huge amount of work to do. Most people don't know where to start. This is especially so if you have no experience whatsoever in search engine optimisation. This is where professional SEO services come into their own - these companies specialise in helping businesses gain the most from their online presence. These are usually provided by freelance or agency professionals who are experienced in all facets of SEO. However, it is always advisable to utilise a company that is known to offer quality SEO services. If you are planning to utilise any of the new services to help your company achieve online success, then there are several things you should be aware of. The most important thing to know about SEO is what strategy an SEO service company will use to boost your ranking in search engine results. Most of them offer their service based on a two-prong approach. These are usually keyword analysis and link building. Keyword analysis is where the SEO company will examine the current search terms that your competition is ranking for and find opportunities to rank your website/ business for similar keywords. The second part of the keyword process is to look at how you can improve upon the keywords that are already ranking well so that your website will be ranked higher. Having completed the keyword analysis the web SEO service will create quality backlinks that point at your website and use variations of those words in the ""anchor text"" (linked text). The best place to start looking for SEO services in any large city is probably by looking at the backlinking services of some of the larger guest post outsourcing companies. A lot of them will offer both comprehensive SEO and digital marketing services. Generally, this includes pay-per-click management and social media strategies. These companies should also conduct keyword research for you to ensure that your website is optimised for the search engines like Google and Bing. This will allow your site to be ranked for the right keywords and will give you a great internet marketing strategy. Optimisation for the search engines like Google means that your website will be optimised to drive the highest possible amount of closely targeted search traffic. It is important for your business website to have relevant and well-written content that has been researched and optimized for the search engines. But that's not all. To achieve good rankings in Google and other popular search engines, you need to make sure that your website has a good page speed. The page speed of a website is determined by many factors including page title length, header tags and image sizes/ compression applied. These things are not set in stone and your SEO consultant can advise you on what is best for your business website. As we have mentioned already. The other major component of successful internet marketing and SEO is link building. Link building is very important for any business that wishes to rank highly in search engines like Google and Bing. There are several off-site optimization methods including guest blogging, forum posting, directory submission and social media marketing which work well. Most off-site optimization techniques are used to build backlinks to your website. SEO consultants in any major city can advise you on which off-site optimization techniques are most suitable for your business needs. This includes optimizing your company website, social media accounts and blogs with targeted keywords so that your business can achieve maximum exposure and potential customers can find your site easily. SEO professionals can offer you a wide range of services that will help you get to the top of the search engine results pages quickly and effectively. If you are considering using off-site SEO techniques to boost your web presence then it is important to work with a professional service provider that can provide you with a bespoke SEO strategy tailored to your requirements. It is a good idea to talk to an SEO consultant about your company's current strategy so that you can make initial changes and updates to the strategy as necessary. The initial free keyword analysis offered by some services should be followed up with regularly scheduled audits and reviews to ensure your strategies are meeting your business objectives."

6,6 Myths of Charging Smartphones Batteries that are Wrong,computers-technology," Some of you may have heard the notion about charging smartphones such as only charging when the cellphone battery is empty or never charging the cellphone overnight. No one knows who started that opinion or assumption, but many people end up believing it. Some of them are not true or just myths or misunderstandings. For a more complete review, here are 7 myths about charging the wrong smartphone. Even if you charge your cellphone overnight, your cellphone will not be overloaded or damaged (provided that the socket and charger used for charging are not problematic). Most modern cellphones currently use lithium-ion batteries that will stop receiving power when they are fully charged. That is, even if your HP is full and still in a charging position, no power will enter your HP. However, that doesn't mean you have to always charge your cellphone all night, every day. This assumption is not true because you can charge your charger as often as you want. Lithium-ion batteries on HP today have a charge cycle, an average of 500. One cycle counts if you charge it fully from 0 to 100 percent. However, if you charge from 70 to 100 percent then, you only use 3/10 of a cycle. Therefore, experts recommend charging when the battery is 40 to 80 percent remaining so that you can maximize one cycle, which can extend battery life. While there are many grounded concerns about this issue, it is fundamentally untrue. You can use your cellphone while it's charging, as long as you use the original charger and the battery on your cellphone is not a third-party battery. In addition, you also need to pay attention that the stop you use does not matter. Most cases of HP exploding during use are caused by the use of a problematic non-genuine charger. In addition to external factors also contribute as one of the causes of HP teasing when used. Non-original chargers like those made by Anker and RavPower are not expensive but still safe to use. Although not recommended more than the original charger, at least the chargers made by big-name brands are safer and better than fake ones at affordable prices. So, there is no such thing as a non-genuine charger that can damage the battery as long as it doesn't come from an obscure brand or at a super cheap price. Even so, it is still recommended to use the original charger as the main charger. There are lots of people out there who, when their phone has a problem and don't want to fix it right away, turn it off right away. This may not be a problem for a damaged cell phone that can't be helped, but it can be detrimental for a cellphone that will someday be repaired. Turning off the old cellphone can have an impact on battery life and performance when the cellphone is used again. You don't have to turn off that kind of HP all night. Once a week is fine. Like a motorcycle, HP also needs to be ""warmed up"". Safety rules recommend unplugging the charger immediately after charging to avoid a short circuit. However, just like the previous points, this rule applies more if the cable or charger used is problematic or not original. However, you need to immediately unplug the charger cable from your cellphone in some conditions. Some of them are like when the charger gets hot quickly or makes a splashing sound. If your charger has a problem like that, buy a new and original charger. That was a review of some of the myths about charging the wrong smartphone. Hopefully, the above information is useful and can give you a new and truer view of charging your smartphone."

10,Artificial Empathy,computers-technology," How is artificial empathy compared to human empathy and ethics in decision making and what are some of the early business use cases of artificial empathy ? Abstract : Companies with humanistic and ethical principles at their heart may benefit from this approach to establishing their organizations. People are prone to a variety of cognitive biases. Empathetic artificial intelligence systems will be able to infuse more empathy into the way their operations are handled. Empathy in AI systems may enable us to take the first step toward functioning artificial general intelligence, which will empower humankind. This article will explore how empathetic artificial intelligence is compared to human empathy and ethics and if Empathy in AI systems can enable better decision making. The article will also look into some early use case of empathetic artificial intelligence. Keywords : Affective, Artificial Empathy, Congitive, Emotional Intelligence, Maslow’s Hierarchy, Human Empathy, Somatic, Singularity, Synthesis. Introduction Most of us want to think of ourselves as rational beings. In reality, our emotions control a significant portion of our cognitive abilities. Human beings are highly sociable animals. Empathy is essential for our survival. Neuroscientists verified in a research that emotional intelligence and cognitive intelligence share numerous brain systems that are involved in the integration of cognitive, social, and affective processes. ( Aron 2021 ) This research supports what psychologists have known for decades: that emotional intelligence and general intelligence are intertwined and interdependent on one another. When we speak of people living ethical lives, we often refer to a life in which we are able to demonstrate a high level of empathy. We may use our empathy to engage with our environment and come to a common understanding with others. In the same way, when it comes to artificial intelligence, the purpose of employing empathy in AI for particular business cases in order to improve our enterprises may significantly raise our chances of engaging in ethical business practices. As a result, there may be an increase in empathy across the business. Human Empathy & Ethics vs. Artificial Empathy Empathy will be critical in artificial intelligence systems if we are to get toward artificial general intelligence. Artificial empathy is distinct from human empathy in the same way that human intelligence is distinct from artificial intelligence. Artificial empathy, is defined as the coding of empathy into robots. He defines artificial empathy, sometimes known as heartificial empathy, as being personal, situational, and dependent on the acceptable motives of the person exhibiting it. Because empathy can be taught, artificial intelligence will almost certainly be equipped with artificial empathy in the not-too-distant future. Empathy is the process of slowly and truly seeing the world through the perspective of another person. It is not something that can be acquired in school; rather, it must be developed throughout a lifetime. ( Minter, 2018 ). In order for agents to be aided by machines in delivering more empathetic and effective service, the issue will be to establish the correct composition and chemistry for the agents to be aided by machines."" ( Minter, 2018 ). Taking cognisance of acceptable use cases for artificial empathy, companies may then incorporate greater empathy into their operations and the services that they deliver to their consumers. The issue over whether or not to include empathy into AI systems is also entwined with the question of ethics. Some believe that incorporating human emotions into artificial intelligence would lead to Singluarity. It's reasonable that we're afraid about the Singularity coming our way as it is possible for artificial intelligence to one day supplant humankind. ( Jayshree, 2019 ). In recent years, as artificial intelligence systems have been a bigger and growing part of our workplaces and homes. We are becoming more worried about the ethics of artificial intelligence. Is the progess of artificial intelligence bringing out the best in humanity and improving the quality of our human lives. When we speak of people living ethically, we are likely to use our empathy to engage with our environment and come to a common understanding socially. ( Charles, 2015 ) People who work for compassionate organizations have a greater likelihood of living an ethical life than their counterparts. In the same way, when it comes to AI, the purpose of employing empathy in AI for particular business cases in order to improve our enterprises may significantly raise our chances of engaging in ethical business practices. Early Use Case of Artificial Empathy In order to attain artificial general intelligence, an artificial intelligence must make judgments based on empathy. This implies that the system must be integrated into the ""artificial brain"" in order to have an impact on both cognitive and emotional processes at once. ( Andy, 2020 ) Businesses must determine the proper use cases for empathy in order to design successful artificial intelligence systems that provide value to their operations. One early use case is in customer care.  A customer care chatbot may converse with the client in the same way as a human would. It will be possible for this chatbot to speak the programmed questions in a natural tone and with intonation. Once this is accomplished, the empathetic chatbot will be able to detect complicated emotions such as frustration based on the replies of the customer. When a consumer expresses abnormally high levels of frustration, the chatbot may determine whether or not to transfer the consumer to a human support person based on the quality of the emotional experience the consumer has had. When an empathic chatbot senses pleasure and pleasure from a consumer, the chatbot has received genuine confirmation of the consumer's contentment. In other words, rather of having the impression that you are talking to a machine, the experience of conversing with an empathic robot might be far more intimate. Another more effective use case of empathy in artificial intelligence to assist others is in the realm of healthcare. Nursing and medical professionals who care for dementia patients have a severe emotional challenge. The application of empathy by AI robots in the treatment of dementia patients may prevent doctors and nurses from being ""burned out"", and hence improving the quality of service. Their responsibilities include collaborating with nurses to monitor patients and providing daily care. Patients with dementia who get regular, empathic care report better results, on the other hand. Can Empathetic Artificial Intelligence Make Better Decisions? When it comes to Artificial Intelligence systems, one of the most common complaints is that they are unable to ""explain"" how they came to their conclusions or judgments. As a result of incorporating the Emotional Processing Unit – EPU into their AI systems, these systems will be able to communicate the emotions that were utilized to make sympathetic judgments. ( Adam, 2020 ). A customized system, rather than a ""black box"" of training sets and data generalization across multiple kinds of data, is designed to meet the specific emotional demands of each individual consumer. Transparency in AI decision making will be improved through the use of empathetic AI systems, by detecting customers' emotional states that are driving the AI system's conclusions. Empathetic AI Systems may have a higher chance of garnering widespread acceptance if they include more openness into the decision-making process of the system. Conclusion As our artificial general intelligence systems progress toward artificial general intelligence, understanding application cases in which empathy might be beneficial in our AI systems will allow for more ethical implementations of artificial general intelligence. People are prone to a variety of cognitive biases. Once real-world use cases and applications have been specified, an emotionally intelligent AI may begin to focus on eliminating cognitive biases that are widespread in human beings, such as fear and anger. Artificial emotional intelligence, with the support of empathy in AI systems, may enable us to take the first step toward functioning artificial general intelligence, which will empower humankind. Those firms who use sympathetic artificial intelligence systems will be able to infuse more empathy into the way their operations are handled. As a result, companies with humanistic and ethical principles at their heart may benefit from this approach to establishing their organizations.

11,Darlox Electronic Limited: Fpc laminated structure,computers-technology," FlexiblePrinted Circuit, FPC is favored for its light weight, thin thickness, free bending and folding and other excellent characteristics, but the domestic quality inspection of FPC is still mainly rely on manual visual inspection, high cost and low efficiency. With the rapid development of the electronics industry, circuit board design is becoming more and more high-precision and high-density. Traditional manual inspection methods can no longer meet the production needs. FPC defect automatic detection has become an inevitable trend of industrial development. In consumer electronic products with movable structures (such as side-sliding mobile phones), in order to ensure that the product slides more than 150,000 times in the bent state, a single-layer FPC (flexible circuit board) is usually used to electrically connect two different modules . With the development of smart phones, their operating frequencies and transmission rates are getting higher and higher. When using MIPI or MDDI and other interface protocols, the impedance of the differential pair wiring needs to be controlled to a certain range, which requires that the differential pair signal corresponds to a layer Reference plane. In the existing technology, FPC design usually uses an additional layer or two layers of copper foil as the reference plane, which will double the cost. At the same time, increasing the number of copper foil layers will increase the thickness of the FPC and cause slippage. The performance is greatly reduced, and reducing the number of times the FPC slides affects the life of the product. If impedance control is not performed in the sliding area, product performance will be reduced. Basic structureedit Copper Film Copper foil: basically divided into electrolytic copper and rolled copper. The common thickness is 1oz 1/2oz and 1/3 oz Substrate film: There are two common thicknesses: 1mil and 1/2mil. Glue (adhesive): The thickness is determined according to customer requirements. Cover Film Cover film protection film: for surface insulation. Common thicknesses are 1mil and 1/2mil. Glue (adhesive): The thickness is determined according to customer requirements. Release paper: avoid the adhesive sticking to foreign matter before pressing; easy to work. Stiffener Film (PI Stiffener Film) Reinforcement board: Reinforce the mechanical strength of FPC, which is convenient for surface mounting operations. The common thickness is 3mil to 9mil. Glue (adhesive): The thickness is determined according to customer requirements. Release paper: avoid the adhesive sticking to foreign matter before pressing. EMI: Electromagnetic shielding film to protect the circuit inside the circuit board from outside interference (strong electromagnetic area or susceptible to interference area)."
12,The future development direction of artificial intelligence,computers-technology," The first trend is that all IT giants will deploy AI cloud services, AI-a-a-S, which means artificial intelligence as a service, which will become the future trend. AI is the future. It is a self-evident fact. New and old IT giants are not only actively using artificial intelligence in their own businesses, but also actively using cloud computing platforms to provide AI services to third parties. From the supply side, IT giants are very clear that as long as third parties use their own platforms, they will leave data on the platform, and these data will be a big gold mine in the era of artificial intelligence. From the demand side, those application companies can use AI cloud services provided by large companies to enhance their competitiveness. Therefore, this is a win-win cooperation for both AI service providers and companies that use AI services. The second trend is that new and old artificial intelligence companies will compete fiercely around smart entrances. In the Internet age, almost every entrance will cause competition, and the winner of every entrance competition will become the next giant. For example, in the Web2.0 era, the rise of interactive social networking has formed a social portal, creating Facebook and Tencent. The era of artificial intelligence is no exception. After the fierce competition, the next huge super enterprise will inevitably be born. In the era of artificial intelligence, the main service portal is voice interaction in natural language. Natural language processing will be the main mode of human-computer interaction. Whoever can make the machine understand human language better will be able to win. Artificial intelligence will completely surround all aspects of our lives, which means that the competition for artificial intelligence portals will be more fierce, and the earlier you participate and the more users you get, the greater the chance of victory. The third trend is that artificial intelligence will occupy the living room, and voice interaction will become the mainstream TV application. The concept of smart home has been shouting for many years. Bill Gates made a clear description in the 1995 Road to the Future, but such a description has not become a reality so far. The core reason lies in the lack of needs of users. Nowadays, with the increase of TV screen size and the explosive growth of video content, traditional remote controls are becoming more and more difficult to meet the needs of people using TV. Voice-based smart search and smart interaction are rapidly emerging, and natural language interaction will become TV manipulation. The standard way of the machine. Traditional TV manufacturers such as Samsung, video content providers such as Netflix and Amazon, and IT manufacturers such as Microsoft and Google have all launched or will launch their own TV-centric voice interactive products, and smart homes are becoming a reality from the TV set. The fourth trend is that smart toys will become one of the earliest successful application areas of AI. If AI is used to diagnose illnesses or make self-driving cars, people often cannot tolerate it making mistakes. But toys are different. People have a high tolerance for errors in toys. Therefore, today when artificial intelligence cannot surpass human intelligence, smart toys are precisely the entry point that allows artificial intelligence to gain initial market recognition. In fact, there are already many successful cases. For example, at the end of 2016, the smart toy Cozmo, which can play games with people, was sold out until it was out of stock. A large number of smart toys will be launched in 2017. Although China's toy manufacturing industry is strong, there is no brand advantage. If Chinese toy companies cooperate with high-tech companies and use their strong manufacturing and marketing capabilities to launch their own brands, they will have huge business opportunities."

14,Why Build a Website For Your Business?,computers-technology," Most of the business owners or corporate managers are doubtful about the contributions of a website to the business entity. They are arguing about the levels of the ROI (Return On Investment) on the website is not justified. Let me brief some of my points of view on this particular issue as below: For starting a traditional business, everyone is trying their best to do the greatest decorations of the shop front, for the purpose of attracting the maximum level of the customer flow in to the shop. It is actually the same reason that you will have to do the best on your website to attract the maximum flow of the internet customer flow. As a traditional business owner or manager, you might need to spend a lot more budget on the shop front renovation than the cost of building a great website(which might bring more businesses than your physical shop!). Important note: Most customers nowadays will actually try to understand your products and services through your website in the first place, and then only send in their request once they have enough confidence on your business, therefore you will only get to have their contacts and to discuss the details of their needs on your products and services. For promoting your business to the potential groups of customer, the marketing material such as flyers, brochure, poster and etc that you might need to print out and get your marketing company to distribute it. Unfortunately, your potential customer who received these physical marketing materials from you might be lost it in whatever reason. You know that these physical things that we just unable to keep it forever by our side. Therefore, you need your website not only to keep it, but promote it forever as you want it to do. Your website is your online sales representative. It promotes your business to the global market; It helps to get as many as it can to get them understand your business through the search engines such as Google, Yahoo, MSN and etc. Your website is also your online customer service representative. It serves to solve the problems of your customers, providing the after sell services, building up your business reputation and rapport with the customers. Your website is also your online business culture disseminator. The design style and contents are representing the unique culture of your business to the customers. The greatest internet is created for the sake of providing a CONVENIENT, SWIFTNESS, ECONOMIC environment for the communication. There is no doubt nowadays that we are able to enjoy the benefit of communicating through the internet either locally or globally among friends, colleagues, customers, suppliers and etc. We can also having to check on the sales records from the database instantly, reading the report that your investment consultant just have done and send over to you by the electronic mail. From the analysis of the source info of the visitor to your website, you will be able to justify the market situation that favor to your business nature. By the analysis of the numbers of the unique visitor, you can be able to justify the influential ability of your website. Your website can also be used to provide a questionnaire to be filled up by the visitors or customers, in order for you to understand the needs of them. Most of the people still think that website is only an advertisement section to display some of the info and images of your products and the services. Well, you will be misleading to a wrong direction if you do think so as they do. Website is not merely a display banner on the internet, it is a real company which is operating on the internet in a virtual way to serve your customer better than never."
15,Darlox Electronics Limited: One-stop solution reduces the barriers for customers to enter the industrial field,computers-technology," On April 14, the 2021 Munich Shanghai Electronics Show opened at the Shanghai New International Exhibition Center. As the only video interview and live broadcast platform officially designated by the exhibition, 8 themed live broadcast rooms were established in the exhibition hall. Internet of Things, Power Electronics, AI, Smart Healthcare, 5G, China Power"" as the main line and core content, invited more than 30 industry leaders to accept video interviews to share new industry trends, new product technologies, innovative solutions, etc. . Darlox Electronic Limited Internet of Things and Infrastructure Business Division System and Solution Marketing Department Director Wang Junfeng said in an interview with Electronics Fan Network in the ""Smart Factory"" video interview live room that Darlox Electronics' one-stop solution can help Customers lower the barriers to entry into the industrial field and quickly respond to market demands. Below is our detailed interview. At present, what solutions can Darlox Electronic provide in terms of smart factories? What are the technical advantages? Wang Junfeng: At this exhibition, we brought two sets of solutions: one set is an embedded object tracking solution based on Renesas’ single-chip MPU, which can be used to detect and track moving targets. The program uses RZ/A2M MPU, built-in Renesas Electronics' proprietary DRP technology. The DRP is an acceleration unit completely independent of the CPU, which can realize very advanced real-time on-site AI processing. It only takes 2.5ms from image input to object detection, which can realize very good object recognition. In addition, this solution is a real-time processing solution that combines image processing and servo control. A single embedded board completes the VGA 60fps image processing task and real-time adjustment of the servo control system. In other words, this solution can eliminate the need for dedicated vision and motion controllers to achieve a small-size and low-power solution. At the same time, because RZ/A2M has a large-capacity on-chip RAM, it can further reduce the system's BOM cost and meet real-time requirements. The other is a multi-protocol industrial Ethernet solution, which can cover all industrial Ethernet applications, including network reception, to network nodes, and cover the current mainstream industrial Ethernet, including Profinet, EtherCAT, EtherNET/IP, and so on. At the same time, in smart factory applications, Darlox Electronic Limited has launched a series of products ranging from RZT-N to TPS-1 at other edges, and R-IN32, covering everything from servos, industrial masters, to slaves, to Nodes and other aspects. It can be said that Renesas can provide a complete set of solutions in terms of smart factories."
16,Cyber Addiction - The Other Apocalyptic Virus,computers-technology," Cyber Addiction - The Other Apocalyptic Virus With all our attention focused on the COVID-19 outbreak, we are potentially overlooking the most threatening calamity of our generation - cyber addiction. The global pandemic is a trigger for this pre-existing crisis because virtual learning is only increasing the amount of time we spend glued to our screens. It is natural to expect increasing rates of screen time within adolescents and even children. We can’t control our screen time spent on online learning, although we can control the amount of screen time we spend on recreation such as social media, Netflix, instant messaging, and so on. If we don’t create and maintain balance in our use of screens for academics versus our use of screens for leisure and entertainment, we may be inflicting upon ourselves a deadly addiction to screens. Our electronics can become barriers that prevent us from productivity, and, inturn, success. Our ability to procrastinate will only grow with this addiction and our efficiency will weaken. Cyber addiction is often disregarded but we must give it equal importance as any other addiction because it is equally destructive, if not more. So, what is cyber addiction? True to its namesake, cyber addiction simply means the addiction to information technology. It is characterized by a compulsive and excessive use of screens. Many people worldwide inevitably experience cyber addiction, though it is often undiagnosed. People think it's completely harmless to spend a couple hours scrolling through Instagram or binging on some cat videos on Youtube, but there’s a fine line between responsible use and addiction. In fact, screens have become so convenient that we are becoming increasingly dependent on our devices to a point where our life revolves around them. Virtually it is impossible to imagine a world without our phones and computers. People are overusing their devices to a point where they are obsessively checking their phone every five minutes. For many adolescents nowadays, even performing a simple task seems impossible to do without using electronic devices simultaneously. For example, going on social media while using the toilet or watching Netflix while doing homework are all examples of the many multitasking uses of electronic devices. Many people can’t even watch television without using their phone at the same time.  People assume that they can use devices simultaneously while doing other work,  but studies show that multitasking is not possible. Research suggests that our brains are not nearly as good at handling multiple tasks as we like to think they are. In fact, some researchers suggest that multitasking can actually reduce productivity by as much as 40%. I recently conducted a survey asking twenty three adolescents around the world how much time they think they spend on screens excluding school work (this can be any electronic device). 40% of the respondents reported that they spend more than six hours of screen time on entertainment. 26% reported that they spend more than four hours. While this is just a small representation of massive numbers expressing hours of time of students dedicated to electronics, the global numbers are much higher. A CNN study suggests that US teens spend over seven hours everyday on their screens on average, excluding schoolwork. Other studies suggest even higher numbers of time spent online in teenagers - such as nine hours or more. So why are teenagers spending so much time on their screens? Teenagers use their screens for a variety of reasons, social media being a significant one. Many teenagers in my generation hold extremely active social media presences. This is because social media creates a naturalistic environment and allows them to connect with their friends immediately through instant messaging. Many teenagers spend hours chatting electronically but barely talk in person. They are more comfortable to converse through social media than face to face as physical communication is foreign to them. Online communicating has become more efficient than ever, and the global pandemic has forced us to make use of it. Teenagers also often overuse social media because of an undiscovered fear of missing out. It’s completely natural that teenagers have a strong desire to “fit in” and stay updated with all the current trends, and social media gives them a chance to feel connected to the rest of the world. The topics of pop culture are widely discussed between adolescents, and social media is a convenient way to allow adolescents to engage in conversations about the subject. Teenagers fear that without their active participation on social media, they will be disconnected to the rest of the world. There’s no harm in spending some time trying to be up to date with all the happenings of the world, but like mentioned above, balance is key. Why are our screens so addictive? According to Business Insider, software applications such as Instagram and Facebook are intentionally conditioning users to treat phones like a drug. The behavioural design of these programmes are coded to captivate public attention by increasing posts that appear to be of interest to each individual. These apps are deliberately designed to be addictive because the more time spent on the app, the more profit it generates. Using these apps may hamper productivity, but developers of the apps grossly benefit from the user’s waste of time. The respondents to my survey answered the following when asked why they spend so much time on their screens. “It's addictive, there's always something to do, and it's hard to put your device down when you get on. Especially with the pandemic, there isn't much to do, so sometimes your device is almost tempting.” “Well, I do procrastinate on school work sometimes, meanwhile I watch shows and youtube videos. For me, I lose track of the time while using my device for entertainment.” “I'm usually on my screen to do my school work, but I also am on it to talk to my friends and communicate with them.” “Since I can't really do anything other than look at screens and can't go outside much I think I've been spending 3 times the amount than when corona was not here.” “I prefer my screen life to my real life.” How are our screens harmful to us? As commonly said, an excessive amount of anything can become toxic. This cliché completely applies to screen time as well. There are many hazards and harmful effects that unrestrained amounts of time on screens can have on teengers. If children and teenagers are growing up reliant on screens, they will become adults with an even deeper addiction to electronics. Our generation, and the many to follow are becoming trapped into a cyber conducted cataclysm. Here are some (out of the many) ways that cyber addiction has proven to have toxic and negative impacts on us. Cyber addiction has been associated with depression and indicators of social isolation. Social media. The unrealistic lifestyles exhibited on social media often entrap people into a false belief that life is perfect for everyone else except for them. People find themselves with lower self confidence and an abundance of self doubt. People are losing their social skills as instant messaging replaces the concept of physical communication. We’re losing intellect. Electronic devices have become so convenient that it is no longer required to expand people’s critical thinking abilities. For example, people are reliant on calculators, analytics, and other tools that make work easier, but it limits the use of our own thinking. The more problems we solve  manually, the sharper we can hone our minds. Distracting notifications interrupt thought processes and reduce quality of work. People's long term memories are impacted by their dependence on technology because many daily habits that improve brain power have now been replaced by the functions of electronics. For example, instead of taking time to memorize phone numbers, we save contacts in a matter of seconds. According to Maria Wimber from the University of Birmingham, the trend of looking up information ""prevents the build-up of long-term memories”. Constant use of electronics shortens attention spans and makes it difficult to focus. Now that the negative effects of cyber addiction have been constructed, let’s think about the process of rehabilitation. Step 1. Recognize addiction Some people are so engrossed in their electronic devices that it starts to prevent them from completing more important duties of their daily lives (such as school, work, relationships). If any action or desire holds that much power over individuals, it is definitely identified as an addiction. Recognizing addiction rather than denying it is the first step to resolving it. Here’s how to identify addiction. Ask yourself the following questions : How often do you find that you stay online longer than you intended? How often do others in your life complain to you about the amount of time you spend online? How often do you find yourself anticipating when you will go online again? If you find yourself answering these questions with ‘frequently’, then you have a problem. Step 2. Drop the belief that there is nothing else to do. When the addiction is established, it is not to be ignored or accepted. Cyber addiction cannot be justified regardless by belief that there is a lack of other things to do. Being given a chance to be bored for once induces thought and awakens creativity. Cyber addiction suppresses imagination! There are a million things to do that don’t involve electronic devices. Step out of your comfort zone and try something new. Carve out a device free time period everyday. Here are some things to do aside from electronics : Try cooking! Play a sport Read a book (I can’t emphasize this enough, reading is magical if you find a good fit) Draw, paint, write! Take a walk, explore nature Workout! Organize your workspace or your wardrobe Meditate Ride a bike Listen to an educational podcast Read the newspapers, instead of social media alerts. Embroidery The possibilities are endless. Step 3. Start monitoring screen time It’s important to be aware of the depths of addiction. Monitoring screen time allows us to understand the magnitude of the addiction. Trust me, the numbers are shocking. The hours of time that people spend on screens are much higher than what they assume. Each time the phone is picked up adds seconds to the enormous daily total. Screen time can be set up on system preferences. This will visually represent screen use. Many smartphones also have the option to set up time limits that prohibit apps use after a certain time. If screens withhold people  from completing important work, creating to-do lists to distribute time is a balanced option. To-do lists and planners are very beneficial because they limit the chances of procrastination by reminding people of tasks that need to be done. Step 4. Delete apps that you waste time on! Spending hours scrolling through social media can be distracting individuals from daily tasks. Deleting engrossing applications such as Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat can be very liberating as it allows a detox from the sidetracking online world. Fear of missing out prevents people from doing so, but everyone should remember that they can download it again when the work is done. Deleting these applications allows people to actually notice and realize their constant urge to check notifications but they’ll also realize that life without these apps is much more meaningful. Conclusion : Master the addiction Remember, we control our electronics, not the other way around. With a balanced distribution of time on screen vs time off screen, cyber addiction can be overcome and people can learn to balance time on screens between academic use and entertainment use. People can choose to indulge spare time watching Netflix or communicating with friends, but it shouldn’t interfere with necessary aspects of daily life. People can choose to stay updated with the trends of pop culture, but it shouldn’t dictate their life. Everyone must remember that electronics are just devices for convenience and not our whole life! I hope this article helps acknowledge the severity of the underrated crisis of cyber addiction, and I hope that the readers are more motivated to improve their relationship with electronic devices."
17,Internet of things define,computers-technology," The Internet of Things define originated in the media field and is the third revolution in the information technology industry. The Internet of Things refers to the connection of any object to the network through information sensing equipment according to an agreed protocol, and the object exchanges and communicates through information media to realize intelligent identification, positioning, tracking, supervision and other functions. There are three key points in the application of the Internet of Things define, namely the perception layer, the network transmission layer and the application layer. “One sentence” to understand the Internet of Things define All items are connected to the Internet through information sensing equipment to exchange information, that is, to realize intelligent identification and management. Ubiquitous aggregation The industrial practice of the Internet of Things on a global scale is mainly concentrated in three directions. What is the Internet of Things in the sense of “ubiquitous aggregation” of data? The first practical direction is called “smart dust”, which advocates the interconnection and intercommunication of various sensor devices to form a network of intelligent functions. The second practical direction is the well-known logistics network based on RFID technology. This direction advocates strengthening the management of logistics and logistics information through the identification of objects, and at the same time forming intelligent information mining through information integration. The third practical direction is called the Internet of Things in the sense of “ubiquitous aggregation” of data. It is believed that the Internet has created a huge ocean of data, and the precise identification of the attributes of each data should be used to fully realize the resource utilization of data. It is not only an inevitable requirement for the in-depth development of the Internet, but also the mission of the Internet of Things. In comparison, the Internet of Things in the sense of “smart dust” belongs to the generalization of industrial buses. This kind of industrial practice has actually never stopped in industrial production since mechatronics and industrial informatization, but it was not called the Internet of Things at that time but called the industrial bus. In this sense, the Internet of Things will move forward steadily and steadily due to the development of sensor technology and various LAN communication technologies, based on its inherent scientific and technological laws, and will not accelerate its development speed due to a man-made movement. . The Internet of Things in the sense of RFID, the EPCglobal standard on which it is based was defined as the core standard of the future Internet of Things when it was launched, but the inherent limitations of this standard and its only method means RFID electronic tags make it difficult to truly point The smart planet advocated by the Internet of Things. The reason is that the information that the connection between things can tell people is very limited, and the connection between the state of the thing and the state can enable people to truly explore the universal connections between things, so as to obtain new information. Cognition and gain new wisdom. “Ubiquitous aggregation” is to realize the ubiquitous vast ocean of data created by the Internet, and to achieve aggregation in the sense of knowing each other. These data represent not only the object, but also the state of the object, and even various concepts defined by humans. The “ubiquitous aggregation” of data will enable people to retrieve all kinds of data easily and arbitrarily. With the help of various mathematical analysis models, they will continue to explore the ubiquitous complex connections between the transactions represented by these data. In order to achieve a revolutionary leap in human cognition of the surrounding world.

18,Smart Home Technology,computers-technology," Smart Home Technology What is Smart Home Technology? The number of smart gadgets has increased in recent years. Also, People can control anything remotely from anywhere using a single device, such as a smartphone or other networked computer. However, with the advent of new devices, we cannot predict what the future of Smart Homes will bring. It has a wide range of potential applications. However, the increasing trend in the number of smart home gadgets demonstrates one thing. That is, we now have smart home device alternatives than ever before. These devices can be controlled remotely from anywhere using a smartphone or other networked computer. Also, Home Automation is another name for it. Smart Home Technology includes appliances, home entertainment systems, home security systems, and environmental control devices. Furthermore, laptops and smartphones link to the internet, and a Home Automation System controls clocks, speaker lights, climate, entertainment systems, and appliances. When home devices connect to the internet, they become part of the Internet of Things (IoT). We frequently consider voice assistants to be the starting point for building our own Smart Home. They give family members or housemates a straightforward way to interact with one another. Many, but not all, of the items on our best Smart Home device list, will function with numerous voice assistants.  Following are some of the Best smart home gadgets you should consider purchasing. The Best Smart Home Devices in 2021 You can monitor everything from lighting and temperature to locks and home protection systems with one of the many smart home product categories. Some of the best products for the home are mentioned below. Home Security Cameras The Arlo Pro 4 Spotlight Camera is best for keeping an eye on what's going on outside without leaving the comfort of your couch. This high-resolution, weather-resistant surveillance camera captures motion-activated footage also shining a bright light on whatever is moving around in your home. Smart Plugs If you want to add some smarts to tiny home appliances like coffee makers, lamps, and TVs, the ConnectSense Smart Outlet 2 is a great alternative for you. Smart Speakers and Display. The Amazon Alexa Echo is a Bluetooth speaker introduced by Amazon. It can also use If This Then That to control smart home devices directly (IFTTT). Google Nest Hub Family Google's Nest Hub series of speakers and Smart displays are a nice option if you prefer Google Assistant over Amazon Alexa. Sons One The Sonos One is applicable with both ordinary voice assistants and, in terms of volume. It also outperforms further smart speakers in its price range. Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Outdoor Plug Pool pumps and patio lights are glorious for converting into Smart home gadgets and also monitor with your phone to outdoor smart plugs. You can use your phone or Alexa and Google voice commands to operate two devices independently of one another. Nest Thermostat This Nest Thermostat lets you manage your cooling and heating system through phone or voice, set temperature schedules, and remotely track your energy usage, just like the more exclusive Nest Learning Thermostat. Smart Lighting The Wyze Bulb Color is the most profitable Smart color bulb and you can use your phone to operate it without a hub, or you can use Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant to control it with your voice. There are numerous Smart Home automation products in 2021, such as Robot Vacuums and Mops, Smart Kitchen Appliance (Sous video cooking, Brava Oven), Smart heating and cooling, Furbo dog camera, and Smart locks and home security system. How Smart Home works Smart home devices are all linked together. They can also operate everything from a single device, such as a smartphone, tablet, laptop, or video gaming console. Door locks, televisions, thermostats, home computers, cameras, lamps, and even refrigerators can all be controlled by a single Home Automation system. This smart home appliance is capable of self-learning. It allows them to understand their owners' schedules and make alterations as needed. Homeowners who have smart homes with lighting control have been able to cut their electricity usage and save money on their energy bills. Advantages and disadvantages of Smart Home Technologies Advantages There are some attractive choices available to give your home a high-tech makeover as Smart home technology becomes much more affordable and easier to use. It is convenient for homeowners to install a smart home technology device. Instead of utilizing many devices to keep track of appliances, thermostats, lighting, and other tasks, homeowners may do it with only one computer, usually a smartphone or tablet. Protect your home and belongings with their always-on connectivity and notification systems, which enable consumers to respond quickly to unexpected situations and range from Wi-Fi-enabled smoke alarms to plugs with auto-turn-offs. While connected to a portable computer, users may receive alerts and updates on problems in their houses. Smart doorbells, for example, allow homeowners to view and engage with visitors even when they are not at home. Internal temperature, lighting, and appliances can all be controlled by the user. Homeowners can save a lot of money in exchange for the cost of installing the Smart system. Smart thermostats and lighting will help you conserve energy by altering or turning it off automatically. Smart systems can assist you in reducing the amount of time you spend operating the air conditioner or leaving lights on in the garage overnight. Also, you can answer the door from any location. Smart doorbells and locks provide you a notification to your smartphone when someone knocks on your door. Disadvantages While the Smart Home offers convenience and cost advantages, it is not without flaws. Security dangers and flaws continue to affect both technology makers and users. Skilled hackers, for example, may obtain access to a smart home's internet-connected gadgets. In such cases, adopting a strong password to safeguard Smart appliances and devices, utilizing encryption available, and only connecting trustworthy devices to one's network are all strategies to decrease the risk of such assaults. As previously stated, installing Smart technology will cost anywhere from a few thousand dollars for a wireless system to tens of thousands of dollars for a hardwired system. It's an expensive price to pay, especially considering the potential of a steep learning curve for everyone in the family to adjust to the system."
19,Cyberbullying and Covid-19 - 2021 Update,computers-technology," California defines a cyberbully as anyone who sends any online communication to deliberately frighten, embarrass, harass, or otherwise target another. The Cyberbullying Research Center defines it as “willful and repeated harm inflicted through the use of computers, cell phones, and other electronic devices,” and, “when someone repeatedly makes fun of another person online or repeatedly picks on another person through e-mail or text message or when someone posts something online about another person that they don’t like.” With schools closed for a year and only just reopening, memories of “classic” face-to-face schoolyard bullying may have receded in the memory of kids who had dreaded showing up at school only to see their tormentors on a daily basis. But remote schooling with extra hours online has only opened them up further to abuse on social media and other types of cyberbullying. Combined with recent increasingly uncivil political practices and the ease with which one can remain anonymous online, many bullies feel more empowered than ever to harass children and adults of all stripes. In any case, 95% of teens are online and the great majority of them use social media, where much of cyberbullying activity occurs. A large number of kids are bullied online: • About a third of US kids have experienced cyberbullying. • Close to two-thirds of teens have experienced cyberbullying • Nearly three-quarters of teens have reported someone spreading online rumors about them. • About one-sixth of youth admit to having cyberbullied others. • Nearly half of LGBTQ youth have experienced cyberbullying. So what? Aren’t we supposed to have freedom of expression? While we generally assume freedom of expression in the USA, this is only guaranteed on government platforms – not private platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook. Even so, not all expression is tolerated under the moniker of Free Speech. Hate speech and fighting words, for instance, are not guaranteed forms of expression. To be sure, many forms of cyberbullying are hate speech. And cyberbullying has consequences: • Victims of cyberbullying are nearly twice as likely to take their own lives. • Those who do the bullying are also more likely to commit suicide – about 70% more likely than the general population. • Two-thirds of kids that have been harassed online have experienced mental health issues. • Two-thirds of kids say cyberbullying affects their ability to learn and to feel safe at school. Aren’t there laws against this kind of thing? There are now laws expressly targeting cyberbullying, but no Federal laws specifically prohibiting such behavior (although there are civil rights laws for certain groups). The great majority of cyberbullying and cyberstalking charges are add-ons to other crimes. • Schools can discipline kids who bully at school, but until recently, their hands were largely tied when it happened after school hours. • Each state has its own laws, which can be found here  and here. https://www.bark.us/blog/cyberbullying-laws/ https://www.stopbullying.gov/resources/laws What can we do? Experts say that it’s best to ignore offensive posts, comments, texts, calls, messages, etc. – that is – don’t respond. But of course, this is hard advice to take. Bullies are looking for a reaction, so it is useful to tell the cyberbullied child that by not responding, they are actually winning. And their online tormentor is fairly likely to just go away. At the same time, it is a good idea to save copies of all these emails, messages, posts, comments, etc., in case action needs to be taken at some point. Save the evidence. Without it, there’s no proof. If there is a sexual picture of a minor, it must be deleted or the recipient could be prosecuted for the crime of possession of child pornography. Under no means should they send it to someone else, or that could add a distribution charge. This bears repeating: Delete sexual images of minors and don’t send them to anyone. You can report the bullying – to the school, to the social media sites where it occurred or originated, and to the ISP supplying your child’s or the tormentor’s email addresses. When reporting, include copies of the offending material – with the above exception of sexual images of minors. If there are threats of violence or death, stalking, or encouragement to do self-harm or even suicide, report these to the police. Again, save copies of the offending material and include it with your report to law enforcement. Include everything but be succinct in your narrative to them to be taken more seriously. Change your accounts. If there is persistent harassment or bullying, you can close the account that is being targeted and open a new one. Remember that kids communicate with their peers through electronic devices. Taking away their means of communicating with their friends because they are being victimized punishes the victim and may encourage them to keep silent when they are being bullied. Verywell Family  [https://www.verywellfamily.com/reasons-why-victims-of-bullying-do-not-tell-460784] says that most kids don’t report bullying for fear of losing their link with the world – which has been especially true in times of quarantine. Help your child to avoid becoming a cyberbully Early on, as children begin to communicate online, teach netiquette, that is, accepted rules of online behavior. They are not so different than accepted rules of in-person behavior, except for that online behavior can be anonymous. It may be hard to teach civility in what we often see as politicized uncivil behavior, but of course, the best teacher is modeling the behavior you wish to see in your children. Basic Rules of Netiquette Avoid hurting people’s feelings. Respect others’ rights. Avoid insulting someone – anyone, really. Don’t write something you wouldn’t say in person. If someone insults you, be calm. They are just trying to get a reaction and, as above, if you refuse to engage the insulter, you win. Respect others’ privacy and use respectful language, which includes not writing in ALL CAPS. This may be for older users, but fact check before reposting. It’s easy enough to do and it quashes harmful rumors.

20,Monster Hunter World (MHW) Layered Armour,computers-technology," In the most recent DLC expansion for the game, Iceborne, Capcom introduced MHW layered armour. Layered armour is a unique set of equipment that allows you to change your character's appearance while keeping your actual armour pieces intact. It is purely a cosmetic skin with no additional perks. However, they make your character look cool while you upgrade and mix and match armour pieces to improve your armour rating. The introduction of layered armour has been a fan favourite amongst the Monster Hunter World player base. It has allowed Capcom to introduce multiple themed armour sets to match popular demand. Here are some of the best themed sets in the game. The Witcher Themed Layered Armour in MHW Geralt, the main protagonist from the Witcher franchise, has his own armour set. To obtain this tremendous-looking set, you need to complete two quests to receive an item known as Mutagen. The two quests you need to complete are Trouble in the Ancient Forest and Woodland Spirit, which faces you off against an ancient Leshen. The Leshen, once carved, should drop a Mutagen allowing you to craft Geralt's MHW Iceborne layered armour, which also requires five thousand research points. Joining Geralt in MHW is Ciri. You can also obtain Ciri's armour, much like Geralt's through completing the trouble in the Ancient Forest and Woodland Spirit quest lines to get the Mutagen item. Once received and given you have five thousand research points, you can forge Ciri's armour set. StreetFighter Themed Layered Armour Street Fighter’s most famous Character, Ryu, also joins the monster-slaying action with his very own armour set in a previously timed exclusive event. To obtain Ryu's layered armour, you needed several thousand research points alongside two Nergiante tickets and one SFV ticket. To receive the Nergiante ticket, you needed to defeat an arch tempered Nergiante in the Heralds of Destruction Cry quest. After obtaining the two tickets, one SFV Ticket III is required. This ticket is obtained through the Awakened Satsui No Hado I arena quest. Likewise, you also needed five thousand research points. Sakura, from street fighter, had her own timed exclusive Monster Hunter World Layered Armor set. To obtain this rare piece of layered armour, it required you to slay an arch tempered Lunastra in the quest Blue Dust Surpasses Red Lust which granted you two Lunastra tickets needed to obtain the layered armour. You also needed five thousand research points alongside an SFV ticket obtained through several different arena quests. OtherArmour Sets Dante, one of Devil May Cry's main protagonists, has his own set as well To obtain this exclusively timed layered armour, it required you to get five thousand research points, two red orbs and 2 Teostra tickets. The easiest way to receive all of these items was to complete the Code Red quest, which required you to defeat several monsters in a row in a fifty-minute time frame. Once all of these items are acquired, you could complete Dante's inferno delivery quest allowing you to receive Dante's MHW layered armour. In this Final Fantasy armour set, you can obtain the Drachen layered armour by completing the quest A Visitor from Eorzea on extreme mode. This quest requires you to defeat a high-level tempered Behemoth to claim the rewards needed to get the Drachen layered armour; completing the mission grants you a Glamour prism needed to craft this armour. You also need to obtain a Nova crystal and five thousand research points to get this set. Assassin's creed Bayek also makes his way to MHW with a special themed layered armour set based on the famous killer. To obtain this layered armour set, you are required to complete the Silent Dead and Fierce quest, which pits you up against a Delevjino, Odogaron and Lunastra. Once you complete this quest, it grants you the Senu feather item needed to obtain Bayek's layered armour. You need two of this item as well as five thousand research points before you can collect it. Aloy also has her own MHW layered armour set from the hit PlayStation franchise Horizon Zero Dawn. To get this timed exclusive set, players had to complete the Proving quest, which rewarded players with a Nora Brave Trophy item needed to forge Aloys armour. To generate Aloy's complete set, you needed nine Nora Brave Trophies alongside multiple Anjanath materials, thus requiring various playthroughs of the mission. Final Thoughts on MHW Layered Armour Sets These eight entries stand out as the best Monster Hunter World layered armour sets in the game. For more Monster Hunter content, including coverage on the upcoming Monster Hunter Rise releasing this month, keep it locked on Hacker Noon."

1,China’s new artificial intelligence algorithm improves data transmission speed,computers-technology," The reporter learned from Southwest University that the school’s research team has released a low-rank tensor recovery model, theory and algorithm based on binary quantization, which helps to improve the speed and accuracy of large-scale data transmission, while reducing hardware costs and enabling data transmission. Compression and preservation are more “cost-effective”. Related research results have been published online by the international journal “IEEE Model Analysis and Machine Intelligence Transactions” in the field of artificial intelligence. According to the corresponding author of the paper and Professor Wang Jianjun from the School of Mathematics and Statistics of Southwest University, with the continuous expansion of the application of artificial intelligence technology, the amount of data transmission in the fields of image and video processing, pattern recognition, and computer vision is huge. However, due to hardware costs and requirements for data transmission speed, the currently commonly used low-rank tensor recovery (LRTR) method cannot achieve high-precision quantization of signals during large-scale data transmission. The resulting quantization error has a significant impact on system recovery performance. To influence. In response to this problem, Wang Jianjun’s research team proposed a low-rank tensor restoration model, theory and algorithm based on binary quantization. The principle is to combine the binary measurement method with low-rank tensor restoration so that the quantization process is incorporated into the model for processing , So as to effectively control the influence of quantization error on system recovery performance and make up for the defects of existing algorithms. The test results show that this new algorithm has achieved higher restoration accuracy in practical applications such as face image restoration and multispectral image restoration, and the obtained image data is clearer. While the new algorithm reduces the hardware cost of data transmission, the data processing speed is also improved, making it possible to transmit, compress and save data with higher “cost-effectiveness”. At present, Wang Jianjun’s research team has cooperated with related companies in the fields of mobile communication terminals and medical image processing to promote domestic mobile terminal technology updates, improve the processing speed of MRI in medical treatment, and reduce economic costs. The new algorithm is also expected to be combined with radar imaging technology to play a role in meteorological monitoring, geological prospecting and other fields.

Focus on a main problem or address all of them and describe your opinion. Explain how the material can relate to the modern world, to the society or separate individuals. Back your statements with sources if needed and make conclusions whether you support the author or not. Writing a reaction paper can be quite a challenging task, so many students use examples to learn more about its structure and key features. Here are a few recommendations, which will help you complete an outstanding reaction paper: Read the original article carefully and highlight the main ideas and points you want to discuss; Describe your point of view and back it with additional information if needed. Use vivid examples; Use various sources to make your statement more argumentative. There are also a few tips, which will help you to avoid common mistakes. First, don’t give a summary of an article. You should perform your personal opinion, not an overview. You should always back your ideas with examples. However, avoid using examples, which are difficult to relate to the topic. With the help of these simple rules, you will learn how to write a reaction paper and will be able to create an outstanding work! Nowadays it is impossible to find a student, who is capable of completing all the tasks without anyone’s help. Because of a heavy workload and tight schedules additional help may be more than useful, so let's continue to simplify your studying. While many students don’t have a chance to order a paper or want to create it on their own, using online samples can be a great way out. They can help students get an overall idea on the subject, structure and main tips. By downloading a sample, you will learn how to write reaction paper and avoid common mistakes You will also be able to shape your ideas in an appropriate form and emphasize the strongest points of your paper, while omitting those, which lack samples of reaction papers and support Reaction paper format Formatting gives every student a chance to create an outstanding paper, using previous experience and a clear plan of actions. With the help of such an outline, you will be able to see how the paper will look like and will be able to go from one paragraph to another smoothly.

3,Significance of Software testing services,computers-technology," Many people are probably unaware of it, but everyone should hire software testing services. I know you’re probably wondering why I need a software testing service and why it’s so important. Don’t worry; I’ll explain everything you need to know about software testing services and why they’re so important. What exactly is Software Testing? Well, software testing is a very viable technique that allows you to determine if the precise software product meets the required specifications and to make sure that perhaps the software product is defect-free and clear of problems and does not cause you problems later on. No wonder why having a software testing service is so important. Its primary goal is to identify any errors in missing requirements when compared to the corresponding specifications you require. It will help you detect bugs, errors and many more complications. What is a Software Testing Service? Well, in software testing services, a service is performed by a service provider who specializes in integrating various testing environments and locating glitches in software products, rather than by the organization’s employer; it is essentially performed by a third party. The third party service provider will assist you in resolving software product issues by testing it first. Why is Software testing services Essential? Now that you know what software testing is and why you use it, let’s get to the main point: why is it essential. Now that you want to deliver a software product, it’s critical that you check for any bugs, errors, or missing requirements. Well, software testing services can help you with that by detecting issues earlier, before you deliver your product, so you don’t have to deal with them later. There are numerous software testing companies to choose from, but it is critical that you carefully select which company or service you will use. Always ensure that the company you’ve chosen has prior experience with the work you want them to do for you."
4,Berry Producer Finds More Value in SIMBA Than Expected.,computers-technology," Kirkland, WA – May 20, 2021- In 2007 when Sara Osborne bought Peters Cranberries, her father-in-law’s cranberry farm on the misty Oregon Coast, she did not expect cranberry prices to soon plunge by 80 percent, sending the whole industry into shock. Yet that is exactly what happened, so Sara was very relieved to eventually land a big contract with one of the world’s largest fruit packing companies. However, that company required barcoded labels on every box. Sara shopped for a labeling system and chose Simba, from Dynamic Systems, Inc., which combines robust barcode software with a full suite of leading printers, scanners, and touchscreen computer tablets. “At the time, I didn’t care about the bells and whistles,” she says. “I just wanted labels.” However, within a few years as the industry changed again, Sara found order sizes varying more even as customer numbers grew. What had been a simple business of supplying a couple of big customers with standard shipments had become much more complicated. Soon, Peters Cranberries added more fruit from other growers, turning its processing center into a transshipment warehouse. The company also had to handle demand for specialty berry varieties, such as those suited for sauces. As challenges grew, Simba proved its real value. “I became addicted,” says Sarah. “I realized that this labeling system of ours could also help me stay ahead of rapidly moving inventory, because once something is barcoded there’s no more data entry, and the system makes it easy to track, organize, and re-box as needed, keeping great records on several orders at once.” “I bought SIMBA for labeling, but I grew to love it for inventory management.” “One grower we partner with was amazed at my paperwork because she was still managing orders as we once did, with a bunch of spreadsheets and notes for each. She’s now planning to buy this herself!” SIMBA also proved itself in industry quality-control audits, such as those from the Cranberry Marketing Committee and the USDA Good Agricultural Practices program. When auditors ask where a box of berries was grown, stored or shipped, Sara no longer searches through drawers, binders and hard drives for records; running a report takes just a couple of clicks. Sara also finds it helpful to have a system user-friendly enough for her extremely seasonal business. “Because we use our system primarily during fall harvest, I have to be able to come back to this software after nine months away without too much relearning. That means having both intuitive software and great tech support. Fortunately, Simba has both.” Now, after fourteen years, Peters Cranberries is going strong, meeting the challenges of a growing network of customers and growers, and more variety in products and orders. Sara has no doubt that more changes are ahead, but, she says, “When changes come, we’ll be ready.”"
5,Artificial intelligence is coming,computers-technology," Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science. It attempts to understand the essence of intelligence and produce a new intelligent machine that can respond in a similar way to human intelligence. Research in this field includes robotics, language recognition, image recognition, Natural language processing and expert systems, etc. Since the birth of artificial intelligence, the theory and technology have become increasingly mature, and the field of application has continued to expand. It is conceivable that the technological products brought by artificial intelligence in the future will be the “containers” of human wisdom. Artificial intelligence can simulate the information process of human consciousness and thinking. Artificial intelligence is not human intelligence, but it can think like humans and may exceed human intelligence. Artificial intelligence is a very challenging science, and people who are engaged in this work must understand computer knowledge, psychology and philosophy. Artificial intelligence includes a very wide range of sciences. It is composed of different fields, such as machine learning, computer vision, etc. Generally speaking, one of the main goals of artificial intelligence research is to make machines competent for some tasks that usually require human intelligence. Complex work. But different times and different people have different understandings of this “complex work”.

6,Internet of everything vs internet of things,computers-technology," There is almost no difference between the Internet of Things (IoT) and the Internet of Everything (IoE). However, the latter term is more semantically broader. In this article, we will detail why the term IoE is relatively rarely used by IoT software development companies. The difference The term Internet of Things was coined in 1999 to refer to machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. IoE appeared a few years later and used to describe the interconnected elements of the entire system (including people). IoE not only requires M2M communication, but also P2M (person-to-machine) and even P2P (person-to-person) communication. To understand the difference between the three communication methods, let’s look at a few examples. Suppose it’s dark outside, you turn on the office lights, and then you type on the keyboard. This solution provides a P2M example of IoE. We are so accustomed to these things that we don’t even realize that they are part of the system. Another example: you make an Internet call to a colleague. This is a simple person-to-person (P2P) communication. On the other hand, an example of M2M communication is a data exchange process between office temperature sensing equipment and HVAC mainframes. You might think that M2M communication (as a technology) is the most advanced way of interaction. But IoE regards P2M and P2P interaction as the most valuable interaction. According to an analysis by Cisco, by 2022, these two types of connections will account for 55%. IoE is now considered to be the next stage in the development of the Internet of Things. Perhaps this is why there are only a few IoT development companies that provide IoE development services. IoT solutions are now more common and widespread. The 4 main elements of the IoE concept Things The so-called things refer to the elements participating in communication in the system. A thing is an object that can collect information and share information with other elements of the system. According to Cisco, by 2020, the number of such connected devices will exceed 50 billion. What objects are in the Internet of Things, things can be anything, from smart tools to construction equipment. In IoE, this scope is expanded to include nurses, MRI machines, and “smart” straws. Any element that has a built-in sensing system and is connected to the network can become part of IoE. 2 people People play a central role in the concept of IoE, because without them, there would be no bridges and no smart connections. It is people who connect to the Internet of Things, analyze the received data and make data-driven decisions based on statistical information. People are the center of M2M, P2M, and P2P communications. People can also make connections on their own, for example, nurses working together in a medical center. Data It is estimated that by 2020, every person using the Internet will receive up to 1.7 MB of data per second. As the amount of data available to us grows, the management of all this information becomes more complex. But this is a crucial task, because without proper analysis, the data will be useless. Data is an integral part of the Internet of Things and the Internet of Things. However, it can only become useful insights in the Internet of Everything. Otherwise, it will just fill up the storage space. Treatment Process is an inherent component of IoE. This is how all other elements, people, things, and data work together to provide an intelligent and feasible system. When all elements are properly interconnected, each element will receive the required data and transmit it to the next receiver. All this happens through wired or wireless connections. Another way to explain this situation is that the Internet of Things describes the network and things, while the Internet of Everything describes the network, things, and people, data, and processes. Where is IoE applied? For the market, we can confidently say that the Internet of Things is a technology suitable for any industry. IoE technology is particularly relevant to some of the most important fields, including manufacturing, retail, information, finance and insurance, and healthcare. IoE technology has almost unlimited possibilities. To give an example: every year more than 800 cyclists around the world die in traffic accidents. If there is a way to connect bicycle helmets with traffic lights, ambulances and hospital ecosystems in a single IoE. Will this increase the chances of survival for at least some of these cyclists? To give another example: Do you know how much food in large supermarkets is wasted because the food is not purchased before its best purchase date? Some perishable products, such as fruits and vegetables, are stocked even before they enter the market Many are discarded. What would happen if you found a way to use IoE to connect food inventory to shelves and forklifts in a supermarket inventory control system? At present, there are endless changes in the use of IoE, many of which have become more and more familiar in our “smart” houses. Few people in our industry will deny the value of IoE in improving our living standards. Fortunately, the IoT development service market is booming. Who knows, maybe one day soon, you will become a “thing” in the IoE environment. Darlox Electronic Limited is mainly engaged in the design and manufacture of custom cables for flat-panel displays and the peripherals; custom cables for auto, mobile and office equipment; and also cables for almost all modern electronic products you can see. We cater to our customer’s every need with our design services and quick lead time. Orders of large quantity and small quantity are both always welcomed. In the era of IoT(Internet of Things), Darlox offers flex flat cables, flex PCB, micro coax cables assembly for data high speed transfer applications."

8,How Disaster Recovery Differs From Data Backup,computers-technology," How disaster recovery differs from data backup Data backup and disaster recovery are both important for protecting your company's critical data and systems, but we have probably heard businesses use these terms interchangeably when, in reality, they are quite different. There is no denying that data loss, cybercrime, and security breaches have become more conventional, so understanding the difference between disaster recovery and data backup is important. Having a backup strategy and a disaster recovery plan is not the same thing, even though information and IT activities are becoming increasingly important. A backup is a copy of your data, while DR is the process of recovering your infrastructure in the event of a disaster. If you can't differentiate the two, then your business may wind up paying through the nose. How are they different? Here's a closer look at each concept individually. Data back-up: The process of copying data into a secondary form or device, which can restore the original file in the event of a disaster. The backup of data can be deduplicated and reduced to consume less storage space. However, performing basic backups is not enough for a modern business; managing business continuity in the face of a disaster or a sudden event is imperative for any company that does not wish to lag. In this area disaster recovery plays an important role. Disaster Recovery( DR): It's a concept in security planning that's designed to protect businesses from the harm caused by natural disasters or man-made disasters, such as cyber-attacks or tornadoes. The goal of a disaster recovery plan is to maintain critical functions before, during, and after a disaster event, resulting in the least interruption to business continuity. The point of preparation: If it takes hours for your employees or partners to recover lost data after an accidental deletion, they will be unable to finish a mission-critical process that relies on your technology. Additionally, if it takes days to get your business back online after a disaster, you risk losing customers permanently. It is worth supporting data backup and disaster recovery due to the risk of both losing time and money. Exactly how are disaster recovery and backups different? Data maintenance requirements: A daily backup of essential data is typically performed in a single location for the intended purpose of copying data, so backups are commonly implemented daily. Recovery time objectives (RTO) are essential in disaster recovery to establish what time limit can be tolerated by the business without IT systems post-disaster. Typically, to achieve a given RTO, one duplicate of the IT support must be available in an optional location to take into account the replication between the production and DR sites. Recovery capability: A disaster recovery plan involves moving your critical environment to an alternate environment that can support business continuity. A backup is valuable for quick access if you need to restore an archive, but it doesn't support the failover of your entire environment should your support become compromised. Further, the physical assets required to bring them back on the internet are not included in the costs. Additional resources requirements: Backups are simply copies of the source data that can be restored. For disaster recovery, a different production environment is required where the data can live. All elements of the current environment should be considered, including actual resources, software, network, and security. Planning measure: The process of setting up a backup routine is generally straightforward since the only objectives are to meet the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and maintain the data. Disaster recovery requires additional planning, including identifying which systems are deemed important, creating a recovery order and correspondence plan, and most importantly, implementing a valid test. There are many benefits to having a disaster recovery plan, such as reducing risk and keeping up compliance, as well as avoiding blackouts. Make sure you know which backup solution is the best for your business needs before implementing it. How should you decide what is best for your company? You should integrate backup and disaster recovery planning into your data protection strategy. Today's business environment values the ""Constantly on"" principle, which states that a company should be able to provide services or goods to its customers no matter what circumstances. Generally, backups should be used for long-term archival purposes for Vendor Management systems (VM) that are catching significant data that may have to be recovered. When it comes to VMs that contain mission-critical systems and applications, they should be included in your disaster recovery plan. It not only ensures business continuity but also helps protect your organization's data and confidential information in the event of a disaster. Conclusion However, if you prepare yourself for these events and eliminate possible risks, recovering your data can be reasonably simple.  There are distinct differences between data backup and disaster recovery, yet being aware of both and applying them to your business tasks can save you from stress in the future."
9,Reasons To Have On Demand Developer,computers-technology," In reality, for a lot of us, the world wide web is your very first (and sometimes the only) choice we use when reaching out to interact with people worldwide for specific purposes like business, education, and entertainment, etc. A website is a group of connected web pages, each built from computer code, and preserved together below a specific domain name. A web page is fundamentally a document that can be seen and/or use through a normal web browser (like Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer, Safari, etc.), obtained either from search engine results pages, hyperlinks to the site home page, or any other pages that are connected, or directly via an internet address. At precisely the exact same time, a website can also be a collection of requests and replies. HTTP is a stateless protocol that allow users to send certain requests and get responses, which doesn't in fact need to be in the shape of a webpage. To acquire a website, your first task is to get its IP address. This IP address makes it possible for consumers to differentiate between the billions of connected devices which are a part of internet or worldwide web and additionally allows those devices to correctly exchange digital data between themselves. You may be a company owner hiring a programmer to construct your website, a marketer pitching a vision into your own development group, or a pupil learning about development for a career. No matter who you are or why you are reading this manual, knowing the fundamentals of website development can be helpful in this technology-driven world. In reality, it's turned into a portal site and primary system of study, link, instruction, and entertainment on earth. Half of the people and individuals of the world are using the web for a huge variety of requirements. What is the first thing those motives have in common? They need a website, and every site demands a skilled programmer. Web development can be a rapidly expanding business. Between today and 2028, the employment of internet programmers is predicted to rise by 13 percent. That is much quicker than most other tech professions. A content management platform, frequently called CMS, is software that helps customers create, manage, and change content on a site without needing specialized technical knowledge. Rather than building your own method for generating web pages, keeping pictures, along with other purposes, the content management system manages all of that fundamental infrastructure things for you so which you could concentrate on more forward-facing pieces of your site. Other than that, you may even locate content management systems to do more different purposes like file management as well. Another big benefit of a CMS is its collaborative nature. Several users may log on and donate, schedule, or edit articles to be printed. The editors of a normal content management system provide access to users to input text and upload pictures without having to know any HTML or CSS. Mobile software development is the practice of producing software applications that operate on a mobile device, and also a normal mobile application uses a network connection to operate with remote computing tools. Therefore, the mobile development procedure requires creating installable software packages (code, binaries, resources, etc.), executing backend services like data accessibility using an API, and analyzing the program on target devices. The two main mobile program platforms are IOS out of Apple Inc and Android out of Google. IOS is Apple's proprietary cellular operating system built especially for iPhones. When there are lots of similarities between both, however various application development kits (SDKs) are utilized for various platforms. Apple utilizes IOS exclusively due to their own devices, while Google has made Android accessible for different businesses which fulfill particular requirements. It is an estimate that Programmers have developed over 1.5 million software for both platforms still now. All the above studies tell us the importance of applications or software in today’s world. As we know there is a huge number of people connected with each other through these digital mediums globally, so nobody will leave this opportunity to be a part of the digital and internet world. To be a part of this world, you need to have custom build applications, software, and websites that will be provided by a professional on demand developer. Professional and expert developers know how to develop fully functional, and interactive applications and websites with the help of the latest technologies and frameworks."
10,What Is Cybersecurity Management and Why Is It Important? - Answer Watcher,computers-technology," Cybersecurity Management It has been forecasted that the worldwide information security market is expected to reach $170.4 billion by 2022- Gartner Analysis In the year 2018, around 62% of businesses have experienced social engineering attracts and phishing- report by Cybint Solutions Over 68% of business leaders think that cybersecurity risks are increasing- Accenture Around 52% of breaches involve hacking whereas 28% include malware and 32-33% involves social engineering, phishing- Verizon On average, 5% of the companies’ folders are protected with safety measures- Varonis The topmost malicious email attachment types are generally .dot, .doc which make up 37% whereas the highest one was .exe at 19.5%- Symantec By the end of 2020, the passwords used by machines and humans globally are about to reach 300 billion- Cybersecurity Media Around 88% of companies spent $1 million on preparing for the GDPR- CSO Online These are just a few points stating the importance of cybersecurity management and the issue with cybersecurity. The integration and concept of cybersecurity are important as it encompasses everything required to protect sensitive data, Protected health information, identifiable information, intellectual property data, governmental, industrial information systems, property data, and so on from external theft, internet theft often made by criminals and adversaries. Its risk is increasing because of the fact that the global economy today is highly dependent on connectivity and the usage of cloud services for storing data and personal information. However, too many dependencies on the cloud storage system are somewhere making poor configuration of the services giving a loophole for cybercriminals to play or use the organizational information. This altogether even strengthens the chances of cyber-attacks and data breaches on rising to the leading and best of organizations. As the world is connected more fiercely, the traditional days of simple firewalls and antivirus software are not enough for a robust security system. Concluding all these major thoughts, it has been analyzed that the importance of cybersecurity management should be highlighted to everyone.

Table of Contents Importance of Cybersecurity Management System Things to Involve in a Cybersecurity Plan Compliance Management Risk Management Security Costs Role Accountability Tips for Presenting Cybersecurity to Higher Management FAQs Importance of Cybersecurity Management System Importance of Cybersecurity Management Awareness of it is crucial for every organization, especially to high-level or mid-level organizations. Any organization can be targeted anytime for using any kind of information for personal benefit. Any IT security breach can be a major loss to the business operations as the IT staff have to investigate and look for the solutions for security breaches while reaching the affected customers in no time and warn them of the potential impacts. In a study by IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach, the average cost of data breaches last year was somewhere $3.92 million. Also, it has also noted that “companies with an incident response team that also extensively tested their incident response plan experienced $1.23 million less in data breach costs on average.” In a nutshell, it is always good to be prepared for the worst in order to minimize the impact. To safeguard the firm, organizations, it is always good to come up with a solution and a plan. Here is a quick shot of the cybersecurity management plan business should consider for an effective solution- Things to Involve in a Cybersecurity Plan Some of the crucial cybersecurity plan components an organization along with the team managers should take into consideration are- Compliance Management Consider understanding what regulations to apply for the company’s information technology security. For that matter, it is important to keep updated with the regulations. Risk Management Managers should look into what is the organization’s biggest security risk. The risk management factor helps in making managers plan as per the organization’s loopholes, vulnerabilities for creating solutions, and improving the security systems. Security Costs Now, it is time to understand how much is it going to cost for the organization. Without understanding the costing part, it will become hard for the organization to establish costing planning. Role Accountability The next thing to take care of is who will be responsible for executing or taking the cybersecurity planning ahead. Any organization and the management would like to have a clear understanding of accountability for maintaining and following the plan as per the guidelines and parameters. Once done with it, there are following Tips for Presenting Cybersecurity to Higher Management Keep the communication clear and positive. Do not hesitate to come up with a clear idea of it. Come up with the data, worst-case scenarios, realistic information, and then present all the positive impact of the security plan and how it is going to impact the process of the organization. Using a bunch of unfamiliar terms and acronyms might be a great way to showcase the impact of cybersecurity, however, using terms that are familiar for the business and authority is a great way to understand the potential of cybersecurity management. It is crucial to keep easy to understand and researched security metrics for presenting the importance of cybersecurity to upper management. The data which is analyzed and researched nicely helps in setting expectations along with tracking the success of the security measures employed. Though the concept of cybersecurity and cybersecurity management is huge but no organization would like to skip it in order. Moreover, cybersecurity management should be that strong that decoding the code from external sources if not impossible at least becomes challenging.

11,Digital Fashion Technology Explained,computers-technology," Digital fashion refers to the virtual representation of apparel and clothing in a virtual environment. The apparel is built using 3D software, pixel materials, and computing technologies. Digital fashion is also termed as the interplay between couture and digital technology. For instance, information communication and technology ICT has profoundly infiltrated traditional fashion and influenced the experiences of fashion consumers and prospects. Such an interplay has happened at three fundamental levels. First, ICT tools and techniques are utilized to design digital fashion apparel while the industry organization uses ICT technologies. Secondly, ICT directly affects marketing, distribution, and sales. Social media platforms and digital ads present exciting opportunities for digital fashion brands to push their merchandise. Finally, ICTs are extensively used in communications with different stakeholders: customers, investors, client groups -- and contribute to creating the digital fashion world. Digital Fashion: An Exciting Tech Trend The fashion sector is going through a painful transition from analog to digital, induced partly by the covid-19 pandemic and rises in global temperatures, forcing the fashion industry to be sustainable. To continue to thrive in the face of these challenges, fashion brands are adopting digital approaches of prototyping, thus reducing waste and streamlining physical production. While many global brands are adapting, some other industry visionaries are reinventing themselves by viewing the industry challenges in the context of shifting consumer desires and fashion consumption. One of the ways that digital fashion is being revolutionized is by the use of digital fashion NFTs by players like Digitalax. One in every three women considers clothing ""old"" after one to three wears. So, imagine a world where clothing and apparel are made of pixels rather than textiles. Sounds strange, right? Not anymore. Fast fashion has already popularized the notion that great taste is similar to new outfits. With this notion in mind, it is evident to see why digital fashion would emerge as a more versatile, customer-focused, and flexible approach to fashion consumption. Indeed, social media reinforces the idea that great taste is usually synonymous with variety wears. One in six people admits they would not wear clothing if it’s been seen online. Welcome to digital fashion. Emerging technologies prove you could have all the varieties of apparel and clothing in your closet. Digital clothes, which are made of pixels rather than textiles, are gaining popularity. While you can possess a minimalist wardrobe in real life, you could express your digital self with thousands of different designer wears on social media. Digital Fashion and the Gaming Culture While on the surface, digital fashion may seem like something fetched from the future, in reality, curating our digital presence has become the new reality. In social media, users are using outsourced applications to curate their digital appearance. From putting your best foot forward in LinkedIn to cultivating an aesthetic look on Instagram, users are proving to be quite thoughtful about their online presence. For serious gamers, digital fashion takes the form of skins: these refer to weapons and outfits that decorate their online avatars. For instance, on Avatar, a typical digital skin would cost a gamer between $5 and $25. While these skins are just for aesthetics and do not affect a player’s abilities, they all together illustrate a market of virtual self-expression. Some of the rarest and most exclusive skins like the Skull Trooper Skin are often resold online for thousands of dollars. Indeed, experts predict that the skin market will hit $50 billion by 2025. Digital fashion integrates a virtual reality embedded perfectly in our gaming experiences, thus bidding farewell to analog, traditional fashion. Why Digital Fashion Technology? Digital fashion is enabling consumers to have a much more emotional and intimate connection with brands that they see and love. Not only has digital fashion become more versatile and accessible, but different fashion brands also prefer to display their collections, whether it is through digital storytelling, video lookbooks, or behind-the-scenes sneak peeks. Given these mounting challenges, digital fashion technology enables brands to build strong and intimate connections with audiences. Building a brand value is tantamount to clothing and fashion brands if they want to survive the ramifications of the covid-19 pandemic. Most consumers strive to understand a brand's communication, values, and what it stands for. Digital fashion technology gives businesses and consumers the power to interact with brands and their corporate culture in building long-term, profitable, and sustainable business relationships. Digital fashion has shown that there are no limits when it comes to digital. There is room for brands to cast their nets wide without having to exhaust their resources. Digital fashion enables an unlimited number of industries and markets to be reached without being selected on whom to invite to shows and exhibitions. For example, the adventures of Zoom with friends by Vigil garnered 3.0 million views in less than four days on YouTube and 1.2 million views on InstagramTV. This made the video one of the most popular videos by Louis Vuitton and demonstrated the potential reach of digital fashion activities. Finally, digital fashion has enabled traditional fashion to flap its wings into new frontiers. With digital fashion, we see new possibilities in terms of consumer behavior. For instance, digital fashion retailers are using capabilities in virtual reality to enable potential buyers to try garments before making a purchase. This particular estimation capability embedded in virtual reality is a classic addition in ensuring accuracy in purchases to avoid wastage and consumer disgruntlement after purchase. Trends in Digital Fashion Technology ● Artificial Intelligence - Fashion brands are using artificial intelligence to forecast trends, boost sales, and improve customer purchase experiences. Touchscreens and chatbots have streamlined business communication and improved relationships between digital fashion retailers and digital consumers. ● Internet of Things – Digital fashion is powered by embedded capabilities in a highly interconnected network of devices: phones, laptops, tablets, and computers. The internet of things denotes an interconnected network of devices that sends and receives data signals, hence permitting communication and interactions among shared users. Consumers are using smartphones, tablets, laptops, and computers to access digital fashion retail platforms and order from digital e-commerce fashion platforms. ● Big Data Analytics – Big data analysis enables enterprises to adapt to their different processes and different business fragments like the supply chain, marketing, project management, and distribution. New software tools available in the market enable brands, markets, and factories to get real-time feedback on the quality, nature, and status of fashion merchandise. Digitally, brands like Digitalax have built the first digital fashion operating system that will enable consumers, brands, and client partner groups to interact with different digital fashion products in real-time. ● Virtual and Augmented Reality – One unique application of virtual reality is enabling consumers to try outfits before making a purchase decision. This capability offers better accuracy due to its customized measurement functionality. The integration of the augmented reality technology implies that customers are likely to buy fashion products they feel they have already tried. The Future of Digital Fashion A historic quote by a renowned philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche reads, ""and those seen dancing were considered insane by those who didn't hear the tune."" Nietzsche's idea seems related to the avant-garde ideas of a Dutch fashion designer, Amber Slotten, the Co-Founder of Fabricant. Slooten is the creative genius behind the Digital Fashion House that sold an exclusively digital designer dress using blockchain. Based on Slooten’s success and philosophy, the globalization of markets implies that brands that do not leap into the new frontier will collapse, signaling a shift to digital fashion."
12,CAN THE NBA BRING NFTS TO THE MAINSTREAM?,computers-technology," The NFT scene has found an unlikely partner in its fight to gain mainstream acceptance - in the form of NBA Top Shot Moments So I just copped a sick T.J. McConnell NBA Top Shot Moment, where he drives down the baseline for a sweet no-look pass behind his head to a wide-open Myles Turner for an uncontested dunk. I was instantly transported to the days when Beckett magazines were still a thing. When these magazines and their ilk served as a price list for NBA trading cards in a fully analog world. A world some of us never got to enjoy. But I digress. At that moment, it was like reliving the childhood I never had. I've had my share of NBA trading cards, but none of them have ever been as fascinating (if not as ""rare"" in the physical sense) as this one. And with this concept, the NBA is bringing NFTs to the mainstream. NBA Top Shot: changing the digital collectible space NBA Top Shot is an online virtual basketball card trading platform where fans can buy and sell virtual basketball cards that are essentially video clips digitized into ""moments"" on the blockchain - on an exclusively digital, 3D cube available nowhere else, rather than a rectangular piece of cardboard. While it certainly isn't the first tie-up between a sports association and a blockchain tech company, the NBA dwarfs the rest of the competition in size. NFTs are permanent tokens existing on the blockchain, minted exclusively for one asset - no other ""originals"" can exist. These assets could be an mp3, a piece of digital art, a lease contract, a tweet, or a status update.... NFTs are already buzzing on mainstream media and gathering momentum. For instance, the NBA Top Shot Cosmic Series 1 Legendary LeBron James NFT featuring him posterizing Sacramento forward Nemanja Bjelica went for a cool $208,000. And it's just one of 49 existing copies on the blockchain. In contrast, the one I bought was one out of 15,000. Okay, I get it. I've heard all sorts of arguments raised about NFTs. Yes, you'll probably find a clip of this for free on YouTube. Yes, you'll probably see it on some spliced-up highlight reel set to bad lo-fi hip hop music and watch it to your heart's content. Here's the thing: those videos of the same highlights aren't technically yours, as far as ownership is concerned. On the other hand, NFTs guarantee that there is only but one original copy for a particular digital asset - and the blockchain is what everybody accepts as the proof positive of your ownership of the said asset. And this unique value on the blockchain guarantees value where it may not have been previously perceived, thanks to scarcity. NBA Top Shot was borne out of a partnership between the NBA, its Players' Association, and the Vancouver-based blockchain tech company Dapper Labs. How it works Dapper Labs takes recent highlight films from the NBA, which are then processed into clips and minted on-chain as Non-Fungible Tokens. Each clip with its own unique identity recorded in the blockchain. The company decides how many editions each Moment - or NFT - to mint, creating more scarcity in other Moments than others (such as the LeBron dunk we mentioned earlier). NBA Top Shot is probably one of the earliest cases for NFTs going fully mainstream, after all, US$500 million in sales can't be wrong. The NFT arrangement works for all partners. Revenues are generated from pack releases and transaction costs, particularly a 5% fee on all transactions conducted on the Marketplace (borne by the seller). On the other hand, the NBA and the Players’ Association receive a portion of Marketplace transactions. Dapper Labs also charges a fee to pay for bank transfer costs whenever users withdraw from Dapper to their bank of choice. Keys to success Top Shot has succeeded in taking NFTs to a much broader audience due to the following aspects: ● It’s a user-friendly and intuitive platform. ● The NBA's massive popularity. ● Its proximity to trading cards as a hobby. There isn't anything cumbersome with how Top Shot presents its platform. It's as simple as it gets. That is where its success lies: at the end of the day, only two concepts matter—loving the game of basketball and understanding the concept of scarcity. Most Top Shot users won't ever have to work directly with the blockchain or know about its inner workings. In fact, there's almost no mention of the term on the Marketplace. Top Shot wasn't created for the crypto-savvy or even for those with a basic working knowledge of its concepts. Rather, Dapper Labs created Top Shot with a view on people who might be intimidated about getting into NFTs - and crypto - for the very first time. You can cop these NFTs directly from NBA Top Shot as limited-edition drops selling anywhere from $9 to $999 apiece depending on the rarity and availability. You can also buy from the marketplace, where individual moments from the said packs can be bought and sold between holders for cash. Conclusion The future looks bullish for Top Shot. Dapper Labs recently announced that it raised $357 million in its last funding round, hauling in massive investments from Philippe Lafont-led Coatue, apart from a handful of current and former pro athletes celebrities like Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Shawn Mendes. If there's anything that recent developments in technology like social media and cryptocurrencies have taught us, being an early adopter pays well. If things continue to go well for Top Shot, we could finally see NFTs breaking on through to the mainstream audience in a massive way. The NBA just might be onto something, after all - and Top Shot might just be the blueprint other brands or sports might follow. Time will tell."
13,Benefits of Game Modding,computers-technology," It’s hard to forget the controversial release of Cyberpunk 2077 last year, where bugs plagued the futuristic world. Cars flew down out of nowhere, NPCs glitched onto their T-poses, and quests were almost impossible to complete without it shutting down. The supposed Game of the Year contender has now downgraded to a viral meme. Obviously, the game needed a fix and extensive adjustments. Cyberpunk players were begging for it to become better, while other players wanted to try to have a little more fun with it despite the numerous bugs and glitches. Thus, mod builders entered the scene to save the day. Mods are embedded codes that change the way the game looks or how it can be played. When Cyberpunk 2077 came on the scene, mods got to work by creating a code that players could install within the game’s folders. Players couldn’t wait for the game developers’ updates anymore as they saw mods could fix AI problems and even make character creation more specific. The Witcher III, though already a beautiful game that’s won multiple awards, including Game of the Year, still had the opportunity to become better than it already is through a wide range of mods. Weather enhancements and better graphics, AI-specifics, and new items, were modded for the game. There are new stories that fans can play as if buying official downloadable content. The Witcher III’s developers decided to place chosen mods within the game interface for players to download instantly instead of using third-party installers or coding it into the game’s folders if installed on their PC. Besides fixes, mods allow some games to deliver a better quality of life experiences. Stardew Valley, for example, is played both as a single and online multiplayer game. Online multiplayer, however, can only hold up to four players. An existing mod that players can install into Stardew Valley can change this to allow ten players instead. Sims 4 is another familiar game. Despite it already being a life simulator, mods found exciting ways to make it feel more realistic, such as introducing AI interactions, new pets, and emotions the Sims can feel and express. Before expansion packs or further updates from its developers were released, the odds were that mods have already published theirs. A Creative Outlet Game modding isn’t just about fixing bugs or improving the game’s quality of life for both offline and online games; it’s also about adding a flare of imagination and out-of-the-box creativity. Those familiar with mods know the numerous content available for Skyrim, one of the most popular and heavily modified games that helped begin this trend and even spearheaded its beginnings. Players love to play around with this open-world, fantasy-adventure game, creating funny antics or adding more to the story. Skyrim is a meme in itself but in the best of ways. Some mods have created entirely new characters to add to the story, mods that change NPCs into funny characters, mods that can change monsters and dragons into something more hilarious, and mods that provide costumes or give your character limitless power. There absolutely is no limit, as more are still being created by coders worldwide. Minecraft, the remarkable survival, adventure, building block game, has various mods that can change how the entire game can look. It’s rare nowadays to find players booting up the game in its vanilla mode or original state. Minecraft worlds can range from Pokemon characters or new texture packs to new mountable animals like dragons, cars, and flying saucers. Teenagers and kids alike, Minecraft’s primary target market, have learned to install mods and code themselves to generate their ideas into a game they already love. Another example of creativity at play is the ability to make a game ridiculous. Left 4 Dead is an online, multiplayer, zombie shooter that features multiple character selections. The objective of the game is simply to go through each level, blasting zombies left and right. Mods have found a way to make this grueling task enjoyable by designing and coding new character designs—including characters from Smash Brothers, and most terrifyingly, characters from Teletubbies. Grand Theft Auto can have your character fly and appear as a Super Saiyan from Dragon Ball Z, be as strong as Superman, or even possess a Bat Mobile like Batman. There is boundless exploration when it comes to the types of mods that can be created. This ongoing trend has created an ecosystem of young and old coders helping build creative and talented minds. For the coders-to-be or those already in the field, how does gaming and modding exactly benefit you? Developers acknowledge the growing capacity modding a game brings to young coders and gamers trying to evolve their skills and creativity. Some games have begun because of mods, while others were inspired by the mods they originated from. Bunk beds, for example, were mods before the developers decided to update the product into the Sims 4 permanently. Counter Strike was a game that was born out of a mod from Half Life 1. The popular MOBA game, Dota, was inspired and created from a mod made for Warcraft III. Gaming with a Learning Experience Experienced game developers and companies don’t see mods as intrusive or destructive to the original game; they’re acknowledged as content addons and possible enhancements. For modders, they allow them to experiment in a vast playground and elevate their skills as artists, designers, and programmers. Modders have begun using their digital creations to build their portfolio, with the bonus of having others enjoy their work. Game companies all over the world see the potential of modders in their lineup. If they can build and code something that can completely change an existing game, then the possibilities of creating a game themselves are exponentially higher than that of someone who hasn’t tried to code something on their own. Modding is seen as starting points for children to learn to code themselves, giving them both the fun of playing games and the educational value of understanding basic languages and computer science. Learning how to mod is also open-sourced material. The ecosystem of modders is collaborative, and present forums and mods sites have various tools and teachings from experts who have been creating game mods for decades. Mods themselves encourage others to do the same, build, design, and let their imaginations fly. Modding makes the industry of gaming so exciting and entertaining; there are limitless ways for it to improve, change, and welcome many young and talented hopefuls into their world. It’s not just aspiring developers, but even artists who dream of designing characters and beautiful landscapes within the game as mods require the imagination and artistic flair to draw and digitally color the virtual world in front of them."
14,Are NFTs driving the hype around the real estate metaverse?,computers-technology," NFTs, The Metaverse, virtual real estate. If you've been following tech reports and news or even mainstream media, chances are you’ve heard one of these terms floating about. We are all familiar with the term ‘real-estate,’ and virtual real estate is exactly as you might imagine. It's a piece of real estate inside the digital world known as the Metaverse. The Metaverse is a shared virtual space. It consists of combining physical reality, virtual reality, and physically persistent virtual space. This includes all of the augmented and virtual worlds and includes the internet itself as a whole. That’s a lot to take in. Simplifying the terminology, you essentially own a piece of digital land/real estate inside a virtual world. This will give you the privilege of building on your real estate plot. For a more visual aide, take a look at The Sandbox. You might notice a few recognizable names from companies that have already bought virtual real estate in this space. How do I own it? It's just a digital item somewhere on the internet. This is where the crucial part of it all comes in, NFTs. These tokens are the main reason for the hype around the real estate metaverse, and it's showing no signs of slowing down. What’s it All About? NFTs have rocked the digital world. They’ve taken on a central role in this digital ecosystem, and it's a very important one. It's been talked about on many major news channels, and some celebrities are jumping on the trend. They aren’t a new concept though, back in 2014, two artists Anil Dash and Kevin McCoy, created a piece titled “Quantum.” This was the first- ever NFT created, a video of dollar symbols in a picture frame. NFTs are part of the cryptocurrency space, and they rely on a digital ledger known as the blockchain. An NFT is a chunk of data stored on the blockchain, and it can represent all forms of digital items and even physical items more recently. NFTs provide proof of ownership of these digital assets, and they provide undeniable proof that certifies these digital assets are unique and not interchangeable. What Makes an NFT Special The acronym NFT stands for non-fungible token. Fiat currency, for example, is fungible. If you were to trade $1 for another $1 you would still have $1. But if you trade an NFT for another, then you have something entirely different. NFTs are trackable on the blockchain. Due to their immutable nature, everything is recorded and can never be altered or deleted. This is where NFTs attractiveness is, and they provide proof of ownership by using a blockchain like Ethereums to record its data. NFTs are about providing undeniable proof of ownership of digital assets. The immutable data stored on the blockchain provides a very secure way to ensure that. NFTs consist of a cryptographic hash which is a string of unique characters and used to verify a digital asset as unique. They work alongside Smart Contracts, which are programs that run on the Ethereum blockchain and allow for users to interact with them via transactions. Not Real... Estate? NFTs, as you can already assume, are the key part of all this; they give you proof of ownership over digital items. Real estate in a virtual world can also be an NFT. In simplified terms, this will act as a deed to the land. With this in mind, the metaverse is a very real concept that has big potential, and this is thanks to the development of NFTs. Virtual real estate assets that you actually own are becoming very sought after. Referring back to The Sandbox, this is not the only place to purchase. There are other worlds like Decentraland, Upland, and our own ESPA which houses unique assets as well. People have been dreaming about this for years, even decades. The term metaverse seems to have first been conceptualized from a science fiction book by Neal Stevenson. He describes a cyberpunk world and covers topics like cryptography, computer science, religion and philosophy amongst others. Neal currently works for a VR technology company Magic Leap, where he runs a team who research into new topics and directions for VR technology. The metaverse can become very real if big names start getting on board. It’s very early days for this, but as technology progresses we are seeing huge leaps in development. NFTs are bringing attention to the space, the introduction of this blockchain backed technology is definitely driving the hype around the virtual real estate metaverse. The Metaverse The popularity of NFTs in other niches and markets is also driving up the hype around the virtual real estate metaverse. As interest grows around this technology people will research into other areas, this will increase the hype around items that relate to the metaverse. As people begin to see value in other areas like art, there will be a perceived value in other areas like real estate. It's not just the virtual real estate, what's helping with the hype are the assets that can be used inside the metaverse. Majority of these worlds also have NFTs in the form of items, buildings, fashion and more. Since NFTs give you ownership over your digital assets, it makes owning and buying these items more attractive. The Big Role of NFTs As already mentioned, NFTs are not just driving the metaverse forward. They are becoming very valuable in the worlds of art, fashion and online gaming too. Art is especially taking the limelight, when an artist's NFT is sold they get a cut every time the piece changes hands (wallets). Fashion is starting to see the potential. Companies like Gucci are already experimenting with the possibility of NFTs. They are looking into not only attaching them to their real world items, but also creating some digital items. With the vision for you to carry them into your favourite place in the metaverse. It's not just big name brands, there are already companies like Digitalax who are pioneering the space and creating fashion in this futuristic world. They have provided some beautiful pieces for you to take into the metaverse, and this is showing how much potential people are seeing in the space. Online gaming as you might have guessed is a big industry for NFTs to break into. Taking a look back at The Sandbox map, you can see Atari, and Roller Coaster Tycoon have purchased virtual real estate (a sizable amount). If you buy an NFT in a game, you own that item. It's not just part of your account that the company owns, it is your item. You will be able to trade or sell that asset as you see fit. It’s all confirmed on the blockchain, and you can do what you want with your property. This is monumental for games, even platforms like IMVU who boast over 7 million monthly users are looking into the metaverse. Pushing things forward, imagine a decentralized virtual space governed by the creators, modders, devs and players. This is what companies like ESPA are trying to achieve. To create an esports platform that benefits all involved and doesn't have to deal with all the industry-political approval usually required. What’s Next For NFTs and the Metaverse AR and VR technology have come leaps in development in recent years, and these will be the key physical technologies to help people experience their purchased virtual assets. The digital transactions are confirmed, and they want to use and view their assets. VR will allow people to visit their virtual real estate places with an immersive feel. AR will allow for people to experience their fashion items by allowing them to be worn in a physical/virtual space. The hype is very real; virtual real estate is also very real. Every virtual asset is a non-fungible token, even the land that you purchase. It's like owning a deed to a house; you are confirming this is yours until sold. Many possibilities are surrounding this blockchain-backed technology. Not only is Ethereum something you should be researching, and staying up to date on. NFTs are proving to be a promising solution to the issues of plagiarism in the world of art, fashion and online gaming. Watch this space!"
15,Application of RFID technology,computers-technology," RF recognition, RFID (RADIO FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION) technology, also known as wireless RF identification, is a communication technology that can identify specific targets and read and write related data over the radio signal, without having to identify system or optical contact between systems and specific targets. . Radio, generally microwave, 1-100GHz, suitable for short-range recognition communication. The RFID reader also is divided into mobile and fixed, and the current RFID technology is widely used, such as: library, access control system, food safety traceability, etc. RF Identification (RFID) is a wireless communication technology that can identify specific targets and read and write related data over the radio signal, without the need to identify a mechanical or optical contact between the system and a particular target. The radio signal is transmitted from the label attached to the item to automatically identify and track the item from the label attached to the item. Some tags can be energy from the electromagnetic field emitted from the identifier at the time of identifying, and there is no need for a battery; there is also a label itself has a power supply and can actively issue radio waves (electromagnetic fields that modulate radio frequencies). The label contains information for electronic storage, and can be identified within a few meters. Different from the barcode, the RF tag does not need to be within the identifier sight or embedded within the trace object. Many industries have used RF identification technology. Attaching the label in a car that is producing, the plant is convenient to track the progress of this car on the production line. The warehouse can track the pharmaceuticals. The RF label can also be attached to livestock and pets to facilitate positive recognition of livestock and pets (positive recognition means to prevent several livestocks from using the same identity). The identification card of RF identification can enable employees to enter the locked building part, and the RF transponder on the car can also be used to levy the fee section and the parking lot. Some RF labels are attached to clothing, personal belongings, even within the human body. Since this technique may read personal information without himself, this technique will also violate personal privacy. Application case of RFID technology RFID is a simple technology that allows any target (OOI) to identify objects. Using RFID tags with only a single recognition encoded, its application is identified in addition to simply paste labels in an entity, easy to embed the label to the target (OOI) to identify. RFID is a wireless RF technology that is transmitted through the antenna between the label and the reader. In this way, the target (OOI) can be easily obtained. When the circuit in the RFID tag has sufficient energy, the signal transmission and link will begin within the reader reception range. This method is different from other static identification technology, which is a Loud ID technology. This feature makes some inventory management and positioning problems very simple, which is why RFID can be perfect for tracking, traceability and inventory management. When using RFID to solve specific problems or improve specific schemes, that is, refer to the use of RFID application, including the label, antenna, reader, and software application system. The RFID tag allows the target (OOI) with identifiable identity, antenna and reader to identify the function of the RFID tag and the necessary information (entity / virtual position), and the application software is responsible for making ID information and related detection conditions. Appropriate use. Just like any other technique, it must make a perfect combination with other integrated solutions. Therefore, it is necessary to take special consideration to have the best results. In recent years, RFID technology has some significant progress and many successful cases. Although this technology can be applied to the tracking and visibility of point-to-point, it has not had a major impact on the logistics industry because the technology applied in this industry has been approached mature. Although the cost factor will gradually decline in accordance with the supply demand law; each other will also be established by a variety of global standards, but more importantly, the change of business models, government policies, and social acceptance can achieve global tracking. And identify. These non-related information technology issues are quite complicated, these are issues other than the information technology areas, and it is also the largest crux. Prior to this, RFID technology will continue to continue the current development direction, successfully achieved limited applications and some close cooperative relationships, and information exchange can be well controlled. Since 2006, it has been in Hong Kong's digital port (Cyberport), a senior and advanced wisdom composite office building has always used the RFID + 3G facility management solution developed by e-commerce solution companies (EBSL). EBSL also assisting the total map in Hong Kong University in early 2009, introducing RFID to more than 1 million books, making students can borrow their own books and returning books, and exempt the library's human and cumbersome rent and inventory, which in turn provides more service. In addition, there are also many retail RFID applications, including Schmidt Electronics Group Wisdom Retail System (SRS) installed in Meanel Tari-Shiji boutiques (SRS) with mirrors, can be used to provide more information to savvy buyers; Power logistics, the logistics solution under Telecom Book (PCCW), actually introduced the RFID sales management system to a leader business appliance and lighting company, not only make customers have a simple order management mode, but can improve operational efficiency and improve customers Satisfaction. Telecommunications (PCCW) with Hong Kong Watson's Mobile Discovery Kiosk, Yixin Technology (EBSL) Grand Buy Department Store E-Sample Solution, is intelligent sales / marketing management automation service equipment, you can help business Their sales or marketing capabilities. The Hong Kong Coding Association (GS1 Hong Kong) has just launched the EZTrack standard as the basis of the information exchange platform, providing consumers with product full supply chain information query and confirmation."

17,Use your smartphone’s fingerprint scanner smartly,computers-technology," Biometric authentication on consumer devices has become popular with the introduction of the iPhone 5s and a fingerprint sensor called ""TouchID"". Android smartphone makers like Samsung and LG quickly followed suit, but Google just started supporting fingerprint readers last year in Android 6.0 Marshmallow. App developers have also begun to implement it in their apps, which has allowed fingerprint scanners to really be helpful and not just a gimmick. Google Pixel smartphones have a handy feature that lets you open the notification panel by swiping down on the fingerprint reader. Fingerprint Quick Action does something similar, but you can install it on any device, and you don't even need root access. However, you can assign your quick actions. Install Fingerprint Quick Action, give it access to the smartphone settings, and then go to the application settings. You can assign three quick actions. One is performed with a single touch to the fingerprint scanner, the second - with a double-tap, and the third - with a swipe (this, however, does not work on all devices). There are quite a few choices: you can open the list of applications, put the device to sleep, activate the split-screen mode, take a screenshot, turn on the flashlight, launch some program, and so on. This app has an alternative called Fingerprint Gestures. There are a few more functions here - for example, the program can control the player's playback. This is quite convenient if you want to play or pause tracks without taking your phone out of your pocket. However, the application will need rooted rights to implement some features, and it is not available for all smartphones. Try both programs and watch which one works best on your device. The diary is a very personal thing. And you are unlikely to be delighted if someone outside gets to your records. So to avoid worrying about security, try the Journey app. It offers you to keep a diary, access to which will be protected by a fingerprint scanner. After installing Journey, you will be prompted to set a password - do that. Then go to settings and enable the ""Fingerprint"" option. Now your innermost thoughts will be safe. If you want to hide your photos from prying eyes, unique applications for blocking access to selected images come in handy. Add your most valuable pictures to the gallery and set up access to them only with your fingerprint. It will place photos in an encrypted database that third-party applications cannot open. And none of the curious will see what he is not supposed to. You can use the biometric fingerprint scanner to unlock the entire phone and protect individual applications. This can save your confidential data, for example, if the smartphone is already opened in the hands of an intruder (or simply from overly curious friends). But, of course, an extra level of security will not hurt, especially in the case of instant messengers or payment services. Keepsafe's App Lock utility can block the launch of your chosen applications until you touch the fingerprint reader or enter your password. After installing the program, give it access to the data, go to the settings and activate the ""Use fingerprint to unlock"" option. Next, choose which apps you want to protect. When you open the desired program, you will be prompted to unlock it with your fingerprint. App Lock also has several alternatives that are not inferior to this option. The password manager is convenient. It rescues you from having to memorize a bunch of complicated combinations. However, before that, you still have to enter the master password. Fortunately, you can save time by enabling fingerprint opening of the protected database. Most popular managers support this feature: LastPass, Keepass2Android, 1Password, Enpass and others. Look in your password keeper's settings and find fingerprint unlock there - it's much faster than entering characters manually. Many payment applications support fingerprint authentication. Among them, for example, Android Pay, Samsung Pay, QIWI, Yandex. Money, as well as a variety of banking programs. Usually, this feature is disabled by default, but you can find it in the settings. Yes, and purchases on Google Play can also be verified with a fingerprint. Fast and convenient. Authenticating app and game purchases on the Google Play Store is essential because otherwise, even a child playing a game on your device might go ahead and accidentally buy something. Previously, the Play Store allowed you to confirm purchases by entering your Google account password. However, it can be an extensive method, and this is when the fingerprint scanner comes in handy. You can go to Play Store settings and turn on ""fingerprint authentication"", and the next time you make a purchase, you can quickly authenticate it with your fingerprint. We often use banking apps to make payments and transactions, but it can be tricky to enter the password to log into the app every time. Also, what if our phone gets stolen and a thief can somehow get inside the app. It's scary. Well, no more, thanks to the fingerprint scanners. Most banking apps have started integrating a fingerprint sensor to make transactions with a tap of the sensor. Not all banking apps support it yet, but with most new Android smartphones equipped with a fingerprint reader, they should do so soon. When your computer has a fingerprint scanner, it is very convenient. You don't have to enter your password after every wakeup. True, mainly laptops are equipped with built-in finger scanners, and even then, not all. For other computers, you will have to purchase a separate USB reader. But a more convenient option is to use a scanner on your smartphone. To do this, you need the Remote Fingerprint Unlock app. It can remotely unlock your Windows computer as soon as you touch the fingerprint scanner on your smartphone. So you have to install the desktop application and then link it to the Android client. Quite a handy thing."
18,Why your business needs cloud services?,computers-technology," The digital era has brought a sharp surge in competition in the global IT market. It has become necessary now more than ever for businesses to invest their resources in building flexible and sustainable strategies. To push their company towards significant progress and scale-up, many businesses are now investing in cloud services. Cloud services make it easy for companies to access and analyze data for analytical as well as business intelligence purposes to digitally transform their businesses, achieve efficiency and reduce costs. What are cloud services? Cloud services refer to a wide range of services that are delivered on-demand to companies and customers over the internet. These services are designed for providing hassle-free and affordable access to applications and resources, without the need for any investments in internal infrastructure by the company. Cloud services are managed by third-party providers that fulfill the unique demands of the business and provide large-scale solutions. Some of the scalable solutions provided by cloud services include storage, analytics, networking, and artificial intelligence. Any service that doesn't require any form of physical contact with the computer hardware is made available via the cloud. Everyday operations such as file storage, email, back-ups, and project management are also included in cloud services and make the internal processes of the company uncomplicated and brisk. Types of Cloud Services There are three types of cloud services: Software as a Service (SaaS) Software as a service (Saas) is one of the most popular types of cloud services. It contains a plethora of scalable solutions such as backup and file storage, tools for project management, and email services. SaaS allows the companies to not install or maintain software, as one can access them via the cloud services provided on the internet. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a form of cloud computing that gives resources to compute virtually over the internet. To manage SaaS tools, providers need robust infrastructure, which is provided by IaaS. Platform as a Service (PaaS) Platform as a service (PaaS) allows companies to build their cloud-based apps. It helps the companies with operating systems, databases, and programming languages that are used to set up cloud-based software. Why companies should use the cloud Companies can drive consistent transformation, expand their operations and keep the processes flowing smoothly. Businesses should use the cloud for the following reasons: Cloud Services Cloud services allow companies to try out their hardware and software in a computing environment provided by a third party. It makes sure that you can improve the performance and security of your infrastructure without being restrained by resources or budget. Cloud Governance Cloud governance includes a set of roles that make sure that companies can improve their data security and tackle risks efficiently to let the operations run smoothly. Cloud Automation Cloud automation makes use of software tools to automate and effectively manage nearly all manual tasks by handling the cloud infrastructure of the company. Cloud Migration Companies can make their transformation easier via cloud migration, as you can easily move your old data and operations to the cloud, making the entire process effective and cost-efficient. Benefits Of Cloud Services Expand the operations easily A good cloud service provider makes sure that you can scale up your business easily by providing all the required software and structures that meet the unique demands of your business. Moreover, cloud services allow you to keep up with the changes and stand out in the market. Be it expanding the workforce or improving the software used, cloud services help the company elevate its current operations. Lower the cost Software licenses are quite expensive. On the other hand, cloud services are often available on a subscription basis. This lowers the cost of upgrading the infrastructure and software. The cloud does not require you to invest in resources and maintenance, as it offers hassle-free access to software and storage. Improve flexibility Cloud services offer immense flexibility, as companies are free to acquire the services whenever the demand arises. If a company does not need a particular software, it can easily cancel its subscription. The flexibility to acquire or cancel a subscription anytime saves a lot of time and resources. Wrap-up Cloud services can leverage your existing operations by meeting the unique demands of your business, upgrading your processes according to technological trends, and pooling the best solutions for your business."
19,Industry 4.0 and Smart Factories,computers-technology," In recent years, manufacturing technologies have undergone accelerated transformations. Automation technologies, Industry 4.0, and Machine Learning have brought the technical and physical worlds together. Today, manufacturing is less about producing volumes and more about the intelligent and dynamic creation of value. Emerging technology like IoT has resulted in a preference for smart factories, where machines and equipment can self-optimize and automate procedures to increase performance. Smart factories can help decision-making processes with better facts by focusing on developing an agile, iterative development process through data collection. By stretching the capacities of both machines and humans, smart factories improve performance and productivity.

Active Data: Proactive analysis using analytic to generate insights without much human supervision. The system will pin key problems and irregularities to forecast errors with high precision and provide timely information."
20,What is Configuration Software - HMI MMI SCADA,computers-technology," Configuration software is a control system composed of HMI (Human and Machine Interface) / MMI (Man and Machine Interface)/ SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition). At present, the rapid development of configuration software has extended to enterprise information management system, management and control integration, remote diagnosis and maintenance and a series of data integration on the Internet. With the appearance of distributed control system (DCS), the concept of ""configuration"" is well known by the majority of production process automation technicians. In the process of continuous development and application of industrial control technology, PC (including industrial computer) has more advantages than the previous special system. PC technology has maintained a rapid development speed, and a variety of related technologies have been mature. The industrial control system built by PC has a relatively low cost of ownership and the PC has rich software and hardware resources, strong interoperability between software and PC based control system is easy to learn and use, and users can easily get technical support. In the penetration of PC technology into the field of industrial control, configuration software occupies a very special and important position. Configuration software refers to some special software for data acquisition and process control. They are the software platform and development environment at the monitoring level of the automatic control system. They use flexible configuration mode to provide users with general software tools for quickly building the monitoring function of the industrial automatic control system. Configuration software should support all kinds of industrial control equipment and common communication protocols, and usually provide distributed data management and network functions. Compared with the original concept of HMI, configuration software should be a software tool or development environment that enables users to quickly establish their own HMI. Before the appearance of configuration software, users in the field of industrial control has to commission a third party to write HMI applications, which required a long time and was in low efficiency and poor reliability. Or users purchased special industrial control systems, which were usually closed systems, resulting in poor choices. The purchased special systems often could not meet the needs, and it was difficult to interact with the outside world, upgrade and increase power. There are serious restrictions on the use of energy. The invention of configuration software has freed users from these difficulties. Users can use the function of configuration software to build a set of the most suitable application system. With the rapid development of configuration software, real-time database, real-time control, SCADA, communication and networking, open data interface, extensive support for I / O equipment have become the main content of configuration software. With the development of technology, monitoring configuration software will continue to develop. With the deepening of the application of industrial control system, people gradually realize that the original development method of upper computer programming is time-consuming and laborious for the project when facing the larger scale and more complex control system. At the same time, the extensive application of management information system (MIS) and computer integrated manufacturing system (CIMS) require the industrial site to provide more detailed and in-depth data for the production, operation and decision-making of enterprises, so as to optimize the various links in the production and operation of enterprises. Here is several configuration software. 2.1 InTouch The early InTouch software uses DDE mode to communicate with the driver, but the performance of this software is poor. The latest in touch 7.0 is completely based on the 32-bit Windows platform and provides OPC support. 2.2 iFix HMI/SCADA iFIX program interface on desktop and tablet. 2.3 Citect The citect of the CIT company has a simple way of operation, but it is more for programmers than industrial control users. Citect provides a scripting language similar to C language for secondary development, which undoubtedly increases the difficulty for users to carry out secondary development. 2.4 WINCC WinCC of Siemens also has a complete set of the configuration development environment. Simens provides C-like scripts, including a debugging environment. WINCC with built-in OPC support can configure the distributed system. But the structure of WinCC is more complex, so it is better for users to master the application of WinCC through the training of Siemens. 2.5 Force Control Around 1993, Beijing 3D force control technology Co., Ltd. has developed its first version of force control which was still a version based on DOS and VMS. Later, with the popularity of Windows 3.1, the company developed a 16 bit Windows version of force control. But until the birth of the Windows 95 version of force control, the former force control was mainly used for some projects within the company. The 1.0 version force control of 32 bit has already been more advanced in architecture. One of its biggest features is its three-layer structure based on real meaning distributed real-time database, and the structure is a configurable active structure. During the period of 1999–2000, force control has made great progress. The latest version 2.0 has greatly improved its rich features, being easy to use, open and adding the number of I / O drivers. In many aspects of the design, force control can start from the perspective of Chinese users, that is, pay attention to practicality, without losing the specification of large software. In addition, the company has invested a lot of manpower in product training, user technical support and so on. I believe that in a relatively short period of time, force control software products will form a huge impact in the industrial control software industry. Other common configuration software is Cimplicity of Ge, RSView of Rockwell, the lookout of Ni, Wizcon of PC soft and MCGS of general state software company of China. This software has its own characteristics. All configuration software currently seen can accomplish similar functions. For example, almost all configuration software running on a 32-bit Windows platform adopts a window structure similar to a resource browser and configures and edits various resources (equipment, label quantity, picture, etc.) in the industrial control system. This configuration software all provides a variety of data drivers, all using script language to provide secondary development functions. However, from the perspective of technology, various configuration software provides different methods to realize these functions. From these differences and the trend of PC technology, we can see the future development direction of configuration software. 3.1 Data Acquisition Most configuration software provides a variety of data acquisition programs, and users can configure them according to their own needs. However, drivers can only be provided by configuration software developers or written by users according to some configuration software interface specifications, which is hard for users. OPC specification is proposed by the OPC foundation. Based on Microsoft's OLE/ DCOM technology, OPC specification provides a complete solution for software component interaction and data sharing in a distributed system. In the system supporting OPC, the data provider acts as the server and the data requester acts as the client. The server and the client communicate through the DCOM interface without knowing the internal details of the other party. Because COM technology is implemented at the binary code level, the server and client can be provided by different manufacturers. In practical use, the data acquisition program as a server is often provided by the hardware equipment manufacturer along with the hardware, which can give full play to the full performance of the hardware. The configuration software can be well connected with the drivers of various manufacturers through OPC, so it fundamentally solves the problem that the special format driver lags behind the hardware update. At the same time, configuration software can also be used as a server to provide data for other application systems (such as MIS). OPC has been supported by well-known foreign manufacturers, including Interlution, Siemens, GE, ABB, etc. With the popularity of configuration software and hardware equipment supporting OPC, using OPC for data acquisition will become a more reasonable choice when using configuration products. 3.2 Function of Script Script language is an important means to expand the function of the configuration system. Therefore, most configuration software provides script language. There are three ways to implement the script language. First, the built-in C / basic language is used. Second, Microsoft's VBA programming language is used. Third, a few configuration software use object-oriented script language. C / basic like a language requires users to write scripts with statements similar to the high-level language, and use the combination of function calls provided by the system to complete various system functions. Microsoft's VBA is a relatively complete development environment. The configuration software using VBA usually uses Microsoft's VBA environment and component technology to realize the objects in the configuration system in the form of components. The VBA program is used to access these objects. Because visual basic is interpreted and executed, some syntax errors of the VBA program may not be found until it is executed. The object-oriented scripting language provides the object access mechanism, and the objects in the system can be accessed through their properties and methods. It's easy for users to learn, master and extend script language, but it's more complex to implement. 3.3 Adding Functions to Configuration Environment Configuration environment provides users with the ability to add new functions to the system without changing the original system. The added functions may come from configuration software developers, third-party software providers or users themselves. The most common way to add functions is the application of ActiveX components. At present, only a few configuration software can provide complete ActiveX components to introduce functions and realize the access of introduced objects in a scripting language. 3.4 Openness of Configuration Software With the popularization of management information system and computer integrated manufacturing system, the application of production field data is not only data collection and monitoring. In the process of production and manufacturing, a large amount of field data is needed to analyze and control the process to realize the adjustment and optimization of the production process. Most of the requirements of the existing configuration software are only provided in the form of reports, or data is exported to the external database through ODBC for other business system calls. In most cases, configuration software is still needed to be redeveloped to achieve. With the increase of information demand in production decision-making activities, it can be predicted that the integration of configuration software with management information system or leadership information system will be more closely, and it is likely to appear in configuration software in the form of modules that realize data analysis and decision-making functions. 3.5 Internet Support The production model of modern enterprises has become international and distributed. Internet will be the basis of distributed production. It is an important issue for all configuration software developers whether the configuration software can run from the original LAN to support the Internet. In a long period of time, the monitoring of industrial site through the Internet in browser mode will stay in the monitoring stage in most applications, and the actual control function should be realized through more stable technologies, such as special remote client, ActiveX control provided by professional developers or Java technology. 3.6 Configuration Software Control At present, the products with great influence in the world include ISaGRAF software package of CJ international company in France, WinPLC of PCSoft International, Paradym-31 of Wizdom Control Intellution company and ProcessSuite of Moore Process Automation Solutions in the United States, InControl of Wonder ware Controls in the US, SoftPLC, etc. With the requirements of high flexibility and high efficiency put forward by enterprises, the control scheme based on classical control theory can not meet this requirement. After the successful application of advanced control strategy represented by multivariable predictive control, advanced process control (APC) has been widely concerned by the process industry. APC is a kind of operation and control strategy which is implemented in a dynamic environment based on a model and fully utilizing computer capability to maximize the benefit of the factory. The advanced control strategies include double control and valve position control, pure lag compensation control, decoupling control, adaptive control, differential beat control, state feedback control, multivariable predictive control, reasoning control and soft measurement technology, intelligent control (expert control, fuzzy control and neural network control), etc. Intelligent control has become a hot spot in development and application. Now many enterprises have invested in the implementation of advanced control in the automation system of the device. Many control software companies and DCS manufacturers abroad are competing to develop advanced control and optimization control engineering software packages. According to the market data, an ethylene plant requires an investment of $1.63 million to implement advanced control, and the benefit is expected to be $6million / year after the implementation. From the above, it can be seen that the configuration software which can embed advanced control and optimal control strategy will be greatly welcomed by users. The demand of users promotes the continuous progress of technology, especially in the configuration software. The future configuration software will provide configuration function and support ActiveX in a more powerful distributed environment. The configuration software is an open system that is strongly expanded, supporting OPC and other industrial standards. Besides, it has a strong control function and can be accessed through the Internet. The broad sense of HMI is ""an interface between user and machine to communicate and convey information, and for users to receive information"". For example, in a factory, we need to collect the temperature and humidity of each area of the factory and the status of the machines in the factory. By monitoring and recording these parameters through a single device, users can deal with some unexpected situations. This is a typical application of SCADA / HMI. Generally speaking, the HMI system must be equipped with the following basic capabilities: *Real-time data trend display - display the captured data on the screen immediately. *Automatic recording of data - automatically storing data in a database for later viewing. *Trend display of historical data - the visualization of data in the database. *Report generation and printing - convert data into report format, and print out. *Graphical interface control - the operator can directly control the machine and other devices through the graphical interface. *Alarm generation and recording - users can define some conditions for alarm generation. For example, if the temperature is too high or the pressure exceeds the critical value, the system will give an alarm to inform the operator. *Check OKmarts' HMI screens of all leading brands"

1,Basics of Industrial Control System and the Use of PLC,computers-technology," The components of the industrial control system (ICS) can be roughly divided into two categories according to their location: control centre equipment and remote site equipment. The control centre equipment is located in the system control centre, including human-machine interface (HMI), engineer workstation and historian. Remote site equipment is a kind of equipment that is resident in the production site and directly connected to actuators and sensors. Its main function is to supervise and control the physical process. Although field devices usually do not interact with people directly, they are more likely to be attacked and damaged because the production site is not as secure as the control centre. The human-machine interface (HMI), sometimes called the SCADA system, is a system that allows the operator to monitor and control the process. A human-machine interface (HMI) program is usually a pure software application program running on a general-purpose computer, which generally runs in Microsoft Windows operating system environment. Common HMI programs in the industrial field include Wonderware, WinCC of Siemens, RSView of Rockwell and Areva E-terra. Historian is a database server that records the state history of the process control system. In some cases, if the function of the historian is powerful enough, it can also be used as an HMI of the control system. Historian, a history server, usually runs on mainstream operating systems and common hardware devices and usually has image backup in the enterprise network. Remote station equipment includes PLC, RTU, IED and relay. Although the functions of these devices are quite different, they can be roughly combined according to their location and similarity. In addition, the hardware structures used in these devices are similar, generally providing analog or digital I / O and control functions. They read data directly from sensors and send operating instructions to actuators. In some cases, they are connected with other field devices. In this article, the equipment is simplified. In fact, these devices mentioned above ( PLC, RTU, IED and electronic relay) perform a certain function subset in the object relationship model (ORM) of the control system. For example, RTU is usually a SCADA system, which only provides the function of field I / O control. Sampling is carried out by field I / O sensor. In individual cases, RTU will generate a trigger for the actuator. The electronic relay will always perform the sampling and triggering functions. RTU will generate status data field points and sometimes process command data field points. The relay will generate status data field points, but it is unlikely to process the data field points of the command. RTU generally has no local control function, but relay has this function. In addition to communication with sensors, actuators and upper control functions, PLC also has important local control functions. These functions seem similar, but they are very different in ORM. The common commercial PC running HMI communicates with field devices such as PLC through standard network protocol (such as Ethernet). Engineer station and historical database are also common commercial PC or server, which communicate with field equipment through a standard network protocol. Field bus and other industrial control protocols based on Ethernet are used to connect field devices to other field devices. Some field devices use RS232 or RS485 standard serial bus communication protocol to connect with intelligent devices. Some field devices are directly connected with sensors, I / O devices and mechanical devices. PLC is a field device that can be directly connected to sensors and actuators or other field devices. PLC is controlled locally by the logic program (the format is generally defined according to IEC 61131–3 standard) and can receive control command and query request from HMI through control system communication protocol. PLC can be modular or combined into a compact fixed shape, but the two types basically use the same underlying components."
2,"Different Types of Pressure Transmitters, Working Principle, and How to Select Pressure Transmitter",computers-technology," A pressure transmitter is a kind of pressure measuring instrument widely used in many transmitters. It is widely used in petroleum, chemical, metallurgy, food, electric power, medicine, papermaking, textile and other industries. It is mainly used to detect the differential pressure, pressure, absolute pressure and liquid level of fluid. It is mainly composed of a load cell sensor, module circuit, display meter, case and process connector. It can convert the received gas, liquid and other pressure difference signals into standard current and voltage signals to supply secondary instruments such as indicating alarm instrument, recorder and regulator for measurement, indication and process regulation. The process pressure and the reference pressure act on both ends of the integrated silicon pressure-sensitive element respectively, and the differential pressure deforms the silicon wafer (displacement is very small, only μ m level) so that the full dynamic Wheatstone bridge made of semiconductor technology on the silicon wafer can output mv level voltage signal proportional to the pressure-driven by an external current source. Because of the excellent strength of silicon material, the linearity and variation index of the output signal is very high. When working, the pressure transmitter converts the measured physical quantity into an mv level voltage signal and sends it to a differential amplifier with high magnification and mutual cancellation of temperature drift. The amplified signal is transformed into the corresponding current signal by voltage and current conversion, and then through nonlinear correction, the standard current and voltage signal which is linear with the input pressure is generated. It mainly includes capacitive pressure transmitter, diffused silicon pressure transmitter, ceramic pressure transmitter, strain type pressure transmitter, etc. 3.1 Capacitive Type When the pressure acts directly on the surface of the measuring diaphragm, the diaphragm will deform slightly. The high-precision circuit on the measuring diaphragm transforms the tiny deformation into a voltage signal which is highly linear and proportional to the pressure and also proportional to the excitation voltage, and then a special chip is used to convert the voltage signal into an industrial standard 4–2oma current signal or 1–5V voltage signal. Because the measuring diaphragm adopts the standardized integrated circuit, which contains the linear and temperature compensation circuit, it ensures the high accuracy and high stability of the pressure transmitter. The special two-wire system chip is used in the transmission circuit, which can ensure the output of the 4–2oma current signal of the two-wire system, which is convenient for field wiring. 3.2 Diffused Silicon Type The pressure of the measured medium acts directly on the diaphragm of the sensor (stainless steel or ceramic), which makes the diaphragm produce a micro displacement proportional to the medium pressure and changes the resistance value of the sensor. And the electronic circuit detects the change and converts and outputs a standard measurement signal corresponding to the pressure. 3.3 Ceramic Type The ceramic pressure acts directly on the front surface of the ceramic diaphragm, causing a slight deformation of the diaphragm. The thick film resistor is printed on the back of the ceramic diaphragm and connected to form a Wheatstone bridge (closed bridge). Because of the piezoresistive effect of the varistor, the bridge produces a voltage signal which is highly linear and proportional to the pressure and also proportional to the excitation voltage. 3.4 Strain Type The resistance strain gauge is a kind of sensitive device which converts the strain change on the measured part into an electrical signal. It is one of the main components of the piezoresistive strain transducer. The most widely used resistance strain gauges are metal resistance strain gauge and semiconductor strain gauge. There are two kinds of metal resistance strain gauges: wire strain gauge and foil strain gauge. Usually, the strain gauge is tightly bonded to the matrix which produces mechanical strain by a special adhesive. When the stress of the matrix changes, the resistance strain gauge also deforms together, which changes the resistance value of the strain gauge, thus changing the voltage applied to the resistance. The selection of pressure transmitter is based on its application. According to the following points to choose, respectively, is the accuracy, range, output signal, medium temperature, measurement medium, explosion-proof grade. 4.1 Accuracy Class Every kind of electronic measuring meter will have an accuracy error. When using, you should choose the transmitter according to the actual accuracy requirements. 4.2 Range Generally, it is best that the maximum measurement range of the sensor is 70% of the full scale of the sensor. For example, if we want to measure the pressure of 7MPa, we should choose 10MPa as the range of the pressure transmitter. 4.3 Output Signal At present, due to the needs of various acquisition, there are many kinds of output signals of pressure transmitter on the market. There are mainly 4 ~ 20mA, 0 ~ 20mA, 0 ~ 10V, 1 ~ 5V and so on. 4 ~ 20mA is commonly used. Among the above output signals, only 4 ~ 20mA is a two-wire system. We say the output is several wire system, not including grounding or shielding wire. The other is the three-wire system. 4.4 Medium Temperature As the signal of the pressure transmitter is partially converted by the electronic circuit, the temperature of the measuring medium of the pressure transmitter is generally — 30 to + 100 degrees. If the temperature is too high, we generally use the condensing bend to cool the medium. Relative to let the manufacturer specially produce a high-temperature pressure transmitter for you, the cost of doing so will be reduced a lot. 4.5 Measuring Medium If the measurement is relatively clean fluid, we can directly use the standard pressure transmitter. If the medium you measure is easy to crystallize or viscous, we usually use the external diaphragm or use it together with the chemical seal, which will effectively prevent the medium from blocking the pressure measuring hole. 4.6 Other Info After determining the above five parameters, we also need to confirm the process connection interface of your pressure transmitter and the power supply voltage of the pressure transmitter. If it is used on special occasions, explosion-proof and protection grade should also be considered. Among all kinds of instruments, a pressure transmitter is widely used. Commonly used to measure pressure, differential pressure, etc. Different from the sensor, the transmitter can not only convert the non-electric quantity into the measurable electric quantity but also has a certain amplification effect. In today’s industrial world, pressure transmitter plays an important role in the industrial control system. It not only displays the pressure of the system on the control screen but also participates in important logic calculation and parameter alarm functions."
3,Rise of Digital Car Control Console and Application of Embedded HMI System,computers-technology," Vehicle HMI system is a bridge between driver and vehicle. With the application of all LCD instrument, central control screen, HUD and other electronic products, the driver can more intuitively understand the real-time information of the vehicle. In recent years, many high-end models at home and abroad are equipped with full LCD instrument display screen supporting three-screen interconnection. Facing the huge and complex system data, how should the embedded HMI system deal with it? With the breakthrough in key technologies of new energy vehicles and intelligent networked vehicles, the development trend of automotive electronics has become irreversible. The application scope of cockpit LCD instrument is expanding with the addition of safety configuration and infotainment system. In recent years, with the rapid development of digital LCD instrument, the display of fuel consumption, calculation of mileage and other functions can not meet the current driving scene. Especially when the new energy vehicle is running, the battery mileage and the real-time working status of the electric drive module need to be accurately displayed. This also makes the car need to be equipped with a powerful SOC processor and highly integrated HMI system to meet the requirements of future driving scenarios. The emergence of an onboard control system has greatly strengthened the communication between driver and vehicle, which also contributed to the birth of navigation module and on-board entertainment system. In the early days, digital liquid crystal instrument added a liquid crystal display module into the middle of the traditional pointer instrument panel to display fuel consumption, mileage and various driving conditions. However, with the development of vehicle towards electrification and networking, the control of vehicle high integration becomes particularly important. The driver can control the real-time dynamic information of the vehicle just by clicking on the screen and saying the command, which also makes the highly integrated onboard HMI system widely accepted. However, the seemingly convenient and fast on-board HMI system tests the software technology integration ability of vehicle manufacturers and parts enterprises. In the past, when importing embedded HMI, design engineers need to input 2D / 3D data into HMI system manually. This often leads to unnecessary costs and vulnerability risks, and the manufacturers are not satisfied with the requirements similar to real-time navigation and 360 ° It is difficult to control the complex design such as look around. Driving scenarios of future vehicles will be more complex. When the vehicle is transformed from a vehicle to a mobile terminal, the throughput of vehicle real-time data is far higher than before. The design system of embedded HMI will be more complex. At present, OpenGL ES 3.0 is the standard for the development of high complexity embedded HMI applications. Socionext, a semiconductor product and service provider, has a new embedded HMI system solution - CGI studio. CGI studio, as the design tool of embedded HMI system, uses ""candera 2D"" engine and ""candera 3D"" engine for 2D / 3D construction and editing, efficiency measurement and improvement, state machine integration/testing, functional security to ASIL standard, and perfect 2D / 3D rendering engine. The tool has been widely used in various vehicle infotainment and multi-screen instrument panel systems in the automotive industry. At the same time, the new version of the CGI studio 3.0 tool supports OpenGL es 3.0, which can help vehicle system support navigation, vehicle status visualization, task menu structure and other high-performance 2D / 3D applications. It can also improve the start-up speed and reduce energy consumption and other necessary automotive applications. At the same time, it can break the bottleneck of complex data processing in traditional HMI system. With the help of socienext's 360 ° technology, it can present a perfect 3D rendering of the surrounding vehicle. At present, CGI studio design tools have been widely used in high-end models of BMW, Volvo, Ford, Toyota and other brands. Founded on March 1, 2015, the group is headquartered in Japan, providing semiconductor products and services with SOC (system on chip) as the core. The company takes the global layout as its strategy. The group is located in Europe, Asia, North America and other regions, and its headquarters in China is located in Shanghai. Among them, socionext vision system, high-performance SOC, IoT & image solutions, customized SOC, network SOC and Internet image are in the leading position in the industry. In addition, Socienext not only grasps its own market firmly, but also cooperates with many world-class parts suppliers for its supporting products, and carries them on the latest models such as BMW and Volvo. In the future, with the help of an HMI system, LCD meters can integrate more functional properties. As the best design tool for embedded HMI system, CGI studio can not only reduce the difficulty of software development but also effectively reduce the cost, providing convenience for embedded HMI designers."
4,"How to Install Hollow Shaft Encoders, Problems & Solutions",computers-technology," The hollow shaft encoder is also known as the hollow encoder. When installing this type of encoders, it is necessary to avoid a rigid connection with the encoder. Please refer to the instructions for the size of the installation shaft. When installing, the encoder should be gently pushed into the quilted shaft. It is strictly forbidden to knock with a hammer, in order to avoid damaging the bearing and the encoder as a whole. After a hollow encoder has been used for a long time, you should check whether the screws fixing the encoder are loose. 1.1 Method 1 of Installing Hollow Encoder You should first fasten the drive shaft on the equipment and DO NOT connect the encoder directly with the equipment. A flexible coupling is usually used. Install the coupling (1) onto the encoder. Please pay attention that the coupling does not touch the encoder surface. Push the servo clamp ring (2) with screw (3) onto the surface of the mounting flange, but do not lock the screw. Rotate the servo clamp ring (2) to push the encoder into place. Rotate the servo clamp ring (2) into the servo sleeve, and tighten it slightly. Fix the coupling on the drive shaft (1) and minimize the angle and horizontal alignment errors to ensure that the installation error of coupling and encoder is within the allowable range. Lock the three screws on the servo clamp ring. 1.2 Method 2 of Installing Hollow Encoder As the same with the former installation method, you should first fasten the drive shaft on your equipment, and DO NOT connect the encoder directly with the equipment. Please use a flexible coupling. Install the coupling (1) onto the encoder. Please pay attention that the coupling does not touch the encoder surface. Push the encoder with coupling (1) into place. Fix the coupling on the drive shaft (1) and minimize the angle and horizontal alignment errors to ensure that the installation error of coupling and encoder is within the allowable range. Secure the encoder to the mounting flange. 2.1 Loose Mounting Loose mounting of the hollow shaft encoder will impair the position control accuracy of the encoder, resulting in the position deviation being out of tolerance during device stop and movement. It may also make the servo system sound overload alarm as soon as the device is started. Therefore, before using the hollow shaft encoder, you should make sure that it is installed firmly and reliably. 2.2 Faults of Connecting Cable The probability of connecting cable faults is the highest, and they often occur in maintenance. This kind of faults is the priority factor in the inspection. Generally, for the problems of short circuit, poor contact of the encoder, or circuit break of the cable, you can simply solve them by replacing the encoder connector or cable. 2.3 Wiring Error During the installation of the hollow shaft encoder, please make sure that the end connection of each pin of the encoder is correct. Otherwise, once there is wrong wiring, it will lead to incompatible operation between the lines, or unstable pulse waveform signal of the encoder, resulting in accurate deviation of measuring data. In serious circumstances, the encoder may be damaged directly. Therefore, please pay more attention to the wiring when installing the hollow shaft encoder. 2.4 Power Voltage Lower Than +5V This means that the power supply is lower than + 5V. In general, the normal working condition of the encoder can not be lower than 4.75V. The reason for the low power voltage may be the power supply failure or the loss caused by the large resistance of the power transmission cable of the encoder. To solve this problem, it is necessary to repair the power supply or replace the cable. 2.5 Battery Voltage Drop This kind of problem usually occurs with a clear alarm. You should replace the battery to solve it. If the memory of the reference point is lost, you will need to take the procedures to make the encoder return to the reference point. 2.6 Errors of the Encoder Itself This type of problems means that there are faults with the hollow shaft encoder itself or its components, and the encoder can not produce and output the correct waveform. For this fault, you need to replace the encoder or repair the internal components. With our brief explanation, you should have learned how to install a hollow shaft encoder and common troubleshooting. There’s still one thing we want to emphasize — since the hollow shaft encoder is usually connected with the main shaft of the equipment and the load of the main shaft of the equipment is impact load when installing the hollow shaft encoder, you should not turn the fixing screw too tightly. Otherwise, there will be no space for the adjustment of the spindle, and the encoder can not rotate, and it will easily send a pulse signal by mistake."
5,Programmable devices for IoT,computers-technology," The introduction of microcontroller-based boards has sparked a surge in interest in embedded systems, allowing a large number of people to show interest in the field of microcontrollers and IoT. This has increased the scope and applications in which they are used.The advent of easy to use microcontroller boards have increased the scope within which microcontrollers are being used, especially paving a path to replace the PLCs in complex control systems. Norvi Industrial controllers are such programmable IoT devices based on microcontrollers. Unlike the usual controllers, these devices are designed with ruggedness and the ability to withstand extreme conditions, which makes them ready for industrial applications.Also they are designed according to the IEC standard which is usually at a range of current/voltage and interfaces for industrial applications. Programming these devices are simplified by providing the facility to code these devices using simplified platforms like Arduino IDE, with step by step guides available to the users.These ESP32 based devices come equipped with digital and analog I/O, enabling them to detect digital logic states and analog inputs, depending on the choice of the model. Variety of models in the Norvi lineup are capable of measuring the environmental factors like flow rate, pressure, temperature and offer analog inputs (for dedicated voltage/current measurement) at the industrial level. Setting up the Norvi devices only require lesser wiring, which offers more flexibility to management of the device. And mainly, it is to be noted that the cost of the Norvi devices is kept in a much affordable range when compared to that of PLC devices, which do the same task in an industrial environment."

Please use a flexible coupling. * Install the coupling (1) onto the encoder. Please pay attention that the coupling does not touch the encoder surface. * Push the encoder with coupling (1) into place. * Fix the coupling on the drive shaft (1) and minimize the angle and horizontal alignment errors to ensure that the installation error of coupling and encoder is within the allowable range. * Secure the encoder to the mounting flange. 2.1 Loose Mounting Loose mounting of the hollow shaft encoder will impair the position control accuracy of the encoder, resulting in the position deviation being out of tolerance during device stop and movement. It may also make the servo system sound overload alarm as soon as the device is started. Therefore, before using the hollow shaft encoder, you should make sure that it is installed firmly and reliably. 2.2 Faults of Connecting Cable The probability of connecting cable faults is the highest, and they often occur in maintenance. This kind of faults is the priority factor in the inspection. Generally, for the problems of short circuit, poor contact of the encoder, or circuit break of the cable, you can simply solve them by replacing the encoder connector or cable. 2.3 Wiring Error During the installation of the hollow shaft encoder, please make sure that the end connection of each pin of the encoder is correct. Otherwise, once there is wrong wiring, it will lead to incompatible operation between the lines, or unstable pulse waveform signal of the encoder, resulting in accurate deviation of measuring data. In serious circumstances, the encoder may be damaged directly. Therefore, please pay more attention to the wiring when installing the hollow shaft encoder. 2.4 Power Voltage Lower Than +5V This means that the power supply is lower than + 5V. In general, the normal working condition of the encoder can not be lower than 4.75V. The reason for the low power voltage may be the power supply failure or the loss caused by the large resistance of the power transmission cable of the encoder. To solve this problem, it is necessary to repair the power supply or replace the cable. 2.5 Battery Voltage Drop This kind of problem usually occurs with a clear alarm. You should replace the battery to solve it. If the memory of the reference point is lost, you will need to take the procedures to make the encoder return to the reference point. 2.6 Errors of the Encoder Itself This type of problems means that there are faults with the hollow shaft encoder itself or its components, and the encoder can not produce and output the correct waveform. For this fault, you need to replace the encoder or repair the internal components. With our brief explanation, you should have learned how to install a hollow shaft encoder and common troubleshooting.  There's still one thing we want to emphasize - since the hollow shaft encoder is usually connected with the main shaft of the equipment and the load of the main shaft of the equipment is impact load when installing the hollow shaft encoder, you should not turn the fixing screw too tightly. Otherwise, there will be no space for the adjustment of the spindle, and the encoder can not rotate, and it will easily send a pulse signal by mistake."
7,Quantum Computing and the future of IT Security,computers-technology," Quantum Computing and the future of IT Security Aaron Searles East Carolina University Abstract Quantum Computing is an emerging field in computer science with the predicted abilities to be far greater than the classical computers we use today. “Quantum computers leverage quantum mechanical phenomena to manipulate information. To do this, they rely on quantum bits, or qubits.” This allows for exponentially greater computational power when compared to even the most powerful classical computers. With this new technology in development many have concerns over IT security as quantum computers are predicted to break common public-key cryptography schemes. This would be a devastating blow to IT security as encryption would no longer have the same amount of protection it does today. In this paper you will find an exploration into this concern as well as possible solutions as well as other possible uses for quantum computers as they relate to IT security. Quantum Computing and the future of IT Security While quantum computers are still in their infancy, they eventually will be able to solve problems far too complex for classical computers to solve. The main concern over this is the ability to solve algorithms behind encryption keys. These encryption keys are used to protect our own personal data as well as all data being stored in computers in general. The security infrastructure that we use to protect all types of data would be redder useless in a short amount of time. Shor’s Algorithm Encryption today is largely based on complex” mathematical formulas that would take today’s computers an impractically large amount of time to decode.” To illustrate this, it is easy to take two numbers and multiply them together in order to create a product. However, it is much harder for a computer to start with a large number and factor it into its two prime numbers. Quantum computers with enough qubits can “easily factor large numbers and break the code.” The algorithm that was developed to do this very thing is known as Shor’s algorithm, developed by Peter Shor. If quantum computers develop to a sufficient level to run this algorithm, then the encryption methods we use today such as the ones behind RSA will be broken. This means that the way we use encryption over the internet today would become ineffective and data could be stollen a lot easier. Data authenticity and integrity would no longer be a guarantee as it is transmitted. While this reality is far into the future, now is the time to think about possible defenses against this kind of threat. Nationally Sanction Cyber Attacks The first institutions that are likely to use quantum computing for cyber-attacks most likely will be government agencies. Due to the nature of quantum computer and the large cost of developing and using them, only wealthy governments will have the resources in order to use such computers. What this means for cyber security in nationally sanctioned cyber-attacks on other foreign governments. As computers and network technology grows, governments around the world have used them to attack other countries. This takes the form of information hacks as well as things like power grids and water treatment facilities and even election related matters. According to the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS), hundreds of cyber-attacks have been orchestrated by government agencies around the world since 2006. Once quantum computers become powerful enough, they may be use by powerful governments to break other foreign government’s encryption methods. It is clear that national sanctioned cyber-attacks is prevalent in today’s societies, and governments are constantly looking for tools in order to make hacking easier. In 2018, Congress signed the “National Quantum Initiative Act” which aims to streamline quantum computing development in the US.  Individual threat actors will not have access to quantum computers anytime soon making this encryption breaking concern for only the most powerful entities such as national governments. Quantum-Safe Cryptography. One possible solution to the concern over the quantum computer’s potential to break encryption methods is the development of Quantum-Safe Cryptography. Also known as “post-quantum or quantum-resistant, refers to cryptographic algorithms that are known to be resilient to quantum computer-enabled attacks.” Since current popular public-key algorithms such as RSA and ECC depend on “the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers,” they can be broken by Shor’s Algorithm thus making them vulnerable. While quantum-safe cryptography is not fully developed they are already making significant progress and are preparing draft standards as soon as 2022. “NIST will likely standardize multiple algorithms for digital signatures to replace the signatures specified in FIPS 186-4 (such as RSA, DSA and ECDSA), as well as multiple key-encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) algorithms to replace the key-establishment algorithms specified in NIST SP 800-56 A/B (such as DH, ECDH, MQV, and RSA OAEP.)” Ultimately what this means is the concern over quantum computers breaking security is well under control. It will be a long time before a quantum computer is powerful enough to break the current encryption methods we use as of now. The most powerful quantum computer as of today is IBM’s quantum computer with under a hundred qubits. The early estimations for how powerful a quantum computer may be to break the RSA encryption method is several million qubits. We have ample amounts of time and security protocols to deal with this kind of problem. Man-In-The-Middle Attack Defense A Man-In-The-Middle Attack is when an attacker secretly positions themselves to intercept transmissions between two parties over a private connection to steal and/or alter data. This kind of attack is one of the reasons IT security is needed in the first place. When data over a network is compromised it does harm to whom ever that data belongs too. Corporations may be losing trade secrets or future plans for projects as well as any other thing that data might entail. These kind of attacks among others are the reasons for IT security in the first place and any defense against them is greatly valued. Using a hypothetical Quantum Internet where quantum computers can directly communicate to each other man-in-the-middle attacks may become ineffective all together. They way this works is due to the nature of quantum particles themselves. When a quantum particle is being used in a quantum computer, they become qubits. Since photons themselves are quantum particles they can be used to transmit data. Using existing fiber optic cabling, quantum transmissions are already here and being used by classical computers in the form of regular bits. The changes for a quantum computer, however, as using a third-party computer in a man-in-the-middle attack to observe the qubit in transit will alter the qubit thus making it instantly detectable. The physics behind this technology in the form of qubits is complicated and knowledge of it isn’t needed on order to use such a machine. Just know that when you use a machine to observe a quantum particle you directly interact with it thus changing it. This makes the qubit lose its quantum state and unusable. What this means when talking about a “Quantum Internet” is that we will be able to know instantly if the data in transit was intercepted. Today a network hack can happen without the knowledge of the network administrators. Several days, weeks, and months can pass without knowledge of a network breach. With this technology we can know instantly if a third-party has attempted to collect data. Thus, attacks that rely on data in transit simply will become ineffective when using a quantum internet. Conclusion The concern over quantum computing and IT security is founded but not without its defenses. While early uses of quantum computers may be used by nation-states to conduct espionage, individual threat actors will have a hard time finding access to a quantum computer. With the development of quantum-safe cryptography comes the solution to quantum computers potential to break popular encryption algorithms we use today. In short IT security will survive the added tool of quantum computing. As this technology develops it becomes clearer that IT security has to potential to increase IT security such as the nature of qubits and their inherent defense against man-in-the-middle attacks.

8,The Relationship Between Cybersecurity and Remote Work,computers-technology," As Covid-19 spread across the world in form of a pandemic in 2020 and 2021, the job market has taken a huge hit as a result and unemployment numbers have been surging to new highs. Statistics show that “The unemployment rate peaked at an unprecedented level, not seen since data collection started in 1948, in April 2020 (14.8%) before declining to a still-elevated level in December (6.7%)” (CRS 2021). This has been a result of health professional guidelines that suggesting social distancing and advising businesses to have their employees work from home. This was a sudden change to many businesses since having employees work remotely was likely a sudden change to business operations. Companies scrambled to quickly come up with a solution for implementing remote work, and this responsibility fell onto information technology departments across the world. IT professionals faced the challenge of implementing new policies and software to allow for all employees to work remotely while still being efficient. The two-week time span starting in the middle of March in 2020 was a nightmare for many IT workers. Here is a chart showing the sudden increase in remote work for U.S. citizens as the need called for it. As shown above, the percentage of  U.S. citizens working remotely doubled in a short amount of time. While IT workers were able to adapt quickly to their business needs, two weeks is a grossly short amount of time to implement any new policy or software. As a result, IT professionals were likely made to initially ignore some of the cybersecurity concerns in favor of getting their newly changed systems working. Consequently, costs may pile up resulting from employees not being properly trained on the dangers of working remotely. This paper is going to dive into the relationship between remote work and cybersecurity, potential pitfalls to cybersecurity in remote work, methods that cybersecurity should use for remote work, information on VPN split tunneling. When referring to cybersecurity, implementing remote work policies has become a priority in the past year. This is due to attackers and hackers seeing the opportunity to take advantage of the threats that come with working remotely. 2020 has been a big challenge for cybersecurity with remote work and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. When talking about the percentage of breaches, “Last year we saw a significant increase in cyber threats, from phishing attempts skyrocketing, the use of COVID-19 and the election as phishing lures, a whopping 128% increase in malware activity in Q3 2020 and botnet traffic increasing by 29% in Q2 2020”(Ayers 2021). This trend of breaches only reinforces the idea that remote workers and systems in place to supplement it will continue to be targeted by attackers. This means that cybersecurity specialists will have to commit to training unaware workers of the potential dangers of social engineering. As of late, the common trend for attackers has been to prey on the fears of remote workers in these uncertain times. An example of this could be an attacker calling or emailing victims under the preface that they represent a health organization like the CDC. Attackers will target worker’s home phones, cellphone, text, email, and other means of communication to try to compromise any companies’ infrastructure. Now is this time for all employees and especially cybersecurity specialists to adapt and be ready for the new dangers coming in the new year with the sudden change in work scenery. With remote work, a whole new set of issues are created along with old threats being reused by attackers. For example, in the last section where phishing and social engineering were brought in when talking about potential ways hackers will attack. These attack methods are not new things, but probably feel new resulting from the attacker's timing when they chose to attack.  Some of the newer issues that are being discovered as time goes on include home network security and specifically the lack of it. It seems that workers are trying to work remotely while having home misconfigurations that are less than optimal when starting to work. Also, employees may take their device to a public location and connect to an unsecured public network that has no way to protect data from being monitored by a malicious threat actor. Another pitfall can include personal and business data mixing on an employee’s home machine. Cybersecurity specialists will have a hard time ensuring that all machines used for business stay updated since they will not be available locally. Another major pitfall for remote work is teaching the employees that dangers that become apparent when working remotely versus when they are working locally. For example, the network security in an office is likely to be much stronger than a home network and will stop a decent amount more malicious attempts at sensitive data. These are not all the potential dangers to cybersecurity in remote work, but IT workers need to understand what some of the common pitfalls can look like. For cybersecurity specialists to efficiently safeguard their company’s data, they have to make their coworkers aware of the dangers of working remotely. One thing that IT workers do is establish and require all at-home workers to configure their home network devices the same. Meaning that instructions and guidelines for appropriate settings when working remotely should be established as soon as possible. This can include settings on WPA, rules for IoT devices on the same network, and changing the router and firewall settings from the default settings. Another good practice for working remotely safely would be ensuring that the company machine being used will be locked up properly when not in use. This would mean that employees would not be permitted to leaving their company device logged in while leaving it unattended or leaving passwords written down beside the machine. Another option for IT security teams to consider is to dedicate someone to monitor their network for alerts. If this is too much of a burden to the team, they should consider outsourcing to a 3rd party vendor to fill in the gaps for support. IT security teams should look for updates on all of their equipment monthly and require remote workers to do the same to lessen the probability of being taken advantage of by a vulnerability. IT security needs to make sure that every incident, whether it is big or small, should be documented to create a timeline of incidents. IT security teams must make sure that any “Remote Administration” or Administration from WAN/Internet” is disabled so that the management UI cannot be used through the internet for any remote worker’s machine. Lastly, like specified in paragraphs, cybersecurity for remote workers starts and ends with their awareness of the potential dangers. IT teams need to dedicate themselves to training the employees of the threats and dangers they will likely face when working remotely. In between the years of 2015 and 2016, the faults in human error in cybersecurity were made apparent as “ 50% of the worst breaches in the last year were caused by inadvertent human error, rising from 31% the previous year”(Evans 2016). IT workers can deploy some of the most impressive policy and security tactics to protect their data but can still easily lose data due to an ill-prepared employee working remotely. The use of VPNs should be necessary and an absolute must when considering remote work. VPNs give organizations a way to have a controlled and secure pathway when sending and receiving data. This also allows for remote connection to be implemented when troubleshooting company PCs. An interesting topic within the world of VPNs would be whether split tunneling should be used. VPN split tunneling is the concept of using a VPN in an environment but controlling which devices and connections use the private connection. In other words, users would be able to use the VPN connection by default but exclude websites or applications like YouTube when on the internet. The biggest benefit in the use of this would be businesses saving money on the bandwidth use of their VPN. If employees always used the VPN connection and end up streaming, downloading, or otherwise exhausting a company’s bandwidth, the costs will be apparent. However, with those cost savings come risks while using split tunneling. The main issue with split tunneling is that end-users become able to bypass devices that were meant to track internet usage (Jeffery 2020). The result of this is if a hacker can compromise a home environment that uses split tunneling, that would put the whole company at risk, and cybersecurity departments would not have visibility to see what is happening. Risks also include the user finding a way around data loss prevention and intrusion detection systems. Ultimately, it is up to the cybersecurity teams to weigh the options for their business. If a business has the budget for unlimited VPN bandwidth for multiple users, then split tunneling does not need to be implemented. However, if a business does not have that luxury, they may need to risk aspects of their cybersecurity to implement remote work with split tunneling. This paper hopefully has given some insight into the reality of the situation for cybersecurity specialists. Now, remote work does not seem to be a necessity but there will likely be more situations for all businesses where they will have to implement working remotely. Cybersecurity specialists need to be wary of the best practices for implementing remote work, the challenges to cybersecurity, the relationship between cybersecurity and remote work, and VPN and split tunneling role in remote work."
9,Do You Really Understand Human Machine Interface (HMI) - HMI Q&A,computers-technology," Q1: Is HMI only used to connect to PLC? That's not true. HMI products are originally produced to solve the problem of PLC human-computer interaction. But with the development of computer technology and digital circuit technology, much industrial control equipment has a serial communication interface ability. So as long as there is a serial communication interface ability of the industrial control equipment, such as VFD (variable frequency drive), DC speed regulator, temperature control instrument, and data acquisition module, they can be connected to HMI products to realize the human-computer interaction function. Q2: What is the difference between HMI and ""touch screen""? Strictly speaking, there is an essential difference between them. Because ""touch screen"" is only the hardware part that may be used in HMI products, which is an input device installed in the front of the display screen to replace some functions of mouse and keyboard. HMI products are a type of human-machine interaction device that includes hardware and software. In the industry, it is not scientific that people often call the HMI products with touch input function ""touch screen"". Q3: Is there an operating system in HMI products? HMI products have a system software component. The system software runs in the HMI processor, supporting multitasking. The processor needs a small management system software to run. In the high-performance HMI products based on the tablet computer, WinCE, Linux, and other general embedded operating systems are commonly used. Q4: What's the difference between HMI and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)? HMI products are often called a ""touch screen"", contain HMI hardware and corresponding special SCADA software. In general, HMI hardware of different manufacturers use different SCADA software, and the main type of equipment connected is PLC. SCADA software is a general tool software running on the PC hardware platform and Windows operating system, and it can also constitute HMI products together with PC or Industrial computer. General SCADA software supports different types of equipment, including PLC, PC board cards, instruments, VFD, modules. Moreover, due to the strong performance of the PC hardware platform (mainly reflected in the speed and storage capacity), the SCADA software has many strong functions, which are suitable for large monitoring systems. Q5: Can the device with a communication function be connected to the HMI product? It's true normally. Because the universal HMI products provide a large number of commonly used device communication drivers to choose from. Generally, the communication connection between HMI and the device can be completed as long as the communication driver corresponding to the connected device is selected in the SCADA software of the HMI products. If there is no communication driver to be connected with the device in the SCADA software of the HMI product, the user can inform the HMI product manufacturer of the communication port type and protocol content of the device to be connected, and ask the manufacturer to compile the communication driver of the device. Q6: Is HMI connected to devices only by a standard serial communication interface? Most of the time. With the development of computer technology and digital circuit technology, the interface capability of HMI products is getting stronger and stronger. In addition to the traditional serial (RS232, RS422/RS485) communication interfaces, some HMI products with data interfaces such as network interface, parallel interface, and USB interface which can be connected to industrial control devices with the same interfaces to realize human-machine interaction of devices. Q7: Can a PC with a touch screen communicate directly with PLC to complete the HMI function? Sure. It is of importance that the corresponding HMI software should be compiled to make the PC a real HMI product. Q8: What is the trend of HMI? With the development of digital circuit technology and computer technology, the functional gradation of future HMI products will be less and less necessary, and the functions of HMI will be more and more abundant. The screen of HMI products which is more than 5.7 inches will be all colour display, whose service life will be longer. Due to the reduced cost of computer hardware, tablet PC will be taken as the high-end products of HMI hardware. It's because such products have great advantages in processor speed, storage capacity, types and quantity of communication interfaces, networking ability and software resource sharing, which is the development direction of HMI products in the future. Of course, functions of small-sized HMI products with display size less than 5.7 inches are further enhanced (such as adding IO functions), as well as their size and price, so that they will be widely used in HMI applications of small mechanical devices."
10,How to Install Encoders - Best Practices,computers-technology," The wiring and installation of rotary encoders should be conducted in strict accordance with the instructions of each product. While for general encoder installation guidelines, you should pay attention to the following aspects during your encoder mounting work. 1.1 Solid Shaft Encoder For solid shaft encoders, you need to pay attention to synchronous flange and clamping flange, which are different on the mounting bracket. Here are 3 methods of fastening solid shaft encoders. *Use the mounting hole on the end face of the encoder flange directly to fasten the encoder and mounting brackets. *Use the mounting boss of the clamping flange to fasten the encoder and mounting brackets by the clamp. *Use the clamping groove of the synchronous flange to fasten the encoder and mounting bracket by an eccentric clamp. 1.2 Incremental Encoder For incremental encoders, setting zero position through shaft or shaft sleeve and mark on flange will benefit the location assembly and use of the encoder. The fixed hole of the shaft sleeve on the through-hole / blind hole hollow shaft encoder corresponds to the zero mark position, which is the mechanical zero position, on the flange surface. The plat of the solid axis encoder shaft, in which the centre line is aligned with the zero mark position on the flange, which is the mechanical zero position. *Keep the original state without any distortion when installing the coupling; *The torque of the top screw on the coupling is generally 0.6Nm. Excessive torque will cause screw damage; *The encoder and coupling shall be installed in a concentric position. Any deviation may cause the mechanical load on the encoder shaft to exceed the rated range. 1.3 Hollow Shaft Encoder with Blind Hole For hollow shaft encoder with blind hole, whether it is an incremental or absolute encoder, note whether the length of shaft matches the depth of shaft sleeve. For example, dbs60, generally, the length of the shaft shall not be less than 15mm and not more than 40mm. And atm60_ SSI, generally, requires that the length of the shaft is not less than 15mm and not more than 30mm. 1.4 Hollow Shaft Encoder with Through Hole For hollow shaft encoder with through-hole, if it's an incremental encoder, you can choose clamping ring and installation reed on the same side or different side. That is determined by the installation environment on site. Note whether it is more convenient to fix the clamping ring after the reed is fixed. 1.5 Installation of Absolute Encoders The forms of mechanical installation of absolute rotary encoder include high-speed end installation, low-speed end installation, and auxiliary mechanical device installation. Encoders are installed behind the reduction gear, such as the shaft end of the winch steel wire rope drum or the end of the last reducer gear. With this method, there is no gear to return clearance, and the measurement is more direct and the accuracy is higher. You can use this method to measure long-distance positionings, such as various lifting equipment and feeding trolley positioning. Rotary encoders are installed at the rotating shaft end of the power motor (or gear connection). The advantage of this method is that it's of high resolution. Because there are 4096 cycles of the multi-turn encoder, the number of rotation rings of the motor can be fully used to improve the resolution with sufficient range within the range. The disadvantage is that the moving object with gear clearance error after reducing gear is generally used for one-way high-precision control and positioning, such as roll gap control of steel rolling. In addition, if the encoder is directly installed at the high-speed end, the motor must vibrate slightly, otherwise, it is easy to damage the encoder. This method is commonly used in gear rack, chain belt, friction runner, and rope receiving machinery. 2.1 Ignoring the Installation of Cabinet As is known to all technicians, it is very easy to ignore the installation of the cabinet in the process of the installation of precision instruments. Choosing authoritative dealers who will pay attention to the overall details and wiring. The cabinet's stable state must be ensured during the installation process. 2.2 Ignoring the Whole People usually pay attention to the subsystem carefully during the installation process, which may result in the neglect of the overall sensory acceptance. So it may lead that some wiring is not beautiful, information panel is irregular. Therefore, we should grasp the whole during the installation. 2.3 Wire Laying It is necessary to lay wires correctly in installation and connection. The space between wires should be set to be less than the specified standard. If cross laying occurs, it is better to make the space between two wires keep within the specified standards. During the laying of wires, there is preferably a certain distance from the wall. This distance is called safe distance by technicians, and PVC protection can be taken for the line when necessary. Besides, selecting qualified technicians is very important. Single-turn absolute encoders measure each channel of the photoelectric code disk in rotation to obtain the unique code. When the rotation exceeds 360 degrees, the coding returns to the original point, which does not conform to the principle of absolute coding uniqueness. Such coding can only be used for measurement within 360 degrees of rotation, which is called a single-turn absolute encoder. The following points should be paid attention to during the installation of a single circle absolute encoder: *The encoder shaft and motor shaft shall be as concentric as possible. *The connection between encoder cable and extension cable should be welded as far as possible, in order to prevent poor contact caused by long-time oxidation, which will affect the signal acquisition. *The encoder cable is separated from connecting cables of high-power equipment, frequency converter and other equipment to prevent interference. After the collected grey code is converted into ordinary binary code, it can be corresponding to the actual position/angle value according to the conventional method. *It is better to select elastic coupling which can significantly improve the eccentric problem caused by poor installation accuracy or abrasion. *The encoder cable shall be of high-quality shielded twisted copper cable, which can reduce external interference and reduce signal attenuation. The rule of converting binary grey code into natural binary code is to keep the highest bit of grey code as the highest bit of natural binary code. The second highest bit natural binary code is the high bit natural binary code, which is different from the second high bit grey code. The other bits of natural binary code is similar to the second high bit natural binary code. *Avoid loosening due to vibration during use. *When connecting the encoder, please confirm that the load cannot exceed its maximum allowable value and deviation. *Lock the screw around the encoder coupling shaft to avoid loosening during use. 4.1 Environment Pay attention to whether there are interference sources around. The encoder is a type of precise instrument which is easy to be disturbed. If it is affected, it will also cause adverse effects on normal use. Temperature and humidity also need to be concerned and understand the scope of equipment requirements. 4.2 Axle Load When installing the rotary encoder, you also need to pay attention to its shaft load and know its allowable range clearly. When connecting the signal line, it must not be connected to DC power or AC power, which will damage the output circuit. 4.3 Connection In connection, the operator should avoid a rigid connection with the encoder but take the plate spring. At the same time, during the installation work, the encoder should be pushed into the quilted shaft gently. The encoder must not be knocked, which will damage the encoder and affect the shafting. In the installation of servo motor encoders, we may encounter various problems, including mechanical and electrical aspects. If the problems are not properly avoided or solved, they will affect the normal use and life of encoders. 5.1 Electrical Interface The baud rate and transmission distance of the electrical interface can be selected according to the specific application environment on site. The actual transmission distance and transmission rate, installation of the encoder and communication cable are affected by environment, grounding and cable material. 5.2 Component Layout When the encoder is installed on-site, it cannot be installed with high-speed interference source equipment such as frequency converter, transformer and solenoid valve. Besides, keep a distance of 10cm, or install a metal partition. When installing the module communicating with the encoder, it is not allowed to install with high interference source elements such as frequency converter and contactor or frequently disconnected switch element. In addition, keep a distance of 3cm, or install a metal partition. 5.3 Grounding Protection The shielding layer of the cable shall be grounded at the signal receiving end in order to prevent the leakage current between the two grounding points from damaging the cable. If the shielding wire of the cable can not achieve good grounding protection, a separate grounding wire should be connected for shielding. For long-distance grounding connection, yellow and green wires need to be added between the product shell and the grounding point as the equipotential compensation line. The shielded cable must be connected to the metal shell (encoder or electric cabinet) of the electrical components at both ends, and you should also ensure the correct connection."
11,Scope of advanced air purifier at neutralizing coronavirus in India.,computers-technology," Summary: PHI (PHOTOHYDROIONIZATION) technology patented by RGF is an active purifying technique to neutralize the coronavirus in the air. The results of the test conducted on it have been very promising with a reduction of almost 99+%. Description: Coronavirus is certainly not the first or the last microbes to have plagued human life. You just have to turn back the history pages and you will find many cases of microbes wreaking havoc. Some of the more fatal ones have been the H1N1 influenza virus responsible for the Spanish flu of 1918, Ebola Virus (West Africa, 2014-16), Japanese encephalitis virus and H1N1 (Swine Flu virus). What has made the Coronavirus stand out is the sheer size and scale of its destruction? Even with the rapid development of medical science and billions of dollars being pumped into R&D, scientists for most of the last year were unable to decipher the enigma of coronavirus. Quite surprisingly, the world had no answer to it and all it could do was to take precautionary actions like wearing a mask, maintaining social distancing, constant sanitizing, etc. vaccine development picked up pace in the last part of the year with some degree of success. However, even the vaccine jab had its own set of critics questioning its efficacy. Killing/ neutralizing Coronavirus in the air- Neutralizing the coronavirus in the air is still the best option. Some level of research has gone into nullifying the virus in the air. Purifying the air of the virus seems to be a better alternative than a vaccine injected to an infected person. Vaccine administration is a time and resource-consuming process. Even with a very high degree of efficiency, it would take years before a sizeable population is administered the vaccine for developing herd immunity. The air purification industry has been somewhat successful in handling the ill-effects of the coronavirus. However, the normal six-stage filtration technique is not 100% effective against the coronavirus. This is because the virus is at the lower end of a HEPA’S filter range. Active air purification technique has been touted as still the best option to tackle the ill-effects of the virus. Active air purification technique and its working- Very few air purifiers in the market have the know-how of active air purification techniques. Essentially, there are two air purifying technologies: active and passive. In the active air purifying, ions are released into air. O2 Cure air purifier equipped with PHI cells works on the principle of active air purification. PHI cells have a quad metallic hydrophilic coating that creates an abundance of hydrogen and oxygen on the coating. PHI occurs by exposing activated oxygen molecules to a hydrated catalyst containing four unique metals and a 100-380 nm UV light. Friendly oxidizers (Hydro-peroxides, hydroxides and superoxide ions) are effective in breaking down both airborne and surface borne virus. PHI is an active purification technology destroying the structure of Viruses, bacteria and other microorganisms. Very few air purifiers for coronavirus in India are leveraging the active purification technique to neutralize the deadly virus. Plug and play air purifiers on Amazon are one of the very few leveraging activation purification technique. Results of third party test on PHI cell technology (an active purifying technique)- PHI (Photohydroionization) technology) patented by RGF has been successful in neutralizing a range of viruses like HINI Virus (Swine Flu), Avian Influenza (Bird Flu Virus), Norwalk Virus and SARS COV 2 virus. In fact, REME with PHI-Cell® technology (patented by RGF) has been successfully tested by CCMB-CSIR virology lab in India for reduction of SARS-COV- 2 by 97.48% and by the Innovation Bio-Analysis lab in the USA for reduction by 99% from air and surfaces."
12,VFD Basics - How VFD Controls the Motor Running?,computers-technology," When the main circuit of the VFD is connected with the power line, in order to control the motor, it is necessary to connect the surrounding control circuit to the relevant terminals and set the starting mode parameters of the VFD to the external operation mode. There are 2 common methods that a VFD controls the operation of the motor: switch control and relay control. 1.Forward-Rotation Circuit Controlled by Switch The forward-rotation circuit controlled by the switch is shown in the figure below. It relies on manual operation of the external switch SA at the STF terminal of the VFD to control the forward rotation of the motor. The working principle of the circuit is described as follows: 1.1 Start Preparation Press the button SB2 and the contactor km coil is energized. The usually open auxiliary contact and main contact of KM are closed, and the usually open auxiliary contact is closed and locked, and the KM coil is electrified and self-locking. The main contact of KM is closed to connect the main power supply for the VFD. 1.2 Forward-Rotation Control Press the external switch of the STF terminal of VFD, and the SA, STF and SD terminals are connected, which is equivalent to the STF terminal inputting forward control signal. The U, V and W terminals of the VFD output the forward power supply voltage to drive the motor to run forward. Adjust the potentiometer r outside the terminal, the VFD output power will change, and the motor speed will change accordingly. 1.3 Error Protection for the VFD If there is any abnormal operation or errors during the operation of the VFD, the internally equivalent switches between the B and C terminals of the VFD which are normally closed will be disconnected, and the KM coil of the contactor will lose power, and the KM main contact will be disconnected to cut off the input power supply of the VFD and protect it. 1.4 Stop Control When the VFD works normally, if you disconnect the switch SA, and disconnect the STF and SD terminals, the VFD will stop the output power and the motor will stop. If you want to cut off the main power supply of the VFD input, press the button SB1, and the KM coil of the contactor will lose power, the KM main contact will be disconnected, and the power supply for the VFD is cut off. 2.Forward-Rotation Circuit Controlled by Relay The forward-rotation circuit controlled by the relay is shown in the figure below. The working principle of the circuit is described below. 2.1 Start Preparation Press the button SB2, the contactor km coil will be powered on, and the KM main contact and two auxiliary contacts which are usually open will be closed, making the KM main contact closed too, and the VFD will be connected to the power supply. At this moment, one KM auxiliary contact which is usually open will be closed, and the locking KM coil is energized, and the other KM auxiliary contact that is usually open will be closed to prepare for the power supply for the median A coil of the relay K. 2.2 Forward-Rotation Control Press the button Sb4, the relay KA coil will be powered on, and three contacts of KA that are usually open will be closed, and one usually open contact will be closed, and locking coil KA is power on, one usually open contact will be closed, and button SB1 is short-circuited, and another usually open contact is closed, till this moment, the STF and SD terminals are connected. Here, it means that the STF terminal inputs the forward control signal, the U, V, W terminals of the VFD output forward power supply voltage, making the motor rotate forward. When you adjust the potentiometer R connected to the terminal, the output power of the VFD will change, and the motor speed will change accordingly. 2.3 Error Protection for the VFD If the VFD runs into errors, the internal equivalent switch between the B and C terminals of the VFD that are normally closed will be disconnected, and the KM coil of the contactor will lose power, and the KM main contact will be disconnected, which will cut off the input power of the VFD and protect it. At the same time, the KA coil of the relay will lose power too, and the three contacts of KA which are usually open will be disconnected. 2.4 Stop Control When the VFD works normally, press the button Sb3, KA coil loses power, three contacts of KA that are usually open will be disconnected, one of which is usually open, so that the connection of STF and SI terminals is cut off, the VFD stops outputting power, and the motor will stop running. When the VFD is running, if you want to cut off the power supply, it is necessary to stop the VFD first, and then press the button SB1. At this moment, the KM coil of the contactor loses power, and the main contact of KM is disconnected, and the input power of the VFD is cut off. If you haven't taken the steps above to stop the VFD, and just press SB1 directly, you can't cut off the power supply of the VFD. This is because when the VFD works correctly, the contact of KA which is usually open has short-circuited to SB1, so it is invalid to disconnect SB1. In this way, it can prevent the SB1 from operating by mistake and cut off the power supply when the VFD is working."
13,Study on the Performance of Single Phase AC-DC-AC Inverter Circuit,computers-technology," At present and in the future, the maintenance of the electrical control equipment, VFD (Variable Frequency Drive) will become the professional knowledge that all electricians need to master. As a reliable supplier of leading brands of VFDs for many years, OKmarts now shares ten simple and easy maintenance methods to the majority of VFD maintenance technicians. Hopefully, these experience can help you in the maintenance of VFDs. Variable Frequency Drive(VFD) converts power in the motion control system. The motion control system now contains a variety of disciplines. It generally includes an AC drive, a high-frequency power converter, digital, intelligent and networked control. Therefore, the VFD, as an important power conversion controller of the system, provides a controllable high-performance VVVF(variable voltage and variable frequency) AC power supply and has been rapidly developed. The middle DC link of AC-DC-AC VFD uses a large inductor as an energy storage element, buffering reactive power. In the state of power generation, the regenerative power fed back to the DC side can be easily fed back to the AC power grid by changing the polarity of the output voltage of the grid side controlled rectifier. The speed regulation system with four-quadrant operation ability can be used in single-machine applications that required frequent acceleration and deceleration and other dynamic performance, as well as in the energy-saving speed regulation of large capacity fans and pumps. In recent years, with the rapid development of power electronic technology, computer technology and automatic control technology, AC drive and control technology has become one of the most rapidly developed technologies. Electric drive technology is facing a historical revolution. It has become the development trend that AC speed regulation replacing DC speed regulation, as well as computer digital control replacing analog control technology. AC variable frequency speed regulation technology is one of the main methods to save electricity, improve process flow, improve product quality and environment, and promote technological progress. The variable frequency speed regulation is recognized as the most promising speed regulation mode at home and abroad. The reason is its excellent speed regulation, starting and braking performance, high efficiency, high power factor and power-saving effect, as well as wide application range and many other advantages. It is of great significance to deeply understand the trend of AC drive and control technology. As shown in the following figure 1, the overall design scheme consists of the rectifier circuit, filter circuit, inverter circuit, etc. The electricity is converted into DC through a rectifier circuit, and the DC is filtered smoothly through the filter circuit, and then input inverter circuit to AC with adjustable frequency and voltage. The single-phase AC-DC-AC inverter circuit is composed of two parts. The conversion of AC to DC is the rectification process. The uncontrolled rectifier diode circuit is selected, and the capacitor and inductance are selected for filtering on the DC power side. So a relatively straight DC supply voltage can be obtained. The structure is relatively simple, reliable and the performance meets the design requirements. It is an inverter that converts DC to AC. Single-phase bridge inverter circuit and PWM control are used, and the output voltage and frequency can be adjusted by PWM control. The intermediate DC link is a capacitance filter, so a voltage inverter is selected. 2.1 Main Circuit The input AC is converted to DC through the transformer and bridge rectifier circuit. The filter circuit is filtered by inductance and capacitance. The inverter part adopts four IGBT tubes to form a single bridge inverter circuit. By adopting bipolar modulation mode, the output is filtered by LC low-pass filter to filter out the high-order harmonic wave. There is AC output with adjustable frequency. The DC supply voltage Ud in the middle of the main circuit is obtained by alternating current rectifier, while the inverter part is a single-phase bridge PWM inverter circuit, where IGBT is used in the power device. The control circuit is composed of single-chip integrated function generator ICL8038, which generates two PWM signals. These are used to control two groups of IGBT (VT1, VT4, VT2 and VT3). ICL8038 can work normally only with small external elements, which can be used to generate a sine wave, triangle wave, and square wave, with a frequency range from 0.001 to 500KHz. The AC-DC-AC inverter circuit consists of two parts. The AC-DC converter (UI-Ud) is used as the rectifier part. The uncontrollable diode rectifier circuit is adopted. The DC side is filtered by capacitors and inductors, and the flat intermediate DC supply voltage can be obtained. The structure is simple and reliable, and its performance meets the needs of experiments. DC to AC (Ud-Uo) is the inverter part, which adopts a single-phase bridge inverter circuit and PWM control. The output voltage and frequency can be adjusted by PWM control. Because the middle DC link is a capacitor filter, the inverter circuit in the figure is a voltage circuit. 2.2 Control Circuit The work process of the control circuit is a signal generation (including generating signal wave and carrier), signal modulation, generating IGBT driving signal. In this study, the control circuit uses two integrated function signal generators ICL8038 as the core, one of which generates sinusoidal modulation wave Ur, the other is used to generate triangular carrier Uc. After the two signals are asynchronously modulated by the comparison circuit LM311, a series of equal amplitude and unequal width rectangular wave Um, namely SPWM wave, are generated. After the Um passes through the inverter, two channels of ± PWM waves with a phase difference of 180 degrees are generated. After delay by the trigger CD4528, two channels of SPWM1 and SPWM2 waves with a phase difference of 180 degrees and a certain dead time range are obtained. They are used as the control signals of two pairs of switch IGBT in the main circuit. The control circuit is also equipped with an over-current protection interface terminal STOP. When there is an over-current signal, the STOP is at a low level and outputs a low level through the and gate, which blocks two SPWM signals and turns off the IGBT, thus playing a protective role. PWM technology, namely pulse width modulation technology, is to obtain the required waveform by modulating the pulse width. PWM is widely used in the inverter circuit. At present, almost all medium and small power inverter circuits are used with PWM technology, which has a profound influence on inverter circuit. ICL8038 is a precise waveform generator. The frequency of the waveform can be from 0.1001hz to 300Hz. 2.3 Rectifier Circuit A rectifier circuit, generally a single rectifier module, is used to convert AC into DC. Most rectifier circuits are composed of a transformer, main circuit and filter. The main circuit is mainly composed of silicon rectifier diodes and thyristors. The filter is connected between the main circuit and the load to filter the AC component present in the pulsating DC supply voltage. The setting of a transformer depends on the specific situation. The function of the transformer is to realize the matching between AC input voltage and DC output voltage, as well as the electrical isolation between the AC power grid and rectifier circuit. The structure of this part is simple and reliable, and its performance meets the needs of the experiment, so the bridge rectifier circuit is used. Its function is to convert AC energy with fixed frequency and voltage into DC energy. During the positive half cycle of the secondary side voltage of the transformer, its polarity is positive at the top and negative at the bottom. At this time, diodes D1 and D4 will be forward biassed, and D2 and D3 will be reverse biased. The current flows out from the upper end of the secondary side of the transformer. It only flows to RL through diode D1, and then flows back to the transformer through diode D4. Then a half-wave voltage, whose polarity is positive up and negative down, is obtained on the load resistor RL. Therefore, it can be considered that the half-wave voltage is the same as the positive half-wave voltage of the secondary side of the transformer. During the negative half-cycle, diodes D2 and D3 will be forward biassed, and D1 and D4 will be reverse biased. The current flows out from the lower end of the secondary side of the transformer, and can only flow to RL through diode D2, and then flows back to the transformer through diode D3. Similarly, a half-wave voltage is obtained on the load, and the polarity is still positive up and negative down, which is the same as the previous one. 2.4 Filter Circuit A filter circuit is often used to filter out the ripple in rectifier output voltage, which is generally composed of reactance elements. These elements include capacitor C in parallel at both ends of load resistance, inductor L in series with the load, and various complex filter circuits composed of capacitor and inductor. After the conversion of AC power to DC power, there will be voltage fluctuation in the circuit. In order to suppress the voltage fluctuation, a simple capacitor filter is used. When the current flowing through the inductor changes, the induced electromotive force generated in the inductors will prevent the current from changing. When the current through the inductors increases, the self-induced electromotive force generated by the inductors is opposite to the current direction. This prevents the current from increasing and converts part of the electric energy into magnetic energy to store in the inductance. When the current through the inductors decreases, the self-induced electromotive force direction is the same as the current. This prevents the current from decreasing and releases the stored energy to compensate for the current loss. Therefore, after inductance filtering, not only the pulsation of load current and voltage is reduced whose waveform becomes smooth, but also the conduction angle of the rectifier diode is increased. Under the constant condition of inductors, the smaller the load resistance is, the smaller the AC component in output voltage is. Only when RL>>ωL can a better-filtering effect be obtained. The larger L is, the better the filtering effect is. In addition, due to the EMF of the filter inductor, the conduction angle of the diode is close to π, which make the impulse current of the diode reduced and the current flowing smoothly through the diode, thus prolonging the service life of the rectifier diode. 2.5 Inverter Circuit The inverter circuit is opposite to the rectifier circuit. The inverter circuit converts the DC supply voltage into the AC supply voltage of the required frequency. It transforms the low voltage into the high voltage and DC into AC. The inverter circuit is one of the core components of general VFD, which plays a very important role. Its basic function is to convert the DC power supply from the intermediate DC circuit into the AC power supply whose frequency and voltage can be adjusted arbitrarily under the control circuit. 2.6 Drive Circuit As the middle link between the control circuit and the main circuit, the task of the drive circuit is to convert the on-off signal of the controller generated by the control circuit into the driving signal of the device. It can complete the following work: (1) The drive signals of the four tubes of the whole bridge circuit are not all common ground, so the control signals need to be isolated. In addition, the voltage level of the control circuit is low, and the voltage level of the main circuit is high. In order to avoid interference, electrical isolation must be carried out. (2) Transform the signal generated by the control circuit into the appropriate drive signal needed for the control on-off. (3) The function of withdrawing saturation protection prevents the damage of over current and short circuit. 2.7 Circuit Composition SPWM (sine wave pulse width modulation) is used to complete AC-DC-AC frequency conversion by changing the modulation frequency. The design circuit consists of three parts: the main circuit, drive circuit and control circuit. The AC-DC conversion is an uncontrollable rectifying circuit, and the DC-AC conversion is a single-phase bridge inverter circuit composed of four IGBT transistors with bipolar modulation. The output is filtered by LC low-pass filter to get high-frequency sine wave (fundamental) output. 3.1 Single-Phase Full Bridge Inverter Circuit Set the input voltage UD to 300V. The amplitude is 1, the period is 0.2 s, the frequency is 50 Hz, and the duty cycle is 50%. Two of them have a delay of 0 s and their outputs are added to the gates of IGBT1 and IGBT4. The other two have a delay of 0.1 s and their outputs are added to the gates of IGBT2 and IGBT3. The load resistance is set to 1 Ω and inductance 0.01 H. The period and frequency of the drive signal are both set to 50 Hz. The simulation time is set as 2 s, and the simulation results can be obtained after running. From top to bottom, there are input voltage Ud, voltage Uo at both ends of the load and Current io flowing through the load in order. The waveforms of AC current and DC current are determined by the characteristics of resistive load. When the DC current is negative, the current flows to the power supply through the anti-parallel diode, and the magnetic field energy storage of the load inductor feeds to the DC bus. When the DC current is negative, the current flows to the load through the IGBT. If it is a pure resistance load, there will not be fluctuation in the DC current. According to the simulation waveform, the AC fundamental voltage output by the inverter is 220 V, which is consistent with the theoretical value in the above mathematical analysis. So the fundamental amplitude of output voltage of single-phase square wave type voltage source inverter circuit is greater than that of DC supply voltage, in which the voltage utilization rate is higher. But the harmonic utilization rate is also higher and the harmonic content is larger, which is difficult to meet the requirements of most loads. 3.2 Single-Phase Half-Bridge Inverter Circuit Set the input voltage Ud to 360V (180V for each power supply), and the amplitude is 1. The period is 0.2 s, the frequency is 50 Hz, and the duty cycle is 50%. One has a delay of 0 s and its output is added to the gate of IGBT. The other has a delay of 0.1 s and its output is added to the gate of IGBT1. The load resistance is set to 1 Ω and inductance 0.04h. The period and frequency of the drive signal are set to 50 Hz. It is basically consistent with the theoretical value. Simple -Fewer devices AC supply voltage amplitude is Ud / 2 DC side needs two capacitors in series. It requires controlling the voltage balance between the two. It is used for small power inverter below several kW. From the experimental data and waveforms, it can be concluded that when it is pure resistance load, with the increase of the input voltage frequency, the output voltage amplitude remains unchanged and the frequency decreases. When it is resistance and inductance load, with the decrease of the input voltage frequency, the output voltage amplitude also remains unchanged and the frequency decreases. Both of them have the effect of frequency conversion. The method of amplitude adjustment is completed in the rectifier link by adjusting the control angle α of the rectifier. The method of frequency adjustment is completed in the inverter link by adjusting the frequency of the trigger pulse of the inverter(VT1 ~ VT6). When the frequency of the trigger pulse increases, the frequency of output voltage will increase too. When it is pure resistance load, the phase of current and voltage is the same. When it is resistance and inductance load, the phase of current and voltage changes. Therefore, it can be concluded that different load can affect the phase of current and voltage."

15,Advantages of VFD for HVAC System,computers-technology," One of the most successful energy management tools ever used in HVAC (Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning) systems of buildings is the Variable Frequency Drive (VFD). Over the past 20 years, VFD has been successfully installed on the fan and pump motors in a variety of variable load applications. The saved energy is up to 35% to 50% compared with using traditional constant-speed applications. And the investment return period is 6 months to 2 years. The early appliances using VFDs were limited because of the power limit of motors, but today VFDs can be installed in any HVAC appliances in commercial and residential buildings. New VFDs can be operated at higher voltages than those of previous generations, providing a ready and stable, and variable power supply for motors up to 500 horsepower. Previously, VFD also suffered from low power, which can disrupt distribution capacitor facilities and may cause power company to impose cost penalties. Now, VFDs can operate with almost constant power over the entire speed range of the motor. Another problem of operational noise has been corrected too. As the output frequency of the drive decreases in response to the load, the noise of the vibration caused by the lamination of the motor can easily be transmitted through the motor to the interior space of the building. But now the drive is functioning at higher frequencies, making the operational noise above the audible range of human being. That’s just an example. And VFDs are evolving continuously. From various advantages of VFDs to an increasing number of available appliances, VFDs are proved to be even more useful and powerful. Most traditional buildings use an HVAC system to operate fans and pumps at a constant speed. However, the load of the building is constant. In the traditional system, some type of mechanical throttle system can be used to reduce the amount of water or airflow. And the drive motor continues to run at full speed, using nearly the same amount of energy, regardless of the heating or cooling load in the system. Although a mechanical throttle system can provide good control, it is not very efficient. VFD becomes an effective and efficient alternative. The operational efficiency of VFD is enhanced by the coordination and cooperation of three factors. 1.1 Operation Below Full Load HVAC systems of buildings are designed for peak load conditions. For typical appliances, peak load conditions take up only 1% to 5% among the whole annual operating hours. This means that the pump and fan motors used more energy than 95% to 99% of their operating time. 1.2 Overloaded System Design Peak load design will make the HVAC system consume too much energy in most working hours. This situation is further aggravated by the practice of excessive load design. Within the scope of the normal operation of HVAC equipment, its power system also allows for underrated and unexpected road conditions, as well as unknown loads that may be caused by different uses of building space. 1.3 Energy Consumption of Motor is a Function of Speed The induction motor is the most commonly used motor in building HVAC system. For induction motors, its power consumption changes with the cube number of the motor speed. This means that if the motor can slow down its normal running speed by 25%, its energy consumption will be reduced by nearly 60%. If the motor speed is reduced by 50%, and energy consumption will be reduced by nearly 90%. In the application of HVAC, the installation of VFD With the decrease of the system load, the VFD controller will reduce the running speed of the motor, so as to meet the flow through the system but not exceed the load requirements. Installing a VFD in an HVAC appliance solves the low efficiency caused by the first two factors, and saves energy because of the third factor. VFD achieves this goal by converting 60 circulating line currents into D and then outputting the voltage and frequency changes according to the load in the system. As the system load decreases, the controller of VFD reduces the motor speed to meet but not exceed the requirements of the load through the system flow. The most important advantage of using VFD is energy saving. By matching the system capacity with the actual load in the whole year, the goal of saving the energy consumption of the HVAC system motor is achieved. Another benefit is reduced wear of the motor. When an induction motor is started, it consumes a higher current than when it normally operates. This current surge can be three to ten times the full operating current of the motor, creating heat and stress in the motor windings and other components. The frequent starts and stops will lead to early failure of the motor. In contrast, if the motor is connected to a VFD, it will be applied extremely low frequency and low voltage. Both the two devices are gradually going normal at a controlled rate, thus extending the motor’s service life. The VFD also provides more precise control of the appliance. For example, high-rise buildings use booster pump systems for domestic water to maintain adequate water pressure at all levels of the building. This makes conventional pump control keep pressure within a range, but the VFD can maintain more precise control over a wider range of flow rates while reducing energy requirements and pump wear. The three-phase induction motor is most commonly used in building HVAC applications, some smaller applications may use a single-phase induction motor though. Both two can be installed with VFDs. While the VFD controller can be used in lots of fields, its applications requiring variable speed that get the most benefit. For example, use the VFD to vary the flow rate. The pump used to build the HVAC system can produce a flow rate that matches the building load. Similarly, in systems where constant pressure is required regardless of flow rate, such as in domestic hot and cold water systems, a VFD controlled by a pressure setpoint can maintain pressure at the most required levels. Most commercial and public HVAC systems use variable air volume fan systems to distribute the conditioned air, and they are mostly controlled by variable inlet vanes and variable air volume boxes in the fan system. As the load decreases, the variable air volume box is closed, increasing the static pressure in the system. The fan’s controller detects this increase and then closes its inlet blades. While using this type of control system will reduce the system fan energy requirements, it is not as efficient or accurate as systems with VFD. VFD can also be used in variable refrigerant flow systems. The system connects one or more compressors to a common refrigerant supply system that feeds multiple evaporators. Use refrigerant instead of air piping, and the distribution of energy needs is greatly reduced. Because of the constant change of load on the compressor depending on the evaporator’s demand, the VFD is used to control the compressor speed to match the load, thereby reducing the energy demand under partially loaded conditions. Even though the benefit of VFD mentioned above is only about energy saving, it is well suited for other appliances that energy saving is of secondary importance. For example, the VFD can control precise speed or torque in some commercial appliances. Some specialized use as dual fans or pumps, both the two units of which can be operated at the required speed because of precise speed control of the VFD. Advances in technology have increased the amount of load a unit can drive. Today, the voltage and current ratings can be matched with three-phase induction motors in most buildings. There are units of 500 horsepower or more that personnel can install on high-capacity centrifugal chiller units to save energy significantly. One of the most significant changes that have occurred recently is that the VFD control has been a must in their systems in many appliances by different manufacturers, with widespread acceptance and recognition. For example, manufacturers of centrifugal chillers offer VFD control as an option for their multiple units. Similarly, manufacturers of domestic water booster pump systems also offer controls as part of their systems, providing users with better control strategies while reducing energy and maintenance costs. When evaluating the installation of a VFD, facility managers should consider a number of factors related to application details. For example, if the VFD emits a series of rapidly switching pulses. These pulses can be reflected from the motor terminals back to the cable connecting the VFD to the motor. For appliances running long distances between the motor and the VFD, these reflected pulses can generate voltages in excess of the line voltage, thus causing stresses in the cable and motor windings that can lead to insulation failure. While this hardly affects motors operating at 230 volts or lower, it is a problem for motors operating at 480 volts or higher. To minimize the distance between the VFD and the motor by using cables specifically designed for VFD. In addition, a VFD may have an effect on motor bearings. The pulse generated by the VFD can create a voltage difference between the motor shaft and its housing. If this voltage is high enough, there can be sparks corroding the bearings, and eroding their surfaces. It can be avoided by using cables."
16,"Piston Compressor Basics — Structure, Working Principle, Advantages and Disadvantages",computers-technology," As both manufacturers and end customers know, in a refrigeration or air conditioning system, the compressor is the equipment core by continuously sucking back and exporting refrigerant. Once the compressor breaks down or stops working, the whole cooling system will be interrupted. The piston compressor is widely used in large and medium-sized cold storage. Here we will explain in detail the structure, working principle, advantages and disadvantages and common fault diagnosis of piston compressors. The following is a detailed explanation of the core components of a piston compressor. 1.1 Body The compressor body includes the cylinder block and crankcase. Generally, it is made of high strength grey cast iron. 1.2 Cylinder The cylinder is a key component of a piston compressor. According to different pressure, discharge capacity and gas properties of the compressor, users should select cylinders made of different materials and with appropriate structures. Basic requirements for cylinders are: strength and stiffness, good cooling, lubrication and wear resistance. 1.3 Crankshaft By changing the rotary motion of the motor into reciprocating linear motion of the piston through the connecting rod, the crankshaft transmits the full power of the compressor. It is one of the key components of the motion system of the compressor. 1.4 Connecting Rod Connecting rod is the connecting piece between the crankshaft and piston, which transforms the rotary motion of the crankshaft into the reciprocating motion of the piston, and transfers power to the piston to work on gas. The connecting rod comprises a connecting rod body, a small end bush, a big end bearing bush and a bolt. 1.5 Piston Group Piston group is the generic name of the piston, including piston pin and piston ring. Driven by the connecting rod, the piston group makes reciprocating linear motion in the cylinder, so as to form a variable working volume together with the cylinder, and therefore to complete the process of suction, compression and exhaust. 1.6 Piston The piston can be divided into cylinder and disc. Piston material is generally aluminium alloy or cast iron. 1.7 Piston Pin The piston pin is used to connect the small end of the piston and the connecting rod. It bears a complex alternating load when working. 1.8 Piston Ring It is a circular ring with a cut on it, and the cut may be straight, inclined or overlap. The angle of the inclined cut is 45 degrees. The piston ring is comprised of a gas ring and an oil ring. The gas ring works as a seal between the piston and the cylinder wall to prevent the compressed air from leaking from the gap between the piston and the cylinder wall. The oil ring is to distribute oil and scrape off the excess lubricating oil on the cylinder wall. 1.9 Shaft Seal A shaft seal is for preventing compressed gas from leaking out along the extended end of the crankshaft, and also for preventing outside air from leaking in when the pressure in the crankcase is lower than atmospheric pressure. 1.10 Crankcase Heater The crankcase heater ensures the normal lubrication of the refrigerant heater in the crankcase by separating the refrigerant in the crankcase. Users should install a crankcase heater in any environment. When the compressor runs with the crankcase temperature 20 ℃ higher than the environment temperature, the crankshaft heater will be powered off. When the compressor stops, the heater will be powered on. 1.11 Compressor Motor Protection Device To prevent overload or overheating of the compressor, the motor is built-in with 6 PTC thermistors. Generally speaking, L, N is for power supply, 11, 14 are connected to the control circuit, and 12 is the alarm indicator. 1.12 Oil Pressure Safety Device The oil pressure safety device monitors the pressure difference between the inlet and outlet of the oil pump to ensure the lubrication of the compressor. It is usually less than 0.7 bar and has 90 ± 10 seconds’ delay. The oil pressure difference of the compressor is 2.5 ~ 3 kg/cm. The oil pressure difference of a single-stage compressor is calculated as: Δ P = Oil Pump Outlet Pressure — Suction Pressure. The oil pressure difference of the two-stage compressor is calculated as: Δ P = Oil Pump Outlet Pressure — Intermediate Pressure. The work of the piston compressor is completed by the continuous change of the working volume composed of the cylinder, the air valve and the reciprocating piston in the cylinder. If the volume loss and energy loss in the actual work of the piston compressor are not considered (that is, during an ideal working process), the work completed by the crankshaft of the piston compressor can be divided into four processes: compression, exhaust, expansion and suction. 2.1 Compression Process When the piston is in the lowest position (called the inner dead centre or bottom dead centre), the cylinder is filled with low-pressure refrigerant vapour inhaled from the evaporator, and the suction process ends. Driven by the crankshaft and connecting rod, the piston starts to move upward. At this time, the suction valve is closed, the working volume of the cylinder is gradually reduced, the gas in the cylinder is compressed, and the temperature and pressure are gradually increased. The process of gas rising from the low pressure of suction to the exhaust pressure in the cylinder is called the compression process. The compression process is generally regarded as an isentropic process. 2.2 Exhaust Process The piston continues to move upward when the pressure of the gas in the cylinder rises slightly above the pressure of the gas in the exhaust chamber. When the exhaust valve is opened, the high-pressure steam in the cylinder is discharged out of the cylinder under constant pressure until the piston reaches the top position (called the outer dead centre or top dead centre), and the exhaust process ends. 2.3 Expansion Process When the piston moves in the cylinder, the upper end of the piston does not coincide with the top of the cylinder completely, but there is a certain space to ensure the safety and reliability of its operation. This space is called the residual space volume. Due to the residual space volume, when the piston moves to the top dead centre, the exhaust is terminated, and a small part of the high-pressure gas in the cylinder can not be discharged. When the piston moves in the reverse direction, only when the high-pressure gas expands to a pressure slightly lower than the suction pressure, the suction valve will open and the low-pressure gaseous refrigerant can enter the cylinder. 2.4 Suction Process As the piston moves downward, the expansion process of high-pressure gas in the residual space volume ends, the suction process begins. The low-pressure gas is sucked into the cylinder until the piston moves to the bottom dead centre. By far the compressor has completed a working cycle composed of compression, exhaust, expansion and suction. After that, the piston moves downward again, repeating the above four processes, and so on. This is the ideal working process and principle of a piston compressor. 2.5 Refrigeration Process of Piston Compressors The refrigeration process is carried out in the closed circulation system composed of an ammonia compressor, cooler, regulating valve and evaporator. After the ammonia liquid pressure was reduced through the regulating valve, it enters the evaporator, absorbs the heat of the cooling medium and evaporates, so as to reduce the medium temperature and achieve the purpose of refrigeration. The evaporated ammonia gas is sucked back by the compressor, compressed and discharged into the cooler to cool the ammonia gas and condense it back to ammonia liquid. Next, it enters the evaporator to evaporate again through the regulating valve, so as to complete the work of refrigeration. 3.1 Advantages of Piston Compressor The piston compressor can be used in a wide range of pressure environments, regardless of the flow rate to reach the required pressure. The piston compressor has high thermal efficiency and low unit power consumption. Strong adaptability. That is, the exhaust range of the piston compressor is wide and will not be affected by the pressure, which makes the compressor capacity meet a wide range of pressure and cooling capacity requirements. The material requirements for piston compressor are relatively low, and it can be made by common steel materials, and it’s easy to manufacture at low cost. The technology of piston compressor is mature, with rich experience accumulated in production and application. The device system of the piston compressor is relatively simple. 3.2 Disadvantages of Piston Compressor The rotation speed is not high. The machine is large and heavy. Complex structure with many vulnerable parts, and it may result in large cost in maintenance. The discrete airflow may cause a gas pulse. There is heavy vibration during operation. Though there is the weakness of the piston compressor, it is used on various occasions for its overall advantages compared with other types of compressors. Piston compressor has been the most widely used type and the model with the largest batch production in the refrigeration industry."
17,What Are the Factors to Consider When Selecting Rotary Encoders?,computers-technology," In a series of modern machinery industries like construction, building materials, mining, engineering vehicles, metallurgy, water conservancy, port machinery and other fields related to large heavy equipment, the reliability and safety of equipment comes first in process control. For safety requirements, reliable feedback of encoder signals is directly related to control safety and reliability. Unreliable and inappropriate encoder selection will lead to frequent equipment debugging and maintenance. As a result, labour costs of debugging and maintenance may rise hugely, and on-site service engineers will never be enough. So what are the techniques of selecting the right encoder? The specific work environment of various devices determines the selection of different encoders and their transmission methods. A.The work environment is complex. Frequency converter, large motor and high and low voltage power supply system, signal cable and power line are arranged together, making heavy electrical interference for encoders. B.Some devices need to be moved in long-distance and are difficult to ground. C.The distance of signal transmission is long, and the safety and reliability of signal data are required to be precise. D. Real-time and reliable signal transmission are required to ensure secure control response. E. Many of the encoders is used outdoor or in a harsh environment, which requires the industrial class of products. Therefore, the right selection of encoders is very important for the use of heavy machinery and equipment. Encoders can be divided into incremental encoders and absolute encoders based on signal principle. Absolute encoders have been widely used in many fields due to their in place design and excellent process performance, and have won a good market reputation. Incremental encoders convert displacement into a periodic electrical signal, then transform this electrical signal into a counting pulse, and the number of pulses is used to represent the displacement. In diverse fields, there is more extensive use of encoders. Based on different uses and principles, the performance of different encoders excels in the work environment that fits them. Here’s a comparison of the differences between these two types of encoders. -Absolute Encoder When an absolute encoder rotates, there are one-to-one codes (binary, BCD codes, etc.) output corresponding to the position. From the change of code size, the position of the positive and negative direction and displacement can be determined without a phase circuit. An absolute encoder has an absolute zero code. After a power failure or shutdown, the code of the power failure or shutdown position can still be accurately read and the zero code in the encoder can be accurately found. When the power is turned on, the measurement is restarted. When purchasing absolute encoders, besides examining the model, the performance serial number and the number of segmentation (or digits) needs to be paid attention to. For the selection of the number (or digits) of the split, here’s a reference formula: Number of divisions = 360°/design resolution The output code system and output mode of the selected absolute encoder should correspond to the user's rear processing circuit. In general, the measuring range of absolute encoders is 0°～360°, but special models can achieve multi-turn measurement. Selection Notes about Absolute Encoders When choosing an absolute encoder, you need to consider the corresponding parameters. The first is the mechanical installation size of the equipment, including the shaft hole size, installation hole position, and the corresponding outlet method that the equipment adapts to. Second, the size and space of the equipment should meet the installation requirements of the equipment, as well as the material protection level of the equipment. Besides, it’s important to pay attention to the resolution of the device in order to ensure that the device has high-quality signal processing capabilities. In the working process of the absolute encoder, the corresponding electrical selection is used to help complete the corresponding work. Therefore in the process of selecting an absolute encoder, it is necessary to pay attention to the corresponding electrical interface, which indicates whether it matches the corresponding Voltage output and the output of integrated electrical appliances. As a result, the output mode of the device can help the corresponding control system and circuit to match each other. Generally, choosing equipment dealers is also an important part. First, analyze from various practical aspects, including the market scale and reputation of the dealer, and its price positioning compared with competitors on the market. In a word, when choosing the right dealer, users need to choose the appropriate equipment and services according to their own use, so as to guarantee future use. -Incremental Encoder When an incremental encoder rotates, it has a corresponding pulse output. Its rotation direction and the increase and decrease of pulse quantity is read by the phase judging circuit and counter at the back. The counting point can be set arbitrarily, and it can realize unlimited accumulation and measurement of multiple turns. It is also possible to use the Z signal for each pulse transmitted as a reference mechanical zero position. When the number of pulses is fixed, the original pulse can be multiplied by the 90° phase difference A and B signals to improve the resolution. When ordering incremental encoders, please specify the selected model, number of output pulses per revolution, power supply voltage, wire outlet mode, and signal output mode. Besides, users should know whether the mechanical installation size of the selected model can meet your requirements. The number of output pulses per revolution should be selected according to the following formula. Number of output pulses per revolution (P/r) = 360°/design resolution When selecting the signal output mode, please note its match the rear circuit. If the long-line drive output mode is selected, users should select a matching receiver so that the rear circuit can accept the data. Selection Notes about Incremental Encoders When purchasing appropriate incremental encoders, users need to consider the technical parameters. So what factors do the technical parameters of encoders include? First of all, the installation limits and methods. Generally speaking, we will divide the installation methods of encoders into two types, base installation and flange installation. There are different characteristics of the two methods. Secondly, the signal processing frequency of the encoder. Whether there are internal chip and relevant technical parameters of the central processing module are also factors worth paying attention to when selecting encoders. First, note the material of the encoder. Generally speaking, encoders are made of new composite materials and metal materials. When an encoder is made, it needs to be tightly closed to ensure that the device is absolutely hermetic. The quality of encoders can also be considered from various components, so as to better meet the use of the equipment. When choosing an incremental encoder, or anything, we need to consider its price. What factors should be taken into account for this part? The main considerations are device performance and the choice of channels. If users want the encoder to have an advantage in performance, they need to consider the market changes of encoders and make a reasonable choice according to their actual situation. Overall, The main factors you need to consider when selecting rotary encoders have listed in the article. I hope you can take the advice and choose what works best for you."
18,Air Compressor Troubleshooting and Solutions,computers-technology," With the development of motor technology, the compressor is considered as ""general machinery"", especially in the coal chemical industry, machinery industry and other industries. For distance measurement applications, both incremental and absolute encoders can be chosen - from a technical point of view. The advantages of absolute encoders are reflected in accuracy and performance, while incremental encoders seem more economical and practical. A correctly working compressor determines the safe operation of the whole air conditioner or refrigerator. For example, during the operation of a piston compressor, there would be burnout, oiler failure or low pressure and gas shortage. Once these problems occur, the appliance would not work right. How to quickly and accurately detect and solve these problems in time affects the compressor operating rate and product output. This article will analyze all common faults of AC compressors and provide solutions. From the perspective of airflow, a possible fault is that the wind pressure or the temperature of compressed air is too high, which may cause spontaneous combustion of carbon deposits and explosion of the pressure vessel if the protective device fails. Another possible problem is that the air volume is insufficient or the air volume is too low, which will affect production. From the perspective of the compressor structure, there are four types of problems: problems of the lubrication system, cooling water circuit, compressed air circuit and mechanical failure. When a piston compressor is in operation, the Babbitt layer of the main bearing shell or connecting rod bearing shell may be burnt or fall off. This causes the temperature of the bearing shell to rise, producing high temperature and smoke, making the Babbitt alloy melt. -1.1 Low Oil Temperature In the past, we are worried about the high oil temperature of the crankcase that can cause burnout. It is stated in the manual that the oil temperature cannot exceed 60℃ or 70℃, but there is no lowest limit. However, oil temperature lower than the standard may cause the same fault. In winter, after the compressor is shut down, the oil temperature in the crankcase of the compressor is lowered. So the oil is very viscous and the shell is burned after the machine is turned on again. Therefore, it is better to use low-consistency oil in winter. -1.2 Low Oil Level in Crankcase If the lower hole of the oil level is blocked, the dropping oil level cannot be found. And if the crankcase oil level is too low, the oil pump will suck in air intermittently. Air drag is generated in the drainpipe, causing the oil film of the bearing shell damaged. Afterwards, the compressor shell will be poorly moisturized gradually, and it leads to burnout in the end. -1.3 Clearance Between Bearing Shell and Shaft We used to adopt the method of pressing lead wire to measure the clearance between the bearing shell and the shaft. This method is suitable for measuring the main bearing shell because the main bearing is fixed and the upper shell cover is buckled on the main journal that will not move when the bolt is tightened. However, the method is not appropriate for the measurement of connecting rod bearing shell. When tightening the connecting rod, the lead wire will be squeezed. If the connecting rod is tilted, it cannot truly reflect the clearance. Therefore, we should use a dial indicator to measure the clearance according to the size of the shaft. -2.1 Fail to Fill Oil If the oil injector is not filled with oil, it should be disassembled and inspected. If the plunger and the pump body are excessively worn, causing the gap to increase and the pressure oil to leak back, you should clean, and repair, and replace them. -2.2 Fail to Suck Oil If the oil injector does not suck oil, and it does not drip oil when viewed from the oil cover, it means that the oil suction valve is stuck, or the oil cover is not installed tightly, and the air has entered. It is necessary to clean the oil suction ball valve in the oil injection pump and replace the rubber ring of the oil cover. -2.3 Insufficient Oil Supply The insufficient oil supply of the oil injector is due to long-term operation with an uncleaned system, which has resulted in pipeline blockage finally. Or it may be that the nut joint is not tightened after overhaul, causing oil leakage. To solve it, you should clean the pipeline and tighten the joints. When the compressor pressure is low and the air volume is insufficient, if there is no air leakage in the compressed air pipeline, it is usually the problem of the compressor unit itself. There are several problems that cause the insufficient exhaust volume of the compressor unit. -3.1 Timely Maintenance First of all, check whether the compressor discharge has decreased after maintenance. How long has the service last? If the environment is not ideal, check whether the air filter is blocked when the compressor runs for 2000 hours. If the air filter is not blocked seriously, you can just carry out a dust removal procedure. If the blockage is serious, you should replace the old air filter with a new one. Most of the time, there is no big problem when the discharge of the compressor drops. The problem is that the customer neglects the maintenance and the air filter of the compressor is blocked. After replacing a new air filter, the compressor can work normally. In addition to an air filter, lubricant and other filter elements are also critical. Check whether the lubricant is within the standard range. If it is missing, please add it appropriately. -3.2 Open Intake Valve If the discharge of the compressor decreases, check the unit. If your compressor has just been served with a maintenance service, and there’s no problem with three filters and oil products, a technician should check the intake valve of the compressor. Remove the intake hose, open the compressor, and watch whether the opening of the intake valve is normal. Generally, the theoretical design service life of the intake valve is 100000 times. Due to the different brands and batches of each manufacturer, the quality may be different. Therefore the failure of the intake valve may lead to the decrease of the unit's exhaust volume. If the intake valve cannot be fully opened when the compressor is loaded, it can be concluded that the decrease of exhaust volume is the fault of the intake valve, which should be removed for maintenance or replacement. -3.3 Motor Failure After the troubleshooting of the intake valve and the exhaust volume of the unit is still unchanged, you should consider whether the motor is functioning well. Due to the local short circuit in the motor coil, or bearing wear and motor shaft wear, the motor speed is lower than the rated speed, which reduces the discharge capacity of the compressor. The motor coil and bearing should be overhauled, and the discharge capacity of the compressor should be tested after repair. -3.4 Working Pressure is Set to Be Low If the working pressure switch of the compressor is set to be lower than standard, it should be raised to an upper value. During factory debugging of the compressor, the working pressure is set according to customer needs. During customers’ use period, it may be set at a differential pressure. For example, when the compressor starts to pump air into the air tank, and the pressure reaches 10kg, the compressor stops or unloads. When the pressure reaches 7kg, the compressor starts up again. There is a pressure difference between them. This process can leave the compressor with a rest to protect it. Different compressor switches have different adjustment methods. One is that the pressure difference is fixed by the switch itself, which only regulates the automatic shutdown pressure and the maximum pressure. This kind of switch is equipped with two buttons adjusted by a slotted screwdriver. The two buttons must be adjusted in the same way. Otherwise, they will move together and stop, stop and start again, and burn out the electrical appliances. The other is to regulate the starting pressure (low pressure) and the stopping pressure (high pressure). Turn the pressure adjusting screw clockwise to increase the closing and opening pressure simultaneously. Turn the pressure adjusting screw anticlockwise to decrease the closing and opening pressure simultaneously. When the differential pressure adjusting screw is rotated clockwise, the closing pressure does not change and the opening pressure increases. When the differential pressure adjusting screw is rotated anticlockwise, the closing pressure remains unchanged and the opening pressure decreases. If it’s the pressure switch failure that causes a working pressure error, you should replace the pressure switch if it cannot be repaired. -3.5 Change of Environment If a compressor was used in a low altitude area at first and was moved to a high altitude area with other equipment due to the relocation of the factory, and the environment became humid, which may lead to the decrease of the unit discharge. The higher the altitude, the thinner the air and the smaller the gas production per unit time. If there’s too much water in the air, the compressed air will contain a lot of water naturally. In the processing afterwards, the participation of water vapour will result in reduced exhaust. -3.6 Loose Belt of Compressor Drive In this case, you should adjust the drive belt. If it’s damaged, replace it with a new one. According to the matching of the pulley and the shaft, the proper positioning method should be selected. The pulley is installed on the compressor head shaft and a compressor motor. Firstly, the pulley of the compressor head is fixed and locked. If it’s loose, you can tighten it with soft copper, aluminium or rubber hammers. If it’s tight, the pressing or heating red pressing method can be used for assembly, and the heating temperature should be controlled at 120-150 ℃. If the tolerance fit of the taper sleeve pulley is slightly tight, the inner hole of the cone sleeve can be slightly extended and installed on the shaft. The verticality of two belt wheels and the same reference plane shall be measured with a horizontal ruler (accuracy ≤ 0.5mm), and the allowable error shall be ≤ 0.5mm. The verticality error is greater than 0.5mm. The installation foundation of the compressor head or compressor oil gas drum can be adjusted by using a gasket, to ensure that the vertical error of the same datum plane is not more than 0.5mm. You should also tighten the compressor head or compressor oil and gas drum mounting bolts. Install the belt on the pulley according to the principle that the trademark is in the same position. Take a small pulley as the benchmark, measure the plane straightness of two belt wheels with a ruler or laser measuring instrument, and the allowable error is ≤ 0.5mm. Tension the belt with the compressor motor adjustment screw. On the contrary, take the large pulley as the benchmark, recheck the flatness straightness of the two pulleys, and the allowable error is less than 0.5mm. Finally, lock the adjusting screw and nut. The belt replacement is the same as the belt adjustment. Only attention should be paid to the replacement of the belt, and not only one belt, otherwise, but the new belt will also be damaged due to the different belt tension. Do not splash lubricating oil on the belt or pulley in case of the belt slipping. Check the belt after the first operation of the new machine for 30h. If there is any slack in the compressor belt, it should be adjusted immediately. There are several kinds of compressors according to their different principles and structures, including piston compressor, rotary compressor, centrifugal compressor and axial flow compressor. Plus the application occasions and usage methods of each type of compressor are different, different failures will occur. If you want to know a detailed introduction about compressor types, check this article: Common Types of Refrigeration Compressors: A Comprehensive Guide Afterwards, we will analyze the special problems of some common compressors and propose solutions, such as piston compressors, centrifugal compressor, and screw compressors. -4.1 Piston Compressor Troubleshooting Common problems of piston compressors can be summarized as follows: The compressor cannot start normally The compressor starts and stops frequently Liquid hammer phenomenon of compressor Excessive noise in operation Abnormal discharge pressure and discharge temperature Abnormal compressor oil pressure -4.2 Centrifugal Compressor Troubleshooting Common faults of centrifugal compressors can be summarized as the following 11 points. Abnormal vibration and noise Bearing failure Thrust bearing failure The oil seal ring and the seal ring are faulty and the seal is unstable The sealing system is unstable and abnormal Performance does not meet the requirements Surge The impeller is damaged Leak Insufficient flow and exhaust Prime mover overload -4.3 Screw Compressor Troubleshooting Screw compressors as one type of compressors that are commonly used, with 11 common faults. The compressor cannot be started The compressor cannot build pressure Too high Exhaust temperature or over-temperature protection Frequent conversion between full load and no-load operation Fail to work without load; cannot maintain pressure or safety valve action when no-load Exhaust volume or pressure is lower than normal Large oil content in the exhaust gas, high oil consumption of the compressor Oil spill Abnormal sound of the unit Overload protection During the start-up process, the host is overloaded or blocked. The main contactor often acts In general, there are a variety of compressors, and they may have different problems due to different work environments and operating methods. At this point, different solutions are needed. However, the structural principle is almost the same, as well as similarly basic operation method. Therefore, in reality, similar problems of different compressors can be used for reference."

1,Develop and maintain multiple database engines with one platform,computers-technology," Working with multiple database engines is often fraught with complexity. A typical situation involves the use of multiple tools to help overcome the many issues with interoperability. This sort of environment can make it a lot harder to work efficiently and maintain high levels of productivity. A classic example of software bloat, which is a major and recurring issue in today's IT and development environments, working with multiple databases often incurs a high risk of costly issues born of unnecessary complexity. Database managers and developers routinely encounter a range of complicated issues, such as regularly switching between apps and navigating different user interfaces. All the while, there is a significantly increased risk of human error. These are the reasons why it is always better to take a more consolidated approach to database development and management. Database Workbench Pro aims to solve these problems by unifying database engine development management in a single operational environment. It has been designed with simplicity and streamlined workflows in mind to provide database technicians and developers with a cohesive set of tools that work with all of the major database engines. As a fully unified solution, this boosts productivity, reduces risk, and eliminates many hours of hard work trying to solve interoperability issues. In other words, it lets you work with a single conceptual data model, even if the underlying physical models are all different. This means, for example, that you can reverse engineer existing databases, create sub diagrams, and print out graphical overviews to represent your data in a pleasing and easily understandable visual form. Indeed, this visual approach makes it much easier to design databases and the relationships between them, and in a fraction of the time it would take otherwise. Thanks to the power of conceptual data models, developers can apply their own business rules to align them with physical data modelling. This allows them to use exported diagrams with existing documentations, document their databases, and simplify the rules and responsibilities for managers. With the user-friendly graphical editors, users do not need to remember specific SQL syntax either.

2,Triassic Solutions - End-to-End Product Development | Digital Transformation | Industrial Automation,computers-technology," Blockchain is the technological advancement that took the world by storm in data storage and distribution, especially in the financial sector. Its immense success across industries has left the healthcare industry reading with questions as well. People are calling blockchain the answer to interoperability. However, if the confusion looms, blockchain will take twice as long to make a healthcare difference. Let’s start by unpacking blockchain, one question at a time, and then see what it means for healthcare. How does blockchain work? Blockchain is a peer-to-peer distributed ledger technology and has three main components: Distributed network: The decentralized P2P architecture comprises nodes that represent network participants, and every node stores a copy of the blockchain, authorized to verify and certify digital transactions on the network. Shared ledger: Digital transactions within the network are recorded by its members into a shared ledger. The members run algorithms and verify transaction proposals, and then once a majority of members approve the proposal, it is added to the shared ledger. Transparent transaction: Any digital asset or information stored in a blockchain could qualify as a transparent transaction. Each transaction is marked by a cryptographic hash that adds the transactions in a linear, chronological order. Imagine blockchain in healthcare Critical healthcare information is scattered across multiple systems, and sometimes, it isn’t available when needed the most. The current healthcare infrastructure has been labeled inadequate to handle information exchange and requires certain tweaks. According to the most recent Gartner Hype Cycle, Blockchain has transcended the “innovation trigger” and has reached the “peak of inflated expectations,” making it relevant for healthcare and data integration. Why should blockchain be integrated into healthcare? A major factor that makes the use of blockchain revolutionary in healthcare is the lack of a central administrator. Why? Because a database is still a tangible thing- consisting of bits and bytes. The contents of the database could be corrupted if they are stored in a particular computer’s physical memory. By using blockchain, you eliminate the need for a central administrator, and all of your data and transactions are protected by clever cryptography. Since healthcare deals with confidential patient information and requires quick access to records, blockchain enables these medical records to be shared securely. Blockchain, at a glance, offers access security, scalability, and data privacy. Blockchain implementation in healthcare will be an incremental process rather than a panacea to address all data management challenges. 5 ways blockchain can improve healthcare: The blockchain can assist providers with compiling longitudinal patient records- including episodes, disease registries, lab results, treatments- facilitating the discovery of better ways to deliver care. Data we manage in healthcare can get mismatched or duplicated. Additionally, varying EHRs have different schemas for every single field- coming up with different methods of entering and manipulating even the most basic data sets. Blockchain stores the entire database in a hashed format, not just the primary keys themselves. The user would search for the address – there can be multiple addresses and thousands of keys, but they will all return to single patient identification. Since blockchain operates on a validation-based exchange, the claim can be automatically verified where the network agrees on the way the contract is implemented. Additionally, there would be fewer errors or frauds since there is no central authority. Blockchain-based contracts can assist healthcare organizations in monitoring supply-demand cycles throughout their entire life cycle – how are contracts being executed, if they are successful, and if there are any delays in their delivery. 5)Interoperation A dependable EHR interoperability and data storage process can be implemented with sophisticated APIs. Combined with a blockchain network shared with authorized providers in a secure and standardized way, this would enable eliminating the cost and burden of data reconciliation. In addition to these, blockchain can transform revenue cycle management, drug supply management, clinical trials and fraud prevention. internet product development Conclusion: The potential of blockchain in healthcare is mostly dependent on how willing healthcare organizations are to develop the required technical infrastructure. Blockchain is a costly technology, there are concerns regarding its integration with the existing technology, and they’re certain is speculation regarding its cultural adoption. However, for sure, blockchain has taken healthcare by storm over the past year, and there has been a significant investment in blockchain. Its broad potential is little surprise. Blockchain is poised to transform the digital landscape in the future. And maybe someday, it’ll do the same for big data."
3,Leave nothing to chance with drive image backup software,computers-technology," Many of us have known that dreaded feeling of losing important files. There are many things that can go wrong, resulting in the loss of your documents or even an entire storage device. Ransomware, for example, has presented a serious problem in recent years by encrypting entire hard drives and making them inaccessible without paying a lofty ransom to cybercriminals. Hardware failures are another constant risk, and even something as simple as a power outage can cause hard drive corruption. However, whether accidental or due to malicious software, there are many ways to reduce the risk to your files and protect your digital life. While data recovery software can be suitable for use as a last resort, it often lacks reliability. For this reason, it is important to take a proactive approach using a comprehensive solution like drive image backup software. TeraByte Drive Image Backup and Restore is an all-in-one backup platform that makes a byte-by-byte copy of the entire contents of a hard drive or other storage media. That way, nothing is left to chance. This is important, since there is a high chance that not all of your important files are in a single folder, such as the My Documents folder. Many programs also save files to other locations by default. On top of that, computers have many software licenses installed and information about saved settings, all of which are likely to be spread across the hard drive in various locations. Because of this, it is best to use a solution that makes a complete image of your hard drive at a given point of time. This is vastly more powerful and comprehensive than the System Restore function included in Windows, as it backs up everything - even including unoccupied sectors if you want. No backup solution would be particularly useful if it did not support all the backup storage devices and platforms you need to ensure your files are always kept safe. For example, one of the most common approaches to backup is the 3-2-1 methodology. This involves having three copies of your files, including at least two stored locally and one stored in the cloud. However, for extra protection, many experts recommend following the 4-2-2 or 5-2-3 strategy, which involves having two or three copies stored off-site. This ensures your data is safe from more advanced threats, such as far-reaching cyberattacks and ransomware. TeraByte Drive Image Backup and Restore lets you back up your files to internal or networked hard drives and other storage devices. It uses the Volume Shadow Copy (VSS) service too, and combined with PHYLock, it lets you continue using your PC without the backup process interrupting you. The latest version adds improvements to the log file, including adding the Windows version to the IFW.LOG file. Other improvements include corrections to the multicast tool, as well as better support for filenames with foreign characters in them. The software is ideal for backing up and restoring your data, as well for reducing manual work required when migrating to a new hard drive or computer.

4,Programmable MQTT Devices - NORVI,computers-technology," The Industrial Internet of Things is a network of sensors and other devices that communicate with industrial systems, all in an effort to enhance the business operations. Manufacturing, agribusiness and oil & gas to name a few, all use a large range of sensors.These sensors transmit essential telemetry data to analytics engines, which search the data for patterns and irregularities, allowing businesses to better understand and optimize their operations. To transfer data from a field sensor to a field controller, to a site network, to a PC data server, and then to the cloud, conventional automation products and protocols usually require a rigorous configuration and hierarchy. These types of implementations can be difficult to develop and maintain. MQTT, which includes multiple functions to satisfy the needs of IIoT, has risen to popularity as a protocol for solving this issue. MQTT is a light and energy-efficient communication protocol with a fast response time.It makes the interaction between devices efficient, regardless of the number of devices involved.It guarantees fast data delivery with low latency all while reducing CPU and RAM load. Imagine a cloud-controlled device to measure the humidity in a farm, remotely. In the case of HTTP protocol, the device would have to continuously make GET requests to see if there’s a change in a variable, say “Humidity Variable“, and then take an action depending on the last reading. This necessitates a huge number of requests, and it isn’t entirely real-time because it is dependent on the polling frequency.MQTT allows the user to listen to the cloud and receive notifications only when a variable changes. The communication between the computer and the cloud is kept open in this manner, but data only moves when it is needed, saving battery life and network bandwidth while enhancing real-time performance. So it is clear that MQTT-capable industrial automation devices are the latest approach for combining commercial and industrial automation with the cloud using IIoT principles in a cost-effective, safe, and reliable manner. Norvi IoT devices are such industrial controllers that support MQTT protocol.These programmable MQTT devices come with a variety of features that make them suitable for industrial automation and IoT solutions. These devices come equipped with digital and analog I/O, enabling them to detect digital logic states and analog inputs, depending on the choice of the model. After selecting a programmable MQTT Iot device like Norvi, only simple legwork has to be done by the users to establish the MQTT connection. Refer this detailed article on connecting the Norvi device to the IoT cloud platform Ubidots over MQTT protocol with step by step instructions.Moreover, setting up the Norvi devices only requires lesser wiring, which offers more flexibility to management of the device."
5,How to Use a Rotary Encoder?,computers-technology," A rotary encoder converts the angular position or motion of a shaft or axle to an analog or digital output signals, so it is also called a shaft encoder. Absolute encoder and incremental encoder are the two main types. Rotary encoders are applied widely, including situations that require monitoring or control, and mechanical systems. So how to use a rotary encoder? The four methods of using a rotary encoder are as follows: The rotary encoder is a precision instrument. It needs to issue instructions through the program during its use. Driver needs to be modified according to the needs of different situations, which determines the encoder's effect. Under normal circumstances, modify the reg file directly, and register a table file, rewrite the dynamic link through adding. In the case where it is determined that the dynamic link has been modified, it needs to be added to the kernel. After the driver is modified, the hardware interface will be connected. In the connection, there are usually two collector output interfaces A and B. In order to ensure line connectivity, you need to operate on a 3.3V resistor. A and B interfaces are plugged into the CPU respectively. After the hardware interface is successfully connected, check whether the high and low voltage values of the voltage output terminal are correct. For example, after pressing the button, if the P2 port output value is high, it is correct. The writing of the stream interface driver is to prepare for the following interrupt service program. The specific writing step is to create a thread to realize the record of the variable value, and at the same time record whether the value of each port is still high in the case of a line interruption. The last step is to interrupt the writing of the service program. The instructions for using rotary encoders are as follows: Determine the detection object that may be speed measurement, distance measurement, angular displacement or counting. It is only used for dynamic process, or it also contains static position or state. -Confirm whether to choose incremental rotary encoder or absolute rotary encoder. Determine the range of motion of the object. Confirm whether to select a single-turn or multi-turn absolute rotary encoder. Determine the maximum speed or frequency of the object. Determine the accuracy required of the object. Determine the application parameters of the rotary encoder. Using environment. Pay attention to the interface mode and protection level of the rotary encoder. *Vibration applied to the rotary encoder will often cause false pulses. Therefore, the installation location is very important. When the number of pulses generated per revolution is larger, and the slot interval of the rotating grooved disc is narrower, the more susceptible it is to vibration. While rotating or stopping at a low speed, the vibration added to the shaft or body of the encoder makes the rotary grooved disc jitter, and false pulses may occur at any time. *Note the polarity of the power supply when wiring the encoder. If the wiring is wrong, the internal circuit of the encoder may be damaged. *Wiring should be done when the power supply is OFF. When the power supply is on, if the output line contacts the power supply, the encoder output circuit may be damaged. *In order to avoid encoder induced noise, try to use the shortest circuit, especially when there is input to an integrated circuit. An incremental encoder converts angular motion or position of a shaft into an analog or digital code to identify position or motion. Incremental encoders are one of the most commonly used rotary encoders. *Incremental rotary encoders with different resolutions which are measured by the number of pulses, ranging from 6 to 5400 or higher generated per resolution. The more pulses, the higher the resolution. It is an important basis for selection. *There are usually three signal outputs of incremental encoders (six signals for differential): A, B and Z, generally using TTL level, A pulse in the front, B pulse in the back. A and B pulses are 90 degrees apart. Each circle sends out a Z pulse, which can be used as a reference mechanical zero position. Generally, judge the direction by determining A is ahead of B or B is ahead of A. *If PLC is used to collect data, a high-speed counting module can be chosen; if the industrial computer is used, choose a high-speed counting board; if a single-chip microcomputer is used, choose input port with photocoupler. *It is recommended that B pulse be forward, A pulse should be reversed, and Z origin zero pulses. *Set up a counting stack in the electronic device. A quadrature encoder measures the speed and direction of a rotating shaft. It is called an incremental rotary encoder. Different types of sensors are used, in which optical and hall effect are both common. In the picture, it shows that there are two IR sensors on the PCB inside a Rover 5 gearbox. The sensors look at the black and white pattern on one of the gears. No matter what type of sensors are used the output is typically two square waveforms 90° out of phase as shown below. You can use either output and simply measure the frequency to monitor the speed of rotation. There are two outputs, so you can determine the direction of a shaft rotation by looking at the pattern of their binary numbers. Depending on the direction of rotation you will get either: 00 = 0, 01 = 1, 11 = 3, 10 = 2 or 00 = 0, 10 = 2, 11 = 3, 01 = 1 By feeding both outputs into an XOR gate (exclusive OR) you will get a square wave with twice the frequency regardless of direction. It allows one interrupt pin to monitor both encoder inputs. Look at how to write efficient code to convert these binary inputs into a simple ""forward or backward"" output. A 2-dimensional array (matrix) that made the code quick and easy. The binary values above convert to 0,1,3,2 or 0,2,3,1 depending on the direction, which repeats continuously. Index one dimension of the array and the previous value to index the other dimension by using the current value from the encoder, then you can quickly get a -1, 0, or +1 output. The array looks like this. So, if the value has not changed, the output will be 0. The sequence of 0, 1, 3, 2 gives an output of -1. The sequence of 0, 2, 3, 1 gives an output of +1. X represents a disallowed state and would most likely occur if the encoder outputs are changing too quickly for your code to keep up. Normally this should not happen. When there is an output of 2, an error occurs, perhaps due to electrical noise or the code being too slow. If you replace X with 0 then the disallowed state will be ignored. If you make this a 1 dimensional array: int QEM [16] = {0,-1,1,2,1,0,2,-1,-1,2,0,1,2,1,-1,0}; // Quadrature Encoder Matrix To read the array the index is: Old * 4 + New So the code reads like this: Old = New; New = digitalRead (inputA) * 2 + digitalRead (inputB); // Convert binary input to decimal value Out = QEM [Old * 4 + New]; Hope the article is helpful to you.

6,Factors to Consider When Selecting Rotary Encoders,computers-technology," In a series of modern machinery industries like construction, building materials, mining, engineering vehicles, metallurgy, water conservancy, port machinery and other fields related to large heavy equipment, the reliability and safety of equipment comes first in process control. For safety requirements, reliable feedback of encoder signals is directly related to control safety and reliability. Unreliable and inappropriate encoder selection will lead to frequent equipment debugging and maintenance. As a result, labour costs of debugging and maintenance may rise hugely, and on-site service engineers will never be enough. So what are the techniques of selecting the right encoder? The specific work environment of various devices determines the selection of different encoders and their transmission methods. A.The work environment is complex. Frequency converter, large motor and high and low voltage power supply system, signal cable and power line are arranged together, making heavy electrical interference for encoders. B.Some devices need to be moved in long-distance and are difficult to ground. C.The distance of signal transmission is long, and the safety and reliability of signal data are required to be precise. D. Real-time and reliable signal transmission are required to ensure secure control response. E. Many of the encoders is used outdoor or in a harsh environment, which requires the industrial class of products. Therefore, the right selection of encoders is very important for the use of heavy machinery and equipment. Encoders can be divided into incremental encoders and absolute encoders based on signal principle. Absolute encoders have been widely used in many fields due to their in place design and excellent process performance, and have won a good market reputation. Incremental encoders convert displacement into a periodic electrical signal, then transform this electrical signal into a counting pulse, and the number of pulses is used to represent the displacement. In diverse fields, there is more extensive use of encoders. Based on different uses and principles, the performance of different encoders excels in the work environment that fits them. 1.Absolute Encoder When an absolute encoder rotates, there are one-to-one codes (binary, BCD codes, etc.) output corresponding to the position. From the change of code size, the position of the positive and negative direction and displacement can be determined without a phase circuit. An absolute encoder has an absolute zero code. After a power failure or shutdown, the code of the power failure or shutdown position can still be accurately read and the zero code in the encoder can be accurately found. When the power is turned on, the measurement is restarted. Here’s a comparison of the differences between these two types of encoders. When purchasing absolute encoders, besides examining the model, the performance serial number and the number of segmentation (or digits) needs to be paid attention to. For the selection of the number (or digits) of the split, here’s a reference formula: Number of divisions = 360°/design resolution The output code system and output mode of the selected absolute encoder should correspond to the user's rear processing circuit. In general, the measuring range of absolute encoders is 0°～360°, but special models can achieve multi-turn measurement. -Selection Notes about Absolute Encoders: When choosing an absolute encoder, you need to consider the corresponding parameters. The first is the mechanical installation size of the equipment, including the shaft hole size, installation hole position, and the corresponding outlet method that the equipment adapts to. Second, the size and space of the equipment should meet the installation requirements of the equipment, as well as the material protection level of the equipment. Besides, it’s important to pay attention to the resolution of the device in order to ensure that the device has high-quality signal processing capabilities. In the working process of the absolute encoder, the corresponding electrical selection is used to help complete the corresponding work. Therefore in the process of selecting an absolute encoder, it is necessary to pay attention to the corresponding electrical interface, which indicates whether it matches the corresponding Voltage output and the output of integrated electrical appliances. As a result, the output mode of the device can help the corresponding control system and circuit to match each other. Generally, choosing equipment dealers is also an important part. First, analyze from various practical aspects, including the market scale and reputation of the dealer, and its price positioning compared with competitors on the market. In a word, when choosing the right dealer, users need to choose the appropriate equipment and services according to their own use, so as to guarantee future use. 2.Incremental Encoder When an incremental encoder rotates, it has a corresponding pulse output. Its rotation direction and the increase and decrease of pulse quantity is read by the phase judging circuit and counter at the back. The counting point can be set arbitrarily, and it can realize unlimited accumulation and measurement of multiple turns. It is also possible to use the Z signal for each pulse transmitted as a reference mechanical zero position. When the number of pulses is fixed, the original pulse can be multiplied by the 90° phase difference A and B signals to improve the resolution. When ordering incremental encoders, please specify the selected model, number of output pulses per revolution, power supply voltage, wire outlet mode, and signal output mode. Besides, users should know whether the mechanical installation size of the selected model can meet your requirements. The number of output pulses per revolution should be selected according to the following formula. Number of output pulses per revolution (P/r) = 360°/design resolution When selecting the signal output mode, please note its match the rear circuit. If the long-line drive output mode is selected, users should select a matching receiver so that the rear circuit can accept the data. -Selection Notes about Incremental Encoders: When purchasing appropriate incremental encoders, users need to consider the technical parameters. So what factors do the technical parameters of encoders include? First of all, the installation limits and methods. Generally speaking, we will divide the installation methods of encoders into two types, base installation and flange installation. There are different characteristics of the two methods. Secondly, the signal processing frequency of the encoder. Whether there are internal chip and relevant technical parameters of the central processing module are also factors worth paying attention to when selecting encoders. First, note the material of the encoder. Generally speaking, encoders are made of new composite materials and metal materials. When an encoder is made, it needs to be tightly closed to ensure that the device is absolutely hermetic. The quality of encoders can also be considered from various components, so as to better meet the use of the equipment. When choosing an incremental encoder, or anything, we need to consider its price. What factors should be taken into account for this part? The main considerations are device performance and the choice of channels. If users want the encoder to have an advantage in performance, they need to consider the market changes of encoders and make a reasonable choice according to their actual situation.

7,Comparison of central air conditioning- Toshiba vs Mitsubishi vs Daikin,computers-technology," Comparison of central air conditioning-Toshiba air conditioning VS Mitsubishi VS Daikin Toshiba Central Air Conditioner VS Mitsubishi Electric VS Daikin Central Air Conditioner Toshiba Central Air Conditioner is an international market. Japan, Europe, America and even the world are his markets. His focus is on the world. Daikin's central air-conditioning market focuses on mainland China and Taiwan, as well as Japan, and European and American countries have a small market share. If you buy a central air conditioner on the market now, it is generally good. The ones with high-cost performance are bought domestically. Gree made in China is regarded as *. Japanese, Toshiba is definitely the boss in the world. In the Chinese market, his main competitor is Daikin. The reason why Daikin sells more is that it entered the home improvement market early in China. Toshiba's main work is tooling when it does home improvement, and home improvement is not a concern. In 2007, the home improvement market began to open. Because home improvement started later than Daikin, its market share was smaller than Daikin. Toshiba, whether it is a home machine or a commercial machine, was imported from Japan when it entered the Chinese market. Of course, Toshiba also has domestic machines, but the external machines can basically guarantee 70-90% of the imported parts. The whole machine is assembled in China, while Daikin is made in China, which is 100% pure. As everyone in the industry knows, Gree is Daikin's production front. Strategic cooperation was signed in 2009, and Gree is Daikin's foundry. 3MAX for Daikin Price*; what swing compressors are used in 4MAX, all of them are obsolete compressors, which are cheap and have poor heating in winter. Daikin LMAX, PLMAX package machine no matter how big the room is in your home, it depends on which package is the same as the room size. A package is a mid-range machine of Daikin. There is also a problem with heating. Daikin is a better machine, VRV series, V3 series used in villas, the price is not cheap, things are purely domestic, winter heating needs to install floor heating. Underfloor heating is comfortable, but underfloor heating is an economic issue. The energy consumption in winter is about 1,000 to 2,000 yuan per month. Daikin's current course is ""quantity"". His aim is to ""improve the emergency response capability after a failure"". Toshiba's home is MINI SMMS' multi-connection and one-to-one series. Mainly promote the multi-connection of MINI SMMS, one external machine can get all the outlets of a house in the house, and the cost performance is high. The imported series is 100% imported from Japan. The SMMS series, which is 100% imported from Japan in villas and projects, is the world's top machine. SMMS, the market is basically unable to find a machine with technology leading her. Toshiba SMMS is used in the subway station of Nanjing Line 2. Japanese air conditioners are not heated with electricity, which saves electricity and is safer than domestic air conditioners, but tests the heating capacity in winter. In winter, the hot air floats in the air, people feel cold. Toshiba has 4 blocks of static pressure. The ultra-thin internal machine is under static pressure. The wind blows far, which can bring down the hot air pressure, and the heating performance is strong. In order to maintain a beautiful appearance, Daikin does not hesitate to reduce the depth of the original internal machine to match the appearance of the decoration. However, the original large motor is changed to the size of a wall-mounted machine. The motor has insufficient power, only two levels of static pressure, and the wind is weak. The problem of rising heat in winter cannot solve the BUG that has always been Daikin. Toshiba adopts the unified installation system of Toshiba, that is, Toshiba has a dedicated team of installation and after-sales organizations in various distribution cities. It is not outsourced. The materials such as copper pipe insulation are all uniformly required by the original factory, and the market is as far as I know. Other brands are outsourced, and the quality of the materials and installation teams is uneven, and there is no guarantee for after-sales. The air conditioner is installed in three-point quality and seven-point quality, and it will save you a lot of attention after installation. Toshiba does not compare prices with other air conditioners. Toshiba's imported home appliances are comparable to Daikin's high-end VRV, which is about three to five thousand and six thousand expensive. Even domestic Toshiba air conditioners are at least one thousand to five thousand more expensive than Daikin, depending on your home. Machine configuration. But you can't just look at the price when buying things, but compare things based on the price. The heart of the air conditioner is the compressor. Daikin's external compressors are made in Suzhou, Toshiba compressors are imported, and the external machine is basically guaranteed to be 70%-90% of the import, and imported Toshiba is 100% imported. You will know the mute effect and repair rate after you install it. I don’t think it’s useful anymore. You know it if you use it yourself. Good things are good, bad things are bad, and we have been in the air-conditioning industry for 8 years. At present, we are selling these two brands. We are very ugly and we know clearly. My purpose is to make your consumers buy it clearly. Now that the house is expensive, it’s not easy to have a house. It’s easy to install a worry-free good thing. You are satisfied and enjoying yourself. At the same time, we sell all the things that are ugly to you and are responsible to the owner. They are responsible for their own operations and future. Development is also a responsibility. Daikin and Toshiba make high-quality air conditioners. From the compressor, these two brands are top-level, and the quality is also top-level: but Toshiba can’t be done by any other brand with its global unified standards. Both raw materials and compressors are used. From this point of view, since choosing this price is better than investing more in Toshiba, the cooling and heating are fast, and the mute can last for more than 7 years. After all, the raw materials are used well, whether Daikin is after-sales Still the materials are incomparable to Toshiba. Mitsubishi Electric, assembled in Shanghai, has a good quality brand. He has original commercial external machines. His compressor is the same as Daikin and belongs to the scroll compressor. The connection technology of Mitsubishi Electric still uses the old-fashioned divergent box connection. On the one hand, the noise is relatively high, on the other hand, the copper tube is used longer, which increases the installation cost. There are also restrictions on Mitsubishi Electric's maximum of only one to five because there are only two types of divergent boxes (one is a five-port divergent box, and the other is a three-port divergent box) In addition, Mitsubishi Electric's market share is not high in the Chinese market, and overall it is a good brand. *Speaking of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Many people are confused about the difference between Mitsubishi Electric and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. You only need to sort out one that is heavy industry-oriented and one that is civil industry-led. The central air conditioner of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries said in the product description that the * page will show them their strengths in shipbuilding, military, printing, bridge building, rocket and aerospace, energy power, etc., but his real energy and financial resources for civilian use are limited, he 90 % Is invested in the heavy industry. Mitsubishi Electric's focus is on civil, air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment, imaging equipment, factory automation, semiconductor technology, and transportation such as elevators, all of which are focused on civilian industries. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries does not have its own compressor. The compressor of the air conditioner is the core component. He directly uses the compressor of Mitsubishi Electric. Imagine a brand that has no R&D department to develop such core components of the compressor. His other Can the components guarantee better performance than other brands? Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' entry into China was also introduced through a joint venture of Haier. The market appeal and brand quality still need to be tested by the market. If it is a commercial machine, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' performance cannot even rival that of Daikin's domestic V3. Although Daikin's domestic machines are all It is purely domestic, but the performance of the commercial V3 is still good, mature, and has a high market share. In general, it is still good. To quote the summary of these two brands by a professional HVAC engineer online, you can go to search. The reasons why Toshiba is better than Daikin are as follows: Toshiba imported air conditioners are 100% imported from Japan. Domestic compressors, inverter boards and important accessories are all imported from Japan. Daikin air conditioner machines can not find any imported accessories. *The core compressor is also used in Suzhou, China produce The noise of the Toshiba ultra-thin duct machine is 24 dB, which is lower than any other high-end air-conditioning brand. Toshiba compressors are better than Daikin in technology. Toshiba uses the first generation DC variable speed dual rotor compressor with an oil discharge capacity of 1/40 of the Daikin scroll compressor, fully protecting the compressor's lubrication system and service life Longer. Toshiba SMMS is a full frequency conversion system, that is, all the compressors in the outdoor unit are frequency conversion compressors, and Daikin VRV is a partial frequency conversion system, that is, the compressor in the outdoor unit module is a frequency conversion + one or more fixed frequencies Compressor, in this mode, the compressor is prone to oil shortage and damage; In addition to the compressor*, the central air conditioner is the inverter, Toshiba uses the independently developed IPDU (vector control inverter), Daikin is outsourced, and there is no inverter manufacturing technology. In our coastal area, is a place with high air salt content. After the Daikin data clearly states in writing: the air conditioner cannot be used on the seaside with high air salt content, that is, it is not anti-corrosive, while Toshiba has it. The key point of N is that both Toshiba and Daikin use DC frequency conversion technology, while Toshiba is a step-less frequency conversion, which is a real frequency conversion and power saving, while Daikin is a stepped frequency conversion. (For example, the step-less frequency conversion is like rolling down a stable slope, and the step-less frequency conversion is equivalent to rolling down a staircase). Toshiba's development policy: To minimize the occurrence of failures Daikin's development policy: Improve the ability to respond to failures In other words, Toshiba has basically no problem, and Daikin can quickly find a solution if there is a problem. In general, quality, Toshiba > Mitsubishi Electric > Daikin, whether it is a central air conditioner or a wall-mounted machine, I believe that in terms of quality, there is no brand that is better than Toshiba. At the same time, Toshiba's central air conditioner is also the most expensive, and of course, cost-effective. Find your quality compressors at okmarts.com"
8,Maintenance of Absolute Encoders,computers-technology," What are the precautions for the maintenance of rotary encoders? Rotary encoders are used as speed and displacement feedback sensors, which are mainly applied in servo motors, asynchronous motors, stepper motors, elevator traction machines, and even mechanical shafts. These automatic control field platforms with speed and displacement information feedback ensure the high-precision and stable operation of the machine, thereby improving production efficiency and ensuring safe operation. Absolute encoder belongs to a rotary encoder. It is determined by mechanical position. An absolute encoder does not need to record or to find a reference point or to keep counting. You just read it to know the position. In this way, the anti-interference characteristics of the encoder and the reliability of the data are greatly improved. To stabilize the daily operation of the absolute encoder, it is necessary not only to know how to use it but also to pay attention to the daily maintenance during the use. Both of these are believed to be of great help in improving the use-value of the absolute encoder. Regular inspection: Regular inspection is carried out on the mechanical part once a month, which is mainly the inspection of the mechanical connection point. The aim is to see if it is misaligned. Do not adjust electronic control equipment at will. The power supply parameter of the electronic control equipment component is 380 volts, which is 160 volts higher than the general voltage of 220 volts. The normal use of the absolute encoder and the safety of personnel can be ensured when the operator does not arbitrarily adjust the equipment, especially the interlocking device. Regular replacement of hydraulic oil: Usually, the hydraulic oil is replaced twice every year. If the hydraulic oil has not deteriorated, it can be replaced once a year. Professionals required to operate electrical equipment: The absolute encoders need to be used with controllers, electronic control systems and other equipment. And this equipment with high power and different operating methods will cause damage to the body and electric shock. So the operation of electrical equipment must be maintained by professionals. Check the mechanical part once a month to know if the mechanical connection and the matching part of the system are loose due to time running. Besides, check whether the connecting screw of the profile bracket is tightened. Check the mechanical connection points to see if they are misaligned; whether the steel wire rope is seriously damaged; whether the main winch is leaking; whether the meters, indicator lights and safety devices are working properly. Frequently check the structural connection bolts, welded parts and structural parts for damage, deformation or looseness. The electrical components require 380V voltage. Untrained personnel must be prohibited to operate or open the control box, otherwise, they will be electrocuted. It is not allowed to arbitrarily adjust the interlocking device of the electronic control equipment. Damage or move the position of each limit stop is prohibited. Do not adjust or replace all of the hydraulic components without permission of the competent authority. When the hydraulic system fails, no one except the maintenance department should be notified immediately to analyze the cause and eliminate it. When the hydraulic system is used for the first time, the hydraulic oil should be replaced every six months. If not, replace it every year. Regularly check the components and accessories of the hydraulic system. The encoder should be kept clean at all times. After each operation, the soil on each glass of the cab should be wiped clean. The leaking processing surface should be coated with butter to prevent rust; each lubrication point should be filled with butter according to the requirements of the lubrication table, and the steel wire rope should be kept lubricated and clean. Encoders are used with controllers, electronic control systems and other equipment. And these devices with high power, different operation methods of them, will not only cause damage to the machine but also cause people a shock. Therefore, encoders are suggested to be maintained by professionals. Enrichment of interface modes The size of the encoder will be reduced, the weight will become lighter, and it will be convenient to install Intelligent operation, not an automatic operation Long service life. Frequent maintenance will not be required In a word, to improve the use-value of the encoder, it is of vital importance to note the daily maintenance during the use. If either operation or maintenance is not ensured, the accuracy of the encoder signal conversion will not be guaranteed. Find your quality Encoders at okmarts.com"
9,Automotive Companies only Access 5% of their Vehicle Data,computers-technology," Although vehicle sensors collect massive amounts of data, only 5% of it is currently being used for product development. Better infrastructure and data processing hold the keys to progress. The promise of fully autonomous vehicles continues to excite and inspire millions of people around the world. The amazing things that safe, reliable, self-driving vehicles can do for humanity--from providing newfound mobility to senior citizens to reducing traffic accidents--are closer to our reach than ever. But we still have a long way to go. Along with the fuel (gasoline, diesel or electricity) that powers automobiles, autonomous vehicles require a fuel of their own to “drive” safely and effectively: data. Although that data, already collected by millions of sensors on thousands of vehicles around the world, is readily available, it’s not being utilized to its full potential. Sensor datasets power the algorithms that make all levels of autonomous driving possible. As automotive companies aggressively pursue data-driven product development, data handling (including the exploration, querying, curation and evaluation of data) is a common bottleneck on the road to progress. These essential but hard-to-manage datasets bring a unique set of challenges for those hoping to make use of them: Unstructured and diverse formats Need for rich semantics in order to access them Huge sizes that require high-performance computing Strong need for data versioning Access and security issues Need for continuous failure-case driven data exploration With the proper data processing and analytics software, engineering users can overcome all of these challenges and vehicle data can fulfill its potential. By upgrading legacy technology for data access and analysis, OEMs and mobility tech companies can bump up data utilisation rates by up to 40% and generate additional ROI as data exploration, search, analysis, anomaly detection, and evaluation require less manual engineering work and yield better results. Data infrastructure and management are being neglected Currently, vehicle technology developers are focused on machine learning models and ground truth labeling. These same developers are neglecting infrastructure upgrades, leading many to use legacy technology for data management. Terabytes of unstructured, unprocessed vehicle data easily overwhelm these systems, causing them to malfunction. Raw data has no metadata and billions of frames, and technology developers are left to use tools ill-suited to the task of data management to organize data on their own. Highly-paid engineers search datasets manually on sluggish database systems, spending up to 75% of their time on raw data handling issues instead of training and validating models.  Furthermore, the lack of insights garnered from these vehicle datasets means machine learning and data science systems are unable to effectively build AI functions that rely on sensor data as an input. Purpose-built data infrastructure is the solution Infrastructure that is designed and built specifically to house raw sensor data and extract insights is the answer. This infrastructure should be as simple and easy to navigate as spreadsheets and SQL databases that bring order and usefulness to data in other industries. For vehicle sensor data, infrastructure that uses a flexible and minimalist data model and a scalable method to produce semantics, along with fast queries and integrated endpoints to use and share data, is most effective. These and other infrastructure elements improve data re-use and result in faster insights. Enabled by semantic automation, data can be ranked according to its importance based on context, content, criticality, and usability. This reduces redundancy and maximizes information density. Low-importance data is archived or deleted, while high-importance data is easily accessible for everyone. Furthermore, data insights can be provided almost immediately with overviews of the content and the redundancy. Users can augment retention recommendations with tailored rule-based constraints, e.g. unprotected left turns should always be kept. Better autonomous vehicles, sooner Advances in automated data infrastructure and processing liberate automotive technology developers from the constraints of legacy technology systems. Automated, semantic data management systems such as SiaSearch make data handling easier than ever, enabling automotive companies to save valuable engineering time, boosting productivity and increasing overall utilization. Put simply, more robust, effective infrastructure for unstructured sensor data will lead to higher ROI on research and development by freeing up engineers to do what they do best: building algorithms that will power the autonomous vehicles of the future. And with those engineers working more efficiently, the dreams of autonomous vehicles improving our lives are that much closer to reality."
10,How to Earn Free Robux in Roblox,computers-technology," Before we go into how you can get free Robux in Roblox to spend on in-game items or services, let's take a closer look at the in-game currency itself. You're here because you're playing Roblox and you found some games you want to play, in-game bonuses, items, VIP servers, and other cool stuff only obtained through the in-game currency, Robux. However, since Roblox is mostly free-to-play, Roblox developers monetize their games or items to convert the Robux they earn from their creations into real-world money. What Are Robux? Much like other free-to-play platforms, Roblox has an in-game currency. The Roblox currency is called Robux. You may have seen Roblox cards in your local stores. These cards make it easy to load your account with Robux and give some limited-time bonus virtual items. These gift cards are great presents for the particular Roblox player in your life, especially if they haven't yet taken advantage of the ways to get free Robux which we'll describe below. As fun as Roblox is without Robux, at some point, you’ll want to pick up some Robux to see some of the premium features the platform has to offer. Unfortunately, not everyone has the real-world currency to purchase Robux. What Are Robux Used For? Players have Roblox avatars; they deck out with clothing, items, and other virtual items the game has to offer. Everything from the avatar shop within Roblox are bought using Robux, including: Game passes Username changes Access to premium games Clothing And much more! Unfortunately, because of the average age group of Roblox players, there is no shortage of Robux scams targeting the easily gullible out of everything from real-life money to login info. It's because people look for non-legal avenues to obtain free Robux that their accounts are compromised, their computers loaded with malware, or their personal information is accessed. It's easy to fall for free Robux scams, especially for those who don't have enough real-life disposable income to spend on Robux. They feel as if they're missing out on game passes and aesthetic items you can get for your Roblox avatar. Roblox has a means for reporting abuse if you believe someone is running a Roblox scam, such as giving the information for your account to another person to do deals for you. How to Get Free Robux: 3 Real and Legal Ways Roblox states that the only official avenue for trading items should be their official trading system. However, you don't need to fall for scams to get free Robux. There are some legal means for obtaining free Robux to spend on Roblox items and game passes. Let's take a look at three free ways to get Robux. This is one of the completely free ways to earn Robux in Roblox. However, you will have to take time to create an engaging game that other players will want to spend their Robux on. If you create an engaging game, you’ll encourage premium users to play your game. You can even take advantage of the premium purchase model to encourage non-premium players to play your game and spend Robux. You can also monetize your Roblox game in other ways to earn free Robux by offering in-game currency specific to your game, skins, or start packs. There's no shortage of monetization techniques you can try when you build a game. You can use the Robux you earn for free on other games or to purchase your own items, or you can convert the Robux to real-life money with Roblox's Developer Exchange Program. Much like any affiliate program, Roblox gives you incentive to get new players onto their platform. For every new person you help bring to Roblox, you get a percentage in Robux for every purchase they make. If you’ve developed a game on Roblox, you get Robux every time a player signs up for Roblox on your game’s landing page. The most efficient way to earn free Robux is to develop your own game. If you build your own game, you can take advantage of monetizing your game and bringing in new players with the Roblox Affiliate Program. The Robux stipend is only mentioned because, technically, you're still receiving free Robux. However, you have to pay a monthly membership for it. Roblox has three tiers of premium monthly memberships. The first tier is $4.99 a month and gives a monthly stipend of free 450 Robux. The second tier is $9.99 a month and gives a stipend of free 1,000 Robux. Finally, the third tier is $19.99 a month and gives a stipend of free 2,200 Robux. The bonuses for being a member more than make up for the monthly membership price, so we consider the monthly Robux stipend a way of getting free Robux. You’re also getting 10% extra Robux at the store, earn additional Robux when reselling in-game items, having access to premium-only levels, and other membership perks. Remember, there are legal ways to get free Robux in Roblox, but be careful with anyone trying to scam you by promising illegal means for getting free Robux."
11,Tips for Building a Healthcare Application Design Here's what you need to knoew,computers-technology," In a post-COVID world, healthcare providers that used to be the only option for patients are going to be heavily reliant on their website, specifically, the user’s experience. Although website design should be straightforward, healthcare companies find it challenging. Healthcare website design strategies and implementations fall completely short of what users expect to see when looking at the websites. With current medical website design guidelines and usability best practices, medical sites can enter a niche, enhance the patient experience, and convert better. Such efforts can keep your site competitive and rank well, as shown below. 12 Tips for Building a Healthcare Website Healthcare Website Design Compliant with HIPAA The first thing your website needs is HIPPA compliance. It is important to ensure the safety of all patients, new and old, before you can concentrate on what elements of the healthcare website design get them through the door. Make sure that your web designer specializes in healthcare in order to ensure HIPAA compliance. Choosing the Right Photos and Images Picking the perfect pictures and images for your healthcare website is an art. At Healthcare Success, we employ both web designers and art directors to select imagery that patients can relate to. An onsite photoshoot is often required to make the most impact at the client’s office. Beauty Isn’t Everything Your website looks perfect, but that does not mean it is ready to go live. It’s too often the case that a good-looking website is missing some of the key marketing elements that convince patients to call your office. In the blog below, you’ll learn more about why the best-looking healthcare websites often fail. One great design trick Most of your potential patients are searching for healthcare options on their smartphones in 2018. The rise of smartphones changed web design to accommodate how people use them. The “long-scroll” trick is among the best adaptations we have seen. Your marketing copy can cost you, patients A captivating headline can entice potential patients to spend more time on your website. However, a weak headline could also cost you, patients. In addition, poor copywriting or a misleading copy can get you into legal trouble, which you want to avoid at all costs. Include reviews from doctors Patients can leave reviews of doctors in multiple off-site locations. You have little or no control over the types of reviews displayed on these sites, but you can have a system for qualified reviews on your own website. Automated systems are available (through agencies like Healthcare Success) to manage your online reviews without too much effort on your staff’s part. Keep On-Page SEO in Mind A good website design incorporates elements that will help your healthcare website rank higher in search engines. SEO is a mix of art and science, and there’s more to it than you might realize. It’s more than just selecting the right keywords. Patient-Centric Websites When designing your healthcare website, patient behavior and expectations should always come first. Sometimes, doctors write or design websites with their own preferences in mind. However, always remember that you are not the patient. Don’t Skip the “Small” Stuff The details matter when it comes to delivering patients from your healthcare website design. Don’t neglect the “small” stuff. Even a seemingly insignificant element as a phone number on a single page, a missing form, or a poorly worded page can send patients to your competitors. If any of these are missing from your website, it may be time to reevaluate your design. Provide a few visuals Videos and photos consistently perform better than text when it comes to views and shares. As a result, a site with visual content will perform better than one without it. A lot of images or videos make your content harder to read, so be careful not to overdo it. Videos add life to a home page, and an introductory video letter earns more interest than a text letter. However, there is such a thing as too much. If you’re going to use videos, keep the file sizes small enough that it doesn’t slow down the loading of the page. Also, avoid designs that enable Flash—a non-animated site is far superior to one that fails to load properly on old devices without this technology. Make it Interactive When you design a website, you have certain goals in mind, whether it’s to increase inquiries or encourage patients to schedule an appointment. If site visitors have to call you or visit your office, they will take some time, and some of them will forget about it once they leave your site. An interactive website will increase your patient engagement and conversion goals. Create interactive forms so patients can fill out critical information such as medical conditions or insurance. Include buttons patients can use to request appointments, get referrals or get prescriptions refilled. It could indicate a problem if something doesn’t look right or work right on your website. It is the same thing for your patients. If you want your website to be attractive and to increase loyalty among existing patients, it has to perform well. Here are some tips for medical website designs that will let visitors have a good impression of your practice. Design responsively Patients access your site from various devices, browsers, and screen sizes. One design won’t look the same from one screen to another, so your site must be designed to accommodate multiple screens. You can customize your site for specific devices or use responsive web design to ensure it loads properly every single time. Choose a design platform that supports responsive design. This platform knows how to customize your page to fit on multiple screens and load on a variety of browsers. You’ll need to regularly test your site to make sure it works on every device. If you don’t have the staff or time to do this testing, consider hiring an agency to handle it for you. https://triassicsolutions.com/blog/building-a-healthcare-application-heres-what-you-need-to-know/ What can you do to help? Choose a consultant who can offer automatic mobile responsiveness. A simple design generally leads to quicker loading times and more satisfied consumers. Triassic can help businesses design a layout that’s intuitive for both mobile and web users."
12,It’s Time to Fast-Track Your Managed IT Services Like The Pros in 2021,computers-technology," If you are a small or developing business that requires IT services, you might not have the resources or budget to hire a completely staffed IT field in-house. You can still get the technical assistance and added benefit with a supplemental company who offers various managed IT services. By outsourcing all tech needs to a company who are pros in the field, businesses can then focus their efforts and spend valuable time on propelling the business forward, rather than managing services they don’t know much about. These six services are highly sought after features that most small businesses overlook to accommodate within the IT field. The internal management of all aspects of information technology can be quite annoying. Businesses often spend a large part of their budget maintaining internal systems through their own personal information technology team and end up disappointed. Although this may seem like a strange statement, it is genuine. Suppose you've been interested in IT services before. In that case, you understand that IT is a fast-moving service where you may instantly become a little lost if you don't put up with the most advanced technologies. By hiring a company who specializes in IT, you can rest assured that they’re capable of handling any updates and new changes that may arise. Before dealing with the breach, it is beneficial to recognize the main categories of privileged threats to ensure your company's information and cybersecurity: • We are human beings, and human guilt is an essential aspect in violations, and we believe, but unknown people inside are primarily responsible. From wrong emails to broken devices to private data sent to insecure home systems, errors can be very costly and can turn into a blunder at any time. The happiest of these are well-meaning IT administrators, whose full access to the company's setup can turn a small mistake into a disaster. • A small number of people reveal passwords. With these believing but intentional insiders, the opinion matters. Malicious personnel whose purpose is to steal or harm is a real threat. Some eliminate viable data, some commercial information or information, and only a crusade against the association. Thus, the cybersecurity of your company is facing a question. Fortunately, artificial intelligence (AI) analysis and augmentation recognize potential threats as more comfortable and less invasive. However, even with technological advances, managers need to be aware of what to look for and how to focus their security efforts to achieve maximum protection performance: • Focus on the exact goods. Bad guys crave the ones you value the most, who are often called the ""crown jewels"" of your business. Recognize the most expensive systems and information, then give them the strictest defenses and the most regular monitoring. • So when you read the following salacious headline about an external hacker breach, remember that these attacks work for less than half of the data breaches out there. And keep in mind that the hacker probably used an unsuspecting worker's identity to get it out. Take a step to ensure that your company is not next in these information and cybersecurity breaches. The current economic situation makes it imperative for individuals to start their own businesses, as recent years have made it clear that conventional ""big business"" can no longer withstand prolonged financial burdens. However, one of the biggest challenges for today's entrepreneurs is IT Solutions. Where does a small, startup business turn to for IT help? It’s best to find a business that can determine your needs and offer IT solutions where you’re lacking. As a small business, you can't afford all the hidden costs that tend to arise at the most inopportune times. With a customized plan, only pay for IT services your business needs. You can be sure that you know that you will not receive surprises. Now, if you're like me, you'll read this with a little skepticism. However, if you're a small business owner, you owe it to yourself to visit the site and see for yourself whether or not it will be right for you. All you have to do is get a customized plan, and you will know that it is the IT solution you have been looking for. Telecommunications software is a type of software package that facilitates electronic communications, especially those that may require audio transmission. Telecommunication solutions can be of different types, ranging from simple software used by an end-user to something more elaborate to manage entire networks' operation. Telecommunications software developers create a range of other solutions that can include wireless applications and mobile solutions. This industry is one of the fastest moving. Moreover, the technology used in telecommunications is continually changing. New models or upgrades of mobile phones and other telecommunications devices appear on the market every two weeks or months. Technologies that allow these gadgets to converse with each other, such as the ability to browse the Internet on your TV and mobile phone, are being developed daily. Working in the giant telecommunications industry is not an easy task. As technologies mature and more households have access to high-speed Internet access, consumers will realize that it is simply more efficient and cost-effective to send voice packets over the Internet than through a landline switched by a point-to-point circuit. Long-distance tariffs are a thing of the past, and international calls are a minute, if not free, in some countries. VoIP's field is growing very fast because it offers features and services that are not usually found in traditional telephone services. Also, it provides all the standard features and benefits of legal telephony services. With everyone offering VOIP these days, how do you know which VOIP provider is best? You need to check and verify a few things before making this determination because VOIP service assumes that you already have a stable and reliable high-speed Internet and cannot provide a reliable VOIP service. Nowadays, with employees working remotely, the need for a phone system hosted by the Cloud is necessary now more than ever. Typically features such as conferencing and call routing simply have to function just as if they were working in the office. The success of your business depends on your IT infrastructure. IT is usually the source of aggressive benefit for small and medium-sized companies. Outdated IT support or IT performance affects the productivity of any company. For most companies, IT investments may become more of a trouble than a profit. Operating a full-time IT field can be a daunting task. Time, money, lack of qualified staff, etc., are some of the challenges faced by most small and medium-sized enterprises. As a result, many companies have hired companies to perform managed IT services as a viable solution to their technology needs. Outsourcing IT services to managed service providers can be very beneficial for the business in terms of network resilience, cost, and productivity. Your network telecom provider can help you find the right IT solution that best meets your needs."
13,Is Society Becoming More Polarized Because of Social Media?,computers-technology," Is Society Becoming More Polarized Because of Social Media? Liam Barrett English II Mr. Dickson 28 March 2021 Research Proposal This paper discusses how social media is causing society to be more polarized in politics. It can be argued that social media does not have any impact on the standpoint of political and social beliefs, but there are numerous examples of how it has impacted society and history. The effects are not well known to many citizens on what exactly social media is doing to society. Young people are easily influenced by social media’s manipulative tactics. It is crucial to address the effects of social media because it may ultimately change the future. A fundamental problem in social media is that many people only see one side of a story, which influences their political views. If many people become increasingly divided in their beliefs and opinions from each other, it can cause violence and prevent the advancement and growth of society. This research project will pull from many databases and sources of information to best examine how social media is impacting the polarization of the public. The research shows that social media is causing society to be more politically and socially diverse. Abstract Society is becoming more polarized because of social media’s numerous platforms and manipulative business models, which have political and social impacts. It is established that social media can be manipulative and have very real effects on individuals. Research has shown that there are and will be more problems in society due to social media, which includes more violence between political groups and people with different backgrounds and lifestyles. Polarization is the increasing division between two attitudes or beliefs to ideological extremes, and it causes many changes to occur in society throughout everyday life. The research was gathered from online articles, databases, documentaries, and books that prove social media is causing polarization in society. With all of the numerous platforms, there is a great amount of false and biased information to possibly be spread. These platforms are manipulative and cause polarization which has many political and social impacts on society. In conclusion, social media has many ways of being polarizing to society. It is proven that social media does have a serious impact on many people’s lives in society. Liam Barrett Mr. Dickson English II 28 March 2021 Is Society Becoming More Polarized Because of Social Media? Democrat or Republican. White or Black. Us or Them. Polarization is the increasing division between two attitudes or beliefs to ideological extremes that causes many changes to occur in society throughout everyday life. When social media was first created, many citizens did not realize the possible and countless real effects of polarization in society. Society is becoming more polarized because of social media’s numerous platforms and manipulative business models, which have political and social impacts. The numerous social media platforms available provide more polarized opinions than ever before and target age groups differently. Back in the 1960s, there were only three channels that were broadcasted on television: NBC, CBS, and ABC (Ganzel 2007). These television channels had minimal biases. Now, there’s Tiktok, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, along with hundreds of cable networks and radio stations that have all different kinds of information. The many platforms cause people to be more polarized because more information can be false, manipulated, or biased. Author Hong expresses that “Daily, citizens share information published via government Twitter accounts, and the content may be fragmented or customized. Furthermore, the trend for information to be shared in this way may not be easily reversed” (Hong 2016). These platforms also target age groups differently. Facebook is generally used by older citizens, TikTok is commonly used by teenagers and younger kids, Instagram and Twitter are social media apps that are commonly used by many different ages of people (but still mainly appeal to the youth). Author Hong explains that “Twitter has emerged as a key platform on which anyone with a smartphone can engage in political discourse” (Hong 2016). Similar age groups engage in political debates over social media, which separates the spread of ideas between generations. This spread of false information causes differences in viewpoints between those who are constantly fed information from one biased source and those who are fed information from a different biased source. Twitter can post something about politics and have it be spread instantly to citizens all across the world with information many people will remember. Overall, the many social media platforms available are contributing to the polarization of the public. The business models of these platforms are polarizing their users because they focus on selling ads, reinforcing viewpoints by showing people what they want to see, and fostering addiction. Platforms sell advertisements to companies for a profit. Instagram’s website appeals to businesses by telling companies that “each ad is tailored to the actions users took on [the business’s] site” and that they can “promote specific products a user viewed or are likely to buy” and “up-sell existing clients with related offerings” (AdRoll 2021). Social media apps track what a viewer does on an app and then sends ads that are believed to be related to what the viewer likes. A simple advertisement shows people what they want to see (they are exposed to only what they are already interested in). Similarly, social media can make a person have a certain belief about something that they can reinforce by never exposing them to the other side or by portraying the opposite side in an excessively negative, harsh light. Reinforcement of viewpoints is another highly common business model of social media apps. Algorithms are the way in which a viewpoint is reinforced to a citizen through an app and there are many different ones. Certain algorithms send and suggest information to a viewer that is related to what was looked at previously and is information that the viewer wants to see. On TikTok, there is something called a “for you page,” which has endless videos that are related to videos the viewer has previously watched. James Cooper talks about how “TikTok focuses on the performance of each individual video rather than [taking] into account your whole profile.  The platform looks at the amount of rewatches, shares, comments and likes each video gains” (Cooper 2021). Viewpoints on social media that people disagree with are rarely shown to opposing sides, leading to social media “bubbles.” “Polarization in the U.S. could be driven by exposure to views people disagree with, rather than being separated from them by filter bubbles'' (Lee De-Wit, Sander Van Der Linden, Cameron Brick 2019). This leads to an increase in polarization. Another documentary says, “We’ve created a world in which online connection has become primary. Especially for younger generations. And yet, in that world, anytime two people connect, the only way it’s financed is through a sneaky third person who’s paying to manipulate those two people. So we’ve created an entire global generation of people who were raised within a context with the very meaning of communication, the very meaning of culture, is manipulation.” (Lainer 2020). Social media apps are designed to be addictive and manipulative, which is caused by algorithms designed to keep people happy in their comfort zones, contributing to polarization. The business model of these apps also fosters addiction. One reason people get addicted to social media is that it creates a sense of well-being. If someone posts something and gets many likes and followers, it can cause a feeling of euphoria, which would not have occurred without the use of social media. “When we replace the human-level communities we thrive in—such as religion, civic responsibility, education, and volunteerism—with communities online that give us a false sense of power, we are heading down the path of failure” (Zito 2019). Social media provides a false sense of power and righteousness because people are manipulated into developing extreme opinions through the problematic business models of social media platforms and are rewarded by the addictive nature of these apps to keep their opinions. The effects of polarization range from political riots to social beliefs that focus on an “Us vs. Them” attitude. One of the biggest effects of polarization is seen in politics. The article “Are Social Media Driving Political Polarization?” says “Since 1994, the number of Americans who see the opposing political party as a threat to ‘the nation’s well-being’ has doubled.” (Lee De-Wit, Sander Van Der Linden, Cameron Brick 2019). More citizens are either Democrats or Republicans instead of moderates, which is caused by social media feeding negative beliefs toward the opposing political group. There is even evidence that shows that the most recent election has affected people’s viewpoints because of social media. Violence at the capitol building is the result of social media encouraging political violence by spreading rumors about rigged election counts and secret terrorist organizations. There are also numerous amounts of social polarization in our society. Social media has created tension about the subject of racism in society today. “Cancel culture” pits the public against a single individual and allows people to be easily criticized. When this happens, some people apologize for their actions and join the canceling majority, but others, rather than admitting to making a mistake, only strengthen their previous beliefs to justify their actions. Many people believe that African Americans are still not completely equal to white Americans, and this has caused lots of anger in society. ""Big Walter used to say, he'd get right wet in the eyes sometimes, lean his head back with the water standing in his eyes and say, 'Seem like God didn't see fit to give the black man nothing but dreams - but he did give us children to make them dreams seem worth while” (Hansberry 29). Many African American citizens in society today are still being degraded and people on social media are arguing about it, which has caused lots of violence and riots from those who support this idea and those who do not. “I used to support BLM, but now I see them as violent domestic terrorists not interested in addressing the real problems within the Black community. BLM is about a communist revolution not about helping the Black community…” (Perrin 2020). This is an example of a person who had his beliefs manipulated by social media. His opinion on Black Lives Matter changed because of misinformation that has been spread about the purpose of the movement. It proves that social media has caused many citizens to argue issues about racism and think negatively toward someone who has a different view on something. Along with these topics, there is an increase in polarization on the topic of sexism and sexual preference. All of these are just examples of how the public is becoming more polarized. Social media is contributing to the polarization of the public. There are many effects, such as an increase in people who have extreme views, which can lead to violence between opposing groups. People on social media and social media platforms have greatly contributed to an increase in polarization in society. Many citizens do not realize how social media’s manipulative business models are making people more separated from each other. There have been many effects and more will continue to happen if social media keeps reinforcing polarization in society.

15,I`ve found this on Usenet…,computers-technology," We all know that these days a lot of people download files using torrents or other file sharing services. But do you know that there is an alternative network for downloading files, especially rare ones. Your might've heard your friends or colleagues saying: “I've found this on Usenet” and thought, what is this “Usenet”? Let's figure it out! Usenet is a network that had been created long before the Internet itself (and now become a part of it), and was used to communicate and publish files. Usenet also featured newsgroups where users could post messages which was very convenient at that time! As the Internet matured, text communication on Usenet had died away and the network was used primarily for storing and transferring files. All web sites that provide access to Usenet mirror the files that are stored in Usenet. However, each of the web-sites has its own different policies, and the administration chooses which newsgroups will be available on their web-site. On some sites, you can find quite rare files that you won`t be able to find on modern file hosting services Usually, files have their retention time. Since 2008, the largest providers stopped deleting files, so you can easily download files that were uploaded eight years ago, while smaller providers usually set a retention time of 1000+ days. Of course, copyright holders are monitoring the network, and respectable Usenet providers do their best to avoid copyright infringement and remove any kind of illegal content. Some web-sites created an automated file deletion system so that copyright holders can delete copyrighted material themselves. That`s Usenet in a nutshell for you. And now you may ask: “How can I use this network? Where to begin?”. It’s simple: first, you need to choose a website that will give you access to Usenet. But how to choose the one you can trust from such a huge selection of web-sites, and not being afraid that you will waste your money and time? Follow these simple steps for it: Search for a list of sites that provide access to Usenet. Read the Privacy Policy, DMCA Policy, Terms of Use BEFORE registering and/or paying for access. There should be clear points that should answer your questions. There should be Support contacts. Reach out to web-site`s Support team and ask about the website. During your research, you`ll, certainly, find many outdated websites with an inconvenient interface and functionality. However, there are also new advanced and up-to-date sites with a user-friendly interface, which will help you learn your way around. You are looking for a file and find only its. .nzb-file - don't worry! Go to site, place the file into an upload field and access the file you`re looking for on any device - a phone, tablet or PC or Mac! All you need is an account on nzbreader.com, your .nzb file - and that’s it! This is a great way to experience Usenet and find what you've been looking for, or are looking for right now!"
16,Why You Should Continue With SEO After You've Reached Your Ranking Targets,computers-technology," If you've hired an SEO company to get you ranking high in the Google search results, and they do get you ranking high, then it's job done, right? Wrong! SEO should be considered a continual process, which is actively maintained day after day, week after week, month after month. If you stop working to keep your website at the top of Google, then sooner or later, as sure as night follows day, your rankings will fall, and you'll be back to square one! Why is this? There are many reasons why, and I'll now explain just a few of them. Ranking Factors Change Over Time SEO is NOT a static discipline. What works today may not work tomorrow, while what worked yesterday may actively harm your rankings when enacted today. This is because Google periodically moves the goalposts as to what makes good SEO practice. Time and time again they have made changes which turn good SEO techniques into rank-killing liabilities almost overnight. It is therefore extremely important that either you, or your chosen SEO provider, stay up to date with every revision Google makes to their ranking algorithm, otherwise you'll be left totally exposed to Google's whims, and risk having your rankings crash every time they make an update. This is NOT an idle threat, as the tens of thousands of businesses who have seen their online sales crash because of Google's Panda, Penguin, Hummingbird, and Fred updates will testify. A good SEO provider will be staying up to date with all major adjustments in Google's algorithms, and will react quickly and decisively when they are introduced, to prevent their clients experiencing a drop in rankings and the consequent decline in leads generated and sales made. Your Website May Not Deserve To Rank Highly In Future In today's SEO landscape, content is king. This means that the days of simply spamming low-quality backlinks to bad content to make it rank top of Google are gone. Google has wised up to the kind of shady (but sometimes effective) tactics which less reputable SEO firms would use to get websites which probably did not deserve to be there, up to the top of Google. Nowadays, if you want your website to rank top of Google, it's always worth asking yourself, does it really deserve to be there? Does the webpage you're trying to rank have better, more useful, and more informative content than the webpages which currently rank highly for those target keywords? If it doesn't, then improving the page until it delivers what users are searching in Google for, better than its competitors, should be the first priority. Once that's done, and once your website is ranking at the top of Google just like it deserves to be, everything is done, right? Well no, actually. The problem is, if a keyword is worth targeting for you, it is worth targeting for someone else, and if they too make it their mission to create outstanding content, which is even better than yours, then you are wide open to having your lucrative rankings taken by your competitors, who will then reap the benefits of placing where your website used to. A good SEO provider will be able to keep tabs on what your competitors are up to, and which pieces of content are rising to threaten your own, so that they can then improve and enhance your own website content to ensure it remains stronger than your competitors’, and is therefore more likely to maintain its rankings. On a similar note, your competition may also be investing their time and energies into improving their off-site SEO ranking factors, such as the number of backlinks and social shares their content is receiving. Again, a good SEO will be able to recognise when and how their client's competitors are gaining traction online, and will respond accordingly to protect their client's rankings. They may even be able to identify which strategies the competitors are using to acquire backlinks and social shares, so they can then replicate them for their clients' benefit. Your Website's Topical Authority Will Suffer An important ranking factor in today's SEO landscape is the topical authority of your website. Topical authority is an especially important part of SEO because it is likely to become a more and more influential ranking signal in the future, meaning that it's best to gain a solid understanding of what topical authority is, and how to utilise it on your website, as soon as possible. For a (very) brief introduction to topical authority, consider that, in future, it is likely that websites which have built up a great deal of trust and authority with Google on a particular topic, will rank significantly higher than other websites which have not, when most other factors are equal. This is already happening to some extent today, but it is likely to be far more widespread and impactful over time. An excellent way to build up topical authority is to maintain a company blog which is regularly updated with high-quality content on some of the main issues, questions, and debates in your chosen field. Similarly, topical authority can be accumulated by ensuring that your website contains all the important information about your business, your history, and your specific methods of working, and that everything is easily accessible to the people who visit your website. A bonus of building up your website's topical authority in this way, is that by showing off your knowledge of your industry all over your website, you are more likely to win the trust of your target audience, show them that you really know what you're talking about, and give them peace of mind that you are a reputable company with genuine expertise in your field. All these factors will help to convert more of your website's visitors into leads and sales, so putting in the effort to build up topical authority is well worth your while for these reasons alone. Currently, SEO providers are less likely to have a thorough understanding of topical authority than they are other aspects of SEO, such as targeting keywords, building backlinks, and accumulating social shares, as it is a relatively new and still developing aspect of modern SEO practice, but SEO providers who are true students of their craft will be well aware of the importance of topical authority, and will know how to ensure that your website is acquiring it, so that as the importance of topical authority grows over time, your site will be in a prime position to maintain and improve its rankings, thereby helping to bring you higher revenues and bigger profits. If you know the value of topical authority, and appreciate how important it'll be going forward, then you’ll understand why it's vital you have an SEO expert on hand who has good knowledge of this ranking factor. You'll Find It Harder To Rank New Pages In Future Imagine that an SEO campaign has worked well for you. You may be ranking right where you want to be for a whole range of lucrative keywords, and reaping the benefits as a result. 'Job done!' you think, and sack your SEO provider. Then, you create a new product or service which you also want to get ranking high on Google. No problem, you'll just hire an SEO company again and get them to do it for you. But here's the thing... In all that time you were doing without an SEO company, you did not have a specialist provider building you new backlinks, improving your on-site SEO, getting you social shares, and establishing your topical authority. Effectively, you've been losing ground to your competitors, day after day... Even if your existing rankings have not fallen yet (although they likely will have done), when it comes to achieving high Google rankings for any new pages on your website that you decide to build, you'll have fallen right down the queue. Your competitors who have not abandoned their SEO efforts will have stolen a march on you, and it will take a lot of time, money, effort, and stress to regain the lost ground and usurp your rivals so you’re ranking where you want to be. On the other hand, if you had simply retained your SEO provider during the times when you felt you did not necessarily need them, then you would be in an excellent position to quickly, easily, and cheaply rise up the rankings for these new keywords that you're targeting on your website - thereby putting yourself in a great position to hoover up all the new leads and customers which your competitors would otherwise be getting. Conclusion So, if your website is currently ranking just where you want it to be because of a successful SEO campaign, think twice before firing your SEO provider, as it could prove to be a very expensive mistake!"
17,Animation Software: The Evolutions And The Options,computers-technology," In recent years, all animations from film to games have started life on someone's computer. Over the last four decades, animation has moved from cartoon, to CGI, and beyond - creating some of the most memorable characters and gaming moments in history. Over time, as animation techniques became more advanced, audiences wanted to see animated content which was bigger and better than anything which came before. This made it necessary for animators to develop new software which could overcome barriers that in the past would have been insurmountable. Smashing Through Hurdles In 2000, Peter Jackson, director of the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, needed software that would allow armies of thousands to fight realistically. In response to this, Stephen Regelous created MASSIVE (Multiple Agent Simulation System In Virtual Environment), which gave Lord of The Rings their award winning visual effects - particularly in the battle scenes. This revolutionary software gives the visual effects artist the ability to create millions of CGI agents that all act independently of each other. These agents can change their behaviour in response to their surroundings, which eliminates the need for content creators to animate or program each agent by hand. The MASSIVE software has since been used in film, television, and gaming, with credits including Game of Thrones, Planet of the Apes, and Infinity War. Jump forward two years to 2002, when Pixar were faced with the problem of how to animate realistic hair and clothes. As a solution, when working on Monsters, Inc. they introduced the state-of-the-art animation software, Fizt (pronounced Fizz-Tee). One of their main characters was a big, blue, hairy monster named Sulley, and using the newly created Fizt, they managed to successfully simulate each of the millions of hairs that cover him - creating realistic motions and behaviours. It took 11 to 12 hours to render a single frame with Sulley in shot, but the time taken by the overall animation process was reduced. From Studio To Study Developers have risen to the challenge, creating software to combat the challenges that animators have come up against, and seeing their work showcased in film, television, and video games as a result. And the best news is that due to all this new software, you no longer need to be part of a huge company to develop your own animations. By using one of the many CGI programs available, you can create animations from the comfort of your own home. 3D modelling programs are just a click away, many of which you don’t even need to pay for, and there are extensive instructional guides and videos online which take you through the animation process step by step – thereby allowing you to try your hand with minimal fuss. Here are just a few of the options available to you: Blender Blender is a free 3D graphics software that allows you to animate films, art, visual effects, motion graphics, video editing and rigging, to name just a few. It is preferred by many users over similar software which can cost thousands of pounds. Blender is best for professional animators, or beginners who want to be part of an animation community. Blender is community-based and allows community driven/designed updates. Some of the companies who use Blender include Roblox, Activision, and the Unity 3D development platform. Animaker Animaker allows you to make live-action and animated videos. It is designed to be easy for both novice and experienced animators to use, and provides specialist tools for people to create video infographics, 3D animations, and animated shorts. Autodesk Maya Although not free for everyone, students, educators, and educational institutions can benefit from this software, which has become an industry giant. Credits include: the Harry Potter series, War Horse, Uncharted 4 - A Thief's End, and Call of Duty - Black Ops 3. This software is a fantastic option for animation students preparing for a career in animation. Clara.io Clara.io is a browser-based 3D modelling tool for those who don’t want to download their animation software. You can create your own animations, as well as access a library of models to use in your creations. Clara.io also supports 3D rendering. Daz Studio Daz Studio was created for artists to design ready-to-use models and 3D content. Its aim was to provide human and non-human figures, clothing, and props for the models. Daz Studio can be used for videos and to create still images, while the character modelling and motion capture capabilities make this a favourite with those who want to create characters, but who may not have the skills to do it from scratch. OpenToonz As the chosen software of Studio Ghibli, OpenToonz is a popular choice for those interested in 2D animation. The OpenToonz software is best for people who are focused on 2D animation, or who want to expand their skillset. So, What Are You Waiting For? All of the software tools outlined in this article can be found for free, and are commonly used by industry professionals. However, you may still wish to seek out alternatives that charge a fee. If this is the case, try searching for animation software on the TrustRadius website. This is a great resource where users can leave reviews and feedback about software programs, and it should give you a good idea about what the available options are. Whatever your requirements, the right software for you is out there!"
18,What Are the Major Causes of Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) Damage?,computers-technology," Variable frequency drive belongs to electronic products, which were composed of many components. An electronic product will not correctly work if any component goes wrong. The Common failures of frequency converters are overvoltage, overload, overcurrent and overheating. They are generally caused by improper use and the operating environment. Meanwhile, there’s a particular service life for electronic products. The aging of the product will be more evident as the use of time increases. According to The Tax Duty Calculation Regulation for Fixed Asset Depreciation, the lowest standard for electronic equipment service life is three years. Many people buy a mobile phone and change to a new one after two or three years of use, even it's still working fine. Compared with the greater frequency of changing cellphones, people replace home appliances such as TV, computer, refrigerators, and air conditioner far less. Under proper use and good maintenance, the service life of these appliances can reach 15 years in theory, even though most people won’t use them for that long. Let’s get back to VFD, an industrial electronic part, its durability and service time is much longer for sure. It is common for some factories to use VFDs for more than ten years. Some VFDs of Japanese and German brands can be used for more than 20 years. Of course, during its service time, the busbar capacitor will be replaced. But as long as staff take good care of the workshop environment and maintenance, the overall service life of VFD will be much longer than that of household appliances. Since the service life of VFD is so long as 10 - 20 years under normal conditions, what factors lead to some failures and shortened service life of VFD? Here are 3 major factors that any VFD user and maintainer should know.  For all kinds of reasons, many people are unable to live in a perfectly healthy and ideal environment, and it's the same with appliances. Many VFDs may not meet the specifications of ideal conditions, but with an understanding of the adverse environment and proper maintenance, users can still maximize the service life of VFDs. Common adverse conditions are as below. There are corrosive gas and electrostatic dust in some chemical and plastic plants, and the VFD is under no protection. The plant may not buy professional maintenance application for VFD either. It is directly installed in the workshop, without obvious separation, and often fails within a year and a half. Dust and corrosion will directly damage the circuit board and welding joints, and static electricity or poor insulation will make electronic components break down and damage. Some equipment vibrates greatly, such as punch press. If the VFD and its facility are installed carelessly, they will vibrate together. After a long time, the circuit connector of VFD will be loose, and so is the solder of the circuit board, causing problems such as false soldering and damage. Therefore, install VFD as far away as possible from any vibrating equipment. Some places are relatively humid, such as some water supply and drainage workshops, or some humidifying places, or an open-air use environment. Humidity and high temperature may lead to inverter insulation break down. Therefore, if you want to avoid the damage of the inverter and extend its service life, if possible, you should install the inverter in a separate electric cabinet workshop, matched with an air conditioner and exhaust fan, so as to reduce the damage probability. A variable frequency drive needs to consider good grounding and appropriate lightning protection devices in some areas with frequent lightning. It’s not uncommon that the VFD is hit and damaged by lightning. In some areas, because the grid voltage fluctuation is relatively large, or the load distance is small, we should also consider adding an inline reactor, bus reactor and output filter and other accessories. Besides choosing the proper operating environment and protection, many people also make mistakes in the choice of product model and product operation process, which will cause the product to fail to meet their expectations and failure. A VFD is a power source that changes the frequency and voltage that drives the motors to work. So, you need to choose the right product according to the engine and the load situation. In addition to the general type of VFD, there are fan pump type and vector type of early VFD models. Now with the increasing use of VFD, many customized VFDs are developed according to the equipment, such as elevator specified VFD, ball mill specified VFD, spinning specified VFD and so on. If a VFD is designed with a specified frequency converter, it will be more competent for the corresponding load than general models in theory, and it can cope better with the current user environment. Relatively speaking, it is not so easy to break down. In some cases, the frequency converter needs to start frequently, so it needs to increase the capacity to avoid the damage caused by excessively high temperature or increase the external braking unit and braking resistance to avoid the impact of long-term braking. Some work environment doesn't require a short acceleration and deceleration time, so it should be adjusted a little longer. For some working loads that need to run at low speed, the inverter needs to be set to avoid working in the low-frequency band. We can increase the speed ratio to improve the actual working frequency of the inverter, which can also extend the service life of the inverter. If you are not sure what is a quality VFD, especially when it's your first time buying electronic parts, then just go to big brands. Of course, this rule applies to buying anything. Because of years or even decades of accumulated process data, and strict quality management system, and the components used are relatively reliable, the overall probability of damage of big brand VFDs is lower than that of small brand ones. Another key factor determining the quality of a VFD is its printed circuit board. Over the years, VFD manufacturers have done a lot of innovations and development on printed circuit boards to make themselves have a competitive quality advantage against each other. By now, VFD quality has reached a very high standard, heat resistance and aging resistance has been dramatically improved. The voltage withstands value of the modules used will be higher for a quality VFD, and the current overload capacity will be more substantial. Electrolytic capacitors and other parts that can resist aging will also be of better quality. To sum up all the above, choosing the right VFD, and providing good maintenance and protections to it is the best way to maximize its service life and avoid failure.

20,6 Tips for Successfully Managing Remote Working,computers-technology," Be it through principle, design, or necessity, remote working is no longer a foreign concept to businesses around the world. While some companies may have already adopted a secure and efficient remote working infrastructure, other less adaptable enterprises have spent the past year learning about new working methods with little knowledge, experience, or time for training. Switching to remote working has been, quite simply, a matter of survival in an extremely difficult year for businesses. But if one thing is for sure, home working is here to stay – pandemic or no pandemic. That being the case, we believe that every business should learn how to manage remote teams successfully and maintain productivity away from the traditional office environment. These are just a few tips that will help you keep on top of your IT configuration, support your employees, and manage your team in a positive way. Ensure Your IT Network Provides Everything You Need Your remote working set-up is only as good as the IT platform that it’s built on. How many meetings have already been disrupted by poor communication? How many tools have let you down, and how many work procedures have been restricted due to basic, incompatible equipment or technology? Your IT system is worth investing in. Make sure that your Wi-Fi is up-to-scratch and that your team has all the equipment they need. Headsets and modern computers will keep your team working effectively, while the appropriate seating and monitor mounts will look after their health and wellbeing. Your IT network should include some form of cloud working in order to share live documents remotely, and network security should always be a top priority as well. Get your IT right and your team will have a much greater chance of working successfully. Adopt Clever Communication Tools Nothing says ‘remote working’ more than video technology. Whether it’s Zoom, Teams, or even Google Meet, you need to use the communication tools that are suited to your business. Each communication tool comes with advantages and disadvantages, and there’s always a cost to consider with premium packages. However, similar to a capable IT configuration, powerful communication platforms will allow you to coach, guide, and interact with your colleagues in real-time. This is essential for successful remote working. Make Time to Support Your Team Everybody handles change differently, and this is no different in the workplace. As a manager, you still need to use your mentoring and support skills with a team that’s working from home. If certain employees seem to be struggling or if their productivity levels have inexplicably dropped, make time to pick up the phone (or make a video call) and discuss their work with them. Support them, listen to their feedback, and make changes based on their thoughts. Just by taking the time to speak to your team and checking in on them, you’ll learn about different ways you can improve their remote working experience and get their contribution back-on-track. Manage Expectations Just because you’re working remotely, it doesn’t mean that you need to abandon all of your usual management principles from the office. In fact, many of the most important elements of managing your workforce come under the spotlight with remote working. First of all, set clear and realistic expectations for your team. There’s no need to add unnecessary stress or anxiety with unrealistic targets – design achievable objectives and put a simple structure in place. Remove obstacles, schedule daily check-ins, and create a platform that allows your team to communicate early-warnings or raise concerns about a deadline. Quick communication doesn’t always require a call – use instant messaging to check-in and update progress efficiently. Trust Your Team With a powerful IT configuration in place, clear objectives, a flexible approach, and communication tools that make reporting and scheduling simple, it’s time for you to get on with your day job. In other words – trust your team! You wouldn’t watch over your team’s shoulders in the office, so there’s no need to do it from home. Micromanaging can be intimidating and disruptive: let your team do what they do best. Should problems arise, you’ve already created a structure which allows problems to be logged and communicated. And when your business delivers the goods, remember to celebrate and identify positive results. Remote Working with your IT Support Company When it comes to finding a company to partner with for your IT support, you need one that is experienced in helping clients to quickly adapt to the remote working environment and implementing powerful and secure IT solutions. You may only require a few changes to get the most out of your system, or you might be considering a complete cloud-based overhaul instead. If your staff are going to work remotely, it means you’re going to need a remote IT support service that can offer features like telephone assistance, 24/7 monitoring and maintenance and remote connectivity, as it would be impossible for an IT company to be able to visit the site of your remote working employees. Whatever you have in mind, make sure they have the right credentials, and they are able to tailor their IT solutions to your needs."

2,SpaceX Mars landing then exploding,computers-technology," Two fantastic flights, two astounding accident arrivals. The third time was practically the appeal. On Wednesday, SpaceX dispatched another high-height trip of Starship, a colossal cutting edge shuttle that Elon Musk, the author and CEO of the private rocket organization, fantasies about shipping off Mars. It got back to the ground and put down in one piece, however then lit up in another red hot shoot minutes after the arrival. As the sun set over the test site in Boca Chica, Tex., near Brownsville, the most recent model, assigned SN10, took off, its treated steel outside acquiring a purple tone as it rose toward an elevation of a little more than six miles, well beneath the orbital statures that SpaceX one day expects to accomplish. It was the subsequent dispatch endeavor of the day. Three hours sooner, takeoff was cut short with simply a negligible part of a second left in the commencement. The motors had effectively lighted however were then stopped when the PC on board the Starship recognized an excessive amount of push from one of the motors. The architects concluded that the issue was not critical, changed the product, refueled the rocket and attempted once more. At about 6:15 p.m. Eastern time, the three motors touched off once more, and this time they remained on. The rocket rose into the Texas sky, and, by plan, the motors shut down individually as the rocket moved toward a height of six miles. ""Pleasant, extremely decent,"" said John Insprucker, a SpaceX engineer portraying the organization's webcast. The Starship at that point spilled to a level situation, generally awkwardly diving through the climate in a controlled fall back toward the ground. The rocket at that point terminated its motors again to flip once more into a vertical position and eased back down to a delicate landing. As the air cleared, SN10 was all the while standing, however shifted. Mr. Insprucker proclaimed the test a triumph. While prior trips to this elevation had finished in red hot accidents, this time the rocket arrived in one piece. Be that as it may, the arrival legs seemed to fall flat, leaving the rocket standing however inclining at the arrival cushion. ""The central issue of the present experimental drill was to accumulate the information on controlling the vehicle while reappearing,"" Mr. Insprucker said on the webcast. ""Also, we were effective in doing as such."" A couple of moments later, after SpaceX started its recuperation tasks of the vehicle and had finished up its video feed, camcorders worked by the site NASA Spaceflight caught a blast that sent the rocket on a spontaneous second jump, deteriorating on fire. A hole in a charge tank may have caused the blast. The past test, on Feb. 2, happened after an engagement among SpaceX and the Federal Aviation Administration, which controls rocket dispatches. The F.A.A. said that the prior December dispatch had happened without the organization's endorsement. SpaceX had mentioned a waiver to lead that flight despite the fact that it had not shown that a pressing factor wave that could be created by a blast during the test would not represent a peril to general society. The F.A.A. denied the solicitation. SpaceX dispatched in any case. After an examination, the F.A.A. permitted SpaceX to go ahead with the February dispatch. At the point when that flight finished in another accident, the office again requested an examination, which seems to have continued with less trouble. The office allowed endorsement for the test on Wednesday. Mr. Musk's organization has gotten fruitful in the dispatch business, and it is currently one of the world's most significant secretly held organizations. Its Falcon 9 rockets have become a predominant workhorse for sending satellites to circle. It regularly moves freight to the International Space Station, and lifted NASA space travelers there twice in 2020, with more excursions arranged for the current year. In any case, many are doubtful about Mr. Musk's attestation that the organization is only a couple a long time from sending a Starship to Mars, saying he has more than once set timetables for SpaceX that demonstrated excessively idealistic in how rapidly they have happened. In 2019, when he gave a report on the improvement of Starship, he said a high-height test would happen in no time and that orbital flights could happen from the get-go in 2020. All things being equal, a few calamitous disappointments happened due to broken welding. At the point when the force tanks quit breaking, two of the models made short effective flights a year ago. Those prior Starship models took after shower paint jars with their marks eliminated, rising almost 500 feet utilizing a solitary rocket motor prior to hindering down at the Texas test site. In a video delivered on Tuesday night, Mr. Musk said Starship would be prepared to dispatch individuals to circle and past by 2023. He offered the comments in a video delivered by Yusaku Maezawa, a Japanese business person who is serving to monetarily endorse the improvement of Starship. Mr. Maezawa expects to fly on a roughly weeklong excursion around the moon and back to Earth. In the Tuesday video, Mr. Maezawa reported that he needed to welcome eight travelers on the lunar journey, and welcomed applications from individuals wishing to go. On Wednesday, he said in excess of 100,000 individuals have effectively communicated interest."
3,Beta Testing – An Informative Guide,computers-technology," What is Beta Testing? Beta testing is a type of external user acceptance testing and is the final round of testing performed before a product is finally released to the wider audience. In this testing, a nearly completed (90-95%) version of the software, known as the beta version is released to a limited number of end-users for testing. This beta testing method is performed to gain feedback on accessibility, usability, reliability, functionality, and other aspects of the developed software. Typically, it is a testing process in which the real users use a minimal viable product in a production environment. The stakeholders of the beta test are the product management team, quality management team, and user experience team whereas the participants of beta testing are real users or end-users of the product. What is the purpose of Beta Testing? The main purpose of beta testing is to get the developed product tested by real users in the production environment. This method of beta testing is conducted to gain effective feedback for product improvement before launching the product into the market for a larger set of audience. Additionally, it is a known fact that continuous improvement is an ongoing process and continues with an aim to constantly evaluate and improve products over time. As Beta testing is done by real-users or end-users, it gives more genuine and real-time insights about whether the product will be liked by end-users or not if launched. Moreover, beta testing also focuses on real-world compatibility of the product as the product is tested in the production environment on various OS, devices, platforms, browsers, etc."
4,Our Windows App Got Better with New App-Based Troubleshooting Features,computers-technology," As we evolve the PureVPN brand, we also take heed to the user experience, seeking ways to improve your interactive experience within our applications even if you're not looking for ways that the app needs to be improved. At PureVPN, we look to get iteratively better, and we're not satisfied with the status quo. We saw a way to improve the app experience even more, so we decided it's time to roll some of these features out. As such, we recently evolved our Windows app with extra troubleshooting steps that allow both PureVPN and the end user to diagnose issues that may arise when connecting to your desired PureVPN server. When a user connects to the PureVPN app, there are 2 broad categories that cause a user's connection to PureVPN to fail: account issues and connectivity related issues. Perhaps the server is down. Perhaps it's something on the user's end. Perhaps your account is no longer active. Our app now will give you the data you need to make informed decisions. Our plan in revamping our application was to reduce the pain it would take to troubleshoot these issues, some of which can be quite difficult to diagnose. Before this point, any connectivity issue with the app would require you to contact our support team, and they'd have had to troubleshoot the issue either by asking you questions or by accessing your machine remotely. And that process could be potentially arduous: if the support rep could solve it through a few questions and answers or through RDP, great. Otherwise, it would need to be escalated to a technical engineer, and it's a very inefficient process when all you want is to have to connect to a VPN without a headache. Our goal is to gradually automate detection and fixing of all the cases where the process can be automated. At the present, we have addressed 6 cases with the focus of adding functionality to address even more cases in the future. Therefore, we overhauled the app to include embedded diagnostic functionality to resolve a large majority of issues. Currently, all the apps have these features, but the number of use cases on each platform varies. And we'll be refining all apps to include additional diagnostics as well, as admittedly this is still a basic iteration of what's to come. Is the user authenticated? The first step we process upon connecting to the app is to verify if the user is authenticated. We return data such as if the account is still active or disabled, if their trial or term has ended, if the user's credentials are valid, or if the user's VPN credentials may have recently been updated. Is the server accessible? The next step we perform is to connect the user to the most optimal server based on the user's specifications. First, we aim to connect to the server within 5 seconds. If it takes too long, we will display a notification informing you that the connection is delayed, and you now have the option to abort and troubleshoot. We also have a means of verifying if there are multiple attempts within the app to connect to a VPN server. For example, when you first connect to the VPN, it may not respond. Thus, our app immediately attempts to retry the connection. If another attempt is taking place and it takes too long, we will default to the troubleshooting process. We display the popup as soon as the time limit is exceeded to give users the ability to troubleshoot. Did the connection fail? If the connection still fails at this point, we may have some data points returned from the server that may indicate why this is happening. If we receive an error code where we have a specific solution, we can then work off of the data from that point to establish the correct fixes with minimal interruption to the user experience. There are 4 types of connection failures that we can work with at this point. A reliable solution, where we understand both the problem and the solution, and can send the user to the solution. A reliable solution, where we understand the problem but it cannot be automated without some interaction by the user. A solution that is not reliable but can be automated. Even though we are not 100% sure that this solution would work, it's still worth giving a shot. A solution that is not reliable and cannot be automated. In those cases, we'll try to send you to the troubleshooting screen where we can walk through additional steps before escalation to support. If all else fails, we'll suggest that you repeat the process or contact our 24/7/365 online support at https://support.purevpn.com Our goal here is to make things as seamless and frustration free as possible, and we hope these steps will make it easier for you to get online and connected to PureVPN in a jiffy. Join 3 million+ users and enjoy complete internet freedom. Check out www.PureVPN.com today for a better and secure Internet experience with PureVPN."
5,Gaming Laptops Under $1000,computers-technology," If you have a decent budget and don't want to deal with buying separate parts and building your own PC, consider purchasing one of the 5 best gaming laptops under 1000 dollars on this list. PC gaming can be a pretty expensive hobby. With new games getting more and more graphically intense, you need to invest a lot of money into buying the latest and greatest hardware in order to get the best possible experience out of these titles. Also, you need to take a lot of things into consideration if you plan on building a custom PC from scratch. List of the 5 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1000 All of the problems that come along with building your own gaming PC can seem pretty overwhelming when you are new to the world of gaming. However, these gaming laptops can solve most of your problems! ASUS TUF Gaming Acer Nitro 5 Lenovo Legion 5 ASUS ROG MSI GF65 Thin These beasts pack a lot of power in extremely thin and light packages that you can carry around with you anywhere you go. While there are many high-end options available in the market, today, we’ll be taking a look at some entry-level gaming laptops. These laptops are reasonably priced under $1000 USD, and they are perfect for someone who is new to PC gaming. While $1000 might not feel like entry-level pricing, it's important to note that higher-end laptops can go for $2000, $3000, $4000, and more! If you are just looking for the best performance you can get while staying close to the limit of 1000 USD, then the ASUS TUF Gaming laptop is definitely the best pick for you. While respecting your budget, you can get TUF Gaming Laptops with a variety of GPUs, up to an Nvidia RTX 2060. This means that you will be able to take advantage of Nvidia’s new raytracing technology. Also, you can get better FPS in the games that support DLSS. The number one reason why most of the consumers might be interested in this laptop would be its Ryzen 7 AMD CPU, which is way more powerful compared to its Intel alternative. This CPU will not only save your battery life, but will also let you maintain a better workflow. The Acer Nitro 5 is a direct competitor of the previous entry above in terms of price and performance. Just like the ASUS TUF Gaming laptop, the Acer Nitro 5 also has various models with different GPUs, up to an Nvidia RTX 2060. This means that you will be able to enjoy raytracing and DLSS in your games. This small beast rocks a powerful 9th Gen Core i7 CPU, so it will be able to handle all of your tasks quite easily. Acer Nitro 5 is a literal bang-for-buck as this laptop is built with durability in mind! Sadly, the placement of the fans on this laptop is not ideal, so it does tend to run a bit hotter as compared to the other options on the list. Nevertheless, it remains one of the best gaming laptops under $1000 currently available on the market. Lenovo is not really a very big name in the world of high-tier gaming laptops. However, if you are just looking for a budget gaming option, then this company has a lot to offer. While the Lenovo L340 deserves to be on this list as well, I decided to go with the Lenovo Legion 5 because of its better price-to-performance ratio. This laptop comes packed with an AMD Ryzen 7 4800H CPU, which gives it an edge over all the Intel options on this list. The GPU you get with the Lenovo Legion 5 is a 1660ti, which is a pretty good budget option. Sadly, this is not an RTX GPU, so the performance in games is definitely not going to be as good as the previous two options on the list. You should go with this option if you are looking for something that is a good fit for an office environment as well. The higher-tier models of ASUS ROG are definitely some of my favorite gaming laptops of all time. While this lower-tier model lacks quite a bit in terms of performance, it is still the best option in the entire list if you are looking for something with the best design and build quality. The ASUS ROG comes packed with a powerful 9th Gen Core i7 CPU that makes it an ideal laptop for productivity. The Nvidia GTX 1650 GPU on this thing is not as powerful as compared to all the other options on the list. However, it should serve you well if you just want to play some less-demanding titles. If you want the most premium laptop that fits your budget, then you should probably consider the ASUS ROG. Now, let us talk about the best gaming laptop under $1000 on this entire list. While the MSI GF65 laptop does not come with an RTX GPU, it is still my favorite entry-level laptop because of its sleek and portable design. The MSI GF65 Thin is the lightest laptop in this catalogue, and it comes packed with an incredibly powerful CPU and GPU. This laptop contains a 9th Gen Core i7 CPU, which is perfect for all kinds of users. The GPU in this thing is a GTX 1660ti, which is just slightly less powerful as compared to the RTX 2060. Sadly, you only get a single-channel 8 GB RAM with this beast, but you can upgrade it pretty easily. If you are looking for a long-lasting and well-balanced laptop, then the MSI GF65 Thin is the pick for you. We hope our list of the best gaming laptops under $1000 can help you find an option that suits your gaming needs."
6,5 Proven Printer Hacks that will level up your printing,computers-technology," Your printer is one of the most important devices in the office. With its ability to print, scan, fax and email, it’s used for many different tasks. Everyone in your office needs to use the printer and photocopier at some point, but there’s more functionality available beyond its basic functions. Here are 5 printer hacks that will help you save time and money and also work more safely and securely. Printer Hacks Wireless Printing In simple terms, a wireless printer is a printer that doesn’t require any cables to be connected between your device and the printer, documents that you wish to print are sent over your wireless network to the printer. Many offices are increasingly using tablets and mobile devices in order to provide more flexibility. Wireless printing allows you to print directly from anywhere within wireless range, you could send documents to the printer during a meeting, or while having lunch with colleagues. Not all printers have a wireless printing option, so it’s worth checking to see if your office printers can. If so, you’ll be able to print directly from a tablet or mobile device, saving time, money and allowing you to be more productive. Only print documents when you're at the printer In a standard printing environment, when you send something to print from your device, the printer immediately starts printing. This is not always ideal and one of the main reasons is security. Many documents contain sensitive information which should only be viewed by certain members of staff. When a sensitive document is sent to a printer, there is a period of time when that document is sitting in the output tray unattended. Any delay in collecting the documents from the printer creates an unnecessary data security risk. With security and data protection regulatory obligations (such as GDPR) surrounding the handling of sensitive data, it’s important for data to be handled correctly and sensitive information protected. One of the best ways to solve this is to set up a secure print release process that enables you to send documents to the printer, then only have the machine print when you’re physically at the device. You access the printer with a secure login (or a contactless authorisation using an access card or key fob) and the document prints. Consider your font Back in 2014, 14-year-old Suvir Mirchandani from Pittsburg, Pennsylvania discovered he could save his school $21,000 a year by changing the font they used to Garamond. He gained media attention by claiming he could save the US government $400 million annually in printing costs. Which font is a printer hack? – Arial Which font is a printer hack? – Times New Roman Which font is a printer hack? – Century Gothic Which font is a printer hack? – Garamond The thing with Garamond is that it’s a much smaller font and therefore can be more difficult to read, although the underlying logic still applies, change your font and save money. This printer hack is especially relevant if your business prints regularly. Let’s say you changed your font from Arial to Century Gothic, studies show that you would use 30% less ink over time. Overall it depends on your preferences and business needs but over time this one of the best printer hacks and has the potential to save a lot of money. Have Your Printer Serviced It sounds simple, but the best way to avoid any potential problems with your printers or photocopiers is to have them regularly serviced. It’s a huge problem when your printer or copier breaks down, and for many businesses who aren’t on a service plan with a managed print company, breakdowns are a real hindrance to regular office work. With regular maintenance and cleaning, you can rest assured you’re doing everything possible to proactively avoid potential issues before they stop the printer from working entirely. Check How Much You’re Actually Printing For many businesses, the cost of printing can quickly become more than originally anticipated. Many people are using the printer on a daily basis and unfortunately, they do print unnecessarily from time to time. One of the best things you can do is understand how your company is printing with an audit of your print activity. Understanding this data will allow you to take meaningful action to reduce overall cost and improve the efficiency of your printing. The simplest way to do this is to have a managed print expert do a full print audit (a quick and easy process), which will report on all print activity and let you see how much and what you’re printing. Rules can be set up to alert you when you’re printing colour instead of mono when you might not need to, and you can even set up daily allowances for printing – making sure that you only print as much as you need to and therefore saving on unnecessary spending."
7,5 Document Security Mistakes and How to Fix Them,computers-technology," The focus of data theft may be on large-scale corporate attacks affecting tens or hundreds of thousands of individuals, but the real risk to document security could be closer to home. Using the wrong printer or photocopier to manage your documents, with features not optimised for your print environment can result in a loss of information. Here’s a list of common ways you’re going wrong with document security and suggestions to make it right. Forgotten Documents Documents that are left in the printer output tray are at risk of being read, copied, or stolen and if the information in these documents contains sensitive information such as payroll, banking, or personal data, that could put your business at risk. Choose a printer or photocopier that is capable of authenticating the user at the device before releasing the print job and ensure that this feature is implemented throughout your office. Hard Drive Data Each multifunctional printer and photocopier contains a hard drive, much like your computer. This hard drive contains all the information of each printed, scanned, copied, or emailed document and therefore requires the same level of security as your desktop or laptop computer. Most modern printers and photocopiers today have the option to turn on data-encryption, this adds a level of security that will prevent someone from removing the hard-drive and using your data. Choose a device with enterprise-grade encryption and ensure it is turned on. As most office printers and photocopiers are leased or rented, you should ensure that when the copier is returned to the supplier the hard drive is wiped of any data. Saving Locally Most people store their documents somewhere on their device before they are scanned. Saving documents to a convenient location, such as your desktop or local folder increases the risk of a data breach by hackers or malicious employees. To mitigate this, make sure your printer can save your files directly to the cloud. Password Protection Documents that contain sensitive information should be password-protected. The right printer can ensure you are sending your documents securely across your business. We recommend that you use a strong password to encrypt sensitive or confidential documents and to level up your document security. Ideally with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols and at least 12 characters long. Use a password generator to avoid words that are easy to guess. Remote Printing A colleague who works from home or away from the office may ask a team member in the office to print a document for them, but if the team member saves that document in an unsafe location, it could fall into the wrong hands compromising your document security. A printer or photocopier with remote printing capability allows colleagues who are not in the office to print safely and effectively. PaperCut software can be installed on most print servers and features mobility print, allowing you to print remotely from outside your network. Level Up Your Document Security Sensitive or confidential documents falling into the wrong hands can be catastrophic for many businesses. In a time of data privacy and regulations such as GDPR, it’s so important for businesses to gain full control over their data and minimise the risks of data leakage. A document management solution allows your business to have full control of its document security and provides a full audit trail allowing you to easily see who viewed, modified and accessed any documents. It provides granular control of the document flow around your business."
8,Printer Security? Here Are 6 Tips To Keep Your Business Safe,computers-technology," Modern office printers and photocopiers operate much like your computers on your network. They have built-in hard drives that contain data on all the documents you’ve printed, they access the internet and communicate across your network. Printer Security Printer security is often overlooked but in today’s world, modern multifunction devices can do so much more than in the past. As they access your network to transfer data, email documents and allow mobile printing they should be treated as major access points to your business network. A recent study by Quocirca on printer security stated that: 11% of all security incidents are print-related, equating to an average of nine print-related incidents per year. 59% of these lead to data losses, costing an average of £313,000 per-annum to deal with. In today’s ever-connected world securing your data should be a top priority. If your business deals with sensitive or confidential documents and must comply with industry data regulations you will want to ensure all your printers and photocopiers are secured on your network. An unsecured printer or photocopier can provide an easy access point to your entire business network. This puts your business data at risk from malicious attack. Choose the correct Printer Printers and photocopiers specifically designed for use in a business setting will have advanced printer security features already built-in to the device. Do not use a consumer printer in a business print environment as these are not designed with enterprise-level security in mind. Make sure you are utilising the security features in your office MFD to take full advantage of the protection it offers. printer security features Remember that the printer manufacturers are constantly improving printer security protocols and adding better security features to their devices and this means that a newer printer is much more secure than an older device. If you have an older device, it may be worth considering an upgrade to a much more secure device, maybe to comply with new regulations or because your business has grown and so has your data. Use Authentication Using authentication protects settings being changed on your copier by just anyone, ensure user groups and access levels are set up correctly and maintained during the lifespan of your device. Keep Updated Manufacturers release regular firmware updates for their devices. Ensure your device is kept updated with the latest firmware. This ensures all recent security features and patches have been implemented. Protect your Data Many business printers now come with the ability to encrypt the data they hold on the hard drive. Make sure you are using encryption to protect your business data. When it’s time to replace your device, ensure all your data is professionally removed from the hard drive before it leaves your business. Network Security Remember your printer is an access point to your entire business network. Be sure to take steps to secure your network. Depending on your requirements, you may want to secure your printer on a firewall-protected internal network and ensure it doesn’t communicate with the outside world. Close your ports Ensure you close any unused ports on your business network to prevent them from being used to gain access to your documents and information printer network Printer Security Best Practices Treat your printer or photocopier like you would any other device on your network. Require a password to access, set up secure firewalls and implement Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies to prevent any malicious use. Your business should have standard policies for printer security enforced through centralised tools, which should be reviewed regularly."
9,The industry ready I/O controllers for automation and IoT applications,computers-technology," Norvi IoT devices are ESP32 integrated industrial controllers which come with a number of features that make them suitable for industrial automation and IoT solutions. These devices come equipped with digital and analog I/O , enabling them to detect digital logic states and analog inputs, depending on the choice of the model. The inputs can come from several sources. In general cases, the source of input can pose a potential threat to the system, but the Norvi devices ensure isolated digital inputs for added protection. Variety of models in the Norvi lineup are capable of measuring the environmental factors like flow rate, pressure, temperature and offer analog inputs (for dedicated voltage/current measurement) at the industrial level. With the Norvi relay model, it becomes simple to control the industrial appliances. When it comes to digital outputs in this relay model, both relays and transistor outputs perform the same task. However, compared to transistors, switching can be far slower in relays, and relays emit clicking sounds. Moreover, relays also have a larger appetite for current consumption. The transistors are smaller in size and silent in operation and affordable. Setting up the Norvi devices only require lesser wiring, which offers more flexibility to management of the device. Also the sinking and sourcing capabilities within Norvi industrial ESP32 IoT devices ensures that current flows in either direction. Hence the machines are capable of switching inputs between sink and source functions."
10,Wall mountable devices for Industrial IoT applications,computers-technology," Wall mountable IoT devices are famous for their ability to function as standalone devices in industrial environments with less human intervention.

11,Is It Possible To Use A Laptop Monitor To Play With The Sega Dreamcast?,computers-technology," If you have ever heard of the Sega Dreamcast, you might be familiar with what it is. For all you newbies out there, the Dreamcast console by Sega was one of the most sought-after consoles of its time. It was a console released way-ahead of its time in terms of the technology it contained. The Dreamcast is one of those consoles which laid the foundation for many of the future consoles to come until today as it had features that were never brought by any of the competitors at that time. What Made It So Unique? The Dreamcast had a distinguished look to it with either black or grey color. It had a joypad with a screen on it along with a memory card inside it for playing games as a separate mini-console for games. The console had a port for internet connectivity for online gaming which was a first for any gaming console for its time. All of these quirks made the Sega Dreamcast one of a kind in its segment. Are You Planning To Get One For Yourself? If you happen to be a fan of retro games, then the Dreamcast might be on the top of your list for sure! Whether you have it in possession or thinking of purchasing one, the main issue today is the compatibility factor of the Dreamcast. This is because it used old-school ports which were the norm back in the days, but today’s modern TVs and other gadgets don’t have them anymore save a few. Can It Work On A Laptop Monitor? Well, it depends on the laptop. If you happen to have a laptop that is a few years old, then you might have a chance to connect your Dreamcast to it via a Dreamcast VGA Cable. The older laptop models might have a port that would have the capability of connecting itself to the Dreamcast via a small adapter. However, if you look at the laptops of today, you might be disappointed by their choice of poets. With evolving technology more and more manufacturers are aiming for minimal and port-less designs which hinder their connectivity to various devices and require several connectors for them to function properly. Similarly, the Dreamcast console will need an adapter to work with a laptop if it is supported by it. Although, you might be better off using a regular monitor screen instead to play games on your Dreamcast. Even though the chances of a laptop monitor connecting to your Dreamcast are slim, but nonetheless, it is still a possibility if you can find yourself a compatible port converter for the Dreamcast VGA Cable. But it is more advisable to buy a new or used standalone monitor and then pursue your Dreamcast gaming through it instead of connecting it with a laptop screen. This will save you the hassle of the many possible errors and issues occurring while you are trying to connect your Dreamcast to the Laptop screen."
12,dlinkrouter.local 10,computers-technology," We need to configure the D-link router setup and once the configuration gets completed, we need to set up all our wi-fi connectivity processes after that we can connect the internet through the D-link router. Note: Before, proceeding we just need to get sure that our system is connected to the router through an ethernet cable or in wireless mode with a smartphone device. Because the IP address 192.168.0.1or 192.168.1.1 is a local web console, which enables us to access the dlinkrouter. local  or www. dlinkrouter.local router’s admin page. That will happen if and only if our system and mobile device connected with the dlink router by wire or wireless mode. Follow these steps to log-In in D-link router Login page: Now, open your search engine whatever you have either Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge, and navigate the following IP address: 192.168.1.1 192.168.10.1 192.168.0.1 Mostly, the Preferable gateway is 192.168.0.1 or else access the link dlinkrouter.local or www.dlinkrouter.local that redirects you to the D-Link login page Enter Login Credentials Once you redirect to the dlink router login page one pop-up will display on your screen which asks you for Login credential: the username and password to access the router’s mydlink page. In D-link by default the username is admin and the password is blank (not required), if you had not change it yet. For to get sure about the default login username and password details, check the router by turn it into the backside there you will see one sticker is there on that you will get the router's IP address and their login credential. That’s your username and password, with that you complete your Dlink login (wi-fi router login). If that login credential will not work for you then you can use username as “admin” and password “admin”. After entering this information you will redirect to logged in into the mydlink login page and the home page will appear Infront of you, in that web console page of dlinkrouter.local. Configuration Now, you are entered successfully in the admin panel, now you can change the setting of the router model. you can do all the reset activities, change the router settings such as change password, change SSID, Change username of the router, and many more. Using the customize setting tab prevents any malicious intruder to enter your private setting panel. So, before making any change note down all the current setting details as it is. This will help you to revert to the previous setting mode easily if things are not working as anticipated. Why can't I connect to my router admin page? Whether you are going to access your wireless router setup or want to view the wi-fi password from previous setup access you need to access router’s admin panel of dlinkrouter.local. If you can’t reach the admin panel page then these are the following reason: Hardwired connection (Ethernet cable mot connected properly) Entered IP address incorrect IP address issues in your system Entered incorrect username and password The Issue with the wireless router itself Hardwired connection (Ethernet cable mot connected properly) •	First of all, make sure that your computer is connected with hardwired and directly connected to a router or not and check out that all the hardwired well connected to the port of the router or not •	One of the quickest and most preferable techniques is the power cycle process. Power Cycle means to remove the connection from the dlink router setup and power point wait for a couple of minutes and then plugging in the power back. •	If the LED light turn on then your router is perfectly working otherwise you have to call the service centre Let’s make sure that you have entered the correct ip address. Don’t make mistake while typing the ip address like https://www.dlinkkrouterlocal.com, https://www.dlinkkrouterlocal.com/, 192.168.1.1.com, 192.168.o.1 use either 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1. or try both it’s your choice. There is no need to enter http:// or https:// Infront of the ip numbers or else go dlink default gateway link dlinkrouter.local  or  www.dlinkrouter.local for more convenience. The computer IP address should be the same as the subnet as the router’s IP address in order of convenient communication between the two of them. For example, If the router IP address is 192.168.0.1 then of course the IP address of your system should start with 192.168.0., if IP address is 192.168.1.1 then it should be 192.168.1.. Otherwise, there is no possibility of communication between the router and your system."

16,Your last line of defense against data loss,computers-technology," Data loss can strike at any moment and without warning, which is why you should do everything you can to keep it safe. For businesses and academics, data loss can lead to disastrous situations, but it also has consequences for personal users. Imagine, for example, suddenly losing many years' worth of treasured family photos or documents for school. While it is always best to keep your data backed up in at least three different physical locations, including in the cloud, there may still be situations where you don't have anything to fall back on. It's an experience most computer users have had at least once in their lifetimes, whether it's something as straightforward as emptying the recycle bin or formatting a drive or a partition. Only when it's already too late do you realize you don't have a copy of the deleted files anywhere else. Fortunately, there might still be hope, thanks to data recovery software! Active@ File Recovery provides a last-minute resource that allows you to get back your deleted data in most cases. However, your chances of getting everything back intact are always much higher if you act quickly. This is because of the way modern digital storage systems work. When you format a drive or partition or empty the recycle bin, the previously occupied disk space will become available for other file operations. This means that no data is actually deleted until it is permanently overwritten by something else. Indeed, this is why you should never donate or sell a used computer without carefully sanitizing any potentially sensitive data stored on it beforehand. Sometimes, it is possible to recover deleted files months or even years are a drive was formatted, especially if the drive has not been in use for long. However, you should always act quickly, and avoid making any changes to the contents of the drive in question. You can also use Active@ File Recovery to recover files from your system hard drive. The Ultimate edition works in its own fully self-contained OS environment, based on the Windows Preinstallation Environment (WinPE). It runs off a removable storage device, such as a USB flash drive, which also means it avoids writing any data to the disk you want to recover data from. Active@ File Recovery also supports hundreds of file signatures. This is important, since it can identify files of certain types, such as pictures or documents. This is easier than manual search and recovery, since the original filenames and extensions may no longer be present. The most recent update to the Ultimate edition now contains a new version of Active@ Boot Disk, which has been upgraded to WinPE based on Windows 10 Build 2004. The Active@ LiveCD software has also been updated to accommodate new operating environments based on openSUSE 15.2, Linux Kernel 5.3, and KDE 5.18. Active@ File Recovery is regularly updated to ensure you always have the best possible chances of recovering your data. The latest version sports several other tweaks and changes, including the removal of the popup window in Easy and Advanced mode, a simplified user interface, and the ability to start the software in earlier versions if you are using the advanced mode.

17,NTFS Recovery Toolkit is the last line of defense against data loss,computers-technology," Data loss is something that almost all computer users have experienced at least once in their lifetimes. While it is always better to take a proactive approach towards safeguarding important data, human error remains a common problem. For example, you might empty the recycle bin because you want to free up some more disk space, only to find that the files within were not safely backed up as you thought. Another common mistake is formatting the wrong drive or deleting the wrong partition, especially when installing or reinstalling your operating system. Other problems are completely beyond the control of the end user, such as hardware and software failures, which can also result in data loss. In some cases, you might not have any recent backup to recover, but that does not mean all hope is lost. NTFS Recovery Toolkit exploits the window of opportunity you have between when the files or partitions are deleted and when the original data is lost permanently due to being overwritten. Sometimes, this does not happen until months or even years after its deletion, but the chances of a successful recovery operation are much higher if you act quickly. This is especially the case if the drive is in heavy use, and there is a higher chance that the original data will be overwritten sooner. However, what really happens when you empty the recycle bin, delete a partition, or format a drive, is that the space originally occupied by the files is marked as available. It still remains hidden on the drive, no matter the storage media, until it gets overwritten by something else. If the files remain intact on the drive, even after deletion, you should be able to recover them without any problems. However, you will need the right data recovery software. Some solutions can only search for files in specific formats, and some only support a very small range. When files are deleted, the original meta information about the file is removed from the file system, such as its original location. Sometimes, other data, such as the file name or type might be lost. This means the software needs to look for file signatures associated with files of certain types. The included File Recovery app in NTFS Recovery Toolkit can search for file signatures across hundreds of different file types. Version 14 includes Active@ File Recovery 21, which includes support for additional file types. NTFS Recovery Toolkit 14 also includes Active@ Partition Recovery 21, which provides the best possible chances of recovering your lost or corrupt hard drive partitions. It makes this possible by working in its own operating environment, which does not require you to boot into Windows or any other specific operating system. Instead, it runs off bootable media and uses your system memory to avoid making any further chances to the system hard drive. This allows you to recover data from your primary hard drive or disk partition, without reducing your chances of a successful operation. You can learn more about how it works at https://www.lsoft.net/ntfs-recovery."
18,"Everything you need to backup, recover, and securely delete data",computers-technology," Active@ Data Studio is a comprehensive set of disk utilities that allows you to backup and restore data, securely erase storage devices, and repair your computer when it cannot start normally. It works in its own operating environment, based on the Windows Preinstallation Environment (WinPE) and updated to Windows build 2004. This makes it possible to access the entire suite of desktop applications from a bootable USD drive or other media. As such, you can repair, diagnose, and modify your computer settings even if you cannot log into your usual operating system. This makes it ideal for repairing errors that are preventing your compute from starting up, getting back deleted data, securely erasing your hard drive, and more. The latest edition of Active@ Data Studio, launched on November 24, includes a better Boot Disk Creator app, and all the latest versions of the main software. Back up your data with Active@ Disk Image 10 Active@ Data Studio includes the latest version of Active@ Disk Image, a powerful utility that gives you an easy and dependable way to back up your entire system. A disk image is the most comprehensive way to back up your computer, since it makes a complete, byte-by-byte copy of everything on a hard drive or partition. This ensures that nothing gets forgotten about. After all, chances are you have important files stored in folders that are not always the obvious ones. Moreover, with a complete disk image, you can easily transfer your entire operating system, along with all your apps and personal files, onto a new storage device or computer. For example, if you have recently replaced your hard drive or your whole computer, this means you do not need to manually reinstall Windows along with all your programs and files. Recover your data with Active@ File Recovery 21 With the included Active@ File Recovery, you can recover files from disks and partitions that have been formatted. You can also get back files deleted from the recycle bin. This solution gives you the best chances possible of getting back your data in one piece. It works by exploiting the fact that formatting a drive or emptying the recycle bin does not permanently delete data. Instead, it just makes the previously occupied space available but, until it gets overwritten, you should be able to recover it. By working in a self-contained boot environment running off an external storage device, it also reduces the risk of modifying the contents of the drive you want to recover data from. Active@ Data Studio also includes Active@ Partition Recovery, which lets you recover entire partitions that have been deleted. Securely erase sensitive data with Active@ KillDisk 13 If, on the other hand, your goal is to ensure data can never be recovered, Active@ KillDisk permanently overwrites every sector of the drive. This process works according to international data sanitization standards, such as those endorsed by the US Department of Defense.

19,An easy way to migrate from QuarkXPress to Adobe InDesign,computers-technology," Migrating from one software application to the next can be challenging. In the case of complex computer aided design software, the process can be even more difficult due to the highly complex data involved. One of the biggest problems is ensuring your documents are transferred without serious data loss. In the worst case scenario, you may even need to recreate documents all over again from scratch to ensure there are no errors or missing data. Compatibility problems often persist, not to mention it can take quite some time to get used to the new software. Despite this, there are many cases for migrating to a new solution. After all, Adobe InDesign is the industry standard for a wide range of use cases, such as document typesetting and designing professional business documents and marketing materials. It makes sense from the perspective of long term sustainability and profitability to use this software, even if you have been using QuarkXPress for years. Fortunately, there are ways to overcome the interoperability challenges if you are migrating from QuarkXPress to Adobe InDesign, or you use both of these popular platforms together. Alternatively, if you often receive files from your clients and partners in the QuarkXPress format, you need a way to easily 'translate' them into a format that can easily be ready in Adobe InDesign. This is a lot more complicated than it sounds, but Q2ID makes it possible while also preserving all the important data along the way. Since it is a simple and user-friendly plugin for Adobe InDesign, you do not even need to have QuarkXPress installed. Instead, you can simply install the plugin and import QuarkXPress files directly in Adobe InDesign with little or no risk of having to make any manual corrections or changes. With this plugin, you can convert more than 20 years' worth of QuarkXPress documents due to support for older versions. Whether you are migrating from QuarkXPress to Adobe InDesign, or you often receive documents designed in QuarkXPress, Q2ID is a must-have addition to your toolset. With a Q2ID subscription, you will be able to use plugins in the current Adobe InDesign CC 2020 and much older versions, right back to InDesign CS6. Plugins are available for both macOS and Windows users too. You can also important documents created in QuarkXPress 2019, which is the most recent version of the software. However, if you have older documents, Q2ID can even convert files effortlessly as far back as QuarkXPress 4, released more than 20 years ago. Moreover, Q2ID is regularly updated to address any user-reported bugs of compatibility issues, as well as to work with the latest versions of Adobe InDesign and QuarkXPress documents. It is also an essential solution if you regularly use both platforms for any reason. Thanks to simple one-click conversions, it only takes a few moments to work and convert virtually all page elements and items. This includes anchored boxes, blends, color models, images, fonts, page positions, styles, tables, text attributes, and virtually everything else you can think of.

20,Effects Behind the End of Net Neutrality,computers-technology," Abstract Net neutrality is the concept/belief that all traffic on a network should be treated equally and indiscriminately. Meaning, ISPs would not be able to slow, block, or speed up the process of delivery at their own will. Net neutrality laws came to an end in 2018, but there is now the debate of how ISPs should be regulated and what the government’s role should be. Other discussions on the topic pertain to the various opinions on net neutrality as well as the different stakeholders. Also, there are a variety of opinions of how net neutrality should be handled in the future. Introduction Times these days have become drastically different from our preceding generations as the last 30 years have resulted in the age of technology. With the advancements in technology over recent year, the internet has made major growth and improvements over time along with it. As a result, people have become highly dependent on the internet for their means of education, living, entertainment, and other aspects of life. Internet Service Providers (ISP for short) have benefited greatly as well by generating revenue through provided internet service to businesses, homes, and facilities. Generally, it was safe to assume that ISPs would treat all traffic indiscriminately and equally. This idea is known as net neutrality before referred to as common carrier regulations in the last ’90s and early 2000s. For homeowners with the internet, the idea of net neutrality is great because it guarantees that their traffic will not be discriminated against by big, up-and-coming companies that provide bandwidth for their consumers. However, this sense of security did not last too long as net neutrality was repealed two years after its official start in the United States. This meant that there is now nothing to stop ISPs from throttling, blocking, filtering, or messing with their consumers’ data. There has been discussion on what the effects will be of the repeal of it as well as how ethical the repeal of net neutrality is. Hopefully, this paper will give insight into the background and history of net neutrality, viewpoints, stakeholders, and its importance in IT. Timeline and Background of Net Neutrality Net neutrality has been debated over and looked at over the recent years, but it all started around 20 years ago. It was the result of the FCC using its power to make sure the internet remained a place that is open and equal for its consumers. The name was coined in 2002 and was upheld across various election cycles for some time. The Bush and Obama administrations pushed to enforce net neutrality as they understood its importance for the United States. In 2015, it took multiple appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court by the FCC’s chairman, Tom Wheeler, to get the rules of net neutrality to keep having an effect. However, in December of 2017 the new FCC chairman, Ajit Pai repealed the Open Internet Order which took Net Neutrality out of effect. The result ultimately leads to a lost sense of security for consumers as they now have no way to ensure their bandwidth is treated fairly or ethically. Lindsay Stern, who wrote an article on the effects of net neutrality states, “ The American public wants certainty that after paying among the highest prices in the world for broadband service, they can actually access the content they want online, without the cable or telephone company blocking or slowing content, or cutting a deal with another content provider to prioritize services other than those the consumer wants to access” (2019). I think Stern’s interpretation of what the American consumers worry over the bill is extremely accurate. As it now stands, ISPs will likely begin to throttle, limit, discriminate and negatively affect their consumers’ data and receive no repercussion for it. In 2021, there is still fighting for the reinstatement of the Open Internet Order and American consumers are extensively showing their disappointment over the initial repeal in 2017. Stakeholders and Impacts of Ethical Issue The major stakeholders for net neutrality have been broken down into a few major categories. These categories include “ Broadband Internet Access Providers, users, platforms, content providers, device makers, and the government” (Buell, 2018). These groups have been defined and interviewed to create an understanding of what the United States should do with internet laws at this point. They also, had the various stakeholders hold a group discussion where the topics included defining the principles of an open internet, net neutrality, management for net neutrality, and who should ensure net neutrality should be upheld. This group would able to come to an understanding about the definition of net neutrality, but discussion truly opened when talking about the principles of what an open internet should be. Also, this group was able to accept either the FCC or the FTC as the organization to uphold net neutrality. The impact of the repeal has led to ISPs having the freedom to act unethically while making their businesses more profitable. ISPs are now able to be more competitive with one another because each service does not have to be held to the same standards. Various Viewpoints on Net Neutrality There are issues with both sides of net neutrality that need to be addressed. The repeal of net neutrality gives ISPs freedom to discriminate against certain traffic or protocols. This ultimately means that depending on who you are you may have your traffic filtered, throttled, and hindered, while the ISP may show preferential treatment to someone else. It is safe to assume that all companies are not looking to discriminate heavily against their consumers, but there are examples of some companies behaving unethically with their services. The other side of the argument is that the repeal of net neutrality ensures that the market will be protected and that it is more profitable for ISPs to take this approach. Also, ISPs insist that the current tiered options for networks will lead to better speeds and connections for everyone in the long run. There are pros and cons to each side, but it is becoming increasingly difficult for the U.S. to come to an agreement on the subject. Importance of Net Neutrality in IT This is important for IT due to the potential of having a company’s bandwidth throttled down by their ISP. Also, there are is the potential for ISPs to show favoritism to some of the companies depending on their relationships with each other. An example of this would be when Netflix had their data throttled by Comcast throughout recent years. When data slows down and their service is becoming worse due to an ISP throttling them, I imagine that the IT department for Netflix had to find a solution quickly to resolve their issues. Net neutrality would be nice to have for any IT department because that would ensure that their data and bandwidth should perform consistently across businesses. Ideal Outcome Regarding Net Neutrality The ideal outcome for net neutrality is dependent on who you are in the situation. Those with home networks generally would rather net neutrality be a thing since that will guarantee equal and fair bandwidth across the United States. Generally, most people would agree that the internet should be this way and that encouraging net neutrality is an ethically correct thing to do. However, if you are someone in the business of telecommunications, you would probably prefer that net neutrality stays repealed. This is due to their businesses being more profitable, competitive, and marketable with net neutrality gone. Summary and Conclusion Net neutrality has been a topic heavily debated over in recent years. In general, the public is in support of net neutrality as they have a right to desire equal and fair bandwidths for the internet. With the repeal of net neutrality, telecommunication businesses have become more profitable to the detriment of their consumers. Consumers now have options to pay different prices for tiered services, but ISPs still hold all the power over their product's performance. The repeal of net neutrality has led to an outcry by many Americans, but they have not been able to get net neutrality reinstated. As time goes on more people are becoming aware of what is happening with the situation which may lead to different internet laws in the future."

3,List Out The 5 Benefits of CCTV Cameras,computers-technology," Taking care of our belongingness is a highly sensitive matter, and technology has made it easier to deal with it efficiently. As the illicit activities are growing, technology is providing the proper gear to deal with it. Gone are the days when hiring a watchman was a requirement to look after the buildings-homes and workplaces. Now, we have the technology that has substituted many jobs and job operators. It has held multiple tasks in its hands. CCTV cameras, for example, are one of the best inventions. Modern CCTV cameras are not merely watchdogs but the enhanced integrated system provides extensive benefits. Some of The Benefits of CCTV Cameras: 1- Protects Against Burglary: One of the biggest benefits of a CCTV camera is related to the security it offers. The advanced features of the CCTV camera offer to deter a burglary by directly daunting a thief. First of all, a thief will not try to enter a premise that has CCTV cameras, but if he does, a CCTV camera has its functions enabled to resist the intrusion. Face recognition and two-way audio system are some of the two features which help the user to stop the intruder right away. The face recognition is a system in which a CCTV camera checks the face of the person asking the access. If the face does not match the verified ones, it will abandon the access. The two-way audio is another feature that connects CCTV camera to the mic of the user at one end and to the speaker in the sensitive premises at the other end. This provides the audio access along with the visual access to the user. In case of an intruder trying to intrude the sensitive location can be rebuked. 2- Keeps The Records: Another immense benefit of a CCTV camera is that it not only keeps its eye on sensitive actions but records them. In this way, it provides evidence to the user and police if, unfortunately, a burglar succeeds to encroach. It provides sufficient data to find the culprit behind it. A CCTV camera, therefore, helps aptly to solve a criminal action. But, it is always significant to have a properly working CCTV camera which has enough storage. 3- Instant Notification of a Suspicious Movement: You might not know, but the cameras also have the feature of instantly providing notifications to the user. It allows the user the immediate access and action taking authority. When a person asks for access through a smart door, the camera sends the notification to the user to grant him access or not. Also, the highly susceptible sensors attached to the CCTV cameras can sense suspicious movement. These cause the CCTV cameras to set off an alarm or notification through the internet. It is of great advantage to priorly know about any suspicious act of intruder. 4- Cost-effective: By looking at the advance features, you may think that a CCTV system must be very costly. In fact, it is not. It is a highly cost-effective approach to get robust and advance security. Once you install the system, you will not have to pay lots for maintenance and repairs. You can find lots of CCTV systems for sale online and in markets near you. 5- Tranquility of Mind: Once you install a CCTV system, you get free of tension of protecting sensitive premises. You may not have to further stress over guarding the location. With a tap on your smartphone, you will access the place no matter wherever you are."

5,Not all charging cables are Equal . . . my near nightmare at LaGuardia,computers-technology," Remember the days of travel?  The days of flying the friendly skies . . . a time when our biggest worry was taking off our shoes and exposing our hole ridden socks. Those days will be upon us soon enough again and just the thought of it takes me reminiscing about the near nightmare I had at LaGuardia – the day. . .  my cell phone . . . wouldn’t charge!!!!! Yikes!  Yes! We have all had those days.  Either our cell didn’t charge or charged so slowly that we felt we would not only miss our flight but more importantly our much needed call with our job or significant other.  Just thinking about this makes me squeamish and wishing that wireless charging areas were everywhere.  But let’s face it, not all wireless charging areas work at the same peak efficiency and there are times when we will need to be tethered to an outlet just to find that our charger is a dud. And, when those times hit us, we need to be ready. Ready? OK so here is the scoop.  Not all charging cables are equal. True! And unfortunately, something I found out at the airport when my cell seemed to be stuck forever on one bar.  No matter how much I watched it charge I couldn’t help but feel like the kid in school waiting for the second hand to reach the moment when class was finally out only to realize that Einstein was right that time was an illusion . . . an illusion that made time appear to stand still. Listen, don’t be fooled, like I was, into thinking your $1000 cell phone is going to have the best charger in the marketplace or even that it is the best charger for your phone.  All chargers are designed to do the same work but either due to time or other issues they fail to equally measure up with each other resulting in us using some cables that keep us disconnected.  ☹ But now! Now there is hope!  And it comes from the Crisoft – the company that stands by their vision to develop new solutions, that will make this world a better place to live, one app at a time.  And the hope is called Amperes. Wait a second.  Amperes isn’t new.  Amperes is the app that a stranger at the airport told me about and kept my airport experience from spiraling into an abyss. But you haven’t heard of Amperes?  Well, it is the ultimate battery and charger testing app that helps you find bad charges and cables, check wired and wireless chargers and provides other system information.  Pretty cool huh? You know back in 2016 Apple removed all access to the battery and charging information.  Once useful apps that were showing this info before, became useless and stopped working.  But Crisoft, with their app Amperes, found a way to get this information and released the first app in the world, THE WORLD, that could gather this data and show it to the users.  There is so much this app can do, and all the particulars are listed down below. But keep your eyes up here for now because I will let you in on the secret – the BIG SECRET of what is new.  NEW I tell you! Now Amperes allows users, through their new portal, to compare their test scores with other users of the same device type globally. That’s right – now you can see how your charger measures up. I personally love this app.  The developers of it are always responsive to the needs of their users and updating it to keep ahead of the curve.  This is just one reason why there have been other companies who have tried to do what Amperes does but they have failed. Never look for an imitation when you can have the real thing for just $1.99 – that’s it!  $1.99 for a lifetime investment, or as long as the world has cell phones that need charging.  Purchase and Download from the App Store  But hey why take my word for it.  Read below about some of the particulars and how you can secure your own app. Language Support: Amperes supports English, Afrikaans, Arabic, Armenian, Catalan, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, Georgian, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Mongolian, Norwegian Bokml, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Traditional Chinese, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese languages. Device Requirements: iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch Requires iOS 10.3 or later 36.1 MB Pricing and Availability: Amperes 4.0.13 is only $1.99 USD (or equivalent amount in other currencies) and available worldwide exclusively through the App Store in the Utilities category. Promo codes are available to members of the press. For more information, please contact Andrey Krasnov. CrioSoft is a developer and publisher of business and entertainment software.

6,Link Building: How To Rank Above Competitors On Google In 2021,computers-technology," To rank above your competitors your website needs to establish more authority than others. This can be done by receiving inbound links from authoritative websites, building up your brand awareness and remaining close to your audience. This article is all about building high-quality links and improving your domain authority. Don’t take our word for the importance of building links, Google has confirmed it. They have stated that quality content and backlinks are two of the three most important SEO factors they look at when deciding where to rank a website. As a rule of thumb, you are very likely to find spammy websites link to other spammy websites, while trustworthy sites link to other trustworthy sites. So, for your website to look trustworthy, you need to go on the hunt for trustworthy websites and attain a backlink from them. This article is going to answer the following questions: What is a backlink? How do you get other websites to backlink to your website? Let’s start by breaking it down. What is a backlink? Backlinks, also referred to as ‘external links’ or ‘inbound links’, are hyperlinks made up of HTML that point to one website from another. Having a lot of backlinks is a lot like having a good reputation. Imagine if you went on a holiday to Rome and bumped in to three people, all unrelated, and you asked them where the best restaurant is for pasta, and they all came out with “Luigi’s near Vatican City”, you would most likely feel confident that Luigi’s is the best place to eat some authentic Italian pasta. Backlinks have the same effect for search engines. Internal links We touched on internal links earlier on in the course, but we thought we would just recap for this next part. Internal links are used to connect pages on the same website. A substantial amount of internal links pointing to a certain page on your site will give Google a signal that the page you’re pointing to is important and they should look at it. This concept can be applied to the use of backlinks and as long as its not done in a spammy way, can be very effective in the quest for higher search rankings. E-A-T If you’re familiar with Google’s Search Quality Rater Guidelines, then you will know that they have highlighted great importance in the concept of E-A-T. This stands for Expert, Authoritative and Trustworthy and if you receive a low score in any of these then you can bet that your rankings will reflect it. You see, websites that don’t work on these characteristics will be seen as low-quality and as a result, search engines will not be favourable towards them. This acronym should be considered as the magic formula and the secret to future-proofing your website. By following these guidelines, you will be providing excellent value to your visitors and that is just the thing that Google is looking for. Links directing towards your website The higher importance and popularity of a website, the larger the weight that come from the links on that website. An example would be Wikipedia. They have quite literally thousands of diverse sites or all shapes and sizes directly linking to it. This shows search engines that they have a lot of expertise, cultivated authority and is a trusted site. If you want to increase your website authority then you will need to receive backlinks from trustworthy websites, the ones that demonstrate the qualities of E-A-T. Don’t worry, you don’t need to chase sites as large as Wikipedia, but they must provide searchers with useful content. Follow or nofollow Backlinks should be considered as votes. The rel=nofollow code enables you to directly link to a resource while at the same time removing your “vote” for search engine purposes. As the name very much suggests, a “nofollow” link tells a search engine not to follow it. This type of link does not pass link equity but can be useful when linking to a web page that is untrustworthy or has a low authority score. An example would be if you decided to write an article about fire safety in the workplace and add links to some of the resources you used. If one of the source websites was untrustworthy you can provide Google with a signal to tell it that you don’t trust it. Remember spammy sites link to spammy sites so you need to make sure that Google doesn’t see you in that light. You should aim for a natural balance between follow and nofollow backlinks to your website. Here are some benefits and examples of both types: Follow Backlinks – These types of links will pass on link equity which will allow your page authority to grow. An example of a follow backlink would be if you have written an article about baking a sponge cake and allow another website to publish on their page in return for credit. This is where there would create a HTML code linking directly back to your website. Nofollow Backlinks – Even though these types of links don’t benefit your page authority, they can still increase website traffic. An example of a nofollow backlink would be a user comment on a blog post of someone else’s website. If your comment is engaging, informative and adds value, then it is likely that other visitors will click through to your website. It is important to note that one of the most popular places to gain backlinks from is website directories. Whilst this may seem like an easy win, they are more often than not, nofollow backlinks and will not count towards your domain authority. Backlink profile The phrase ‘backlink profile’ refers to the total number of links directing towards your website, the quality of them, the diversity, and many other factors. A search engine will read and assess your backlink profile to understand the quality of your site. The backlink profile of all websites is a major SEO factor and something that needs to be monitored. There are hundreds of free tools out there that can dissect your backlink profile, but our favourite and one of the most popular across the web is ‘Ahrefs Backlink Checker’. There is a free version and a paid version available at a small cost. The free version gives a breakdown of the links a website has, as well as identifying the domain authority score. The importance of a healthy backlink profile When backlinks first became a deciding SEO factor for search engines, people immediately began manipulating the algorithm for their own benefit. There were and still are several ways to gain artificial backlinks to improve search engine rankings. Although this is an easy solution, it goes against Google’s Terms of Service and can result in huge penalties and even having a website deindexed which basically says game over. Don’t cut corners to get to the finish line faster, build and maintain a healthy backlink profile and futureproof your business. The importance of a healthy backlink profile comes down to the way a search engine views your website. If they can see you have high-quality, natural backlinks and have built up your page authority fairly, then they will reward you. Editorial backlinks What is an editorial backlink and why are they important? These types of backlinks are created naturally by other websites that want to link to your website. By supplying publishing websites high-quality content that they want to post on their sites, you are able to gain high-quality backlinks. Don’t think that if you string a few sentences together about driving laws, then send it to an online motoring magazine that they will publish it and you will receive a backlink. Your content must be the best and most interesting resource they have read about a particular topic. These types of links are our favourite because they require no major work from you except the time put in to creating a piece of high-quality content. Stick to what you know, write about things you’re passionate about and have fun! If you’re having fun when you’re writing, it will show through in your content and hold readers attention for longer. Relevant backlinks When creating a backlink profile, it is important to stay relative to your niche. For example, if you sell used cars, a backlink from an online motoring publication will matter a lot more than a backlink from a wedding photography website. As well as the odds of you finding more customers on websites relevant to your business, it is worth noting that search engines can get confused if you have a wide variety of backlinks that cover alternative topics. Keep it relevant! Don’t get spammy As you already know, Google doesn’t like to be manipulated so it dishes out heavy penalties to those they believe are spammy websites. One major element that SEO’s get wrong is anchor text. Using anchor text is a fantastic way to tell search engines what a page is about. However, too many backlinks with the same anchor text will indicate to search engines that you’re trying to manipulate your websites search engine rankings. Proceed with caution and maintain the quality of your content. A great analogy to get your head around this concept is to imagine that you met up with five different friends, at different times of the same day and asked what they have been up to that day. This is the exact response from each one: “I began my day with a bowl of Shreddies followed by a walk on the beach with my dog, Todd. When I got back, I cooked myself a sirloin steak and asparagus.” How weird would that be and how suspicious does it sound? It is the same principle for Google. Using anchor text to describe the content of the target page is an excellent way to support a search engine to understand what your page is about. Too many of the same description though, well that will just look suspicious and it could be considered as spam. Qualified website traffic Although a healthy backlink profile is primary built for search engines, it is important to remember that you should focus on acquiring links that will bring qualified traffic to your website. If you are selling dog collars online, build links that come from dog-related websites such as puppy training or dog grooming forums. These types of websites will have an audience that will find value in your content and products. Methods to avoid There are a few link building methods that are still very popular in this day and age but involve unnatural, sneaky methods that search engines are cracking down on. One method to avoid is buying links or engaging in a link building exchange programme where you add multiple backlinks to your website in exchange for backlinks from a variety of other websites. It might seem like there’s nothing bad in doing this, but they are not natural, and you can receive a penalty. A rule of thumb is to never try and manipulate a website ranking. Build links naturally and watch your website grow. Top 3 things to avoid in link building Buying links – Even though a search engine cannot identify the exact links that a website purchases, there are some signs that their robots can identify. Buying backlinks will only end one way, a severe penalty, and a significant drop in search engine rankings. Exchanging links – Have you received one of those emails or messages on social media that reads something like “I will link my website to you if you link your website to me”. Now this can be a bit of a grey area so pay attention. It is perfectly fine to link to a partner website or a supplier that you use or even a customer. What Google doesn’t like however, is excessive link exchanging that occurs on a mass scale with unaffiliated websites. This method will result in a penalty. Directory links – In the early days you could sit at your desk for a few weeks and add your website to every online directory imaginable. These days they don’t count for an awful lot because they are so easy to acquire. That being said, people still use online directories and there can be opportunities to receive additional traffic that you may never have received. Whichever way you look at it, using a directory to receive a backlink is classed as manipulation and if your entire backlink profile consists of only directories, then your website will look spammy. 8 steps to success We have covered a lot of the methods to avoid in this section, but it is worth noting the steps to success in link building. Here are the 8 most important points to think about when building your link profile: Earn – Write informative, high-quality content and earn backlinks from other websites using editorials. Authority – Forget about the low-authority pages, they won’t help. The real results will come from pages with a high domain authority. Progress – You link profile should gradually increase over time. Don’t build 1,000 links in a few days because it will look spammy. Relevance – Build backlinks from websites that are relevant to yours or your niche. Anchor – Make use of anchor text, make it relevant to what your pages are about but don’t overuse them. Qualified – Bring qualified traffic to your website that show an active interest in your product or services. Mix – Build a healthy mix of follow and nofollow links. Natural – Earn links naturally and don’t try to run before you can walk. Building high-quality backlinks Link building comes in many forms and it is important to get a good mix of high-quality backlinks from a range of sources. The following part of this section goes a bit deeper into the best methods for acquiring high-quality links. Partner links An easy one to kick things off – partner links. Make a list of all your partners and reach out to them to see if you can place your logo or domain name on their website. A great way to do this is by creating a digital ‘partnership badge’ that you can both put on your websites as a sign of a strong, mutual relationship. Blog links If you don’t have a blog already, you need to build one. It is a well-known fact that blog posts are personally recommended by the engineers at Google as part of link building strategies. Blogs have an unrivalled ability to publish consistent and new content while all the time linking back to different web pages. They have a very high conversion rate in search engine results because of how specific they are to search queries. Be careful when commenting on other blogs, however. Even though you will receive a nofollow link back from that page, they are considered low-quality due to the nature in which they can be acquired. Unique resources A unique resource is not easy to create during the age that we live it. Often it feels as if everything has already been done but if you can create a unique, high-quality resource then you are on to a winner. It helps if your resource is visually appealing, addresses a timely interest, is new and elicits strong emotions. It is also worth making it specific to a location. The idea is to share your resource with as many publishers that you can reach out to with a view of them linking back to your web page. Make sure you keep it specific and target websites that have a similar audience to your own. Community engagement There are loads of ways to get involved with the local community and gain valuable backlinks to your website. The community doesn’t necessarily have to mean the local under 11’s football club, it can be a wide range of genres, clubs and educational programmes. Here are some ideas to get your creative juices flowing: Sponsor a local club or organisation. It is common practice for a club to put a logo of their sponsor on their website along with a backlink. Host an event or workshop that engages the community. Ask them to write about it on their own personal or business blogs. Donate to local causes and charities. Attempt to create working partnerships with the charities. Loyalty programmes can help increase your brand awareness within a local area. Run a local competition and offer discounted entry to anyone that shares it on to their own web page along with a link. Team up with other like-minded local business owners to create an organisation that helps your local community. All of these points are authentic and natural strategies to gain backlinks for your website. It will also paint a positive picture of your business and support brand awareness. Re-write content Your back-end platform should provide you with the statistics for your web pages so you can see which ones are most popular and has the highest conversion rate. It is important to keep the content on these pages fresh and updated. You might one day discover that a few websites within your niche all link towards a resource website whose content is out of date. Well here lies your opportunity to approach those websites and offer to link to your website instead. Remember, they want to provide the best experience for their own customers and will only want to link to the best content. Make sure yours is the best they have read, and you will most likely receive a new backlink for your efforts. Stay up to date There are always new topics, stories and controversial opinions that will increase engagement on your website. Be newsworthy and relevant to the world around you. Remember that the human race is naturally nosey, and you can use that to your advantage when coming up with new content to publish. Measuring results Hopefully, you have now gained some valuable insights into how important links are and how to build a high-quality backlink profile. What good is this knowledge if you can’t measure the results and understand what works and what doesn’t. This part of the course is going to guide you on how to track your performance. Quantity The most accurate way to track and understand how effective your link building has been is to count the number of total links to your page or website. There are plenty of tools online that can help you achieve this. One of our most favourite is Moz’s Link Explorer. By using tools like this you can see if the number of backlinks directing to your website is as high as you planned. You’ll be able to cross reference each page of content to understand what works and what doesn’t. This process is all about learning and there are a few questions you need to ask at the same time. One of the most popular reasons why link building efforts weren’t as effective as people thought they would be is because the content simply wasn’t as valuable as other web pages. Revisit the content, understand what others are doing well and create something even better. Please don’t expect people to find your content and immediately want to link to it. Send emails, promote it on social media and speak with your existing contacts to showcase your work and drum up some excitement. It is even worth using your most popular web pages to link to your new content. By using SERP analysis tools just like Keyword Explorer from Moz, you will be able to view a report that outlines who is ranking for particular search terms and how many links you have. This is so useful when coming up with a link building strategy because you can see in black and white how many links you need to be visible at the top of search engine results. Remember that its quality over quantity and even though other pages might have hundreds of links, if you can get a handful of high-quality links, you will be in the driving position. One link from a website with a high domain authority is a lot more valuable than twenty from directories, blog comments and other low-quality sites. Growing domain authority This section has already explained that building high-quality links with the ‘follow’ tag will, over time, improve your domain authority. There are other ways in which you can gain more page authority. Social media, the one industry that goes from strength to strength and something that has become part of our every day lives. It is also a great place to share your valuable content and make your audience aware of what you’re doing. This will encourage them to amplify that awareness to their own networks by sharing posts. Although you can share links on to social media, they are not categorised as backlinks so has no direct impact on your SEO score. Social media platforms do have their uses: Shares can directly increase website traffic and visitors. Attract a brand-new audience. Grow brand-awareness. Increase trust in a brand. Increase links from other websites. Website visitors may find you through social media and as a result they may link back to your website because the content is such a high quality. Be trustworthy Search engines are all about the user experience, so they want to put the websites they trust most, in front of their audience. Trust is mostly determined by the number, and quality of backlinks a website has. There are some other determining factors that are considered by search engines: Helpfulness – Does a website provide the answer to a query? Integrity – Are they honest and do what they say they can do? Language – Are they able to communicate their message clearly? Value – Are they focused on providing value to visitors? Quality – Is the quality of the product or services better than others? Reviews – Do people have good things to say about them? The final point in this list is often overlooked but it happens to be extremely important to a business’s reputation. In a generation of total transparency and the ability to dig up dirt on anyone, negative reviews can ruin a business. The goal is to always provide excellent customer service or sell a product that is of the best quality but sometimes things are out of our control and we face a backlash. Some things to consider when looking after your online reputation: Don’t review your own business or ask your staff to do it. Don’t offer incentives or rewards in exchange for positive reviews. Don’t pay an agency to leave positive reviews about your business. Don’t leave reviews for customers. Don’t write negative reviews about competitors. Don’t ask customers who are inside your building to leave a review. It can be assumed that a business is spamming if multiple reviews come from the same IP address. Don’t forget to read the terms and conditions of any review platforms that you sign up to. Although leaving a fake review might seem harmless, it is actually a major problem that’s taken on global proportions. It is in violation of government advertising guidelines and if found guilty can be punishable with heavy fines. Fake reviews really aren’t worth it so don’t be tempted. So how do you improve your online reputation? The simple answer is to provide exceptional customer service. Using a combination of exceptional customer service and following search engine guidelines you are creating a winning formula for building domain authority and trust. Final words Domain authority is built when businesses share great content, earn reputable backlinks, and make customers happy. If you can tick all of these boxes you are on the road to SEO success."
7,What is Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy?,computers-technology," Confocal fluorescence microscopy is a customarily utilized optical imaging technique in science, joining fluorescence imaging with confocal microscopy for expanded visual goals. This article will examine fluorescence and confocal microscopes' standards and depict fluorophore determination and test arrangement phases. What is fluorescence? Fluorescence is the cycle by which a photon is consumed, and another of marginally lower energy, and along these lines, more extended frequency, is this way discharged. Under ordinary conditions, the electrons of a fluorophore (an atom fit for fluorescence) are in a low-energy ground state. When energized by communication with an occurrence, a photon might be elevated to a higher energy level. Some energy is believed to be devoured by non-radioactive rot measures, and the distinction in life between the occurrence and discharged photon is known as Stokes move. As the framework unwinds vibrationally, the ground state's electron re-visitations deliver the leftover distinction between the electron energy levels similar to a photon. By and large, the rot rate follows first-request energy, with most regularly utilized fluorophores radiating inside nanoseconds. Numerous normally happening mixes are characteristically fluorescent, and a massive library of extra extraordinarily designed fluorophores is an inconsistent turn of events. Most of the time, natural fluorophores contain a few twofold bonds and polyaromatic structures that give delocalized electrons all through the particles, equipped for excitation. In useful application, fluorophores are chosen by the ideal excitation and discharge frequencies, the power of backed light (quantum yield), and fluorescence time. Different contemplations that may support a specific fluorophore over another incorporate the atomic weight, as bigger particles might be sterically thwarted in particular applications—the presence of other fluorophores that may give covering signals explicitness of the fluorescent mark. Atomic ""lock and key"" instruments can be abused to guarantee that fluorophores bond with interest structures, possibly just actuating or deactivating once in position. Antibodies structure-specific bonds with their objective construction and are now and again connected to fluorophores to follow the objective's number and circulation in situ. All the more, as of late, peptide and corrosive nucleic successions have been utilized to comparative impact in distinguishing cell segments. What is confocal microscopy? In confocal microscopy, a laser bar is centered on a particular profundity inside an example. Like conventional light microscopes, any reflected or produced satisfactorily situated microscope distinguishes light. The undesirable visual clamor from the example, other than light from the spot in concentration with the laser, is discarded from the last picture by utilizing a pinhole opening that forestalls light dispersed from higher points from going through. The pinhole is set along a similar plane as the example to guarantee that lone photons voyaging straightforwardly from the guide to the microscope are recognized. It is supposed to be in a central form plane, thus the portmanteau ""confocal."" Contingent upon the example's straightforwardness and the frequency of energizing light, samples can be imaged to a profundity of two or three hundred micrometers. Kept up looking over some time gives time-passed pictures that permit researchers to notice the elements of labeled particles or designs over the long haul. The laser used in confocal microscopy, other than enlightening a little segment of the example, can instead be utilized to energize fluorophores, hugely improving the affectability of location and sign-to-commotion proportion contrasted and mirrored light from the model alone. Moreover, laser light's essentially lower forces might be utilized to acquire a good sign, diminishing the dangers to the example related to photon barrage. Other sub-sorts of the confocal microscope are accessible, contingent upon the application, restricting openness to photons and improving the assortment season of pictures by utilizing a cut or turning circle instead of a pinhole. Notwithstanding, the accessibility and variety of laser types obliged by laser examining confocal microscopy imply that it stays the most famous choice. How are tests arranged for confocal fluorescence microscopy? As talked about, fluorophores are chosen for similarity with the example under scrutiny and good unearthly properties. The extraordinary affectability of fluorescent tests implies that lone a nearly modest number need be available in the model to accomplish a good sign. Over-or under-populating an example with fluorophores can be disadvantageous, creating a boisterous sign or deficient primary clarification. Thus while choosing a fitting fixation, it should be handled with care. The rehashed initiation of fluorophores ultimately prompts a wonder known as photo bleaching, leaving the particle altogether incapable of fluorescing. In time-delicate investigations, this should be represented, as the quantity of radiated photons will decrease following rehashed episodes of excitation. Tests now and again go through obsession before microscopy to deliberately safeguard the underlying highlights of the piece. Formaldehyde has truly been utilized for this reason, quickly entering cell layers and shaping disulfide spans between cysteine deposits in proteins, saving even the delicate primary subtleties of antigen destinations. In situations where proteins need not be protected, while inspecting little atoms' quality, liquor obsession at low temperatures may be utilized. The cells are presented to mellow cleansers to guarantee the specialist's total infiltration, expanding the cell layer's porousness. Antibodies are the most widely recognized, focusing on fluorescent naming specialists because of their flexibility and particularity. Explicitness can be improved further by a cycle known as obstructing, flooding the example with a protein mixed drink that involves vague restricting locales and debilitates the protein-crosslinking capacity of any leftover formaldehyde. Following every one of these means, the essential counteracting agent connected fluorophore can be added. Sometimes, extra counter stains might be incorporated to decrease foundation fluorescence. By definition, obsession is unacceptable in unique microscopy applications that mean noticing the cell or tissue's capacity after some time. Live-cell imaging raises a few issues concerning keeping fitting cell conditions inside the entire microscopy chamber, including temperature, environmental synthesis of CO2 and stickiness, and the cell culture medium's pH and substance. Little vacillations in temperature can cause centering the laser and microscope because of changes in the material's refractive file—consistent dissipation from the cell culture jar fuels this issue. life sciences consulting"

10,Why it is important to install Access control system at your business,computers-technology," For many years the primary function of the access control system has been controlling, allowing, and restricting access to doors, areas, and points of entrance and egress. Recently the Access Control System has become much more than that. Nowadays, an access control system is becoming much more than a door card reader, locking hardware and keys. Not only does it involve securing openings in all manner of new technologies, but it also includes optimizing a variety of facility functions. Today, the access control system is a multi-dimensional system that can address a full spectrum of operational and physical security needs. What Is an Access Control System and How Does It Work? An access control system allows or restricts access to a building, area or a room, or another designated area within a building or business. It is an electronically powered security system that manages who has access to a location at a particular time and date. An employee who wants to enter an access-controlled door or location presents their credentials in a form of a key card, key fob or, in some cases even a mobile device. An employee makes a request to unlock the door at a card reader, which then sends the information to an Access Control System motherboard then the system either authorizes the user and triggers the door to unlock or denies the request if the employee or user does not have proper credentials to access the area. On the administrative end, an access control system has a management interface or web-based portal. The interface or web portal allows dedicated access control system administrators, IT person, or security personnel to specify who can access the building and under what condition. The access control system manager or administrator can create a setup and schedule based on time of day, shift schedule, job title, and more. The access control system consists of electric locks and door strikes, card readers, door status for monitoring traffic, and request to exit devices. All of those devices are reporting to the main control panel (motherboard) and then the server if necessary. Here is the breakdown of the main components of an access control system: Electric door locks (electric door strikes): Device, which will lock the door if supplied with power, and fail-secure locks, which will unlock when supplied with power. Fail-safe locks are necessary for doors on fire escape routes and fail-secure doors are for rooms that need to be protected in the event of a power outage, such as a Network room. Fail secure doors will still need push bars to be installed to allow people to exit but not reenter the building or area in the case of an emergency. Access control panel: The control panel is usually set up in a secure location, such as an IT office, Network room, or an electrical closet. Whenever an employee’s credentials are scanned on the card reader, the signal is sent to this control panel, which then sends the authorization to unlock the door. The access control server: The server stores the access control system’s data and schedules. This system decides to unlock a door for a specific user and tracks data. Servers can exist on a dedicated computer, a cloud-based service, or in the card reader itself. The access control system can serve interior and exterior access points as needed for your business.  Managers can provide access to specific areas for individual employees during certain hours or conditions. Therefore, select areas can be restricted to management only, even if non-management personnel present in the building. Limiting access to parts of a business can be effective in reducing employee theft. As well, access can be restricted to specific days or hours for your business needs. For example, a manufacturing facility can allow certain groups to access the building only during regular business hours. All-access points are typically managed by IT personnel or dedicated access control system administrator and can be changed and updated quickly. As a result, all use of the access points can be viewed in a report, or notifications can be set up so that management or operations can be alerted when certain access points are triggered. Access control system eliminate the need for keys. When using an RFID system, employees or members are simply granted access via a fob, PIN code, or card. Employees can be deleted out of the system, which will deny access. Furthermore, lost cards and fobs can be programmed out. Rental groups who are in arrears can be programmed out. Although Access Control systems are sophisticated and somewhat costly, the benefits are numerous. Another benefit is that access control can be limited to only the most critical access points to minimize costs.

19,The privacy-first browser that doesn't track you,computers-technology," Surfing the internet is something most of us take for granted, and many of us cannot imagine being without. But the ubiquity of the internet, on not only our computers, but also our smartphones and other devices, has also opened up a new wave of surveillance. The internet is rife with valuable information that governments and companies want to get hold of to know more about their citizens and people. At the same time, cybercriminals and state sponsored hackers are out in force to steal and misappropriate your data. Just like the real world, the internet can be a dangerous place with threats both seen and unseen. Thus, online privacy has become one of the biggest concerns of the generation, and it all starts with the browser you use. All of the popular web browsers are notorious for tracking online activities and sending things like usage data and even personal information to major online advertisers. Search engines and social media are notorious for using this data to learn intimate details about their users. While new regulations like Europe's GDPR and California's CCPA have been introduced to give users more control over their data, they can only do so much. You also need to choose the tools you use carefully, and that includes the web browser you use. After all, for most people, the web browser is the app they use most, both on their desktops and mobile devices. For advertisers and governments alike, they provide a proverbial treasure trove of insights into people's personal lives. It's time for that to change, which is why Maiar has developed a privacy-first browser where online privacy isn't just considered nice to have, but a fundamental human right. It provides full control and transparency over your data, giving you the chance to choose who you give it to. It does not try to force you to use a search engine that tracks and records all of your personal and user data. Instead, it provides a secure search function with native integration with the increasingly popular DuckDuckGo search engine. It also blocks ads by default, though you have the opportunity to unblock them whenever you want. Aside from removing annoying and intrusive ads from your browsing experience, it blocks trackers that follow you around the web. For the sake of convenience, the desktop version of Maiar supports almost all Google Chrome extensions available through the Chrome web store. That way, you can use a variety of popular extra functions and enjoy seamless interoperability with the world's most popular browser without sacrificing your privacy to do so. Maiar also locally stores and synchronizes with your other devices while keeping your data in your hands. The iOS version also generates two-step verification codes directly in your browser to provide you an extra layer of security. Finally, the built-in password manager lets you autofill passwords in websites you visit regularly, so there's no need to worry about your online privacy getting in the way of productivity and convenience. The Maiar Browser has recently been updated to version 81.0.1.656 with the new Brave 1.9.68 Brave rendering engine. It is based on the popular open-source Chromium browser version 81.0.4044.138.

20,Boost productivity with a free password manager for Windows,computers-technology," The average internet user has almost a hundred online accounts, and all of them need their own set of login credentials to ensure maximum security of your information. This is for certain one of the major reasons why so many people have developed poor password habits. For the sake of convenience, a lot of people reuse the same passwords and answers to secret questions for all their online accounts. With password overload being a real problem, it is easier than ever to end up leaving your accounts vulnerable. After all, when you use the same set of login credentials on all your online accounts, you end up with many single points of failure that could give an attacker access to everything. Thus, reusing passwords should be avoided, as should choosing ones that are easy to remember and, as a consequence, easier for attackers to guess or crack with a brute-force hack. Cyclonis Password Manager for Windows provides a safe and simple solution for overcoming the problem of password overload without leaving you open to a greater risk of a security breach. Almost every computer user knows the annoyance of forgetting about their login details, especially if they are accessing an account that has been dormant for some time. Moreover, if you enter the wrong login information too many times, you may get locked out of the account, which can be a serious problem for everyday things like online bank accounts or email accounts. Sometimes, you can be locked out permanently if you enter the wrong password details. This is commonly the case with cryptocurrency wallets, which are not mediated by any third party organization. As such, losing access to the account can mean permanently losing your money too! These are some of the problems that Cyclonis Password Manager for Windows can help solve. It is a completely free password manager that stores all your passwords and login information in a secure encrypted repository.

1,Deep Learning vs Machine Learning,computers-technology," Machine learning and deep learning are two subsets of artificial intelligence which have garnered a lot of attention over the past two years. If you’re here looking to understand both the terms in the simplest way possible, there’s no better place to be. So if you’ll stick with me for some time, I’ll try to explain what really is the difference between deep learning vs machine learning, and how can you leverage these two subsets of AI for new and exciting business opportunities. Deep learning vs Machine learning Before I start, I hope you would be familiar with a basic understanding of what both the terms deep learning and machine learning mean. Machine Learning for dummies: A subset of artificial intelligence involved with the creation of algorithms which can modify itself without human intervention to produce desired output- by feeding itself through structured data. Deep Learning for dummies: A subset of machine learning where algorithms are created and function similar to those in machine learning, but there are numerous layers of these algorithms- each providing a different interpretation to the data it feeds on. Such a network of algorithms are called artificial neural networks, being named so as their functioning is an inspiration, or you may say; an attempt at imitating the function of the human neural networks present in the brain. I tried to put those definitions in the simplest way possible, but even if it didn’t help you make out any differences, here’s an example that will. Image via: https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/dogs-vs-cats-image-classification-with-deep-learning-using Here is a collection of images of dogs and cats. What happens when machine learning and deep learning networks have to make some sense out of it? Have a look at the image above. What you’ll see is a collection of pictures of cats and dogs. Now, let’s say that you want to identify the images of dogs and cats separately with the help of machine learning algorithms and deep learning networks. Deep learning vs machine learning basics - When this problem is solved through machine learning To help the ML algorithm categorize the images in the collection according to the two categories of dogs and cats, you will need to present to it these images collectively. But how does the algorithm know which one is which? The answer to this question, as in the above definition of machine learning for dummies, is structured data. You simply label the pictures of dogs and cats in a way which will define specific features of both the animals. This data will be enough for the machine learning algorithm to learn, and then it will continue working based on the labels that it understood, and classify millions of other pictures of both animals as per the features it learned through the said labels. When the problem is solved through deep learning: Deep learning networks would take a different approach to solve this problem. The main advantage of deep learning networks is that they do not necessarily need structured/labeled data of the pictures to classify the two animals. The artificial neural networks using deep learning send the input (the data of images) through different layers of the network, with each network hierarchically defining specific features of images. This is, in a way similar to how our human brain works to solve problems- by passing queries through various hierarchies of concepts and related questions to find an answer. After the data is processed through layers within deep neural networks, the system finds the appropriate identifiers for classifying both animals from their images. Note: This is just an example to help you understand the differences in the way how machine learning basics and deep learning networks work. Both deep learning and machine learning are not actually simultaneously applicable to most cases, including this one. The reason for the same will be explained later as you read. So in that example, we saw that a machine learning algorithm required labeled/structured data to understand the differences between images of cats and dogs, learn the classification and then produce output. On the other hand, a deep learning network was able to classify images of both the animals through the data processed within layers of the network. It didn’t require any labeled/structured data, as it relied on the different outputs processed by each layer which amalgamated to form a unified way of classifying the images. What have we learned here: The key difference between deep learning vs machine learning stems from the way data is presented to the system. Machine learning algorithms almost always require structured data, whereas deep learning networks rely on layers of the ANN (artificial neural networks). Machine learning algorithms are built to “learn” to do things by understanding labeled data, then use it to produce further outputs with more sets of data. However, they need to be retrained through human intervention when the actual output isn’t the desired one. Deep learning networks do not require human intervention as the nested layers in the neural networks put data through hierarchies of different concepts, which eventually learn through their own errors. However, even these are subject to flawed outputs if the quality of data isn’t good enough. Data is the governor here. It is the quality of data which ultimately determines the quality of the result. What we didn’t see in the example, but are important points to note: Since machine learning algorithms require labeled data, they aren’t suitable to solve complex queries which involve a huge amount of data. Though in this case, we saw the application of deep learning networks to solve a minor query such as this one. The real application of deep learning neural networks is on a much larger scale. In fact, considering the number of layers, hierarchies, and concepts that these networks process, they are only suited to perform complex calculations rather than simple ones. Both these subsets of AI revolve around data in order to actually deliver any form of “intelligence”. However, what should be known is that deep learning requires much more data than a traditional machine learning algorithm. The reason for this being that it is only able to identify edges (concepts, differences) within layers of neural networks when exposed to over a million data points. Machine learning algorithms, on the other hand, are able to learn through pre-programmed defined criteria. So with that example and subsequent explanation of deep learning vs machine learning basics, I hope you would have understood the differences between both of them. Since these are layman explanations, I try my best to not introduce technical terms which are mostly incomprehensible to those looking to leverage AI and machine learning development for their business. Now its time to hammer the final nail. When should you actually use Deep learning or machine learning in your business? When to use deep learning? If you’re a firm with boatloads of data to derive interpretations from. If you have to solve problems too complex for machine learning. If you can spend a lot of computational resources and expenses to drive hardware and software for training deep learning networks. When to use Machine learning development for your business? If you’ve data that can be structured and used to train machine learning algorithms. If you’re looking to leverage benefits to AI to surge ahead of the competition. The best machine learning solutions can help in the automation of various business operations, including identity verification, advertising, marketing, and information gathering and help leverage great opportunities for the future."
2,Powerful Keyloggers for Windows,computers-technology," Nowadays, only those who don't use computers have never heard of keyloggers. Initially developed as software for stealing passwords and other sensitive data, now keyloggers have turned into comprehensive tools for parental and employee monitoring or solutions for someone who wants to know how their computer is used in their absence. Yet, keyloggers remain half-illegal software. If you install one on your computer and warn all other users about the monitoring, it is alright. However, installing a keylogger on a computer that does not belong to you and without the owner's permission violates the person's right for privacy and may lead to legal penalties. Due to their ability to collect sensitive data, keyloggers are hunted by the antivirus and anti-keylogger software. Most powerful keyloggers can boast of algorithms able to bypass those, but in fact, these algorithms only make them the primary target for anti-spyware programs. Besides, most antiviruses may block any attempt to remotely install a keylogger. Antivirus programs are updated almost daily, and no by-pass algorithm can 100% guarantee that one day you won't find your keylogger blocked and deleted and valuable data lost to your unpleasant surprise. That is why adding your keylogger to exceptions and making sure that using it does not infringe anyone's privacy is crucial in employing this type of software. Below we present our overview of ten powerful keyloggers on the market today. Spyrix Free Keylogger Powerful. User-friendly. Free. All these are about Spyrix Free Keylogger. Even if you have never dealt with a keylogger, you will have no trouble installing and using the program at all. The program has a user-friendly interface and a convenient built-in log viewer where you can check all the logs in the chronological order or by category: screenshots, keystrokes, apps and user activity, printer tasks, removable drives activity, etc. More than that, Spyrix Free Keylogger will show a complete list of installed programs on the monitored computer, which allows more control over computer usage. Don't have daily access to the computer that you want to monitor? No problem, because Spyrix Free Keylogger has a remote monitoring feature. It delivers all logs to a secure online account where you can check all the logs just like you would on the target computer. More than that, there you can find comprehensive analytics of the activity, such as active and inactive time, mostly used apps and more. A cherry on top is live viewing of the screen of the monitored computer, so you can always know what the user is up to at the moment without a single glance at the logs. The online monitoring account also allows configuring all the settings or uninstalling the program remotely. Probably, you are already impressed by now but wait. Spyrix Free Keylogger is free unlike other programs with similar features in our list. Like free. Lifetime. This undeniable advantage brings Spyrix Free Keylogger to the top of our today's rating. Actual Keylogger Another powerful, yet user-friendly piece of software is Actual Keylogger. It tracks keystrokes, screenshots, visited webpages, printer tasks, running apps and much more. The program can also assess active and idle time and monitor the user's activity in social media and chats, which managers can find quite useful. Don't be afraid of getting lost in loads of collected information. Actual Keylogger presents the logs in the convenient chronological order and can filter them by type of activity (keystrokes, visited websites, etc) and time of the event.   Apart from a built-in log viewer, Actual Keylogger has other ways of log delivery, such as by email, FTP and others, which are rather useful when you do not have access to the monitored computer. Another feature that comes quite handy is the hidden mode. The program runs in the background and thus is not obvious for the user. Additionally, it is password-protected, so that you don't need to worry about unwanted access to the collected information. All In One Keylogger All In One Keylogger is indeed one of the most fully-featured keyloggers on the market today. It works as an invisible ninja, collecting keystrokes, screenshots, visited websites, sent and received messages in social media chats, printer tasks, change of files and folders directories and more. It can also block unwanted websites and applications, which is a huge plus for worried parents and employers striving for productivity. If the computer you are monitoring has a webcam, All In One Keylogger can use it to record sounds in the room or snap images, turning the computer into a simple security system. The program offers a variety of convenient ways of log delivery: by email, FTP, LAN or copying collected data to a USB drive. There is no need to worry about privacy, as the program is password protected and can encrypt collected logs. An additional advantage for system administrators is the one-click or pre-configured installation, which is a huge time-saver for large companies with extended staff. Total Logger Another comprehensive monitoring tool in our list is Total Logger. The program can boast of an impressive feature range: keystrokes logging, screenshots, file operations and visited websites tracking, monitoring chats in social media, sound and video recording from the user's webcam. You can build a pre-configured installer and deploy it to the target computer secretly. Checking the log is not a problem too, as the program delivers the log by email, FTP, Dropbox or LAN. Thus, you can get a complete picture of the user's activity without ever touching their computer with a single finger. Sounds wonderful, isn't it? NetBull Keylogger One of the unique features of NetBull Keylogger is its ability to recover user names and passwords stored in the most popular browsers. Apart from that, the program can secretly log everything that the user types: messages, emails; record texts copied to the clipboard, track programs and computer usage. NetBull by-passes firewalls and antiviruses and installs silently, after which it is invisible anywhere on the computer including Task Manager and the list of installed programs. If you need to stop monitoring, you can press a set hotkey and the program will be deleted, as simple as that. The app has a clear intuitive interface and a convenient built-in log viewer, but if you don't have access to the monitored computer every day, you can opt to receive logs by email or FTP. Perfect Keylogger Perfect Keylogger indeed meets its name by offering all the features that are expected of the software of the kind. The program has an invisible mode and is undetectable even in the Task Manager. Moreover, it can rename its executable files and registry entries for more stealth. Perfect Keylogger is easy to install and use, you can even create a pre-configured package and install it remotely and silently on the computer that you want to monitor. The software logs all keystrokes, including typed messages and passwords, and sends alerts if a certain unwanted word or phrase is typed. Webcam snapshots and screenshots are a great visual aid to text logs. Email and FTP log delivery come handy if you do not have constant access to the computer that you are monitoring. Perfect Keylogger can even compress and password-protect the log file for more privacy. HomeGuard Activity Monitor Initially designed for parental monitoring, HomeGuard Activity Monitor will yet be useful to anyone who wants to control the usage of their computer in their absence. The app can record keystrokes, take screenshots, monitor visited websites, printer tasks and USB connections as most of the modern keyloggers do. Besides, HomeGuard Activity Monitor has an advanced content filtering feature which allows blocking websites based on content, not only names. Other useful features are the restriction of the Internet, certain apps or computer usage and blocking certain Internet connections. You can also block deleting or moving specific files. These restrictions can be applied only to particular users of the computer and only at a determined time of the day, which allows you even more control over who and how uses your computer in your absence. Elite Keylogger for Windows Perhaps, the main advantage of Elite Keylogger is its invisibility. The program can hide itself from the lists of running processes, installed applications, the Start menu and anywhere else. Besides, Elite Keylogger employs several unique algorithms to avoid detection by antivirus and anti-keylogger software. However, the range of features of the program is somewhat limited in comparison with previous software on our list. Elite Keylogger offers a solid basic feature pack: keystrokes (including passwords) and the clipboard tracking, screenshots, recording all visited websites, running applications, emails and social media chats monitoring. Revealer Keylogger PRO If you are tired of all the bells and whistles and want a simple basic keylogger, Revealer Keylogger PRO is your choice. The program offers a well-developed keylogging feature which can intercept keystrokes in all applications, including passwords and chat messages. Additionally, Revealer Keylogger PRO snaps screenshots whenever the user types some text or clicks the mouse. All collected information is available remotely, as the program can deliver it via email, Dropbox or LAN. You can set a convenient delivery frequency from once to several times of the day. And the last but not the least: the program has an invisible mode which allows it to stay undetected in the Explorer, Task Manager and the registry. Viotto Keylogger Another solid keylogger with all the basic features you might need - keylogging, screen capture, running apps and visited webpages tracking, clipboard logging. Yet, two features distinguish Viotto Keylogger favourably from other similar software on the market. The first one is its lightweightness - it is only 80 kb, thus requiring very little system resources, which contributes to its invisibility. The second advantage is selective logging - the program can log only specific apps, windows or webpages usage. pctattletale Quite a peculiar sample in our list is pcTattletale. Their slogan is ""More than just another Windows 10 keylogger"" and this is truly so. The program logs keystrokes like a usual keylogger, but it also makes a screenshotshot every time the user clicks the mouse. After that, the program compiles these screenshots into a video recording of the screen with captured keystrokes shown above the recording. This recording can be viewed later from your account remotely from any computer or even a smartphone. Constant recording of the screen guarantees that you will never miss an action or a keystroke, yet checking logs becomes quite time-consuming. Instead of a glance through a log file, you may have to watch minutes and minutes of video. Video controls letting you skip to a certain time are quite helpful in this case. Today's keyloggers have long overgrown their initial purpose of recording keystrokes. A modern keylogger is a powerful tool able to monitor almost any activity on the target computer, thus serving a wide range of purposes from parental monitoring to controlling your computer. However, it should be used with caution and only on devices that you have proper authorization for."
3,Artificial Intelligence Disrupting Science,computers-technology," An unlikely source of innovation, algae is the solution to most of our natural problems. Not only does it thrive when digesting the hazardous chemicals in our wastewater system; algal lipids hold the power to fuel our future. Biofuel, a nontoxic substance, produces a fraction of the emissions of fossil fuel: If widely adopted, it could halt the buildup of poisonous gases in the atmosphere. In a two-year, multiphase research study, I conducted numerous experiments that ultimately produced a fully-functional, wholly-viable biofuel that can be processed in any standard diesel engine. Though my work resulted in only a small-scale product, it is the embodiment of the change necessary for our planet’s survival. In the Twenty-First Century, fourteen species have gone extinct, 573,686 square kilometers of forest have been destroyed, and well over 1.5 million individuals developed acute respiratory issues because of poor air quality. With such a pandemic amassing from environmental degradation, every individual is responsible for preserving this planet and ensuring its longevity. As a global community, we face numerous complex issues from political corruption, to overpopulation and the aftermath of resource depletion, but none are as severe and far-reaching as what we face if our environment continues to degrade. Yet hope can be found, even in the scummiest of places, if one dares to experiment. The potential for this field is infinite. With the connections and resources provided by these scientific endeavors, this - and numerous other research efforts - will be actualized and pursued to conserve the planet and promote a sustainable way of life. If our societal focus is directed to algae, we can power our world, clean it, and even heal it.  And yet, if pond scum- an overlooked, seemingly unsavory species - holds such an abundant strength to heal our world, and a teenage scientist like myself has the ability to use it, one can only imagine the presently unfathomable advancements that could be thought up by the entirely new, technological species known simply as AI. It has been proven time and again in laboratories across the nation that Artificial Intelligence is capable of not only creative thinking but also mental growth and learning. Without being specifically programmed, AI technology can solve problems far beyond the reaches of the human minds which created it. While myself and many other scientists are presently searching for clean fuel alternatives, the self-advancing intelligence can easily be set to the task of finding anything from a larger solution or a practical application of human-made products like algae biofuel. As a scientist myself, and a lover of the proven facts which science provides, it can be difficult to imagine yielding control of all new advancements to technology. However, only just beginning to think, artificial intelligence is all but guaranteed to surpass what even science can predict in the next five years' time. If these two worlds are allowed to combine, to grow together as a unified intellect, our environment, this world with it, may just have a fighting chance at survival."

5,4 Guidelines On How To Make Your Website Stand Out,computers-technology," In a digital world with close to 2 billion websites on the internet, users have a tendency to bounce around from site to site in search of a suitable answer or solution to the problem they have or to find the information that they seek. Did you know that the average user spends 15 seconds or less on a website? With the attention spans of viewers decreasing at an alarming rate, it is safe to say that with only 15 seconds, it’s a really good idea to know how to make your website stand out. High bounce rates and the loss of business opportunities are a reality without a strong and unique website, especially with the large number of competitors, standing out can be a grueling task. Here at WelkinMKTG management, we’ve got experience with making our Digital Agency’s website engaging and relevant for users. We suggest that you use these tips and pointers for helping your business website stand out in a saturated market. How to make your website stand out At WelkinMKTG we feel that everyone deserves a chance to be successful and should know how to make their website stand out. Consider the following when creating your company website:  Firstly, you need your website to feature at the top of Google or any other search engines search results page so that users will know where to find you. Let’s say for example that you have a company that specializes in social media marketing. You would want your company’s website to appear when users search for keywords like “social media marketing agency” or “social media specialists”. In order to achieve this, you would need to include these specific keywords on your web pages. To lead more people to your website, you could provide users with insightful blogs, articles, how-to-guides and other informative resources. You should include popular ranking keywords within these resources which are specific to your industry. In reality, nobody ever goes to the second or third page of a search engines results to find the answers that they seek. This is why it makes sense to rank on the first page. Another important factor to consider is that once users land on your homepage, it needs to be direct, engaging and relevant to their search query. If not, the chance that they’re going to leave are pretty high. And the faster users click off your site, the lower your site ranks in search. When it comes to the design element of your website, there are various factors that need to be taken into consideration in order to perfectly execute a captivating, unique and memorable overall look and feel of your website. Firstly, cohesive branding is a major key aspect. Quality brand design forms the foundation of any good website. Visual branding includes logo design, a color palette, and font selection. It could also include photo curation, mood boards or any other resources that represent the general aesthetic of your brand. Secondly, imagery that features on your website’s homepage holds a high importance. Images serve a greater purpose than just making your design look good. Photos should be high-quality, professional and match your brands aesthetic. Images that are used effectively have the ability to gain your business excessive traffic and therefore conversions, whether that may be sales or enquiries. As humans, our bodies and minds have been designed in such a way that we react to certain forms of visual and audio stimulants. Hence, if your website has appealing imagery, this will not only attract the attention of users, but also spark emotions and draw them in.  Images can improve the user experience and help users easily understand and digest information. The third aspect of your website design is compelling copy. Words carry immense power, and as the great Robin Sharma said “Words can inspire. And words can destroy. Choose yours well.” This quote says it perfectly, the words you choose can either have the power to connect with your audience on a deeper, more personal level inspiring and enabling them to spend more time on your website or, if not chosen wisely, they can be deemed irrelevant and force the user to be uninterested and leave your website. Being able to easily navigate through your website has to be one the most crucial aspects of usability. People nowadays really don’t have the patience or attention to progress through multiple clicks in order to find the information they are looking for. Too many clicks, and users are gone. Good navigation helps the user find their way around your website in a simple, intuitive and structured way. When creating your website, ensure that your main navigation tab consists of your most important pages, these are usually the pages that you want to direct users to visit. In order to do this, it’s important to highlight these pages. Navigating a website shouldn’t be a slow process either. Websites that have slow loading pages encourage users to firmly exit your website. As mentioned earlier, users have no patience or the attention span to hang around and wait for new webpages to load. In fact, a recent study discovered that 40% of people would leave a website with a loading speed of longer than 3 seconds. Lastly, I would like to turn your attention to your domain name. A domain name is basically your digital street address. If you want your domain to stand out and be unique, there is an array of factors you might want to consider when selecting your website address. Your domain name should be strong, eccentric and closely represent your business name, as this makes it easier for customers to find you. Domain names are important for 3 very crucial reasons: Technically your domain name is your first impression – Your URL is the very first thing that your visitors will see. And as the saying goes “First impressions, last” so make it count. It impacts SEO – Having a relevant keyword in your domain name can help your SEO ranking. Your domain name defines your brand – If chosen correctly and intuitively, your domain name can form as a branding opportunity and can significantly increase your brand recognition."

8,The necessary digitization of the economy and business,computers-technology," The necessary digitization of the economy and business In a future marked by technological development, only those businesses that adapt to this new reality will be viable. Aware of this situation, Banco Santander supports SMEs and the self-employed through different initiatives that promote innovation In just a few years, technology has transformed society, the economy, human relations and the production formulas of companies. Digitization is an unstoppable phenomenon and the Covid-19 pandemic has further accelerated this global trend. The process affects all economic actors, who must urgently adapt to this new situation. Only in this way will administrations, companies and citizens continue to compete on equal terms with other countries and businesses. Numerous studies suggest that, if digitization is approached with rigor and guarantees, it will imply accelerated growth in productivity and an increase in employment levels. Hence the importance of successfully facing digital transformation, something that is a priority for the society in which we develop as individuals. “I think digitization is not an option. It is a goal shared by all: banks, society, the education sector, health”, the president of Banco Santander, Ana Botín, has reiterated on more than one occasion. In this roadmap, the policies of the European Union play a very important role. “Good policies can help us get there. If we think about the last 100 years, the technological difference between Europe and America and emerging markets was very great, but that distance is closing, ""said Botín in the framework of a meeting at the Institute of International Finance, held last year in Brussels. The pandemic as an opportunity The covid-19 crisis is also presented as an opportunity to enhance these digital advances. Spain will soon receive 144,000 million euros of European funds, of which half will correspond to credit, for the reactivation of the economy after the deep economic debacle caused by the pandemic. EUROPEAN FUNDS MUST GIVE THAT DEFINITIVE IMPULSE FOR THE DIGITALIZATION OF SMES This money should serve, among other things, to support the solvency and viability of SMEs and give them the definitive boost for their digitization. It is these small and medium-sized companies that are suffering the most from the effects of the crisis, which is why a large part of the employment and economic fabric of Spain depends on them. For this reason, Ana Botín considers it essential that European funds arrive as soon as possible, to support these businesses in the post-covid era. “This means that European funds must give that definitive push for the digitization of SMEs. Banks have played an important role in this phase of the pandemic to protect companies (...) and now what we need is to strengthen public-private collaboration to capitalize on companies that have the capacity to invest, grow and generate employment ”, The president of the financial institution recently assured. Incentives to innovate In this sense, Banco Santander in Spain is developing platforms, services and technological applications that are supporting SMEs and the self-employed to improve their expertise and stimulate their innovation. One of them is Financia & Go, a 100% digital financing service for invoices issued and pending collection for SMEs in Spain, with which access to short-term financing is facilitated in a flexible and simple way, from the management tool itself. customer invoices. So they can connect their account with Banco Santander, select the amount they want to advance and the repayment period. Banco Santander is developing platforms, services and applications in Spain that are supporting SMEs and the self-employed to improve their expertise and stimulate their innovation For its part, Santander ZOne is a unique platform that helps companies and businesses connect with more than five million potential consumers. In total, more than 1.2 million active customers already benefit from this initiative, which, in essence, represents a powerful marketing tool. With it, companies can send tailored offers to Santander customers, filtering by age, location or spending profile, and thus boost their sales in the current context of recovery after the crisis caused by covid-19, at the same time that customers take advantage of significant discounts and benefits. Regarding Santander's global transformation strategy, the entity has just announced the creation of an autonomous company, PagoNxt, which integrates its most disruptive payments businesses. It will carry out its activity in Europe and America in three business areas: solutions for businesses (Getnet), solutions for SMEs that operate internationally and need services that were previously only accessible to large companies, and digital products and services for individuals, such as Superdigital, la financial inclusion platform already available in five Latin American markets. The digital revolution is already unstoppable Digitization is one of the strategic pillars of Banco Santander, key to the growth and transformation of the group. In Spain, the financial institution already has more than five million digital users, which represents 64% of its total active clients. In addition, the confinement accelerated this process, with the incorporation of 300,000 new digital customers, 20% of which are over 70 years old. During the state of alarm, the contracting of products and services carried out through digital channels accounted for more than 50% of total sales on key days. In those months, remote assistance to clients increased by more than 60%. The data shows the weight that digitization implies in the present and the future of the entity, which currently has more than 41 million digital customers around the world, of which 34 million use mobile banking and almost half of sales (44%) in the first nine months of the year were produced through digital channels, compared to 36% in 2019. The ultimate goal is to “accelerate the digital revolution” so that the bank becomes “the best open platform for financial services”. Hence the recent launch of three new initiatives: One Santander to simplify the group's operations, products and services, starting with Europe; the creation of a digital native global bank through the combination of Openbank and Santander Consumer Finance, and the payment platforms that will operate under the autonomous company PagoNxt."

10,How to Run a Productive Virtual Meeting,computers-technology," The entire understanding of the business world and the office work changed overnight, with the coronavirus pandemic outbreak. The changes that took place approximately a year ago look like a new normal today. Entrepreneurs and companies should keep to social distancing, and, in many cases, self-isolation measures, introduced by the government, to prevent the spread of the infection. Many teams haven't managed to return to the previous working schedules, while physical contacts are limited or even avoided. Thus, business proprietors and team leads face the challenge regarding how they can motivate and unite employees despite being physically apart. They also have to create an environment that will keep all of its parts united, and the performance - a satisfactory one. In order to retain the right business image and enable people to collaborate effectively, regardless of the distance, that separates them, virtual meetings are widely used. The concept of the virtual meeting With the latest videoconferencing facilities, it has become significantly easier to host meetings online and invite participants worldwide. Virtual meetings are often used instead of face-to-face ones, as they are quick to arrange, as well as relatively inexpensive. The most important people related to your business can join the conversation wherever they are based. In other words, the virtual meeting doesn't have a precise physical location, as it occurs online and unites lots of attendees, each of which works from a different place with the Internet connection, of course. Although being rather popular among freelancers and entrepreneurs, home-based offices can not ensure business recognition and competitiveness to the fullest. Very often, in order to retain a professional company's image, the business proprietors are looking for a virtual office for rent. This office solution, among the other amenities and services, often boasts video conferencing facilities that makes it significantly easier to officially run a meeting from a renowned and respectable commercial address. The term ""virtual meeting"" relates both - to an ordinary audio-conversation and the one that is conducted with the help of video-cameras. The latter example is more common nowadays, as, since the outbreak of the pandemic, platforms like Zoom, Skype, and Google Hangouts have become exceptionally popular among entrepreneurs and employees. Initially, they said that the absence of physical presence during the meeting could create some barriers or troubles related to the natural communication between the participants. Still, for no-way-out, the usage of online meeting platforms has become so common that people have found lots of benefits in ""running business talks"" virtually. Virtual meetings can be as effective and productive as personal ones, yet, to gain success, the organisers have to plan the meetings in detail, as there are many things needed to be taken into consideration. How to make a virtual meeting effective When attending a virtual meeting, a participant pays attention to a variety of details, and, as a result, can define whether this or that conversation was a success or vice versa. If you are not a participant, but a planner, you are hardly given room for error. Engaging your audience online requires a profound understanding of the meeting's entire purpose and the result you are looking for. Virtual meetings planning and running requires a different approach from leading the personal one. When looking for the best results from the conducted virtual meeting, planners have to build certain strategies that will help them cover all the necessary sides and issues of this process. Still, there are some common things that make a virtual meeting meaningful and effective in the majority of cases. ●	Plan the agenda carefully Actually, in the process of planning a virtual meeting, you will probably need each of the participants to be maximally concentrated and attentive. Preparing the agenda helps a lot to present the content, aims, and purposes of the meeting in a convenient and understandable manner. Depending on the type of participation of attendees you need, there is the possibility to plan the verbal and non-verbal interaction, preparing the virtual floor segments beforehand. The agenda is usually used as a guideline for a specific meeting, so, even if you don't stick to it completely, you will always have a plan of the meeting in front of your eyes, so, you can be sure that nothing important is omitted. It would be great to send copies of this agenda to each person who will be present at the discussion. ●	Choose the best devices and tech facilities After the issues with the agenda are completed, it will be right to consider and choose the most suitable online platform for your planned meeting. For instance, a quick ""check-in"" may require one tool, while the discussion that is to involve many participants, a brainstorming session, or a decision-making process requires an entirely different platform. Some of the most popular software instruments that ensure the possibilities to ""meet"" in the virtual world are Skype, Zoom, Citrix GoTo Meeting, Cisco WebEx, Google Hangouts, etc. The right choice of the online platform for conducting a meeting is not a hundred per cent proof that the meeting will run smoothly. It is also necessary to make effective use of technologies. Here we speak about the stability of the Internet connection(if possible, it is better to use a wired connection than wireless), the satisfactory condition of gadgets, etc. It is better to check how everything works before you launch a programme and start a meeting. As an organiser of the conference, you have to feel comfortable with all the tech, software, and programme tools you use. ●	Prepare the participants and keep them focused Attentive attendees are at a premium when it comes to predicting the final outcome of this or that meeting. It is extremely difficult in a modern busy business world to get involved in one process to the fullest and forget about the other things at least for half an hour. That's why it is indeed essential to get people engaged and invested before they join the virtual meeting. To reach the required result, it would be great to communicate with your business guests beforehand, prepare the answers to their possible questions, or predict the possible comments to the initially planned agenda. When the meeting starts, try your best not to waste time on long introductions, and unnecessary talks. By jumping right into the content, you not only achieve better results but also show respect for people's time. Still, people are only people. It means that upon some circumstances, they may lose focus on the topic of the conversation and become inattentive. To avoid distractions during the meeting, the experts recommend planners to inject some kind of interactive activity roughly every 10 to 15 minutes. Environment matter What does it mean? In order to gain the participants' trust and make each attendee feel comfortable about virtual communication, it would be advisory to think about the safety of the virtual environment. The key feature to keep online meetings safe and secure is the use of passwords, recording the conversation to save all the data discussed in the process of the event, etc. Here, it is extremely important for each participant to understand the issue of confidentiality. Sharing meeting links and passwords with only those people whom you plan to invite is a way towards avoiding the leak of important information. Summing up Over the last decade, the number of virtual meetings has increased dramatically, from the occasional conference call to a situation where many project managers spend a large proportion of their time on conference calls and other virtual meetings. The increase in the popularity of the virtual meeting was driven by several important factors, such as the development of the VOIP telephony, telecommuting, freelancing, etc. The external environmental factors, like, for instance, pandemic outbreaks, natural catastrophes, etc. can also impact the growth of interest for the virtual workspace per se or flexible meeting schedules. When working with virtual meetings, many different variables come into play that the project manager must be aware of. And, although, many virtual meetings are frustrating and ineffective, a little thought and preparation can turn them into a great success."

Even workers training sessions are now different, most are done online or through video conferencing while others are taking place on sites following strict social distancing protocols to prevent the spread of the virus. All organizations are now forced to go under health and safety courses to be able to cope with all rules set by the government. From now on, it is more likely that business will invest heavily in technology that will enable operations to be completed remotely and employees will definitely be trained in different types of software as part of their job to be able to work from home in case such an approach is needed. Contracts will also change, dictating clauses that will be more specific about what will occur in case previous agreements are not completed because of extreme circumstances such as a pandemic. Ultimately, rather than just changes to contracts and additional training, as a result of COVID-19 pandemic, many office-based work will shift to a virtual environment as part of their daily operations. The truth to be told is that the way we work, perhaps has changed forever. The only way for many industries to survive will be their ability to adapt, and maybe just, maybe, virtual methods will be the best option.

14,What are Your Web Hosting Options?,computers-technology," Your website will be hosted on a unique piece of storage hardware known as a hosting server. Not all servers are made equal, though. There are four main types of servers available on the market today for web-hosting options: Shared servers are the most basic and cost-effective of all hosting solutions. As their name suggests, shared servers store hundreds of client websites on a single server device. Given that shared storage space, though, this kind of web hosting platform works best for low-traffic websites with minimum features. VPS is a step up from basic shared servers. In this hosting arrangement, your website is programmed into what’s called an instance and placed on a virtual computing platform. Like shared servers, hosting companies will store many website instances on a single VPS. However, VPS frameworks are much speedier and include far more storage and data retrieval capabilities than completely shared servers. VPS servers can also work with other managed IT services, particularly cybersecurity defenses. For fast-growing websites as well as businesses prioritizing network security, a dedicated server option may be particularly attractive. With a dedicated server, your website and only your website sits on its own physical device that’s stored off-premise in your host company’s data center. Dedicated servers afford the most privacy, customizations and configurations. They allow you to tailor your security features, support architecture, operating system, load and traffic balancers and more. WHAT ARE THE TOP WEB-HOSTING PROVIDER CONSIDERATIONS FOR YOUR SMALL BUSINESS? Have confidence in your managed web hosting partner by prioritizing these three features during your search: The best hosting providers deliver robust defense systems on its platforms, guarding your website — and your brand’s reputation. Be vigilant in your security inquiries with potential web hosts. Don’t be afraid to ask what types of attacks their defenses aim to prevent as well as the updates and configuration schedules made to those defenses, including: Clustered firewalls with deep-level packet inspections. Around-the-clock inbound and outbound traffic monitoring for suspicious packet patterns. Additional firewall and antivirus security layers deployed across various computer control panels and levels. Distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attack defenses and spam filters. System reports summarizing traffic history and blocked malicious activity. Hosting company prices vary widely, from a few dollars a month for mega-shared servers without any special amenities to a few thousand dollars for all the web-hosting premium add-ons. The main variables affecting a managed web host’s pricing, will be your bandwidth and storage requirements, as well as any additional services you request. Other price considerations to look for when picking a web host include: Sign-up fees Contract renewal rates Cancellation fees Expedited set-up charges to get your website “live” faster Website hosting performance metrics are the third and final essential feature to test before picking your website host. Again, use your website’s true nature and realistic traffic amounts to gauge best-fit hosting performance. A blog — even a large one published daily — demands far less from a server than a high-volume, endless-aisle configured online store. Pay attention to the following performance parameters with your provider, as these metrics are some of the most revealing about your host’s true service deliverables: Peak traffic load timelines. Frequency of server overloads and lag times. Scalability of storage and bandwidth. Customer support when issues arise, as well as the medium for that support. CHOOSE WHITELABEL ITSOLUTIONS AS YOUR WEB HOSTING PROVIDER Get in touch with the web-hosting experts at Whitelabel ITSolutions to see how we do web hosting different, including providing redundant servers and truly around-the-clock customer support, lending you peace of mind your website’s in the right hands."
15,How to Choose a Web Hosting Provider,computers-technology," So you’ve got a website. You’ve also got products and services to distinguish, prospects to convert and customers to engage, plus a brand reputation to nurture online along the way. Now you just need a reliable web hosting provider — a company to play that essential gatekeeping role in getting your website live on the internet. In this guide, we’ll discuss your business’ choices in today’s provider marketplace, plus what to look for when vetting potential hosting companies once. WHICH WEB HOSTING FEATURES DOES YOUR WEBSITE REQUIRE? When it comes to finding the right web hosting provider, try not to put the cart before the horse — meaning don’t rush out to find a host before understanding the design, usage and nature of your website. First, you need to consider: Consider the full state of your website. What activities, media and content does it currently support — and which features are you hoping to build new pages for? For example, your website may currently have architecture dedicated to: Sales pages, from one central sales page to endless aisle-mirroring scrolling A secure payment portals Personalized customer accounts, profiles or portals Multimedia content Blogs or vlogs Real-time online chat options Before picking a web hosting provider, you must first understand the functional nature of your website plus how you intend to build and expand it. Some hosts have a suite of infrastructure tools dedicated to supporting certain types of websites, while others offer broader hosting and support styles. Be honest about your bandwidth and storage realities. Small businesses or new startups beginning to gain traction will likely have fewer people visiting their sites simultaneously, as well as fewer pages to manage, files to upload and less strenuous network activity. As a result, a modest bandwidth amount — also known as your byte upload and download speeds — from your internet provider can be more prudent without sacrificing functionality. Many hosting providers build contracts around bandwidth and storage amounts. For that reason, it’s important to understand your website’s traffic patterns and bandwidth usage to find that Goldilocks provider. Who performs the bulk of your website’s current design and management, like editing product descriptions, A/B testing a strategic landing page or uploading a new blog post? For many small businesses, the brunt of that website maintenance work falls on your shoulders. It doesn’t have to, though. Some hosting companies offer website maintenance services, including page-building, traffic monitoring and even cybersecurity defense layers. If these features sound attractive to partially or fully outsource, you can filter providers even further to only those offering site maintenance and ongoing support."
16,How Many People Use Instagram? 30+ Instagram Statistics (2021),computers-technology," Knowing platform statistics can be extremely helpful in creating or modifying your existing social media strategy.

17,Give your computer a boost with System Mechanic Professional,computers-technology," Computers often don't work the way we want them to. Common problems include apparently random drops in performance, unresponsive user interfaces, and the constant threat to data security and privacy. That's why iolo created System Mechanic Professional, an all-in-one utility for protecting your PC and boosting its performance. The latest edition includes easy disabling of voice and handwriting recognition, opting out of privacy-invasive search suggestions, blocking access to Windows User Account information, and denying websites access to language preferences. The antivirus system has also been improved to deliver better real-time protection and on-demand malware removal for machines already infected. PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY AND SECURITY Cybercriminals have countless ways of exploiting your personal data, which is why everyone needs to keep their digital security and privacy front of mind. System Mechanic Professional takes a proactive approach to keeping you safe by automatically removing malware in real-time.

It protects against viruses and other forms of malware, and removes existing infections before permanently protecting the computer from future attacks. Also, it neutralizes threats quietly without constantly interrupting you with alerts and false positives. Furthermore, it doesn't weigh down the system with unnecessary background activities. System Mechanic Professional also removes spyware and bloatware, a lot of which comes preinstalled on new computers. This software may not always be harmful, but it can contain trackers that keep a record of certain online activities and send the logs to advertising companies. Bloatware also bogs down your computer by hogging system resources. You can also configure many privacy-protection settings in the user-friendly dashboard, some of which are very hard to find natively in Windows. It provides easy access to lots of settings that are not immediately available in Windows, such as those that can normally only be changed by making risky adjustments to the system registry.

Fortunately, and especially if you act quickly, there's a good chance you'll be able to get back what you've lost. System Mechanic Professional includes the Search and Recover utility, which lets you recover data from many different drives, devices, and platforms.

This overwrites the original data with zeros using military-grade technology. By removing bloatware and disabling cumbersome and invasive processes from the background, System Mechanic Professional helps tune up your computer. It provides full transparency over the health of your device, and provides full control over a wide range of advanced system settings. You can quickly run repairs and optimizations, such as removing junk software, improving boot times, and automatically fixing and optimizing your computer during idle times with the Active Care technology.

19,How to Keep Your Audience Engaged on YouTube,computers-technology," You've done a good job getting folks to watch your YouTube video. Now, what about converting those folks to subscribers and encouraging them to become a continued and beneficial resource for your business? Before I discuss best practices, let's talk about how many views your video received. Your video could have received between 1,000 and 40,000 views. That translates into about one viewer per interaction. Is that enough engagement to move people to become a customer or potential customer for your company? Personally, my expectation is much higher than one viewer per interaction. Having high level of engagement helps grow and sustain a product or service by making potential consumers feel connected to the brand on a deeper level. Increased viewer engagement also enables greater sales and referral opportunities. How do you build and keep an engaged and engaged video viewer? Engagement consists of two basic elements. The first aspect is getting people to watch the video, but the second aspect is determining what they want to watch. My research suggests that the easiest and most effective way to do this is offering coupons, discounts, opportunities for contests and giveaways. Each of these elements is linked to one of four basic motivations. Motivator 1: Favorite Something You Watch The first motivational element is becoming familiar with what you're watching. A podcast, video or something else you watch provides a means to become an expert at your favorite topic or service. The only exception to this is if your expertise is in something that is a crossroads or a new area to which you're learning a lot. In those cases, a website can be the place where the experts give their knowledge free to the public. Motivator 2: Interaction With Creative Content Motivator 2 applies to people who do not know much about a brand or who have not participated in a social conversation. These people need an opportunity to engage, ask questions, learn and become interested in the company or service. A lot of the content we share on social channels and throughout the web is some form of creative content. A lot of these creations are part of a viral promotional campaign. Motivator 3: Potential Encouragement Getting a viewer to click a link to something in your site or on social channels can increase the reach of your videos and increase the ability to drive them to a website. You can also manipulate this type of interaction to increase awareness of your products or services. It is great to have a YouTube channel and lots of videos, but you need text versions of your content on the Internet as well. The primary reason for this is that search engines are unable to scroll through audio and need to index text. It will thus help your SEO to have a text-based website and increase your organic search traffic.  But don't worry, it doesn't have to be time consuming to maintain a blog for your YouTube channel. To convert your video to text and then upload a full transcription of your video as a blog post, all you need is an automated transcription service provider. Alongside the full transcript, embed your YouTube video and away you go. Once these three factors are understood, it's a good idea to get your content incorporated into what someone likes to do. The result of this content could be some fun and viral interactions. This will bring you new viewers and possibilities for more content. It's about how you package and integrate video into your social video marketing plan."

A good ranking can be achieved through spamming also, especially black hat spanning. So check the facts before getting lured with this tactic. Offering fixed cost SEO package: SEO needs a customized approach to each website as every site has its issue or requirement. That’s the reason why SEO package isn’t always the right fit to meet the business needs. Important thing is to ensure that the company you are hiring is acquainted with your business, formulate a strategy, and then levy charges. Providing misleading credentials: Retrace your steps if your SEO agency says it is a Google partner or it has any connection with Google. There are no Google partners so it is best to avoid this trap. Making you locked into a long contract: Never consider any company that makes you lock into a contract for one year or longer. If you are locked, it will not be able to leave the company if you are not getting any return. So How to Find a Right SEO company? Ask for A portfolio: If the SEO service provider you are seeking is not able to share its past works, get wary. There is a possibility that it has just started the business. It is also a likelihood that the techniques it has applied for the clients had not been up to the mark, and this is a reason why it is not willing to reveal to you its past work. It is always best to study the portfolio, reach out to its clients, and understand if it is of any worth to invest your time and money. https://www.seoserviceagency.com.au/ Getting the word of mouth testimonial about the SEO Company gives a better idea about its credibility and the work it does.

2,Should you choose MP4 or MKV format for your videos?,computers-technology," Without a doubt are MPEG-4 part 14 and Matroska Video (or as most people know it: MP4 and MKV) the most popular video formats around. When it comes to choosing the appropriate file format for your own video files, a few things have to be considered in order to make a choice between MP4 and MKV. Containers, not formats Let’s start with bursting the myth around the assumption that both MP4 and MKV are video compression formats. They are simply not. They are what you call video containers. A video container, as the name implies, contains things a video needs in order to play properly on your tv or pc. They contain items like video codecs, audio codecs and even subtitles. Having them all in one file makes it easier to playback, but also enables the editor to choose methods to reduce file the file size. The editor might choose to reduce the video quality, but improve the audio quality. MP4 and MKV being containers is important to remember because they might have a .mkv or .mp4 extension, they might have different video extensions for the video media inside the container. Matroska Video Matroska Video, or MKV, is developed by Mastroska.org as an answer to replace the old AVI video format. The name is similar to that of the Russian ‘dolls’ called matryoshka. You know, the big doll that each container a smaller matryoshka doll. This is quite fitting, when you consider the fact the MKV is a container format. MKV video formats enable the user to capture endless amounts of video, audio and subtitle formats in one single file. MKV and WebM files are related. WebM is a restricted version of MKV. The restriction is in the video codecs. WebM only allows the use of VP8 and VP9 codecs. In short, all WebM files are MKV, but not all MKV files are consistent with WebM MPEG-4 part 14 MP4 is the probably the better known video format of the two. It is the standard output of many video camera’s and smartphones. Although MP4 is, similar to MKV, a container format, it offers a bit more restrictions in terms of encapsulating formats. For instance, MP4 doesn’t offer the possibility to embed ASS like MKV does. As has been said above, MKV has been developed to overthrow AVI. MP4, however, is the successor to the popular MPEG-1, MPEG-2 etc and has become the industry standard. Being the industry standard, MP4 has a much greater compatibility with videosoftware and video players. For instance, YouTube practically demands MP4 for uploads. This is the reason Iphones and Androids have chosen MP4 for their players. Third party software might still enable you to play MKV files on your smartphone though. It’s worth noting that MP4 is controlled and patented by MPEG, while MKV is an open-source project. This makes licenses for players, editors and video software a lot easier. So, which is better? Both containers are similar, and the choice for video format lies in personal preference and usability. There is no clear difference in quality. The difference are less subtle than that. MP4 has broad browser, device and software support and are often smaller in file size compared to MKV. MKV, being open-source software, is much better supported in free software. It also supports practically all codecs and has better subtitle support. If you prefer Google’s latest codec VP9, you should go for MKV (or WebM). Do you want broad device support? Go for MP4. Frequently Asked Questions Does MP4 or MKV have better quality? Both file formats support H.264 video codec. This means the quality of the video is similar. The difference are in the usability and functionality of the two container formats. Is MKV open-source? MKV is designed by Mastroska in order to replace the AVI format. Everything that has been used in creating the MKV format is patented, which means it can be used and distributed without licenses. Does MP4 container support subtitles? MP4 supports different subtitle formats, but not as many as MKV. MKV support ASS formats, whereas MP4 does not."

5,Recover lost or damaged partitions with this freeware toolkit,computers-technology," Data loss is something that almost every computer user is familiar with or has experienced firsthand. Yet in spite of the rise of better backup and disaster recovery solutions, it still happens, either by accident or due to hardware or software failures or even malicious activity. A common way to lose data is to accidentally delete a hard drive partition, which also removes all content on that drive. It is easy to do this by accident when installing a new operating system or configuring a dual boot setup. Most computers come with multiple partitions on their hard drives. Often, these are configured in the factory. For example, there is usually a partition for recovery, which contains all the original factory default software from your computer. It might be safe to delete this, if you have another backup, but working with partition manager tools always carries the risk of deleting something important. Fortunately, when you delete a partition, none of the data is deleted, at least not initially. Instead, the file system is deleted, along with the master file table. This is a hidden database on the partition which includes the entire directory and file structure of the drive, thus allowing modern operating systems to access its contents. Without it, the entire partition will simply be marked as available space. This also means the original data can eventually be overwritten, which is why it is important to act fact. If you do not, the data may be permanently lost. For example, if you are reinstalling your operating system from scratch, and you delete or format the original partition before realizing there was something important still left on it, you should stop the process right away. As soon as you start creating or modifying new partitions or installing the operating system or making any other changes to the disk, the chances of getting your data back intact drop significantly. Active@ Partition Recovery has been designed to exploit this opportunity to help you get back what you've lost. It's a freeware toolkit that helps you recover deleted or damaged partitions and logical drives, including system hard drives themselves. You can perform recovery operations within Windows too. However, if you are unable to boot up your computer because you accidentally deleted or lost the system partition where your operating system was installed, there is still hope. You can recover these partitions and any other across your storage devices using a recovery boot disk with the Windows Preinstallation Environment (WinPE). Alternatively, if you are a Linux user, you can use the Linux-based LiveCD recovery environment. The Active@ Partition Recovery application itself has a simple quick-scanning feature that detects and recovers recently deleted partitions, provided they have not been formatted or overwritten after deletion. If that fails, there is also a deep-scanning method and a last-chance recovery method for individual files. The latest version now adds applying Boot Sector Template to any disk sector. The last chance recovery kernel has also been improved. Finally, the Ultimate version now includes a new version of Active@ Boot Disk based on the Windows 10 build 2004.

9,TTS Technology,computers-technology," What is Text-To-speech technology? Text-to-speech or TTS is a type of assistive technology that turns your digital written text into audio. TTS is considered among the best technologies in this era, as it is very helpful to certain people such as people with some kind of disabilities, sight problems, kids, students who can't find time for reading, or simply people who prefer listening over reading. All it takes is a few clicks and then you will be able to listen to your books rather than reading them, or maybe listen to the handout assigned by your professor on your way home. How does TTS Work? Text-to-speech is computer-generated since it uses computer-generated voices similar to human voices. There is a variety of voice types and qualities that you could choose from whether you like a female soft voice, a little boy childish voice, or it could be a sharp deep male voice, so it all depends on what matches your taste. Why TTS and who could use this technology? Text-to-speech technology is designed for everyone to use; however, there are certain people who could benefit from it the most. People with sight issues or some kind of disability could use TTS, as it will enable them to listen rather than read and perhaps they want to read a book so badly, or read that newspaper but they just can't; therefore, TTS is the go-to for them. People who hate reading books could use TTS as well since it will save them the trouble of reading, and let's be honest; sometimes, reading could be boring for certain individuals and that is where TTS thrives, it will help them listen to their books rather than reading them. Not only that, they get to choose their preferred voice, as I mentioned before. Your kids could use this technology too. How? In school, your kid will be assigned to read printed material and handouts; however, it is not very optimal since kids struggle with decoding and understanding written words on paper, not to mention that it's quite unfun and boring for him/her. With that being said, Text-to-speech is very useful in this situation as it creates a multisensory experience for your kids which enables them to develop certain skills. Some researchers have found that the combination of seeing and hearing text while reading is very beneficial: develop a good memory while reading improved word recognition developing meticulous hearing and reading skills increases the ability to pay attention help kids recognize their mistakes and fix them in their own writing Students in college, high school, or even university could make good use of TTS. Instead of settling down in your room to read material and handouts assigned by your professor, you could use TTS to listen to that material while jogging, or having a coffee outside on a rainy day. You will be accessing your reading material with ease and in a comfortable position of your choice. Not to mention that TTS is perceived favorably by the students who used it. TTS to learn new languages? YES. Let's suppose you are an immigrant and you want to learn the language of the host country, it could be quite challenging since in most languages the way a word appears spelled out in letters often doesn’t match up with the way it sounds phonetically and TTS will offer the ability to listen along to the way words sound at the same time as reading; therefore, it will save you time, energy and possibly money if you are looking to hire a teacher. Do you want to listen to your favorite books or the newspaper while doing your laundry, driving home from work, or washing dishes? TTS offers you the ability to do both if you are a decent multitasker. Where can you find TTS technology? Text-to-speech technology is everywhere, you could simply just google it and find a decent program, platform, or app depending on your needs. Some of them might have a bad voice quality or shortage of voice varieties and usually, those are the free platforms. Look for a paid platform or program to use as it will make your TTS experience better. I personally use www.naturaltextreader.com (smooth platform, good voice quality, and a lot of voice types to choose from) but you can find hundreds of platforms on the internet, choose what suits you most. All in all, TTS is indeed among the most cutting-edge advances that artificial intelligence has made possible as it makes reading life so much easier, as well as aiding people in need."
10,What Are the Three Categories of Surveillance?,computers-technology," While many people install surveillance cameras and other technical devices to secure their homes and offices, surveillance is a much broader term than just security cameras. Technical, mechanical, and physical surveillance are different forms of surveillance that helps investigating teams to find the culprit as soon as possible. Whenever a case is on the table of any investigation officer, different surveillance categories are combined to solve the case effectively and quickly. Detailed surveillance is not needed in most of the cases. However, you must keep yourself aware of the surveillance methods and categories. What Is Surveillance Surveillance itself is a category of the security systems. It is the act of monitoring activities, behaviours, and keeping all the information safe in case of an emergency. Surveillance can be both technical such as distance monitoring security cameras, CCTV cameras, alarms, and alarms supplies or physical surveillance such as human intelligence, detective agents, and physical security. Surveillance is used for the prevention of crime, gathering information about an event, or finding evidence against the suspects of a crime. The Three Categories Of Surveillance There are different types of surveillance, but the major categories of surveillance used in most of the cases are as follows: Electronic Monitoring Electronic surveillance is also called wiretapping where a connection is made with the help of fax, email, internet, or telephonic communication. Different security systems such as sound and video recording cameras and CCTVs are also installed in the areas or in a house where the crime is being committed or will be committed. However, an order from the court is needed for such an investigation. In case of any proof against the suspected person, the convict is liable for punishment for the crime after getting arrested. This type of surveillance is mostly used where organized crimes by criminal organizations have taken place. Undercover Operations Undercover operations are another form of surveillance usually adopted for rescue purposes or getting information about a huge criminal organization. For example, an undercover surveillance officer will get dressed as an alcoholic and drug addict to catch the major drug smugglers who are the mastermind of the drug mafia. The officer needs to gain the trust of these groups by behaving like one of them. This kind of surveillance is risky because only a single undercover surveillance officer has to be present among such a group while the other team members are on the backend. Fixed Surveillance In fixed surveillance, technical security is used to capture and record all the information and details about a crime spot or any place where there are chances of a crime to happen. Investigators will install a recording device in a car, on a trash can, or a tree in the area in a way that all the movement and activities are easily visible and captured in it. The investigator has to make sure that the camera is fully hidden so that the criminals are not signalled of any threat to change their place and plan."

For some smaller businesses, these new rules can be hard to realize tasks. To follow a new style of working and not lose customers they should hire a professional IT services company and together analyse what to change to make business to be modern and follow new times. Hired IT company will make these transitions easy for workers and customers, economical and free from problems.

12,How Often Should You Defragment Your Computers at Work?,computers-technology," Remember back in the day when you had to defragment your hard drive regularly? This was pretty common back when Windows Vista and Windows XP were heavily used. Unfortunately enough, many companies still use these operating systems (which don’t even have support anymore from Microsoft), and your file systems can become cluttered. When your computers have heavy traffic, increasing file adding and removal can cause fragmentation of files, and the more fragmented a hard drive gets, the slower your system’s going to get. Windows 10 does this automatically, but the main problem is that many users don’t even have their computers on when their devices are supposed to do regular maintenance. Not only that but how often you’re supposed to do it varies greatly on performance as well. So the question remains – how often should a business actually defragment their files? Traffic and File Management Regularly, many companies have a server or shared devices that are networked to their systems, even in business. This means that your employees are regularly adding data to the system, saving files to it regularly, and much more. However, if you have remote solutions set up so that you have networked backups or even do regular maintenance to keep free space as much as possible (often a result of sending data to networked cloud space, then deleting the files off of local hard drives) regularly, then you are increasing the fragmentation that happens to your system. In the past, it used to be believed that the larger the files that you were deleting, the more fragmentation that’s going to occur. This ends up causing more damage to your hard drive and even your processor because it has to work harder to process data. You’ll notice that your files take longer to open when you need to defragment your drive, and more importantly, that it takes a lot longer to open your programs – even if you open and run them on a normal basis. One important thing that you need to do, though, is to be sure that you utilize Windows’ disk cleanup service first, as this can help get rid of the bulk of temporary files used up by programs first (and free up more free space). What Affects How Often I Need to Defragment? In today’s day and age, media is an extremely heavily used factor in terms of whether or not you end up needing to defrag. If you are a graphic designer and have many high-resolution files at your company, you will probably add and remove large files regularly. The same goes for media creation companies that create a lot of video and audio media. For these businesses, it may be necessary to clean up and optimize your hard drives every week. Of course, you can have your IT support team set up regular automated maintenance to do this for you on your systems. Otherwise, some programs can help you even further on your own. Defrag is Not the Same In the olden Windows days, everyone remembers the block-like graphics and simple UI of the defrag program, but with Windows 10, it’s hard to see how much fragmentation is on your drives. More importantly, Windows isn’t always accurate in terms of figuring this out. That’s where an alternate defragmenting program may come into play. One of these top-rated programs is the Auslogics Disk Defrag. It still has the same old user interface as the older one, and it’s more accurate in terms of detailed information of fragmentation. More importantly, if you have the Pro version or an older version of the software, you can optimize your hard drives, SSD drives, and more. The Final Take No matter what kind of business you run, it’s important that you defragment your virtual machines and even hard drives at least once a month. If you are continuously saving and removing data, you’re going to want to possibly defrag once every other week. If you’re dealing with large files regularly, then definitely once a week is a good idea. This will help to produce even more productivity and keep your system fresh and optimized for maximum workload so your employees can work smoothly."
13,How effectively and successfully recruit software engineers remotely?,computers-technology," During the last months, because of a lockdown, we had to adjust to the quick and unexpected changes and a new reality. Our lives started to look different from our jobs. We put on hold many things recently, but companies looking for employees and people seeking for occupation can’t wait any longer. Online headhunting isn’t as simple as it would appear at first sight. The inability to speak face to face with a potential candidate and is limited to the cameras or phones could be challenging sometimes. That’s why we give you our best tips and tricks to make this process easier. What COVID-19 changed in our work world? Many companies decided to operate fully remotely so that they were able to keep their continuity. The pandemic urges us to rethink our opinions about the importance of telework - this kind of work is sometimes regarded as easier and undemanding. But, the necessity to balance professional and personal life, lack of interpersonal relations limited only to video conferences for some of us could occur more back-breaking than we imagined. That strong experience probably permanently alters the world of work. Now, when we slowly coming back to our workplaces, the hybrid work model is more and more popular. Smaller groups in offices systematically exchange with the rest of employees working remotely at the same time. It appears as a compromise among restrictions and old habits. We are used to the conventional recruitment process in person, but the pandemic forces us to change our well-known ways and look closer at new or less often chosen solutions. The majority of recruiter activities have to be brought forward to the internet, which firstly may be received as a constraint. Seeking a software engineer on dedicated websites is nothing new, however, job ads on social media have become more and more popular these days. They could be used as a complement or as a main approach - the biggest advantage of considering this solution is increasing the possibility to find a candidate quicker and make contact effortlessly. How to be a great recruiter during a pandemic? The new reality is challenging both for recruiters and their business customers and candidates. For this reason, you should try to even look after areas like clear boundaries between personal and professional life, good relations and information management, and last but not least being understanding. Some of these points may sound clichéd to you, but in a stressful situation, we could easily forget about them. Working from home may occur its toughness in different ways - maybe have you found difficulty in systematic work or you suffer from a lack of motivation? Or maybe you have started work more and more and now you are hardly leaving your desk? We hope that you are the lucky one who didn’t feel any change, but if not we have some advice that should make your work-life balance so much better. First - make a schedule. What are your goals? What do you want to achieve during this week/month? At what time do you want to want to start and finish your work? Map out the breaks. After all, you will be able to point to things you have finished or required to take more time. This simple thing can change everything - the „to do” list and clear working hours allow you to plan your day better and be more productive. The first message is crucial - what information will be included and how its overall reception will influence later conversation. You should mention things like the name of the company, potential salary, and requirements. Candidates appreciate personalized messages and confidence that this offer was prepared specially for them. Also, you should have in your mind the balance - do not call the candidate several times a day but also do not ignore messages from them. Even if the person that you talked to weren’t hired - send them feedback and try to remember about them during later recruitment processes. When information about COVID-19 reaches us ceaselessly we can feel overwhelmed and experience a phenomenon called information overload - make use only of reliable sources to reduce this feeling and, at a pinch, be able to manage it. The new situation affects also your business partners, potential candidates, and co-workers. Increasing the feeling of insecurity could be tough, so try to mitigate it by giving as clear a message as possible and taking care of the quality of relationships with your business clients. Some people prefer contact through e-mail and have things in writing or face to face calls. Ask which solution fits better for them. What tools simplify the recruitment process? The variety of applications and programs for HR is huge, but it doesn’t mean that you have to use all of them. Test, check, try, and choose which are the best for you. However, when we experience rapid changes we want to start with foolproof tools and don’t give over more time for choosing. Below we share with our favourites. ATS and CRM ATS is an abbreviation for the applicant tracking system. The software collect and sort resumes - the best matched to the requirements are highlighted for the recruiter. Also, it helps with creating application forms and the base of candidates. It’s a great timesaver - the possibility of keyword research, organized resumes are easier to check than thousands of e-mails clogged your inbox.  Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is similar to ATS but focused on the business client when ATS mass on relations with the candidates. If you are interested in this kind of solution you could try out HubSpot - we guarantee you that missing out on the potential employee will be so much harder. Video recruitment Video interviewing platforms are an alternative for personal meetings that may occur stymied. Apart from the first connotation with a simple conversation between candidate and recruiter these platforms have many more advantages. For example, as a recruiter, you can record your questions and candidates will send their recorded answers - thanks to the fact you will be able to watch these short films over and over again to choose the best person for the job. Furthermore, there is one more benefit for the two sides - everyone could choose the most suitable time for themselves. Get it right! More complex recruitment processes could demand additional help. Trello is a virtual kanban board. If you used to have it in your office, this could be a great alternative. It enables creating boards and pipelines which makes everything uncluttered. The whole team can use one board, so everyone stays up-to-date if you actualize it regularly. Changes are coming? Our predictions One we can say for sure - changes are happening now. It’s not only because of COVID-19 - it accelerates them, but they have been in the air for some time. Companies started to look favourably at fully remote employees after positive experiences with remote recruitment and work - it’s an opportunity for people living in different cities, countries, and even continents (but then remember about team agreements - rules obligatory for co-workers). Trust in employees increases - a lot of them will not come back to the office or will be there from time to time. Corporations noticed that people working from home still are diligent and professional. They decided to bring on „remote only” mode because more valuable than the person behind the desk is their efficiency at work. Even though the labour market seems inimical, IT still needs new people. Software engineers, IT specialists, and software testers will be urgently wanted. More remotely work equals more sensitive data online requiring better protection - specialists in this area also will be welcomed.  The pandemic time puts us to the test but also shows many new opportunities and unexpected ways of growing our carriers and developing skills."

16,Trouble-free File Server Access and Search for Macs,computers-technology," Acronis Files Connect (formerly ExtremeZ-IP) has been the leader in solving Mac/Windows integration issues for over 15 years. It addresses file corruptions, slow searches, and incompatibilities in accessing Windows file and print servers and NAS devices. Acronis Files Connect 10.7 includes a number of new features and enhancements aimed to make everyday workflows of both Mac users and Mac administrators easier and more productive, such as a new Mac client application and improved search capabilities. NEW MAC CLIENT APPLICATION Simplified file share location A new Mac client application acts as a handy unified interface to quickly locate and access all file shares and DFS resources available on your network via both AFP and SMB. The brand-new application enables users to bypass the process of individually working with file servers and mounting file shares, providing one simple window into all available resources. Fast, powerful search capabilities Use a new Mac menu bar tool or the Mac client application interface to perform nearly instant filename and full-content Spotlight searches. Searches can target one, many, or all available file shares for enterprise-wide search. Advanced search query parameters are available, including Windows and Mac file tags. View and add available printers Browse a list of all network printers hosted by Acronis Files Connect. Quickly add printers to your Mac. Spotlight search for SMB file shares Put an end to painfully slow, filename only search of SMB file shares. Acronis Files Connect now supports search indexing of SMB file shares, providing fast full-content search for Mac users connecting to shares via SMB. With the new Mac client, each file share volume added to an Acronis Files Connect server can be configured in two ways: as an AFP file share with Network Spotlight search, or in a mode, when Macs locate files and folders using the search capabilities of the client and then connect to the file server or NAS by using SMB. SPOTLIGHT SEARCH IMPROVEMENTS Real-time search index updates. Provide up-to-date search results when using Acronis Content Indexing with local and Network Reshare volumes. Acronis Files Connect continuously monitors for changes in file shares, even when indexing remote content on other file servers or NAS, enabling near real-time search results, even when using our Network Reshare feature. File content indexing limits. Control the size of your search indexes with new Acronis Content Indexing, which provides the ability to limit file content indexing. Acronis Files Connect can be configured to only index the first few MB of each file on your server, reducing search index size dramatically when many large files are involved. File indexing exclusion rules. Further control your search indexes by excluding a subset of folders or file types from Acronis Content Indexing. File exclusions can be configured on a per file share basis, allowing content that is not necessary for indexing to be omitted. Intelligent handling of archived files. Acronis Content Indexing will detect and omit file system archiving 'stub' files from search indexing. This allows nearly instant Spotlight search to be enabled for a file share, even if it is being managed by an hierarchical storage management (HSM) / file-system archiving solution. Integrated Windows Search controls. View the indexing status and issue a reindex command for a file share you've selected to index with Windows Search services, directly from the Acronis Files Connect admin console. File shares configured in Acronis Files Connect to use Windows Search will now be automatically configured for indexing, if they are not already being indexed. You'll no longer need to handle this separately. Windows and Mac file tags search. Perform searches for files that have standard Windows or Mac file tags added to them. Acronis Files Connect now translates Windows tags so they can be viewed within a file's 'Get Info' details on the Mac. DFS CONNECT IS NOW INCLUDED IN THE BASE LICENSE The ""DFS Connect"" features, which were previously available as an add-on to perpetual Acronis Files Connect licenses, are now included in the base product license. All versions of Acronis Files Connect will allow publishing your DFS namespace to Mac users via the new Mac client application. Select whether Mac users connect to each target server in the namespace via AFP or SMB. This allows flexibility in where you install Acronis Files Connect.

17,The Point of Sale Kiosks Are the Wave of the Future For All,computers-technology," The Point of Sale Kiosks Are the Wave of the Future For All The potential for Point of sale kiosks at the retail level is extremely wide. These self-serve kiosks enable customers to book appointments, order products, and find out more information about certain products from their own homes without taking employees off of the floor and having them go to a computer to input data manually. What Drives Point of Sale Kiosks The technology that is currently in place allows for kiosks to be used for the purpose of selling. This can take the form of a physical store that displays the product while an associate enters the data manually into a handheld device. This is also very useful if the kiosk itself is a kiosk, where the customer can simply walk up and take the item from the display to their hand. This can be extremely convenient for a consumer who wants to purchase a specific product. In the case of these kiosks in retail stores, they are extremely popular. The problem is, these devices cost money. They are expensive. And they aren't used every day, which means they aren't being used as much as they could be. To some people, this doesn't make sense, but there are those who see these devices as necessary and inevitable. Establishments Using Point of Sale Kiosks Restaurants Point of sale kiosks is being used more in restaurants. Restaurants have a greater tendency to place larger items such as coffee cups on their tables rather than more specialized items like tea kettles and refrigerators. The reason for this is simple; it saves money for the restaurant and it allows the business to save on labor costs. Many of these kiosks are used for displaying menus and for taking credit card payments. However, many are also used for displaying coupons, so the restaurant is able to earn money in two ways: the sales it makes and the amount of money spent by customers who have taken the time to print the coupons. Hospitals Kiosks are also used in hospitals, which make use of them for similar reasons. Most hospitals are located near busy streets and busy shopping areas. Since most people shop at a fast pace when walking, they often make mistakes when trying to shop for medicine at the hospital kiosk, which leads to them not being able to buy from a pharmacy or getting the wrong size of medicine for their prescriptions. Airports They are used at airports to allow travelers to complete their check-in and baggage claims. They are often installed in areas with a high volume of travelers, which helps travelers avoid being stranded at the airport. Theme Parks These kiosks can also be installed at theme parks, cruise ships, airports, hotels, etc. to allow tourists to easily enter the areas they are visiting without having to leave the comfort of their homes. These kiosks often display maps and even offer free Wi-Fi, making it easy to connect and navigate to areas you are interested in. Malls Point of sale kiosks is also used at malls, which allow shoppers to purchase products they want from a kiosk. Many people find these kiosks convenient because they can scan products as they are entering their name and address to ensure they will get the items they need before leaving. Businesses Lastly, it can also be used in businesses. There are several business owners who install these types of devices at their stores. The kiosks display products that are offered for sale and allow customers to pick and choose them according to what they wish to purchase. These items can be anything from toys to gift cards. These kiosks usually have labels which allow customers to print out the information for future use, and then redeem the product for a cash payment. and then put the label back on the item to be purchased. This can be a convenient way to receive items a shopper wishes to receive but isn't in stock. To Wrap Things Up The Point of sale kiosks is useful for everyone who has to deal with customers in the retail sector. They are efficient, cost-effective, and allow for savings for both business and individual consumers. There is no question about whether these devices are the wave of the future for both businesses and individuals."
18,Protect your digital assets with drive image backup software,computers-technology," Almost every computer user has lost important data on at least one occasion. Whether it is due to accidentally formatting a drive or deleting a volume or partition, there are many human factors that can lead to widespread data loss. On top of that, there is always the risk of a serious hardware failure and consequent destruction of all data on the device. These are just some of the reasons why everyone needs to think about backing up their data. It is even more important to have a comprehensive way to back up and restore systems for business users, or anyone else who stores important content on their drives. And there is no better way to back up local machines, such as your desktop or laptop computer, than by creating a complete disk image that contains a copy of every byte of information on the drive. TeraByte Drive Image Backup and Restore is designed to do exactly that. It is far more than just another backup solution. It protects everything on a hard drive, including the operating systems, programs, and every individual file on the volume. This means there is no chance of missing something, as every byte of data will be recorded in a single file. The program can even make a copy of blank sectors, so the image is literally a complete virtual copy of the entire drive. You can then save the image directly to a large enough external drive, optical disc or even a USB drive. However, it is a good idea to keep a backup stored online as well, since a serious problem could also damage or destroy any local backups you have as well. You can send your backups to any mapped external drive, such as cloud storage. One of the many unique features of TeraByte Drive Image Backup is that you can continue using your computer while backups are in progress. The software uses the Volume Shadow Copy Service in Windows to do this but, if the VSS won't start for any reason, it can fall back to PHYLock automatically. Although any modification you make to the contents of the drive won't be backed up while the backup is in progress, it will ensure everything that was on the drive when the process started is safely backed up without any risk of data corruption. Since it can take a while to create a complete image of a typical large modern hard drive, this is a very useful feature to have. In the end, this eliminates many of the inconsistencies often found when creating an image of a partition or drive that is already in use. With TeraByte, you can extract individual files instead of having to do a full restore, which can save a lot of time. You can also mount images as physical drives and make them available to virtual machines which can access logical drives too. Mounted drives can be modified and backed up again too. TeraByte also includes lets you restore your images by extracting them onto a suitable drive. This is extremely useful if you are upgrading or replacing your PC or hard drive and want to avoid having to manually reinstall everything.

1,"FINTECH TRENDS: AI, SMART CONTRACTS, NEOBANKS, INSURETECH, REGTECH, OPEN BANKING AND BLOCKCHAIN",computers-technology," What Is Fintech? ""Fintech"" describes the new technology integrated into various spheres to improve and automate all aspects of financial services provided to individuals and companies. Initially, this word was used for the tech behind the back-end systems of big banks and other organizations. And now it covers a wide specter of finance-related innovations in multiple industries, from education to crypto-currencies and investment management. While traditional financial institutions offer a bundle of services, fintech focuses on streamlining individual offerings, making them affordable, often one-click experience for users. This impact can be described with the word ""disruption"" - and now, to be competitive, banks and other conventional establishments have no choice but to change entrenched practices through cooperation with fintech startups. A vivid example is Visa's partnership with Ingo Money to accelerate the process of digital payments. Despite the slowdown related to the Covid-19 epidemic, the fintech industry will recover momentum and continue to change the finance world's face. Originally published on Blackhorn Vision Website Fintech users Fintech users fall into four main categories. Such trends as mobile banking, big data, and unbundling of financial services will create an opportunity for all of them to interact in novel ways: B2B - banks and their business clients B2C - small enterprises and individual consumers The main target group for consumer-oriented fintech is millennials - young, ready to embrace digital transformation and accumulating wealth. What needs do they have? According to the Credit Carma survey, 85% of millennials in the USA suffer from burnout syndrome and have no energy to think about managing their personal finances. Therefore, any apps that automate and streamline these processes have a good chance to become popular. They need an affordable personal financial assistant that can do the following 24/7: Analyze spending behaviors, recurrent payments, bills, debts Present an overview of their current financial situation Provide coaching and improve financial literacy What they expect to achieve: Stop overspending (avoid late bills, do smart shopping with price comparison, cancel unnecessary subscriptions, etc.) Develop saving habits, get better organized Invest money (analyze deposit conditions in different banks, form an investment portfolio, etc.) The fintech industry offers many solutions that can meet all these goals - not only on an individual but also on a national scale. However, in many countries, there is still a high percentage of unbanked people - not having any form of a bank account. According to the World Bank report, this number was 1.7 billion people in 2017. Mistrust to new technologies, poverty, and financial illiteracy are the obstacles for this group to tap into the huge potential of fintech. Therefore, businesses and governments must direct the inclusion efforts towards this audience as all stakeholders will benefit from it. Apparently, affordable and easy-to-get fintech services customized for this huge group of first-time users will be a big trend in the future. Big Data, AI, ML in fintech According to an Accenture report, AI integration will boost corporate profits in many industries, including fintech, by almost 40% by 2035, which equals a staggering $14 trillion. Without a doubt, Big Data technologies, such as Streaming Analytics, In-memory computing, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning, will be the powerhouse behind numerous business objectives banks, credit unions, and other institutions strive to achieve: Aggregate and interpret massive amounts of structured and unstructured data in real-time. With the help of predictive analytics, make accurate future forecasts, identify potential problems (e.g., credit scoring, investment risks) Build optimal strategies based on analytical reports Facilitate decision-making Segment clients for more personalized offers and thus increase retention. Detect suspicious behavior, prevent identity fraud and other types of cybercrime, make transactions more secure with such technologies as face and voice recognition. Find and extend new borrower pools among the no-file/thin-file segment, widely represented by Gen Z (the successors of millennials), who lack or have a short credit history. Automate low-value tasks (e.g., such back-office operations as internal technical requests) Cut operational expenses by streamlining processes (e.g., image recognition algorithms for scanning, parsing documents, and taking further actions based on regulations) and reducing man-hours. Considerably improve client experience with conversational user interfaces, available 24/7, and capable of resolving any issues instantly. Conversational banking is used by many big banks worldwide; some companies integrate financial chatbots for processing payments in social media. Neobanks Digital or internet-only banks do not have brick-and-mortar branches and operate exclusively online. The word neobank became widely used in 2017 and referred to two types of app-based institutions - those that provided financial services with their own banking license and those partnering with traditional banks. Wasting time in lines and paperwork - this inconvenience is the reason why bank visits are predicted to fall to just four visits a year by 2022. Neobanks, e.g., Revolut, Digibank, FirstDirect, offer a wide range of services - global payments and P2P transfers, virtual cards for contactless transactions, operations with cryptocurrencies, etc., and the fees are lower than with traditional banks. Clients get support through in-app chat. Among the challenges associated with digital banking are higher susceptibility to fraud and lower trustworthiness due to the lack of physical address. In the US, the development of neobanks faced regulatory obstacles. However, the situation is changing for the better. Smart contracts A smart contract is a software that allows automatic execution and control of agreements between buyers and sellers. How does it work? If two parties want to agree on a transaction, they no longer need a paper document and a lawyer. They sign the agreement with cryptographic keys digitally. The document itself is encoded in a tamper-proof manner. The role of witnesses is performed by a decentralized blockchain network of computing devices that receive copies of the contract, and the code guarantees the fulfillment of its provisions, with all transactions transparent, trackable, and irreversible. This sky-high level of reliability and security make any fintech operation possible in any spot of the world, any time. The parties to the contract can be anonymous, and there is no need for other authorities to regulate or enforce its implementation. Open banking Open banking is a system that allows third parties to access bank and non-bank financial institutions data through APIs (application programming interfaces) to create a network. Third-party service providers, such as tech startups, upon user consent, aggregate these data through apps and apply them to identify, for instance, the best financial products, such as savings account with the highest interest rate. Networked accounts will allow banks to accurately calculate mortgage risks and offer the best terms to low-risks clients. Open banking will also help small companies save time with online accounting and will play an important role in fraud detection. Services like Mint require users to provide credentials for each account, although such practice has security risks, and data processing is not always accurate. ÀPIs are a better option as they allow direct data sharing without accessing login and password. Consumer security is still compromised, and this is one of the main reasons why the open banking trend hasn't taken off yet. Many banks worldwide cannot provide open APIs of sufficient quality to meet existing regulatory standards. There are still a lot of blind spots, including those related to technology. However, open banking is a promising trend. The Accenture report offers many interesting insights. Blockchain and cryptocurrencies The distributed ledger technology - Blockchain, which is the basis of many cryptocurrencies, will continue to transform the face of global finance, with the US and China being global adoption leaders. The most valuable feature of a blockchain database is that data cannot be altered or deleted once it has been written. This high level of security makes it perfect for big data apps across various sectors, including healthcare, insurance, energy, banking, etc., especially those dealing with confidential information. Although the technology is still in the early stages of its development and will eventually become more suited to the needs of fintech, there are already Blockchain-based innovative solutions both from giants, like Microsoft and IBM, and numerous startups. The philosophy of decentralized finance has already given rise to a variety of peer to peer financing platforms and will be the source of new cryptocurrencies, perhaps even national ones. Blockchain considerably accelerates transactions between banks through secure servers, and banks use it to build smart contracts. The technology is also growing in popularity with consumers. Since 2009, when Bitcoin was created, the number of Blockchain wallet users has reached 52 million. A wallet is a layer of security known as ""tokenization""- payment information is sent to vendors as tokens to associate the transaction with the right account. Regtech Regtech or regulation technology is represented by a group of companies, e.g., IdentityMind Global, Suade, Passfort, Fund Recs, providing AI-based SaaS solutions to help businesses comply with regulatory processes. These companies process complex financial data and combine them with information on previous regulatory failures to detect potential risks and design powerful analytical tools. Finance is a conservative industry, heavily regulated by the government. As the number of technology companies providing financial services is increasing, problems associated with compliance with such regulations also multiply. For instance, processes automation makes fintech systems vulnerable to hacker attacks, which can cause serious damage. Responsibility for such security breaches and misuse of sensitive data, prevention of money laundering, and fraud are the main issues that concern state institutions, service providers, and consumers. There will be over 2.6 billion biometric users of payment systems by 2023, so the regtech application area is huge. In the EU, PSD2 and SCA aim to regulate payments and their providers. Although these legal acts create some regulatory obstacles for fintech innovations, the European Commission also proposes a series of alleviating changes, for instance, taking off the table paper documents for consumers. In the US, fintech companies must comply with outdated financial legislation. The silver lining is the new FedNow service for instantaneous payments, which is likely to be launched in 2023–2024 and provides a ready public infrastructure. Insuretech The insurance industry, like many others, needs streamlining to be more efficient and cost-effective and meet the demand of time. Insurtech companies are exploring new possibilities, such as ultra-customization of policies, behavior-based dynamic premium pricing, based on data from Internet-enabled devices, such as GPS navigators and fitness activity trackers, AI brokerages, on-demand insurance for micro-events, etc., through a new generation of smart apps. As we mentioned before, the insurance business is also subject to strict government regulations, and it requires close cooperation of traditional insurers and startups to make a breakthrough that will benefit everyone. Fintech solutions with Blackthorn vision Even knowing the current trends, it is hard to predict where the fintech industry will be in 10 years' time. Without a doubt, its further development will boost many other spheres, like eCommerce, and create numerous opportunities for all market players. Traditional banking is declining, one of the reasons being the Covid-19 epidemic, which boosts the demand for financial apps with a contactless, transparent, and seamless experience. Software that will help users master various aspects of finance effortlessly, engage new audiences, ruin borders, and create additional value for all stakeholders is what the market needs now.

5,How to Earn Money from Email Marketing. Email Marketing for Beginners:,computers-technology," This post is all about email marketing and why it is so powerful to build and expand your business. It also talks about how to earn massive amounts of money from email marketing while you sleep. Not only that, but you will also find out how you can build your email list from zero to 10k and continue to grow that. Before we start, know that email marketing can really help you grow just any business online so you can reach that goal of ultimate freedom. You can generate 500 to 600 leads per day just by following a few simple steps. In this post, we will discuss the ""email marketing beginner guide"" and why and how you should be using email marketing services to your benefit and also what are the top-notch tools to get you where you want. How to Start Building an Email List? Wondering how to build an email list from scratch or continue to add quality subscribers? Learn how to develop a healthy email list that will deliver an amazing return on investment and help you grow your customer base. Email is the most effective marketing channel on the planet because you get to talk directly to the people who want to hear from you. This opens up amazing opportunities to build relationships and sell your products and services. But before you jump for joy, there is 1 major hurdle—building a high-quality email list. Your subscribers are the lifeblood of your email marketing strategy. You need to grow your list to keep your campaigns healthy. How? By understanding what your audience needs, you can create compelling offers that entice more people to sign up to your list. And when it’s time for someone to opt-in, MailerLite provides the signup forms and landing pages that you need to collect subscriber email addresses. 10 STEPS GUIDE TO START AN EMAIL LIST Step 1 – Choose your email marketing provider If you want to send out emails as a business and not to your best friend or sis, you need to use a so-called email marketing provider. There are tons of options but the ones that I recommend are Mailchimp, Aweber,Convertkit and Getresponse. Step 2 – Set up your email marketing account Sign up with your chosen email marketing provider and set it up Step 3 – Create an opt-in form for your website Next you want people to be able to sign up to your list through your website. Mailchimp and ConvertKit both have forms that you set up and then simply add to your WordPress website. In your form, describe in a few words what people can expect when they sign up. Step 4 – Write your first newsletter Before you start sending out random notes or shout out stuff you want to promote to your subscribers, think about how you can best serve them. Step 5 – Create a welcome message Your welcome message is the first email your new subscribers will get automatically after they’ve signed up to your list and confirmed their subscription. Here first impressions absolutely matter. That’s why you should put some effort into your welcome message. In your message you want to acknowledge how grateful you are to the folks who actually took the time to subscribe to your list. So, start with saying “Thank You” Step 6 – Design a freebie People freaking LOVE getting freebies. Offering someone an unexpected gift is one of the quickest ways to form a bond with that person. And when that gift or freebie that you give someone who signs up for your email list happens to be totally awesome, beautiful, inspiring or helpful? Instant love and connection happens. Here are a few common types of opt-in freebies: a workbook a checklist a cheat sheet a video tutorial an email course a discount code a PDF guide Step 7 – Create a landingpage When you have your amazing freebie, you want to promote it and show it to as many people as possible. But if it’s hidden somewhere on your homepage not everybody will find it and people will get distracted by everything else going on. That’s where a landing page comes in. On your landing page you introduce your freebie, tell people what they get, and give them the possibility to sign up for it. Nothing else! You share the link to this page as much as possible, for example put it in your Instagram profile, post it on Pinterest and in Facebook groups. Step 8 – Drive traffic to your freebie Now that you’ve created a kickass freebie – it’s time to GET IT OUT THERE! There are a million and one ways you can promote your freebie, but here are a few of my favorites: In social media posts In your social media bios In a blog post In your sidebar on your website In Facebook groups In forums or other places your readers hang out In guest posts on other websites As a quick one-liner or “PS” in the signature field of your emails, below your name & contact info. The worst thing you can do is spend days actually creating the freebie, and then not spend enough time promoting it! Step 9 – Create a content plan Having a plan is the key to consistency. First, brainstorm topics and look up upcoming events you want to promote. Next, plan your newsletters for the next 2-3 months so you’ll know about every event or update that’s coming up or promotions you can include in your emails. This strategy will prevent any last-minute disaster, you can make your email newsletters in a comfortable way and prevent sending random, unstructured emails. Step 10 – Test, test, test Taking some time to test each email thoroughly before you send it out is super important. Read it at least twice and check all the links. Next comes testing different options to improve your performance, like for example: Which day of the week leads to higher open rates? What subject lines are most effective? Should you use a different name in the “From” field? Testing EVERYTHING is the secret of successful marketeers. How else will you know if what you’re doing is working? The Power of Email Marketing - Why Build Email Lists? Imagine this. You have built an email list of 20,000 people. Only 500 of them open your broadcast email. Out of those 500, only 10 people purchased the offer. Now the product you were trying to target your audience paid you $100 in commissions or sales. This makes you $1,000 right in your pocket. For what? Only sending one email. Makes sense? Read again. If you have a well-targeted and niched email list of people who you send a valuable offer to. And you have built trust with them over time through your content (emails). Some percentage of those people will buy from you. And this can be extremely rewarding for you. That is the power of email marketing. Businesses have gone out and sky-rocketed their sales by using this simple strategy. If you are not using this powerful tool to benefit your business, you are leaving a lot of money on the table. When you grow a sizeable email list in a specific niche and you have continuous communication with them, at a push of a button, you can make money via one email. No long waiting, no hours and hours of endless work and no leaving money on the table anymore."
6,Remote Desktop vs VPN - Everything You Need To Know,computers-technology," While we're constantly connecting to remote servers to browse the web, talk to our friends and play games, getting unfettered access comes from one of two ways: a Remote Desktop (RDP) and a Virtual Private Network (VPN). These are two very different beasts. Both have clear differences and a number of pros and cons as well. In this article, we'll drill down to explain the difference between the two, so keep on reading for this comparison between RDP vs VPN to decide which is the best solution for your needs. What is an RDP? An RDP is a software that allows you to connect with another computer system wirelessly, giving you complete access to a different computer. It doesn't matter if the computer is in the same building, or thousands of miles away, you can easily connect to and use it as if you were physically there. Some popular RDPs include RealVNC, Netviewer, LogMeIn, Teamviewer, Citrix and Apple Screen Sharing. On a Remote Desktop, you effectively take control of the whole system, which also means that it's usually not available to the person physically being seated at that computer. All keystrokes and mouse movements are sent to the remote desktop through the Internet. The screen, on the other hand, is sent to the user so they can see what is happening. What is a VPN? A VPN is much different as compared to an RDP. While using a VPN service, your device connects to a VPN server. You cannot directly control this server, which is the case with an RDP. A VPN acts like a tunnel for your communications and allows you to change your IP address so that you can remain secure and anonymous online. When connected to a VPN, you continue to use your device instead of an external one. However, your device stays protected against a plethora of online threats and your virtual location changes which bring other advantages. RDP vs VPN When it comes to comparing RDP vs VPN, there are 4 main concerns. These include: Security Whether you want to remotely access a device or network, security should always be the top priority. As you connect to an outside resource, you leave yourself open to a variety of vulnerabilities. A VPN is perfect from a security standpoint and encrypts your connection with military-grade encryption, which considerably reduces the risk of intrusion or theft of data. RDPs, on the other hand, use encrypted channels to provide a safe remote environment. However, some clients may not be compatible with this encryption. That's why most experts recommend using RDP over VPN as a solution to this security woe. Flexibility If you want to gain access to a network and its resources from anywhere, a VPN can help. However, RDPs give you complete control over a local computer from a remote location, unlike VPNs. So, the latter is better than the former in terms of flexibility. But one must consider that a VPN does more than screen-sharing, increasing your online privacy and security all the while providing remote access to a network. So, in the end, it all comes down to what your needs are precisely. Usability RDPs can only be set up and used on desktop or laptop computers. They also require high Internet speeds in order to function smoothly, but in most instances continue to lag despite that. VPNs can be used on any device of your choice as there are user-friendly apps available for all major platforms. Most of them can also be used on your browser as an extension or add-on. They slow down your connection to some extent, but can increase your speed in some instances. Cost VPNs are generally cost-friendly in comparison to RDPs. Many VPN providers also offer seasonal deals and offers allowing users to get their hands on a subscription at a reasonably discounted price. RDP or VPN or Both? It depends on your situation and whether you're a business or individual. For Businesses: VPNs should be used by employees to provide safe access to the Internet when using public Wi-Fi networks VPNs must be deployed by employees to ensure secure remote access to the corporate network and its resources If your employees need to access and use a standalone system from a remote location, use an RDP If your IT team requires to remotely access employees' computers, they can easily perform troubleshooting and maintenance activities with an RDP For Individuals: If you want to access the Internet safely, privately and freely, use a VPN For streaming unavailable content from anywhere, use a VPN Avoid intrusive government surveillance, use a VPN If you need to access your home computer from a remote location or allow a trusted acquaintance to do so, use an RDP Get secure remote access with PureVPN in just $0.99.

8,How Mobile Phone Towers Could Help Monitor Rainfall in Developing Countries,computers-technology," Many developing economies experience the ill effects of an absence of dependable precipitation estimations because of an absence of assets and a lack of gear -, for example, checks and radars. Regardless of whether nations are outfitted with these checking instruments, they all have constraints. Downpour measures, meteorological instruments that gather falling water drops, just give an extremely nearby perception. In any case, the power of precipitation can be totally not the same as one area to another, occasionally regardless of whether it's not exactly two or three many meters away. Radars utilize radio waves to get precipitation appraises however they may not generally be productive. For instance, their pillars may get impeded in uneven areas. Earth-watching satellites can likewise give appraisals of downpour. These are produced using space, utilizing distant sensors. Nonetheless, the spatial pictures are coarse, making it difficult to break down precipitation dissemination across small regions on the ground. These imperatives present issues with regards to checking crop yields in light of the fact that numerous smallholder ranchers in developing economies depend on downpour took care of farming. Exact precipitation estimations are fundamental to ranchers. For instance, for anticipation of over water system - this would prompt water sparing and more effective utilization of manures. Precise estimations are additionally attractive for precipitation based protection, a significant asset to relieve hazard for ranchers in developing nations. In our examination adventure, we utilize business microwave joins - remote associations between mobile phone towers - from various areas on the planet, as a successful ease approach to assess precipitation. This adds to past investigations which have indicated the equivalent. Nonetheless, the greater part of the scholarly work done as such far has been directed in developed nations pointing essentially to hydro-meteorological applications, for example, flood forecast. Our drive centers around developing this methodology for farming needs in developing economies. Utilizing business microwave joins Business microwave joins are remote associations which move information between mobile phone towers. These connections are generally conveyed, a few many meters over the ground, by mobile phone suppliers everywhere on the world. Precipitation lessens the sign quality of radio pillars between the communicating and getting towers. Subsequently, we can gauge how much precipitation there depends on changes in the nature of the electromagnetic signs. The framework can be arranged so flags between towers are recorded over brief timeframe periods; for example, like clockwork. This makes it valuable for downpour checking This strategy has been shown in different spots over the world, including Israel, the Netherlands, Germany, the Czech Republic, and that's only the tip of the iceberg. Lately, endeavors have been made by the scholarly network and the private division to advance the utilization of this strategy in developing nations. Nonetheless, as far as logical distributions, up to this point just a couple of papers have been distributed. In our exploration adventure, we break down information from various mobile phone suppliers. A case of such an examination as of late showed the conceivable preferred position of business microwave joins, over downpour measures, to distinguish precipitation in a rural field. This was at a tea ranch close to the town of Kericho, in western Kenya. Precipitation gauges, procured by various connections, were contrasted and estimations from downpour measures found nearby them. While a convincing connection was seen between the connection estimations and downpour measures, the downpour check technique missed a total blustery scene. Despite the fact that the measure is more exact, it gives just a nearby perception. This exhibits that there's gigantic potential in utilizing microwave joins in developing nations, where climate observing abilities are regularly restricted. A reasonable minimal effort arrangement Numerous pinnacles are introduced in far off zones. This implies perceptions would now be able to occur in places that have been difficult to access previously or where precipitation has never been estimated. Moreover, the usage cost is low on the grounds that the information is as of now gathered and logged by numerous mobile phone administrators throughout their administration quality. Thinking about the versatility, and relative simplicity of establishment of the remote technology in the field, the absolute number of introduced connections will probably keep on developing, including especially, in Africa. In this manner, the proposed strategy is required to be accessible, and feasible, into what's to come. In any case, there are impediments. Business microwave joins were intended for correspondence needs, not estimating precipitation. Thus, significant vulnerabilities in estimations do occur. For instance, in country zones, since towers are sparser, the connection lengths will be longer than in metropolitan territories. Actually, in this circumstance the connections are worked in shaft frequencies that are less touchy to precipitation. Because of the lower thickness of the connection organization and the lower affectability of each connection for this situation, readings will be less exact. Hence, an ideal methodology is utilizing this technology as a supplement to existing instruments like downpour measures, radars and satellites. That being stated, considering the numerous situations where there are no checking resources by any means, the capacity to give data with respect to precipitation in the zone utilizing mobile phone pinnacles would in any case be important."
9,When to replace your smartphone battery,computers-technology," When you purchase another cell phone, how long do you anticipate that it should last? Two years? Possibly three? Regardless of the occasionally out of this world retail costs, we will in general supplant our cell phones more oftentimes than any of our other costly electronic gadgets. It doesn't need to be like this. Around the time early cell phones from Apple and Google began to hit racks in the last part of the 2000s, the customary model for purchasing a Smart phone from your transporter worked this way: You would pursue a two-year contract and in return you'd get a free (or modest) phone whose cost was incorporated with the cost of your regularly scheduled installment. When your two years were up, transporters would bait you back with a ""redesign"" that reestablished your agreement, gave you another Smart phone and perhaps got the old Smart phone from you. This worked fine for old flip phones, and particularly less expensive Cell phone that probably won't keep going long. In any case, this model accompanied a unintended result. It prepared clients to expect overhauls at regular intervals. That demonstrated exorbitant to transporters that couldn't eat the expense of progressively costly cell phones. In this way, they changed to another model. Around the mid-2010s, transporters began decoupling Smart phone costs from administration contracts. Under the new model, you'd address a set cost for your administration and a different month to month cost for your Smart phone. Unexpectedly, it turned out to be clear how costly cell phones truly were. After that progress, Smart phone purchasers began to overhaul less frequently. As per an investigation by HYLA Mobile, the normal exchange gadget in 2016 was 2.38 years old. By 2018, that number expanded to 2.77. For iPhones, which have gotten fairly costly lately, it climbed much higher to 2.92 years old. At the end of the day, since Smart phone costs turned out to be more straightforward, individuals have begun keeping them longer. But, three years is as yet a relatively short life for such a costly contraption. A $700 PC may last three to five years, while a $1,000-in addition to PC could last a few more. All in all, for what reason don't Cell phone keep going that long? Some portion of the explanation might be on the grounds that battery replacement is hard. . Numerous PCs have removable batteries. On the off chance that the battery won't hold a charge, you can simply purchase a substitution. Most cell phones, then again, have underlying batteries that are hard to supplant or fix. As per Kay-Kay Clapp, the head of interchanges and backing at iFixit, a site that urges individuals to fix their own gadgets (and distributes advisers for help them), Apple's ""Batterygate"" was a defining moment for shoppers. Straightforward fixes will add long periods of life to your phone Contingent upon what Phone you have, you might have the option to fix it all alone. iFixit separates the most well known Cell phone and gives them a repairability score. Most of the cell phones have gotten less repairable in the course of recent years,"" Ms. Clapp said. Regardless of whether you fix a Smart Phone yourself or take it to an assistance place, there are a couple of normal parts that can make your Smart phone last more. Supplanting your Smart phone's battery will get you more mileage than some other fix. Ms. Clapp said. ""Consider it like tires. Regardless of whether you don't run over a kitchen blade on the expressway, you must supplant them. They're consumable."" On the off chance that you've clutched a Smart phone for a very long time, it may not hold a charge the manner in which it used to. As Apple's ""Batterygate"" discussion uncovered, this can likewise prompt your Smart phone easing back down or closing off arbitrarily. The more you charge and exhaust batteries, the more they debase. ""iPhone can hold up to 80 percent of its limit after 500 completed cycles, So you're essentially taking a gander at 80% of your new battery 18 months to two years in."" Replacing the battery gives you another 500 cycles or thereabouts, which can expand the life of your Smart phone another couple of years. Apple will supplant an out-of-guarantee battery for $50 to $70, which is extensively not exactly the expense of supplanting your Smart phone. The screen is another repairable component. Regardless of whether you utilize a case, dropping your phone can split or break the screen. The screen is typically one of the most costly parts, so regardless of whether you do the fix yourself, it can even now be expensive (yet less expensive than purchasing another Smart phone). Screen fix packs accompany all that you have to fix a broke presentation, including the screen and the digitizer — the part that recognizes where you tap your finger — and most incorporate the instruments you'll requirement for the substitution. Most famous  phones have numerous units you can purchase on the web. Now and again, you might have the option to supplant only the glass, which can be significantly less expensive"

16,Tips For Choosing A Reputable Web Hosting Company,computers-technology," Are you in the process of changing your web host? Do you want to know how to go about choosing a web hosting company? If that is the case, you have come to the right place. In this article, we will discuss how you should not focus only on the initial price of web hosting when choosing a web host. There are thousands of web hosting companies out there and it can be a challenging experience to find the right one. It becomes more challenging as every company tries to get new customers by offering a significant discount on the first payment. Many beginners are fooled by these significant discounts and end up signing a long-term contract with a web hosting company that is often only interested in selling as much web hosting plans as possible without really caring about the quality of their web hosting service. Therefore, the first rule of choosing a web hosting company is to not choose someone based on the discounts they offer on the first payment. The most important thing that matters when it comes to choosing a web hosting company is the uptime. After all, you expect your website to be up at all times as a customer can visit the website at any time of the day and you would want your website to be available. Therefore, uptime is the most important parameter and ideally, you should go with a web hosting company that offers an uptime guarantee. Most web hosting companies offering an uptime guarantee usually mention it on their homepage prominently. In addition to the uptime guarantee, the other important thing you need to care about is the customer support. If you are not a techno-whiz as most people aren’t, you might need to get in touch with the technical support team frequently. It could be due to a web hosting issue or your website being down or for making changes to your website or for any other reason. It has been observed that web hosting companies that sign up customers by offering them significant discounts typically have poor customer service. Their technical staff often read solutions from a script and do not have any kind of technical knowledge. In short, they might not be able to help you with any kind of technical issues. There have been many horror stories posted online by users who were surprised to find that their web hosting companies do not maintain any kind of backups or they are unable to serve their customers because their websites remain down for an extended period of time on a frequent basis. This is all due to these web hosting companies outsourcing their customer service to cheap freelancers who do not know anything about web hosting technology. Therefore, pay special attention to the customer support. Make sure they offer customer support through email, phone as well as live chat. More importantly, their customer support techs should be knowledgeable and should be able to solve your issues. The right way to check the quality of their customer support is by checking forums and review websites dedicated to web hosting. On these platforms, you should find reviews from real users who have interacted with the customer service team of a particular web hosting company. Overall, the two most important things that matter is the uptime guarantee and customer service of a web hosting company. Therefore, do not choose a web hosting company only because they are offering some kind of significant discount for new customers. Choose a company that is known to be reliable and excellent customer service that can solve your issues when it matters the most."

18,Why Is SEO So Slow - Legit SEO Takes Some Time To Deliver Results,computers-technology," If you plan to hire a search engine optimisation company and you have already met a few legitimate companies, you might be wondering why all these genuine companies do not guarantee number one rankings and tell you to be patient when it comes to search engine optimisation. On the other hand, you might have also come across SEO agencies offering quick results or guaranteed page 1 rankings, and other such things. The truth is that search engine optimisation is hard and takes a long time to deliver results. You might also be wondering why people opt for SEO when there are other avenues that deliver quick results such as PPC ads or social media marketing or other kinds of paid advertising. The advantage of SEO is that the traffic remains stable for a long period of time once you achieve your SEO objectives in terms of rankings or traffic. Also, organic rankings bring a lot of additional benefits in terms of increase in trustworthiness in the eyes of the consumers. After all, consumers inherently trust the organic search results and an organic listing on the front page is always going to have better brand awareness and better trust ratings. Coming back to the question of why SEO takes so long, the fact is that there are techniques that can deliver organic results quickly but those results often last for a short period of time, and more often than not, lead to penalties from the search engines. Therefore, it is always better to stick to established procedures and practices when it comes to search engine optimisation. The process of SEO involves on page optimisation as well as off page optimisation. In terms of on page optimisation, there are certain technical aspects that need to be tackled. For instance, if you have a really old website, there might be hundreds or thousands of pages with broken links. Fixing these links takes a really long time. Similarly, you might have issues with page loading speed due to certain underlying technologies or wrong technical setups. Fixing such issues also takes a long time. The other aspect of on page optimisation is the quality of content present on your website. If you already have a lot of low quality content on your website, it is going to take a really long time to identify that poor quality content and replace it with higher quality content. Similarly, identifying duplicate content issues on a big website takes a long time. In addition to the on page optimisation, there is also the question of off page optimisation which essentially refers to links from other websites. Since you can't just buy links from other websites as search engines do not like bought links, you need to make efforts to obtain them organically. Typically, it is done by posting high quality content on your website and marketing it to ensure that it reaches as many people as possible in your industry. In this manner, that content should be able to attract high-quality links from other authority domains. Another way is to publish high quality guest posts on other sites in your niche and this also takes a really long time. Overall, thorough search engine optimisation takes a really long time as issues need to be identified first and once the issues have been identified, fixing those issues takes a lot of time. It also takes some time for search engines to re-crawl the website and reward it for making those optimisation changes. Therefore, it is important for you to keep in mind that legitimate search engine optimisation is going to take time and if someone is promising guaranteed quick rankings, they are lying through their teeth. Therefore, stick to legitimate companies if you want to enjoy the benefits of your investment in search engine optimisation for the long term."

1,What is Product Categorization?,computers-technology," Product categorization, sometimes referred to as product classification, is a field of study within natural language processing (NLP). It is also one of the biggest challenges for ecommerce companies. With the advancement of AI technology, researchers have been applying machine learning to product categorization problems. In this article, we will discuss what product categorization is, why it is important, and how it relates to ecommerce sites. Lastly, we will briefly discuss companies that provide product categorization outsourcing and their position in the market. What is Product Categorization? Product categorization is the placement and organization of products into their respective categories. In that sense, it sounds simple: choose the correct department for a product. However, this process is complicated by the sheer volume of products on many ecommerce platforms. Furthermore, there are many products that could belong to multiple categories. For example, the item “Mens Basketball Sneakers” could use the following path and categories: Clothing, Shoes & Accessories > Men’s Shoes > Men’s Athletic Shoes However, it could also follow this path: Sporting Goods > Team Sports > Basketball Equipment > Shoes > Men’s Basketball Shoes The correct path, or whether you employ multiple paths to the same item, depends on how you expect customers to search for that product. It also depends on which departments you have available. In addition to choosing the correct department, product categorization also deals with the intricate organization of those departments. Why is Product Categorization Important? There are many reasons why product categorization is important for ecommerce and marketing. Through the accurate classification of your products, you can increase conversion rates, strengthen your search engine, and improve your site’s Google ranking. On average, 99% of users will not make a purchase on their first visit to your site. One reason for this is that people want to shop around and find the best price. Eventually, they will finish shopping and be ready to make a purchase. At that point, users will choose the site that offered the best price and the smoothest shopping experience. A well-built product taxonomy allows customers to find what they are looking for quickly and easily. Making your site easy to navigate is one of the most important elements of your UX and will lead to higher conversion rates. Correctly categorizing products allows your search engine to fetch products quicker. As a result, you create a quicker and more accurate search engine.  Since the search engine is often the first element users will interact with on ecommerce sites, a strong search engine is pinnacle to the user experience of your site. Most people won’t access your site directly. In fact, 35% of people searching for products start on Google. Once you have a strong product taxonomy in place, this will allow you to create the relevant landing pages for your products. In turn, Google and other search engines will be able to index your site and your products more easily. In the end, this allows your products to rank higher on search engines, increasing the chance that customers find your site. Ecommerce Product Categorization We’ve explained how accurate and intuitive product taxonomies can improve the user experience and lead to higher sales. The problem is numerous sites contain incorrect product classifications. This is because these sites often require merchants to input their product info and select categories manually. Furthermore, sometimes multiple merchants select different categories for the same product. To solve this problem, ecommerce sites often employ automated product classification. For example, Amazon hosts around 350 million products on their platform. To help merchants choose the correct category, Amazon and other ecommerce companies have automated product categorization tools available. After simply inputting the title or a few words about the product, the system can automatically choose the correct category for you. When there are hundreds of millions of products in the catalogue, even a 1% increase in accuracy can lead to millions of additional accurate classifications. As a result, many ecommerce companies heavily invest toward improving their automatic product classification systems. How Do You Improve Product Categorization Models? The remaining question is, how do you improve automatic product categorization models? The overall process is quite simple: -You create a list of desired categories and guidelines -Annotators are given those categories, as well as products to be categorized -The resulting training data is fed to the classifier -The classifier is then tested on the training data and a test dataset In theory, once the model has been trained it should be able to place new products into the correct categories, based on your current product taxonomy. In the past, choosing the category path was as simple as reading the product’s title. Using the title, annotators would discern the correct department. With this method, the task is simply a text classification task. However, numerous novel machine-learning based approaches have been created which not only analyze the title, but also the description, image(s) of the product, and other metadata as well."

If you have installed everything correctly and your components are compatible, however, your computer should restart and be able to install the operating system."
3,"The gilding process on the edge of the card, Zhanfeng smart card can be customized.",computers-technology," A brief introduction to the stamping process on the edge of the card. Card edge hot stamping is the desired color on the card cutting surface hot stamping. Most of the conventional hot stamping needs on the market are the positive or negative side of the card. Combined with the market demand, we have developed a card edge hot stamping process, which can now be mass customized. Welcome to send order consultation! Nine problems in bronzing process and their solutions. First, the hot stamping is not firm. There are many reasons for weak hot stamping. To sum up, there are three main reasons. When the hot stamping temperature is low or the pressure is light, the hot stamping temperature and pressure can be readjusted. In the printing process, due to the excessive amount of dry oil added to the ink, the surface of the ink layer dries too quickly to produce crystallization, so that the hot stamping foil can not be hot stamped. The solution is to prevent crystallization as far as possible during printing, and secondly, after crystallization, you can remove the hot stamping foil, air-press the print under heating, destroy the crystallization layer, and then hot stamping. Adding waxy desalination agents, anti-sticking agents or non-dry oily substances to the ink will also produce hot stamping. The solution is to first stick a layer of absorbent paper on the printing plate and press it again, adsorb the wax on the background ink layer, and then carry out hot stamping operation. Second, the hot stamped pictures and text are empty and dizzy. Hot stamping process, found that the picture and text virtual, dizzy fault, mainly hot stamping temperature is too high, gilding paper coking and other reasons. If the hot stamping temperature of the printing plate is too high, so that the hot stamping paper film exceeds the limit it can bear, and at this time the hot stamping paper film will expand around, resulting in halo and vacuity, then the temperature must be adjusted to an appropriate range according to the characteristics of the hot stamping paper. For the coking of the hot stamping paper, the main reason is that the machine stops for too long in the hot stamping process, so that a certain part of the gilding paper will come into contact with the electrothermal high temperature printing plate for a long time, and the picture and text will be dizzy after hot stamping. Therefore, if there is a shutdown in the production process, the temperature should be lowered, or the gilding paper should be removed, and a piece of thick paper can also be put in front of the higher temperature printing plate to isolate the gilding paper from the printing plate. III. Blurred handwriting and blurred version. The main reason for this failure is that the hot stamping temperature is too high, the coating of the hot stamping paper is too thick, the stamping force is too large, and the installation of the hot stamping paper is lax. Corresponding measures should be taken to solve the problem according to the specific situation. Hot stamping temperature is too high is the main cause of illegible handwriting and paste plate, hot stamping process, if the printing plate temperature is too high, resulting in film base and other film transfer, adhesion, resulting in illegible handwriting and paste version. When hot stamping, the hot stamping temperature should be lowered appropriately according to the applicable temperature of the hot stamping paper. In addition, thin coated gilding paper should be selected, the appropriate pressure should be adjusted, and the pressure and tension of the reel drum should be adjusted appropriately. IV. The edge of the picture and text is uneven and unclear. The main performance is that when hot stamping, rough edges occur on the edge of the picture and text, which affects the printing quality. The main reasons for this phenomenon are: the pressure of the printing plate is uneven, mainly because the layout is uneven, causing uneven pressure everywhere in the layout, some pressure is too large, some are too small, so that the force of the picture and text is uneven, then the surface of the hot stamping hot stamping paper is not smooth, and the adhesion between each part and the substrate is not the same, resulting in uneven imprinting. Therefore, the hot stamping plate must be flat and solid, to ensure that the hot stamping pressure is uniform, in order to ensure that the picture and text is clear. In addition, if the hot stamping plate pressure is too high, it can also cause uneven imprinting. In the process of hot stamping, it is necessary to adjust the hot stamping pressure to an appropriate degree. To ensure that the pad of the printing press should be accurately fitted according to the area of the pattern, do not shift, do not move. In this way, in order to ensure that the picture and text coincide with the cushion layer when hot stamping, and avoid hair around the picture and text. Also, the pressure of the same plate is uneven after hot stamping. This is because there is a great disparity in the size of the picture and text area, so the pressure of the large area should be increased, and the pressure of the size area can be corrected and adjusted by the paper cushion method to make it equal. Finally, if the hot stamping temperature is too high, it will also cause uneven imprinting. Therefore, according to the characteristics of the gilding paper, the hot stamping temperature of the printing plate should be reasonably controlled in order to ensure that the four sides of the picture and text are smooth, smooth and hairless. This fault is mainly caused by the speed of gilding paper, printing plate and so on. For example, the printing plate is damaged or deformed, which is one of the important reasons for the incomplete imprinting of picture and text. Therefore, if the printing plate is found to be damaged, the printing plate should be repaired or replaced immediately. The deformation of the printing plate makes the printing plate unable to withstand the hot stamping pressure, so the printing plate should be replaced and the pressure should be adjusted. If the gilding paper cutting and conveying deviation, the gilding paper horizontal cutting edge is too small or cutting skew when conveying deviation, it will make the gilding paper and printing plate picture and text does not match, part of the picture and text exposed, resulting in incomplete. In order to prevent such problems, when cutting the ironing paper, make it neat and smooth, and appropriately increase the size of the edge. Gilding paper conveying speed and tightness improper will also produce this kind of fault. The gilding paper receiving device is loosened or loosened between the core and the reel, the unwinding speed changes, and the tightness of the gilding paper changes, which deviates the position of the picture and text and causes the picture and text to be incomplete. At this time, it is necessary to adjust the winding and unwinding position, and if the bronzing paper is too tight, the pressure of the pressing drum and the pulling force of the reeling drum should be properly adjusted to ensure a suitable speed and tightness. Hot stamping materials and hot stamping materials are uncomfortable or too much powder spraying during printing will also occur this kind of fault, we should pay attention to adjustment. In addition, the part of the printing plate moves and falls in the position of the base plate, and the gasket of the imprinting mechanism shifts, which changes the normal hot stamping pressure, which is uneven, which will cause incomplete imprinting of picture and text. If the pressure is too light, the pressure can be increased. Therefore, in the hot stamping process of hot stamping paper, the hot stamping quality should be inspected frequently, the quality problems should be analyzed immediately, and the printing plate and backing should be checked. If you find that the printing plate moves or the backing shifts, adjust it in time and put the printing plate and backing back in place. The main reasons for hot stamping are: 1, the hot stamping temperature is too low, the printing plate hot stamping temperature is too low to reach the minimum temperature required for anodized aluminum foil to be separated from the film base and transferred to the substrate, hot stamping paper is not completely transferred, resulting in picture and text blooming, exposure or hot stamping. If you find this kind of quality problem, you should increase the temperature of the electric hot plate in time until the intact print is printed. 2. The pressure of hot stamping is low. In the process of hot stamping, if the hot stamping pressure of the printing plate is too small and the pressure applied to the anodized aluminum foil is too light, the hot stamping paper can not be transferred smoothly, making the hot stamping picture and text incomplete. Found that this situation should first analyze whether the hot stamping pressure is small, external observation of the weight of imprint marks, if the hot stamping pressure is small, hot stamping pressure should be increased. 3. The background color is too dry and the surface is crystallized, so that the hot stamping paper can not be hot stamped. When hot stamping, the dryness of the background color can be printed immediately within the printable range. When printing background color, the ink layer should not be too thick, when the printing volume is large, it is necessary to print in batches and appropriately shorten the production cycle. Once crystallization is found, printing should be stopped immediately, and the printing should be continued after finding and troubleshooting. 4. The gilding paper is not of the right type or of poor quality. When the hot stamping paper model is wrong or the quality is not good, it also makes the hot stamping quality problems. At this time, the gilding paper with appropriate model, good quality and strong adhesion should be replaced. Hot stamping area of a larger substrate, can be hot stamped twice in a row, can avoid hair, exposure and hot stamping. Most of this is because the hot stamping temperature is too high or the hot stamping pressure is too high or the hot stamping speed is too slow, so we should appropriately reduce the temperature of the electric hot plate, reduce the pressure and adjust the hot stamping speed. In addition, it is necessary to make as few empty cars as possible and reduce unnecessary parking, because empty cars and parking will raise the temperature of the electric hot plate. Use the same material, but the hot stamping quality is good and bad. The main reasons are unstable material quality, problems with temperature control of electric hot plate or loose pressure adjusting nut. Can change the material first, if the fault remains, it may be the problem of temperature or pressure, the temperature and pressure should be adjusted and controlled successively. The main reason is that the pattern of the scalded object is too deep, so the pattern should be replaced; if the pressure is too small and the temperature is too low, the pressure can be increased and the temperature can be increased. In short, hot stamping paper hot stamping failure, there are many reasons, in addition to hot stamping temperature, pressure and speed, but also pay attention to printing materials or replacement of hot stamping paper and other problems, careful analysis, in order to prescribe the right medicine, better rule out all kinds of reasons."

As you read on, your eyes will be opened to a solution to this problem that will shock you. Let us talk about the author: Unbelievably, Zack Bennet a carpenter by profession created Backyard Revolution. He was motivated to create this product because of a near death experience. One evening an electrical blackout occurred in the community where he lived. During this ordeal, an invader broke into his house. His daughter was threatened and in the process to protect her, he was shot. Fortunately the incident ended with both he and his daughter life speared. This incident prompted him to seek a permanent solution to his light problem and as a result, was led to a technological development in solar research by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Out of this research, he was able to create a mini solar generator to energize his house during a power cut, hoping that this might prevent any future incident such as this. What is the Backyard Revolution about? The Backyard Revolution is a solar powered generator, based on, that MIT technological development, which found that by arranging 3-D solar panels in a zigzag pattern you could produce electricity effectively.

6,What Is Hyperfast Broadband And Why Is It So Popular Today,computers-technology," Most people have heard of broadband Internet. It is extremely fast. It is so much better than what we once had in the form of dial-up connections. It is possible to download movies, stream multiple TV shows, all the while checking your email. However, there is something called hyperfast broadband that you may want to consider getting. It will be a little more expensive, and it is only available in certain areas of the world. Here is an overview of what hyperfast broadband is and how it can help change your way of doing anything on the Internet. The Changing Landscape Of Internet Speeds The Internet has been around for only a couple decades. It was thought that this would be a fad, something that would pass because people liked doing things in person. However, as more people set up websites, and as e-commerce began to develop, you can see a quick change in the way that people processed online activities. It became the way that people began to communicate and do business. However, this would demand higher speeds, especially as technology continues to advance. What Is Hyperfast Broadband? When you think of broadband, it typically ranges around 100 Mb per second. However, with hyperfast broadband, you can do 500 MB of speed or faster. There is also what is called gigabit broadband which, as the name indicates, delivers 1 GB downloads. This is extremely fast, something that was simply not available even just 10 years ago. When you can exceed a gigabyte of data in such a short period of time, you might imagine that it would begin to require more towers, cables, and fiber-optic set ups around the world. How Do You Find This Type Of Internet? First of all, this type of Internet connection does rely upon having direct connections from the delivery system to your computer. This will require cables, and as a result of this, you may not have this type of Internet at your current location.

By default, computers must be upgraded at the same time so that they will be able to process this information.

8,Research Reveals How to Increase Your Workplace Performance with Remote Working,computers-technology," In July this year, the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) released a brief revealing evidence on working from home productivity. This information is significantly beneficial, given the new norm and the importance of the survival of businesses. The evidence found two main channels that help ensure your employees will be productive remote working. The direct channel impacts performance by altering the motivation, efficiency, and knowledge creation of the workplace. While the indirect channel facilitates cost reductions that free up resources to reorganize as well as innovate your employees. Within these channels, there are 4 aspects that will help enable a more efficient performance within your team. Satisfaction It’s proven when a worker is satisfied with their workload and type or work, they will be more productive. Think about it like this – if you enjoy surfing, then you’re going to spend more time surfing, and you’re going to be more engaged and catch more waves than you would spend doing another activity you simply didn’t enjoy. When it comes to work, there are multiple aspects that contribute to satisfaction. These include work-life balance, fewer distractions, and a variety of work. When there minimal distractions, you can stay focused, and with this comes less frustration and less stress. By improving your employee satisfaction, it will enable a more efficient overall workplace performance. Cost Reductions What exactly does this involve and how will it affect performance? Well, by the ability to lower costs through implementing remote working, you can invest that money into increasing workplace performance. Makes sense, right? Here’s how… Reduce office space and equipment Decrease labor costs by increasing the pool of workers you can choose from. For instance, workers in smaller towns will no doubt charge a lower rate, due to cheaper living costs An increase in worker satisfaction will reduce the number of people quitting, which reduces hiring and training costs Attract lower wages by increasing work-life balance and flexible hours. People will be willing to sacrifice a higher salary Communication Coming from someone who did a Communications Degree, communication really is key. And it’s more important now than ever. The report found the decrease in face-to-face communication can inhibit productivity. Meetings and personal communication have proven to be more effective, engaging, convincing, and easier to pick up social cues. Consequently, remote working requires forms of communication that disrupt workflow, such as emails and video or phone calls. There’s no need to worry though. This is where we adapt. Incorporate forms of communication that enable less disruption, such as Slack. Slack allows for more normal conversations – it’s less serious like emails and allows you to quickly message back and forth, like that of a conversation - even seeing when the other person is typing. And only when there are important meetings, utilise video calls to pick up on social cues. Information Management If information isn’t managed efficiently, workers will collectively waste hours upon hours searching for certain information and waiting to hear back from colleagues who can access it. Unfortunately, it’s not as simple as asking your colleague who sits in front of you for access and the request being received within a matter of seconds. Here are some ways for an efficient management solution: Put in place a process which enables information to be shared with colleagues Allow colleagues to easily access and discover crucial and helpful resources Implement a flow between departments, individuals and external parties The importance of information flow is reinforced in the report, “Innovation depends importantly on the sharing of knowledge: ‘What each individual knows is less important. What counts is collective knowledge.’” The utmost efficient way to manage information and therefore increase productivity is by incorporating document management tools. This is essentially a secure iCloud, collating all your information, regardless of platform, into one space, so employees can easily access information from wherever, whenever. Now you have this information on hand, go out there and smash it!"
9,Top Tips for Protecting Your Phone Against Water Damage,computers-technology," When it comes to mobile phone insurance, a leading concern for individuals across the globe is water damage – because, for most of us, it’s been an unwelcome reality. Whether it was our phone taking a dip in the ocean, the bathtub or the sink – it’s safe to say that liquid damage is a paramount concern when purchasing a new device. Of course, many manufacturers are becoming savvy to this worry and are implementing designs to tackle it. And whilst this is a great step in the right direction, accidental falls, slips or dips can still be an inconvenience and hit our purse hard. So, with this in mind, it’s important that we protect our phones to the best of our ability and, luckily, we have a few tips to help you on your way! We know, it’s a simple ask. But more often than not, these are the home zones that can pose the most risk to mobile users. And whilst these accidents may seem few and far between, they can still happen and your hindsight won’t be able to help you. So, to avoid this being the case, keep your phone away from these rooms – and while you’re at it, avoid taking it to the pool, beach or any other public water zone.  We know this might sound a tad dramatic, but consider the fact that 1 in 5 people have dropped their mobile device down the toilet and get back to us. So, get into the mindset of assessing whether you really need your phone when going to certain locations. If no, then why take it? Washing your clothes can be a mundane and long-winded task at the best of times, so you won’t want to turn on the machine to realise that your mobile is in there also. Of course, more often than not this is just a mindless panic that resolves once you find your phone in your back pocket. Other times, you won’t be so lucky. To ensure that you don’t have to experience that special kind of panic moving forward, check your pockets. Before placing any items into the washing machine, check that they’re not holding any valuables, receipts or pens. You’ll thank us in the long run! Phone cases are designed to protect your phone from all kinds of disasters, so why buy one that doesn’t? Investing in a waterproof design is always worthwhile – especially if you ignored our advice from step one. Additionally, these cases tend to be airtight and prevent water from getting in whilst ensuring you can still use your touchscreen – so you won’t have to pop your phone away every time the rain begins. If that hasn’t convinced you, then consider the fact that they are available fairly cheaply! Most manufacturers will provide you with headphones when purchasing a new phone and too often we forget to use them. To avoid water damage, even damage that may seem minimal, you should try to use earphones, headphones or anything of the like when answering your phone in the rain - because whilst you won’t want to avoid a call, you also won’t want to come away with a hefty bill. By using, or investing in, earphones you can take your calls but keep your phone safe and dry in the comfort of your pocket. Headsets such as this can be found with a fairly low price tag, but it’s important to consider that the quality of sound might vary in which case. Taking small steps to reduce the risk of a water-based disaster is a fantastic way to care for your electronics. But unfortunately, accidents can, and do, still happen. With this in mind, it’s important to understand and assess the available insurance policies that will cover your device should any damage occur. Luckily, these policies can often be found cheaply and offer the peace of mind you need."

18,5G TECHNOLOGY AND IOT: HOW DO THESE TRENDS RELATE?,computers-technology," Lower latency and more flexibility are network features that will allow the advancement of the Internet of Things. The Internet of Things works only when devices connect to the internet. From this statement, it is already possible to imagine that the importance of 5G for the advancement of IoT in the coming years is fundamental. Being the first network planned to operate with low latency and response time 10 times shorter than the 4G network, 5G is the solution that experts are working to more efficiently connect autonomous cars, refrigerators that will be programmed, buildings that will talk to airplanes, among numerous possibilities. According to market surveys, by 2020 there will be more than 20 billion IoT devices worldwide and current networks are not enough to transmit the large amount of data that is already being generated at all times. 5G appears as a solution capable of absorbing simultaneous connections, efficiently and with lower energy consumption. It is a network programmed to respond in real-time, as well as being scalable and versatile. 4G was an evolution of 3G, with a wider band and higher speed, but with the same ecosystem, while 5G has new programming, intending to enable a whole series of uses that leave this ecosystem.   It is intended that the 5G network has a latency of no more than 1 millisecond, and currently it is 10 milliseconds, which causes numerous devices to be connected to the network and disconnect when they are not in operation. The new network has to respond to critical needs, which need extremely short response times. An autonomous car today, from the moment it receives the guidance of brake car, needs 3 meters to stop, precisely by the response time of 4G. With the 5G, this braking distance would be a matter of centimeters. The increased demand for 5G will transform the direction of investments of telecommunications operators, today focused on serving communication between people. The Internet of Things opens a new market where operators have great opportunities to increase their revenues. The market is betting that, for sure, the number of devices connected to IoT will be greater than the number of smartphones, and the need to hire a new network will be greater. The ITU - International Telecommunications Union has been defining parameters for 5G, based on previous networks and future needs. However, associations of manufacturers, equipment suppliers, operators, and research institutions have already defined their goals and objectives for the new network.   One of these industry associations is 5G Americas, where companies come together around market-relevant discussions and discuss key solutions for the consistent deployment of the network throughout America. One of the points they argue for is that spectrum planning is the key to 5G success. For the association, mobile spectrum bands below 6GHz will be important for the integration between 4G and 5G, while the above bands offer technical challenges, being possible to develop mobile services in higher bands with new radio solutions. For them, it is necessary to take advantage of all spectrum sources, from licensed, unlicensed, and shared, and regulators and politicians need to ensure investments in all areas of the ecosystem to encourage a connected society. Experts believe that standardization will allow the network to be effectively operational in 2020, arriving in various countries in 2022. In short, the 5G network is expected to increase internet speed but, first of all, will arrive to organize the coexistence between smartphones and millions of connected objects, such as cars and smart homes, as well as help in the development of smart and efficient cities."

1,The Importance of Natural Language Processing for Non-English Languages,computers-technology," Natural Language Processing (NLP) is growing in use and plays a vital role in many systems from resume-parsing for hiring to automated telephone services. You can also find it in commonly used technology such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and modern spam detection. However, the development and implementation of NLP technology is not as equitable as it may appear. To put it into perspective, although there are over 7000 languages spoken around the world, the vast majority of NLP processes amplify seven key languages: English, Chinese, Urdu, Farsi, Arabic, French, and Spanish. Even among these seven languages, the vast majority of technological advances have been achieved in English-based NLP systems. For example, optical character recognition (OCR) is still limited for non-English languages. And anyone who has used an online automatic translation service knows the severe limitations once you venture beyond the key languages referenced above. How are NLP Pipelines Developed? To understand the language disparity in NLP, it is helpful to first understand how these systems are developed. A typical pipeline starts by gathering and labeling data. A large dataset is essential here as data will be needed to both train and test the algorithm. When a pipeline is developed for a language with little available data, it is helpful to have strong patterns within the language. Small datasets can be augmented by techniques such as synonym replacement to simplify the language, back-translation to create similarly phrased sentences to bulk up the dataset, and replacing words with other related parts of speech. Language data also requires significant cleaning. When a non-English language with special characters is used, like Chinese, proper unicode normalization is typically required. This allows the text to be converted to a binary form that is recognizable by all computer systems, reducing the risk of processing errors. This issue is amplified for languages like Croatian, that rely heavily on accentuation to change the meaning of a word. For example, in Croatian, a single accent can change a positive word into a negative one. Therefore, these terms have to be manually encoded to ensure a robust dataset. Finally, the dataset can be divided into a training and testing split, and sent through the machine learning process of feature engineering, modeling, evaluation, and refinement. Original image featured on Towards Data Science One commonly used NLP tool is Google’s Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) which is purported to develop a “state of the art” model in 30 minutes using a single tensor processing unit. Their GitHub page reports that the top 100 languages with the largest Wikipedia databases are supported, but the actual evaluation and refinement of the system has only been performed on 15 languages. While BERT technically does support more languages, the lower level of accuracy and lack of proper testing limits the applicability of this technology. Other NLP systems such as Word2Vec and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) have similar limitations. In summary, the NLP pipeline is a challenge for less popular languages. The datasets are smaller, they often need augmentation work, and the cleaning process requires time and effort. The less access you have to native-language resources, the less data available when building an NLP pipeline. This makes the barrier to entry for less popular languages very high, and in many cases, too high. The Importance of Diverse Language Support in NLP There are three overarching perspectives that support the expansion of NLP: The reinforcement of social disadvantages Normative biases Language expansion to improve ML technology Let’s look at each in more detail: Reinforcement of Social Disadvantages From a societal perspective, it is important to keep in mind that technology is only accessible when its tools are available in your language. On a basic level, the lack of spell-check technology impairs those who speak and write less common languages. This disparity rises up the technological chain. What’s more, psychological research has shown that the language you speak molds the way you think. An in-built language preference in the systems that drive the internet inherently incorporates the societal norms of the driving languages. The fact is that supported systems continue to thrive while it is challenging to introduce new aspects to a deeply ingrained program. This means that as NLP continues to develop without bringing in a diverse range of languages, it will be more challenging to incorporate them in the future, endangering the global variety of languages. Normative Biases English and English-adjancent languages are not representative of other world languages as they have unique grammatical structures that many languages do not share. By supporting mostly English languages, however, the Internet and other technologies are progressively treating English as the normal, default language setting. As a relatively agnostic system is trained on English, it learns the norms and systems of a specific language and all the cultural implications that come with that limitation. This single sided approach will only continue to become more apparent as NLP is applied to more intelligent processes that have an international audience. Language Expansion to Improve ML Technology When we apply machine learning techniques to only a handful of languages, we program implicit bias into the systems. As machine learning and NLP continues to advance while only supporting a few languages, we not only make it more challenging to introduce new languages, but run the risk of making it fundamentally impossible to do so. For example, subword tokenization implementation performs very poorly on languages that feature reduplication, a feature common to many international languages such as Afrikaans, Irish, Punjabi, and Armenian. Languages also have a variety of word order norms, which tend to stump the common neural models used in English-based NLP. What Can Be Done? In the current discourse around NLP, when the words “natural language” are spoken, the general assumption is that the researcher is working on an English database. To break out of this mold and create more awareness for international systems, we should first always refer to the language system being developed. This idea of always stating the language a researcher is working on is colloquially referred to as the Bender Rule. Simple awareness of the issue, of course, is not enough. However, being mindful of the issue can help in the development of more broadly applicable tools. When looking to introduce more languages into an NLP pipeline, it is also important to consider the size of the dataset. If you are creating a new dataset, a significant portion of your budget should be applied to creating a dataset in another language. Of course, additional research in optimizing current cleaning and annotation programs in other languages is also vital to broadening NLP technologies around the globe."

3,Web Hosting Made Easy!,computers-technology," How To Find The Best Web Host Provider So you're looking to learn about web hosting and what it has to offer or you? There is no shame in not knowing this information. Everyone has to start at the beginning at some point. On that note, lets begin learning about web hosting. First off, what is web hosting and how does it work? Web hosting is the business practice of providing space and bandwidth on a high-powered computer server that is connected to the Internet at very high speeds. Hosting companies maintain large networks of high-powered web server computers in a physical location known as a data center. These computer servers are connected to a very fast, and generally redundant, Internet connection. The data centers have primary and backup power, a fast connection to the Internet, and a security monitoring staff. The web hosting companies provide a share of disk space and available bandwidth to a customer for a monthly fee. Once the customer is signed up, they can upload files to their personal space on the web server and the information is then viewable to anyone interested on the Internet. The monthly fee the web hosting company charges is much less than what it would cost to run a server out of your own home or data center. This is the reason these companies exist. They take care of all the hardware, software, and other technical needs for you. So whether you are considering the start up a new blog, online business, E-commerce store, etc., you will need a web host. Without it, it will be near impossible for anyone to find you on the search engines. Web Hosting Considerations Wondering about all the other information listed in web hosting plans? In this section, I will explain the most important considerations in choosing a good web host. Price The price of web hosting services is one of the most important. There are many hosting companies out there with cheap hosting packages, but they may be lacking in other areas. Don't let the price of a hosting package fool you. There are some hosting companies out there who have great prices and the other features are just as good. Price may be one of the most important decisions of a web hosting plan, but there is much more to consider in choosing a quality web host. Customer Support In any business, it is very important to provide exception customer service. Web hosting is no exception to this. Many of the hosting companies are available all day and night in case you have a problem with your web site, but there are some who are just available specific hours of the day. If your web site goes down in the middle of the night when they're not available, this means lost revenue for a business. You should make sure the web host you select is always available for support. Money Back Guarantee Most web hosting companies will provide a thirty-day money back guarantee. Some will provide one even longer, but be wary of the ones who offer no money back guarantee. I would not purchase web hosting services from a company who does not offer at least a 30 day money back guarantee, unless they have proven themselves to be a leader in the industry and have an excellent reputation. Operating System An operating system is a piece of software that controls the interaction between the computer user and the physical hardware of the machine. A vast majority of all web sites on the Internet run on the Linux operation system. Linux is generally much more stable than Windows. Stability is critical in running a web site. For this reason, I prefer to host my web sites on the Linux operating system. Some sites have specific requirements that only the Windows operating system can satisfy, but there are always alternatives to those requirements. Backup A good web hosting company will have a regular schedule to backup the data on all the web servers. The more often the data is backed up, the better. At the very least, a web hosting company should backup web site files daily. Control Panel The control panel is the point of contact the web site administrator will have between the host server and their own machine connected via the Internet. It is essential to have a well organized and easy to use control panel interface. Bluehost control panel is one of the leading web hosting control panels out there today. Most web hosting companies will provide a link to a demo of the control panel they use with their hosting plans. The control panel used is a matter of preference, but it should be user friendly. Email Email is essential part of communication on the Internet. Most web hosting companies out there will give you more email addresses and more space to hold email messages than you will ever need. What you need to watch out for is the companies that have decided to be a little strict on their email accounts and only offer a small number or a small amount of message space. Statistics As a webmaster, it is nice to know how many visitors you've had, where they came from, how long they stay on your site, and how much bandwidth they've used. This information is collected by the web server and is placed in a log file. A statistics software package can read this data and provide meaningful information to the webmaster. The information gathered from these logs can be very valuable in improved services to the viewers of the web site. Conclusion Web hosting can be a very difficult decision with the many thousands of hosting companies out there. It is critical to find a plan that fits your needs and to have a good hosting company. I hope this article was useful in making your decision about which company to host with. If you are looking for the best bang for you buck, click the link below.  Happy Hosting!"

The Hyper-V solution from Microsoft is one of the most common virtualization options currently used, as it comes embedded into the Microsoft OS package and can be utilized without extra purchases, licenses, or arrangements. But along with the ease of its use and numerous appealing features, users still report that some degree of technical knowledge is needed for setting the virtual instance on a computer. This guide clarifies the best practices of Hyper-V configuration, issues that users may come across when using Hyper-V, and ways of minimizing the dangers of virtual data loss with embedded data protection and Nakivo hyper-v backup . Verify Your System’s Compatibility with Hyper-V The starting point of work on Hyper-V configuration is to check out whether your computer can generally support it. The fact that Hyper-V comes embedded into your software package does not mean by default that it will run smoothly. Overall, there are not too many critical requirements for Hyper-V activation, but some of them are vital: •	The version of Windows you have (Hyper-V is currently supported on Windows 10, Pro, and Education versions) •	Processor type (Hyper-V runs only on 64-bit processors with SLAT) •	Your CPU should support the VT-c extension •	Memory (minimum 4GB of spare memory is required) Explore Various Hyper-V Enabling Options To date, users can enable Hyper-V in a variety of ways, so the choice depends on your software knowledge and the availability of these options. First, Hyper-V may be run with PowerShell. To do it, you only need to open the PowerShell console in the Administrator mode and run a select command for Hyper-V activation. Once the installation process ends, all you need to do is reboot your machine, starting to use Hyper-V afterward. CMD and the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) feature of Windows can also be used to run Hyper-V. The process is the same as with PowerShell (the CMD session should also start in the Administrator mode), but the command will be different. Finally, users can quickly get one step closer to Hyper-V from the Settings section, by going to the “Apps and Features” folder and pressing “Programs and Features,” then ‘Turn Windows Features on or off,” and then selecting Hyper-V and clocking “OK.” Once this is done, Hyper-V gets automatically activated on your machine. Beware Technical Issues Things happen, and even those who have installed Hyper-V correctly may come across some technical bottlenecks. The most common problems emerging during Hyper-V use include: •	Troubles with the processor (lags of the host machine’s CPU or overloading of processors); •	Memory issues (overcommitment of memory to some non-critical tasks; RAM depletion; failures during the launch of VMs); •	Network problems (imbalance of network resource distribution; network-bound host issues); •	Storage problems (waste of physical storage, slow I/O; disk latency). As all the troubles mentioned above come from hardware, they should be monitored closely when setting up and running your VMs in Hyper-V. Otherwise, if hardware problems go undetected and persist, you risk losing data because of a massive hardware collapse. Never Forget to Back-Up Data Once your Hyper-V is set up and running, take proper care of the data backup measures. It’s good to have some external data backup software or at least to use the Hyper-V Failover Clustering method for creating reserve copies of your data on other hosts. In case your data is not backed up properly, and something goes wrong with your VM, the data loss may be permanent. More Pro Tips for Expert Hyper-V Users For those who want more guidance on increasing their VM capacity and running Hyper-V as pros, we have prepared a couple more tips: •	Check the sufficiency of physical network adapters in the host machine to prevent overloading •	Enhance your dynamic disk performance with Hyper-V R2 •	Use your VMs to access iSCSI storage •	Make sure of the processor compatibility features •	Make use of the live migration feature for easy and convenient movement of VMs across hosts. As you can see, nothing is challenging about Hyper-V activation. Take your final step to enjoying the world of virtualization services. Set up Hyper-V, take all data protection precautions, and enjoy the unlimited virtual capacity."

6,Powerful business email with MDaemon Messaging Server,computers-technology," For some years, many have been claiming the end of email as a mainstream way to keep in touch. Nothing could be further from the truth, especially when it comes to business communications. In fact, it is safe to say that email is still one of the most important tools in any business. Indeed, a company's ability to survive depends on it. MDaemon Messaging Server helps alleviate many of the challenges and complexities of business email. These include security, privacy, and compliance - some of the hottest topics in the world of email right now. MDaemon Messaging Server helps streamline a whole range of communication and collaboration functions, and it supports all three of the major email protocols - IMAP, POP3, and SMTP. It is also highly customizable and helps ensure a high uptime. Scale your business security Business emails routinely contain highly sensitive information, including private details about clients and employees and proprietary information of the sort that isn't meant for public consumption. Yet by itself, email is not a sufficiently secure communications channel. This is especially likely to be the case with most consumer-grade email platforms. MDaemon Messaging Server, on the other hand, provides multiple layers of security, including powerful techniques like IP shielding, SMTP authentication, relay controls, and reverse lookups. Combined, these greatly reduce the chances of server exploits. There is also proactive malware protection to guard against new and unknown threats. Of course, MDaemon Messaging Server also provides full email encryption, both when using webmail and on the server-side. Finally, email archiving is also built in, which is important in certain industries for ensuring regulatory compliance. Adapt to constant change One of the biggest challenges today's business leaders face is to keep up with constant change and disruption. Challenges come from all sides, such as evolving cybersecurity threats, new privacy regulations, and, of course, constantly evolving customer demands. This is why you need an email system that offers scalability and flexibility, rather than being tied to specific hardware. With MDaemon Messaging Server, admins can manage email systems from anywhere on any device equipped with a browser. They can add and edit accounts, directly edit configuration files, set storage quotas, and review email deliverability logs. This gives them the means to quickly diagnose any potential issues and resolve them before they become a problem. Employees can access their accounts using webmail and even enjoy complete group collaboration by sharing certain email folders and synchronizing or sharing things like calendars, contacts, tasks, and notes. More than just an email server, MDaemon Messaging Server is a fully fledged collaboration platform. It even includes a closed instant messaging desktop app, which is far more secure than using a major public platform. This highly secure environment is ideal for exchanging confidential files, contacts, and other assets. MDaemon Messaging Server originally started off as a purely on-premises email server. However, hosted email options are now available as well via the MDaemon Private Cloud. This is by far the most important change in the latest update. MDaemon 20.0.1 was released on August 18, 2020, and also includes many other changes, new features, and bug fixes.

9,Ground-breaking women in tech showcased at Future of Work Conference,computers-technology," The first-ever Future of Work Virtual Conference - hosted by CNBC Africa, in partnership with Forbes Africa – surpassed its goal of outlining digital opportunities for business in Africa, reaching more than 2 000 viewers across the globe with the live broadcast on Thursday, 20 August. But more than this, the conference showcased the impact being made by women in the field of technology, most of whom have had to successfully navigate a male-dominated industry to have their voices heard. “The conference sought to highlight the many ways in which the continent can leverage new technologies for business growth, and it’s through platforms, such as these, that we are levelling the playing field and giving women the chance to show the world what gender equality really means,” explained Roberta Naicker, Managing Director of the ABN Group. “Female empowerment is not about ticking the politically correct boxes. It’s about actually giving women an equal opportunity to thrive in their chosen career, to listen and learn from them, and to acknowledge that, in many instances, they are having to overcome much more to achieve the status enjoyed by their male counterparts.” Matching this calibre of women in the technological industry, the all-day virtual conference welcomed an esteemed panel line-up comprising a strong selection of female leaders. Included in Future of Work programme were: Panel: Empowering the workforce to harness IoT and Big Data Analytics Panel: Cybersecurity for the distributed, hyper-connected workplace Panel: Turbocharging productivity: what automation, machine learning and AI can do for your business Panel: Digital transformation and the distributed enterprise Panel: How Saas & Cloud computing can help African enterprises futureproof their business model Kavitha Prag: Supply Chain and Network Operating Lead within Enterprise Technology & Performance Canninah Mapena: MD and Country Sales Director for Rockwell Automation Introductory address Sannah Rajpurohit: Management Consultant in the telecommunications, media and technology space. The need to shift mindsets, particularly in terms of women in traditionally male-dominated industries, is vital for both the cause of women, as well as the nation as a whole. In her SA FM interview ahead of the conference, Kavitha Prag recalls being one of two women in her electrical engineering class, with few female role models within the workplace. However, she believes the fundamental skills learnt within STEM fields provide a solid foundation for all industries. “It (engineering) teaches fundamental problem-solving skills that you take with you, irrespective of whether you’re dealing with a core engineering design problem, or a business problem. “These core skills are not only critical but essential for the progress of this country. Until we make this (apprenticeship) attractive …create an environment where these careers are aspirational, we’re going to suffer as a nation.” For those who missed the live #FOWA2020 event, the speaker panel is available at  https://www.cnbcafrica.com/future-of-work/"
10,Industrial-grade disk sanitation for enterprises,computers-technology," One of the most overlooked areas of information security is secure IT asset disposal (SITAD), which governs the processes around retiring things like old hard drives securely. Deprecated hardware poses an enormous and often underrepresented security threat. Things like old hard drives and any other digital storage device often contain sensitive information. In the business environment, this might include regulated customer data, information about financial transactions, trade secrets, and intellectual property. Simply formatting the retired drives does nothing to delete the data. Using the right software, it is easy to get the lost data back intact, unless it has been physically destroyed via several write cycles. Until that happens, it may be possible for someone else to get their hands on the data in misuse it. Because of this, every business needs to think carefully about the way they go about retiring old IT assets. KillDisk Industrial from LSoft Technologies is an enterprise-grade solution supporting globally recognized standards like the US Department of Defense 5220-22M. It lets users erase multiple drives at the same time, making it vastly more efficient and faster than many competing products. This is ideal for meeting the challenges of scale when, for example, retiring an entire data center or a large storage area network. With this software, ideally installed on a dedicated desktop or server, you can securely erase dozens of drives in parallel. It is also highly customizable in any context, and it supports all hard drives and solid state drives in the 3.5"" and 2.5"" form factors. It also meets more than 20 international disk sanitization standards for ensuring compliance with regional laws and regulations. The software itself is designed to work on any Windows- or Linux-based platform. However, it's also available with its own bootable environment, letting you run it on a computer without any operating system installed. What's new in Version 4? LSoft Technologies released KillDisk Industrial version 4 on February 10, 2020. The new version includes a raft of bug fixes and major improvements to performance. Most importantly, the software is now more stable working with damaged or unresponsive disks. It also provides enhanced disk analysis for extracting essential information like SMART data and serial numbers. The erased log has been improved too, allowing users to track erased disks by order IT and records filtering. The data may be exported to a CSV file for easy viewing on any device. Other improvements include barcodes and QR codes for certificates and disk labels for easier item tracking. Enhanced HTML and sound-based notifications help keep users informed about process completion, while individual disk labels are now customizable with presets for various tasks. KillDisk Industrial is LSoft Technologies' flagship data sanitation product. It helps enterprises overcome the challenge of scale when securely erasing large numbers of solid state and hard disk drives without physically destroying them.

11,Manage dual boot and multi-boot environments with a boot manager,computers-technology," Although Windows is the most popular desktop operating system, Linux wins in the server department, and is also the platform of choice for developers and enthusiasts. But Linux and Windows are far from being the only operating systems worth using. There are many others, and some enthusiasts even run macOS on a PC. Normally though, a computer will only run a single platform, and it often is not easy to set up a dual boot or multi boot system. Still, there are many reasons you might want to, such as for testing software on another platform, trying out a pre-release version of a popular operating system, or even finding out which Linux distro best suits your needs. But to do this, you will need to make a few important preparations first. Every operating system needs its own partition to run on. You cannot install more than one platform on a single partition, since they need to function separately. Also, many operating systems use different file systems, which might not be natively compatible with one another. Once you have set up a partition for the new operating system, you will then need to install your chosen platform on it. Then, to create a reliable dual boot or multi-boot environment, you will need to go into the BIOS setup utility and choose a default boot device. However, you will need to change this setting every time you want to boot up into an operating system other than your primary one, unless you take a few extra steps. Setting up, managing, and using dual boot and multi-boot environments with no specialized solution for doing so is tedious and unreliable. The BootIt Collection is a set of two professional-grade boot managers providing users the ability to set up dual boot and multi-boot systems. The two programs are BootIt UEFI and BootIt Bare Metal. BootIt UEFI is designed to run on most modern systems, which use the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, which is found on most computers less than five years old. However, if your system uses legacy BIOS firmware, the BootIt Bare Metal version provides the same degree of functionality, and it is included at no extra cost. With the right option, you can run practically any number of operating systems. The BootIt Collection is an industry-leading boot manager, but it goes far beyond simply allowing you to run multiple operating systems in parallel easily. It also includes a built-in partition manager, which lets you set up your hard drive into multiple logical blocks known as partitions. Each one of these functions like an independent storage device, which also means you can run a different operating system on each one. You can easily change the size and file system of each partition to accommodate the platform of your choice. Furthermore, you can use the included disk imaging feature to create a complete byte-by-byte copy of all the data on a storage volume. This is ideal for transferring your operating system and all your apps to a new drive or computer without having to reinstall everything manually. The latest edition of BootIt Bare Metal (v. 1.68) and BootIt UEFI (1.20) have been updated to include Image for DOS/UEFI 3.41 and TBOSDT scripting 2.01. Several other bug fixes and changes are also included. Find out more at https://www.terabyteunlimited.com/bootit-collection.htm ."

The latest version, released on May 29, 2020 includes a new lightweight boot disk console based on the Linux Tiny Core environment. It also ships with new and improved editions of Active@ File Recovery, Active@ KillDisk, and Active@ Partition Recovery. Recover deleted files and partitions Contrary to popular belief, it is usually possible to recover deleted data from formatted drives and partitions, including those which have no file system and cannot be accesses through conventional means. Users can also recover files which have been emptied from the recycle bin. This works in any situation where the original data has yet to be permanently overwritten by another file operation. Sometimes, it is possible to recover data months after it has been deleted, but the chances of a successful operation are always higher if you act quickly and avoid making further modifications to the contents of the storage device or partition. With Active@ Data Studio, you can use the included Active@ UNDELETE utility to recover files from a wide range of file systems, including those supported by Windows, Linux, and macOS. Also, you can recover entire partitions and damaged or formatted volumes using the included Active@ File Recovery. Secure data erasure for sensitive files Given how easy it often is to recover deleted data and formatted volumes, your goal might instead be to securely delete it so that no one else can ever get their hands on your private files. This is strongly advisable for anyone who is planning to sell, donate, or dispose of an old computer or any other data-bearing device. The included Active@ KillDisk utility will destroy all data on hard drives, solid state drives, memory cards, and USB disks to prevent any possibility of recovery. The tool supports the globally recognized DoD 5220.22-M standard, along with over 20 other international standards for data sanitization. Back up and protect your files Active@ Data Studio includes powerful tools for managing disk images, ISO files, and more.

Securely delete data Most people assume that emptying the recycle bin or formatting a drive is final. After all, your operating system will warn you whenever you try to go ahead with such an action that the files will be gone for good. However, that isn't really the case, since data remains on any storage device until something else overwrites it. Sometimes, this can take many months or even years, especially if the device isn't often in use. As such, if you want to sell or donate an old computer, you will need to make sure beforehand that your personal data has been securely erased. Active@ KillDisk 12, the new version, is included in this suite. It securely erases digital storage devices in accordance with globally recognized standards. Recover deleted files Active@ LiveCD 8 also includes new editions of Active@ UNDELETE and Active@ Partition Recovery. These are LSoft Technologies' leading digital recovery solutions, designed to exploit the window of opportunity you have before deleted data is truly lost for good. For example, if you accidentally lost a partition or formatted a drive, then you should act quickly. You can use the partition recovery app to immediately recover damaged or formatted disk partitions, while the file recovery software lets you get back specific files which have been removed from the recycle bin. In the latest version, there are many new file signatures supported, which give you an easy way to find recoverable data. Back up everything The most secure way to back up all your data is to make a complete image of the entire disk. That way, nothing will get forgotten about. Also, if you have a full disk image, you can easily transfer your operating system and applications and documents over to a new storage device or computer. That's a lot quicker than reinstalling everything manually from scratch, especially if you're provisioning a lot of new systems at once. The latest Active@ Disk Backup 2 does everything for you. Active@ LiveCD 8, released on June 5, 2020, includes the latest versions of all the tools mentioned above, as well as Active@ Password Changer 10 and Active@ Disk Editor 7.

15,Secure IT asset disposal made easy with KillDisk Desktop,computers-technology," Retiring old computing assets is never as simple as simply discarding them in the nearest landfill or locking them away in a storage room. Aside from the environmental and waste disposal concerns, however, there's the fact that these used storage devices can contain a wealth of valuable information that you wouldn't want ending up in the wrong hands. A lot of people assume that formatting the drives is enough to get rid of the data. However, using the right software, it's very easy to recover formatted or deleted drive partitions and even recover deleted files emptied from the recycle bin. Of course, you can physically destroy the disk to such an extent that no data can ever be recovered from it, but that's not much use if you want to sell or donate your old computing assets. Secure IT asset disposal (SITAD) is a strategy that every enterprise needs, no matter its size and industry. The fact is; every organization holds a treasure trove of valuable and potentially sensitive data on its hard disks and other information-bearing assets. This might include regulated customer data, intellectual property, trade secrets or financial information, just to name a few categories. To ensure your data storage and digital lifecycle management routines adhere to industry regulations and internal business policy, you need a structured and documented way of retiring disused assets like hard drives and other storage devices.

18,"Diagnose, repair, and maintain your PC with Active@ Boot Disk",computers-technology," If your computer refuses to boot, it's often hard to locate the source of the problem and repair it. Windows, like other operating systems, provide limited functionality if you can't boot into the operating system as normal. While you can attempt to start the computer using installation media, there are few options for actually diagnosing your computer or carrying out key repairs, diagnoses steps, and other low-level disk functions. Instead, you might even feel compelled to reinstall the operating system. However, this is a lengthy process, especially when you have to manually install all your applications, drivers, and other content. Also, formatting your drive and reinstalling the operating system involves permanently deleting everything on the drive. Even then, there's no telling whether the problem will occur again. Active@ Boot Disk provides a powerful suite of tools designed to help you diagnose issues and access your files even if your computer refuses to boot from its regular operating system. This is especially helpful if the BIOS reports that there's no operating system installed. Active@ Boot Disk is a fully self-contained operating system that runs from removable media, such as a USB pen drive or an optical disk. It provides a basic set of everyday computing tools, such as a calculator, notepad, and partition manager. It also offers network access, support for every type of storage device and file system you're ever likely to encounter, and support for a multi- or dual-boot environment. However, the real power lies in its unique data backup and restore software, which allows you to recover deleted data or lost partitions. Alternatively, if you're selling or donating your PC, you can use the industry-standard disk sanitization tools to securely wipe the entire drive. Other boot disk utilities include a Windows task manager, a file manager, a web browser, a registry editor, and many other useful apps and tools. It offers a completely independent environment, so you can even use it if you have no other operating systems installed on your computer. If data recovery is your goal, this ability is especially valuable, since it eliminates the risk of permanently overwriting the deleted data. Instead, it doesn't make any modifications to your system hard drive, so if you're trying to recover data from that drive, you'll want to avoid booting up from it anyway. The same applies if you want to securely erase the drive, which of course you can only do if you're not using it. Finally, Active@ Boot Disk also offers a complete system imaging tool for making a byte-by-byte copy of everything on the drive. Not only is this an exhaustive backup option - it's also good for moving your operating system and applications over to a new computer or storage device. New in version 16, released on May 22, includes a new lightweight Linux-based boot disk console, a better bootable disk creator, and the latest versions of Active@ KillDisk 12, Active@ File Recovery 20, and Active@ Partition Recovery 20.

19,What is the easiest way to recover deleted files?,computers-technology," Data deletion is perhaps one of the most widely misunderstood things about computers. Most people assume that files are gone for good the moment they empty the recycle bin or format a drive or partition. After all, operating systems like Windows typically warn you before you go ahead. But despite this, most of us have accidentally deleted or otherwise lost valuable files due to not paying attention. In other cases, it can be easy to accidentally wipe the wrong drive or partition. For example, if you are installing or reinstalling an operating system, you might accidentally delete or format the wrong partition. Then, you only realize when it is already too late it was the wrong one! Fortunately, and contrary to popular belief, there is still hope. The thing about deleting files and formatting drives is these operations do not actually make any changes to the original data. All that changes is the master file table on the drive. The MFT is a huge database which tells the file system where to find particular files. Without the MFT, the drive will be unreadable through conventional means. Moreover, if the drive has been formatted, it will appear to be empty. What most people do not realize though, is that the original data remains on the drive until something else overwrites it. This can happen at any time, such as when you create or save a new file or install a new application. This is why it is important that you act quickly to recover your files - ideally as soon as you realize they are gone. Active@ UNERASER is a powerful tool for exploiting that opportunity. In a few cases, it is even possible to recover files months or years after they were deleted. The less the contents of the drive have been modified since you lost the files, the higher the chances are of getting them back in one piece. Active@ UNERASER lets you perform a low-level search of the affected storage device to locate files of hundreds of different types. It recognizes certain file formats, which is important since the original filenames may be truncated or missing entirely. The latest version, launched on June 3, 2020, adds support for more filetypes, including LibreOffice and WPS Office documents and Ancestral Quest files. It now also lets you recover files or partitions from the Apple ApFS filesystem. Support for Microsoft ReFS has also been improved with more stable and reliable code. Active@ UNERASER is available as a freeware utility for letting you search for recoverable files and recover those up to a certain file size. However, the Professional package now ships with the latest version of Active@ Boot Disk and a new and improved Boot Disk Creator for recovering files from you system hard drive partition. This is important since it works in its own environment to avoid making any further changes to the drive. Ultimate package users can now use the latest version of Active@ LiveCD, offering full support for PCI-E NVMe M.2 solid state drives. Moreover, the recovery kernel has been improved with many bug fixes and improvements to improve your changes of a successful operation even further.

20,Live Memory Analysis Tools and Techniques in Linux Environment-TechForing,computers-technology," Live Memory Analysis Tools and Techniques in Linux Environment Abstract Live memory analysis on the Linux based system has never been easier in the past. Analysts always had to take traditional approach which involved multiple stages before even begin the investigation. Taking the snapshot of the whole disk or the memory, shutting down the compromised machine and then investigate the memory in the lab were few steps an analyst must had to follow in a traditional approach, which has a high risk of losing potential data as killing the machine not only end all the processes but also alter many programs behavior which can mislead the investigator. On the other hand, capturing a memory’s live state can be very crucial for forensic investigators as it contains all the running processes, file, directory information, recent activity details, session details and the user activity related information. Apart From post investigation issue, there has been limited work done in Linux memory forensic analysis compare to windows. Live memory analysis requires precise understanding about the complex “struct layout” information in memory and how memory store data. It also involves multiple steps to carry out to analyze and extract the valuable evidence. Looking for the clues and tracing the suspicious activity in the memory can be a slow and steady task if traditional approach is taken and one doesn’t know which tools to use and what techniques can retrieve information fast and in a sufficient manner. Though there are many Linux based forensic investigation tools but only few of them are focused on memory analysis, among them many are outdated. Open source ones are either not properly documented or the documents mismatch the current available version. In this paper I actively researched the live Linux memory analysis related works and took the action to demonstrate, how to effectively carry out live Linux memory analysis using different tool set and showed different approach and techniques to dissect a live memory on Linux platform. The main purpose of this paper is to provide a details hands on demonstration about how to use various forensic and non-forensic tools for incident response on live Linux memory analysis. Introduction In the era of computerized world and digital cryptocurrency like bitcoin, cyber criminals have become more active than ever and they are expanding their devil eye throughout all kinds of industry to single individuals. This rise of cyber criminal’s activity also have forced the forensic analysts to think out of the box and come up with new techniques to response immediately for any unexpected incident. Memory analysis is one of the most sophisticated way that can provide insight details about a criminal’s activity if performed properly and in time. Though memory analysis is been around for some time but it is not only very hard to perform but also time consuming and dangerous as there is a possibility of losing sensitive evidence if not properly handled. There are many forensic investigation tools available out there but out of all, very few can be used to retrieve sensitive information like username, password,email, encrypted keys, hashing details, activity and login information along with many other data. Memory analysis tools are among them what can be a real asset for any analyst. However as the memory focused analysis tools are expanding their wings and integrating new plugins every day, so does the number of new analysts are increasing but many of them don’t know how to use these tools and use them for their own benefits. At first observation, many can make a mistake to think physical memory is randomly constructed wide range of data but that is not true at all. Physical memory is used to store all program’s activity and state in a much disciplined way. The developers take the following steps to ensure the structure of a memory: a.    Employ logical construct (C struct) to gather relevant data into logical units - This represent abstract data types b.   Struct is laid out in a memory in a consistent manner c.	Generate codes to access various members of the struct Analyst must have access to abstract struct object to successfully extract vital information from the memory. For an open source operating system like Linux, it is very difficult to do that as struct layout and kernel version changes frequently. In a case like this, researchers tried to find a solution for the question that how memory analysis could be done in Linux in more automatic fashion? To make analysts life easier few open source projects were founded and many forensic professionals did intensive research to find a way to automate everything which is fast and efficient. Though open source foundations like volatility memory analysis framework and Rekall successfully found a way to use the information derived from debugging streams to analyze memory images from multiple versions of Linux based OS but many of them have limitations to guide an examiners to conduct their analysis effortlessly. This process not only requires many manual steps but also all the memory analysis framework has so many plugins and modules that it can be overwhelming for an investigator to choose between right tool for the right incident response that can lead to the right path to extract the right evidence. This situation has raised questions like:    What is the right approach and methodology to perform live memory analysis without losing or altering valuable evidence?    What tools and techniques to use for different incident response scenarios? In the past academic work, most researchers focused on particular issue to carry out Linux memory analysis and usage of tools only on disk analysis. In this research my prime goal is to address the obstacles on performing live Linux memory analysis, various tools and techniques focused on only live Linux memory analysis and shed light on details methodology to carry out an incident response. I have used an action based method to demonstrate various tools and techniques to perform my analysis. I started with LiME to capture the memory. After capturing the memory and creating the profile , I have used Volatile and Rekall Memory Analysis Framework to perform extensive analysis on the memory image to find out evidence of criminal activity .I have also used simple tool like cat, grep and photorec to demonstrate the techniques to  perform quick investigation on live memory and retrieve valuable information.  A cloud based (AWS ) Ubuntu 14.04 server with 1 GB memory was used during the practical work. The outcomes of the practical work provides a high level overview of how to handle the compromised system, capture a memory of a live system or running the analysis on the live memory instead of capturing it, usage of decomposer library for advanced binary analysis, how to use system map to generate a profile on any Linux based machine, how to extract system information, process memory , network information and perform rootkit analysis using volatility, how to create virtual environment to run live mode using Rekall , details comparison between volatility and rekall and some more techniques with non-forensic tools. Literature Review of Previous Work Socała and Cohen [1] stated, if the investigators want to extract any sensitive information from a live memory image, they must get their hands on abstract struct objects first, which the program handles from the physical memory. In order to achieve this, the analysts should have an exact model of the physical layout of the structs and their member’s data types, which is a difficult process, especially for Linux based OS. In most cases, investigators perform live triaging by copying and moving the necessary files to a remote host, likely configured to the targeted host, make the profile and then copy the profile to the target host. To make everyone’s life easier, the authors have developed a tool called Layout Expert which not only can calculate memory layout of critical kernel structures without any extra tools but also generate automatic profile. The generated profile can be used to diagnose the live memory via /proc/kcore device. The way Layout expert tool work is as follows: First it predicts the struct layout , after that it calculates a profile without installing the full compiler tool chain or contacting any external server. The Kernal sources are dissected into a PRE-AST which is later used to get rid of unnecessary code, macro expansions and struct definitions. On this stage, the new version of Pre-AST is being serialized using JSON and stored on the disk. This file can be shipped to live memory acquisition tool in the data files group. The final version of layout is bundled with the system.map to produce a profile for analysis framework. Case, Marziale and Richard [2] mentioned, in earlier days running a number of statically linked binaries and capturing the output of the commands ( ls,ps,lsof ,lsmod etc for Linux ) for later usage on the target machine was required for live forensics. Physical memory dump was also limited to only string searches. Linux releases new kernel versions often and it is quite difficult for analysts to model the required structure even if they have the complete source code. Without having a proper understanding of the data structure and algorithms of the original OS , it is not possible for the investigators to analyze everything on the physical memory dump. The authors tried to find a solution for this issue and developed a tool called Ramparser which allows live memory analysis tool to work with wide range of kernel versions automatically without relying on any specific kernel distributions. At the beginning Ramparser collects all the required structure offsets ( task_struct,mm_struct,file, dentry, Qstr, inet_sock, Sock, Socket ) to analyze the memory, then it gathers information according to the needs of its features and store them in a SQLite database. This database contains all the sensitive information about memory image that Ramparser can retrieve. Authors had successfully tested the tool on different distributions of Linux from 2.6.9 to 2.6.27 kernel versions. Wang et al., [3] proposed a methodology for live investigation by breaking it into multiple stages such as information gathering, analyzing it and creating a report. This method is applicable for the memory image. Live examination based on the physical memory works on the running host. An external media is linked to the targeted host but this will alter the behavior of the system and it could be difficult to confirm the validity of the evidence. It is very significant to enable the validation of live evidence. After procuring an image of memory, the raw data of the toolkit ought to be accessible for the third party assessor so that they can come to a conclusions about the validation of the live evidence. With this model, it is possible to reduce the impact of live evidence collection by executing the memory image collection task. In [4], Aljaedi et al. depicted the volatile memory strategies, because of fast increment in memory size, the analysts firmly prescribe the live reaction approach for securing of unpredictable proof. Through this procedure, the specialists can gather the data about live processes as well as about the cache and finished processes. Volatile memory examination turns into an imperative bit of examination since the physical memory could have vital information which analysts can't find on the hard drives. To get a decent hold of the occurrence, the volatile information accomplishment is the first step in the digital examination. Typically the examiner accumulates the volatile information through live reaction while the criminal may utilize different libraries to influence the system call, connect to the kernel and update the information. To explore the unstable information of target system, a memory image examination approach is also utilized. This approach may fill in as an alternative to live reaction. With administrative tools, the inspector can acquire all the unpredictable data in the memory including the live and ended processes data. S. Balogh, and M. Pondelik [5] proposed how to discover encryption keys from the memory dump, in Linux they utilized TruCrypt application that has AES encryption algorithm with XTS mode to procure image of the memory so they get everything except password. Investigators examine that the encryption keys is found in HEAP of the last process produced from the HEAP procedure by the TrueCrypt. They discovered PID and with PID last process, they additionally discovered address of pages in the memory dump which is the access process, so by using this technique it is possible to lessen the span of image since analysts don't need to take image of the full memory. All the keys are available in kernel memory since all the encoding and decoding forms are executed as kernel factor. So the TrueCrypt driver appoints the kernel mode memory and store all the keys as non- paged pool. The first restriction of this work is finding the location of the keys. Analysts need to install third party encryption packages on the target machine for various encryption packages. Second, if the memory contain any fraction of decomposition then the extracted keys might have some blunder and the final issue about this procedure is, the key can split through the memory in a consistent way. To properly configure the virtual machine to adopt the target OS settings, tools like LiveView and VFC are commonly used. Mariusz Burdach [6] presented various methods that can be used during an evidence collection phase from live memory for Linux based OS. First he started with running a network sniffer tool (tcpdump) to monitor the communication flows to and from a compromised machine. He pointed that it is very much possible to detect malicious activity by analyzing the captured data in raw format in the network. He also advised to build and copy the following tools to the external media (Such as CD-RW disc) : nc, dd, datecat, hunter, pcat, NetstatArproute, insmod, dmesg that would be mounted in the compromised system. In initial step, he suggests to take a picture of the compromised system’s screen before mounting the media. After that author started to collect information from cache tables (arp and routing tables), current / closed connections and port details, list of modules loaded into kernel memory, list of active processes and list of suspicious processes. A very useful method to detect any rootkit if it loaded into kernel memory by checking one of its task if it is hiding any open port. The author used gdb tool for advance analysis on kcore file. As an example of usage he compared and verified the system call address by looking for address of the sys_call_table from Symbol.map. Project Methodology a.   Basic Idea: Before explaining the methodology, let me provide some basic idea of memory usage when any program is running. Once any program starts, the memory module divide into program segment and data segment part which consist of heap and stack. Program Segment Data Segment b.   Methodology To obtain all the reliable and sensitive data from both segment we have used two main method. Both of the methods has sub steps and some benefits over each other. In this method a memory was captured in lime format with .mem extension prior to analyze. The following methodology was taken step by step to analyze the memory without putting it into risk of losing any information.    Memory acquisition    Creating profile    Reconnaissance    Enumeration of running process    Recovering memory mapped files and directories    Analyzing active tasks details    Investigating for rootkits In this method no captured memory was used and no profile was created prior to analyzing the memory.    Automatic profile detection    Reconnaissance    Enumeration of running process    Recovering memory mapped files and directories    Investigating for rootkits    String search    Detecting and Recovering hidden data In this step the live state memory of the target machine was acquired A profile is required to perform the memory analysis for volatility and rekall framework. To create the profile , Linux distribution, kernel version, cpu architecture information was retrieved, which was used to generate system map file by LiME and module.dwarf file by volatility. Later on both system map and module.dwarf file was used to create the compatible profile to carry out our analysis. However for rekall, we didn’t have to create any profile manually as rekall has a large collection of profiles for various operating systems with many kernel versions. information like system and network information and got a technical understanding about the memory and the target machine. On this step we enumerated the running processes, This step was very crucial to analyze the incident in depth and identify if any malicious activity is in progress. Retrieved the path of all files and directories. With this technique one can find many sensitive information along with further clue of what the target machine was compromised on the first place. This was the final stage to use all the possible techniques to identify any rootkits, infected files or any other malicious activity. Some basic techniques was used to promptly get an understanding about the captured image and find valuable information in between lines using keyword search. On this step the full memory was dissected and all the data was recovered in full form including hidden data. c.

It is developed in python and supports all kinds of OS and have a number of plugins to perform normal to deep memory forensic investigation. It can also analyze a wide range of file formats including but not limited to VMware .vmem ,raw dumps, expert witness (EWF), hibernation files ,crash dumps, VirtualBox core dumps, VMware saved state and suspended files (.vmss/.vmsn), direct physical memory over Firewire and LiME (Linux Memory Extractor). Volatility works in a fast and efficient manner regardless of the size of the memory. Environment Setup To demonstrate the usage of volatility, I have setup an Ubuntu 14.04.5 server on AWS with a LEMP stack on it. The server has a live website running that is configured in a virtualhost with Nginx web server.  It has a memory of 1 gb. Basically we are going to acquire the memory and dissect it using volatility. I did ssh to connect to the target server with my username and private key. I need to have full power on the server to perform all the tasks without having access limitation, so I decided to become root! #sudo su It is always a good idea to keep everything up to date before starting any serious work on the system, so I performed an update and upgrade: #sudo apt-get update #sudo apt-get upgrade To make sure our memory acquisition and analysis tool will work without any issue, we will need to install some third party dependencies. #sudo apt-get install build-essential #sudo apt-get install Linux-headers-uname -r #sudo apt-get install git python dwarfdump zip python-crypto I couldn’t find the distorm library directly from the Ubuntu official sources. So I pulled the repo from github and build that manually. Distorm is fast and easy to use decomposer library. It can return a binary structure upon giving an instruction which is very helpful for advanced binary code analysis. #git clone https://github.com/gdabah/distorm.git #cd distorm #python setup.py build Installing LiME Volatility doesn’t provide any memory acquisition tool but it recommends to use a LiME format to perform and get a better result. LiME is a LKM (Loadable Kernal Module) to acquire our target system’s RAM. It is possible to acquire the memory both to the file system and over the network. It avoids any kinds of interruption between user and kernel space processes during taking the snapshot of the memory. That’s why it is able to capture the memory in a live version and produce the exact copy including all the vital information on the memory without ending or disrupting any processes. We will need to build LiME according to our target’s kernel version. #git clone https://github.com/504ensicsLabs/LiME #cd LiME/src/ #make On the above screenshot if we have a look at the last line of the “make” output we can see the kernel version that we need to use. In my case it’s lime-3.13.0-105-generic.ko. Now I am going to capture the system’s memory and acquire a copy of it on my current folder with lime format by loading the kernel module. After capturing the memory I have moved it to /tmp folder for safety reason. We will use this snapshot to perform our forensic analysis. #sudo insmod lime-3.13.0-105-generic.ko “path=ubuntu.mem format=lime” #sudo cp Ubuntu.mem /tmp Installing Volatility Now we have are going to install and configure the volatility tool. It’s better to get the updated version of the volatility directly from the official site. #git clone https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility #cd volatility/tools/Linux/ #make clean #make It is time to locate our system map which provides details information to volatility about how memory analysis snapshot is structured. In our case(Ubuntu) we can find that in /boot/ so, #ls -al /boot/ System.map-3.13.0-105-generic is what we will need for our next step. Creating Volatility Profile It is important to create a profile to make volatility work properly and perform memory analysis. For any kind of memory analysis using volatility, we must be careful to build the profile for the system that we want to analyze but not the system where we want to analyze the memory. Volatility comes with a list of profile but in our case, we will make one manually as it is not available in the pre-defined list. We need to keep three things in mind to match the profile with our target system, which are: Linux distribution Exact kernel version CPU architecture (32-bit, 64-bit, etc). We will select System.map-3.13.0-105-generic file as it matches our lime-3.13.0-105-generic.ko file. Our profile will require module.dwarf file made by Volatility and our System map, so I will simply zip them together. #cd ../../ #sudo zip volatility/plugins/overlays/Linux/Ubuntu140405.zip tools/Linux/module.dwarf /boot/System.map-3.13.0-105-generic Running Volatility Before we run the volatility, let’s find out if our profile has been created successfully and everything is in place. #python vol.py --info | grep Linux As we can see Volatility is printing the profile that we have created on earlier steps: LinuxUbuntu140405x64 – A Profile for Linux Ubuntu140405 x64 It indicates everything has been setup properly and we are good to start our memory analysis. Let’s have a look at the available plugins from volatility that we can use to perform our memory analysis. #python ./vol.py --info | grep -i Linux_ In this demonstration I am going to perform the analysis using various plugins to give an overview idea of their usage and outcomes. There are total seven main categories of plugins in volatility. Processes Process Memory Kernel Memory and Objects Rootkit Detection Networking System Information Miscellaneous Each of the category has bunch of plugins that can be used to perform details analysis on the memory. These tool set provides insight details of the memory and can help an analyst to navigate through the memory , understand it’s pre and post compromised state along with performing very high level analysis. It doesn’t stop there, it also allow an investigator to gather all the required digital evidence to put together his case. We will run all the plugins against our saved memory snapshot located in /tmp. We will also need to define our profile before the plugin module name. Let’s start with something simple and get ourselves familiar with the plugins. System Information a.    Linux_cpuinfo: It simply prints the target machine cpu details. #sudo python vol.py –f /tmp/ubuntu.mem –profile=LinuxUbuntu140405x64 Networking b.   Linux_arp: This module simply prints the ARP table. It can be useful for an investigator to get some network related information. #sudo python vol.py –f /tmp/ubuntu.mem –profile=LinuxUbuntu140405x64 Linux_arp c.	Linux_enumerate_files: This plugin simply enumerate all the files with their path details. This list of file details can be helpful to find any suspicious file on the system. #sudo python vol.py –f /tmp/ubuntu.mem –profile=LinuxUbuntu140405x64 Linux_enumerate_files Now, let’s have a look at some past history on our target machine’s memory. Process Memory: d.   Linux_bash: This plugin allows us to see all the Bash commands that were ran prior to taking our snapshot. This can help an investigator to understand what the attacker was doing, which directories he was visiting, what files he was opening or if he was installing and malware remotely and so on. #sudo python vol.py –f /tmp/ubuntu.mem –profile=LinuxUbuntu140405x64 Linux_bash It would be also a good idea to look under the hood and see if we can find something fishy. Rootkit Detection e.   Linux_check_creds: This module recognizes rootkits that have increased the authority to root level utilizing DKOM procedures. The obtaining of cred structures prompts an irregularity that Volatility can use to discover if any processes were given root level authority. In the typical workings of the kernel, each process gets a special cred structure and they are never shared or acquired. The Linux_check_creds module uses this by building a mapping of processes and their cred structures and after that reports any processes that is similar. On our memory, we have not got any pid that has similarity with any of our processes. That indicates it is rootkit free. #sudo python vol.py –f /tmp/ubuntu.mem –profile=LinuxUbuntu140405x64 Linux_check_creds f.	Linux_check_fop: This plugin prints the lists of the /proc filesystem and all opened files and confirms that each part of each file_operations structure is in the right place and not hidden. From the screenshot below we can see, volatility couldn’t find any hooks placed by Average Coder. This confirms again that the system is not compromised with any rootkits. #sudo python vol.py –f /tmp/ubuntu.mem –profile=LinuxUbuntu140405x64 Linux_check_fop g.   Linux_check_modules This plugin helps to discover rootkits that break themselves from the module list but not sysfs. We have never found a rootkit that really expels itself from sysfs, so on a live framework they are covered up from lsmod and /proc/modules, but can still be found beneath /sys/modules. #sudo python vol.py –f /tmp/Ubuntu.mem –profile=LinuxUbuntu140405x64 Linux_check_modules h.   Linux_check_syscall This module also helps to identify if the system is compromised with rootkits. It lists the system call tables and checks for hooked functions. For 64-bit OS, it prints both the 32-bit and 64-bit table. In case a hooked function, it prints the ""HOOKED"" on the output, if not, it just shows the name of the system call function. In our case, we haven’t found any hooked function. #sudo  python vol.py-f /tmp/Ubuntu.mem -profile=LinuxUbuntu140405x64 Linux_check_sysca/J Rabiullslam C I EH, CISA,CISSP Rekall: It a memory forensic and investigation framework consists of a set of tool. It is written in python and provides complete memory analysis solution to all major os including Windows, Linux and Mac. Rekall also provides memory acquisition tool for each platform. Overview of rekall:   MacPmem – For most recent OSX.   WinPmem – For windows memory acquisition   LinPmem – For Linux (ordinarily utilize/proc/kcore).   Automatically stack driver and access crude memory without taking a picture first.   Used for triaging and gathering a full image   Focus on flexible live memory investigation.   AutoDetect the right profile   Automates everything   Provide an entire workplace with an easy to understand interface. Install/Setup Rekall: We will need to install some third party dependencies before we proceed with the installation of Rekall. Let’s install and create our virtual world Activate it Once we are done with installing all libraries, we can go ahead and install rekall along with rekall-agent. Install/Setup Linpmem All the memory acquisition tools provided by Rekall uses unified AFF4 imager framework to produce all the images in a similar way. Rekall can utilize all kernel components straightforwardly when performing live examination on all supported systems. Rekall moreover includes a plugin called aff4acquire which uses this physical memory access to get a physical memory image, in a comparable way to the standalone instruments. Memory procurement through Rekall is able to incorporate extra information which can only be reduced from live investigation (e.g. it too captures all mapped records) but it requires running Rekall (with bigger footprint and requires access to the profile repo). As we are on Linux, we are going to use Linpmem for our memory acquisition. However, in this demonstration we don’t need to use the snapshot as Rekall also provides live memory analysis without dumping it first. Let’s give it right permission to work without any issue. The above command will take the snapshot and save it as mem.aff4r file on the current directory. We can perform our investigation using Rekall in multiple ways. a.    Trough Rekall API which performs the analysis using OS APIs b.   Perform analysis on the memory image after acquiring it from the target machine. c.	Rekall-Live: We can erform our analysis directly on the physical memory instead of creating an image first. As we already have seen how to perform analysis on a captured memory with volatility, let’s use Rekall- Live mode to investigate our target machines memory. For rekall live memory analysis, we don’t need to create any profile as it will automatically detect the kernel version and load the required profile to work with. Rekall has wide range of plugins supporting all major operating systems including Linux, windows and OSX. It has six major categories of plugins: These plugins are focused on filesystems only. It has six major plugins supporting various file systems including NTFS, MFT, These are common plugins that can be used regardless of Operating system. There are 29 plugins in this category to the date. They can be used for various purpose like dumping the image, exporting, building index, searching with specific pid id, session or process details etc. These set of plugins are particularly for incident responders. There are total 15 plugins under this category. These plugins use the API to fetch live system state in a timely fashion. All of these plugins can be used with  --live Memory or the --live API mode There are total 38 plugins focused on only Linux operating systems. Plugins focused on OSX based operating system. Plugins focused on windows operating system. In our following demonstration we are going to show techniques related to Linux , General and Response plugins category. Rekall- Live #rekall - -live a.   Pslist It gathers active tasks by using the task_struct->task list. It does not print any swapper process. If the DTB column is empty, the item is most likely a kernel thread. Structured ouput    describe(pslist) In general ‘describe’ describes the output of any plugin. In this particular case, it is providing a details view of the pslist.    pstree It prints a parent/child relationship tree by running the task_struct.sibling and task_struct.children members.    session    paxview    arp It simply provides the arp table details.    banner It prints the os version details.    check_afinfo The plugin distinguishes the area of each function pointer of diverse network protocol. If found inside the kernel or a stacked module, rekall provides details data as well as its kernel-space address. If malware powerfully distributes memory and duplicates code there to handle these functions, the Module column will show up as Obscure. We can see we have so many module column that is unknown.    check_creds This plugin finds out if any process is sharing credential structures. Credentials are dealt with inside through the task_struct->cred member. Likely due to apathy or a poor endeavor at remaining stealth, a few rootkits basically reuse the cred member of tasks that have the specified credentials (most frequently ID 0: root). This plugin reports the area of the cred part of each task. When this structure is being reused, it show more than one line of yield with the same cred address.    check_proc_fops It goes through the file operations pointers of each open file within the proc filesystem. Many  rootkits hook these operations to hide the process. To detect if any operation pointer is hooked, rekall checks that the pointer stays  inside the kernel image or any known module. If a pointer is found outside of these, then it reports with details.    maps It provides process maps. In this section, I am going to use several Linux based simple tools to analyze our Linux memory that we obtained with LiME. Cat stands of concatenate. It’s a very useful and widely used command in Linux environment. It allows the system admin to view contain of file, concatenate files, create single or multiple files, and redirect output in terminal or files. We are going to use cat command and tell it to find all the strings in our memory image file and save everything in a text file named dictionary. If we open the dictionary.txt file, we can see full of text, some binary and some raw texts. Here the question is what we are looking for and how this can help us to analyze the memory. Let’s imagine a scenario where we don’t have any clue about the target machine and we need to response to the incident live and fast. With this techniques, we can quickly find out more about the memory , relevant information os the OS that it was running on and what it was being used for. Not only that, this simple technique can help us to find out many sensitive information like username, passwords , email, social security number and so on. If we look closely at the dictionary.txt file, we can see there is a theme name ,WP, wp-content, phpmyadmin and some plugin directory urls. This indicates that someone was running a wordpress site on our target machine. Let’s try to find more relevant information. Let us use cat command again but this time, we are also going to use grep tool to find a single word “wordpress” within our memory and get a filtered output on the terminal instead of getting all the text from the memory. Now this provides us more details and accurate information including cookie details, server and site details, the root directory of the website , form structure, server users and group. Let us use the keyword “username” and see if we can find anything interesting. From the above screenshot above, if we look closely on the same line as “envato_username”, we cann see “rabiulis”, this could be interesting. Let’s use the keyword “rabiul” and examine the output. It shows “rabiul” was used as an username at some point on our target machine but that is not probably valid. However, it also show us the email address:  ri.sumon@hotmail.com . These techniques can help us to build a dictionary of username and password along with understanding the memory better at an initial stage. It is always a good idea to carry out a dictionary attack rather than bruteforce to save our time and work efficiently. Now though the above tools are techniques are very easy to apply and find out sensitive information quickly but we can not look for all the files separately ( unless we divide them manually ) or look for photos and other formats of files easily. Photorec is one of the most frequent used tool to recover lost / deleted files in Linux. As we are on Ubuntu, we are going to install testdisk library for photorec. On my machine, it is already installed. #sudo apt-get install testdisk Now, we will simply run the following command to start our analysis on the memory.    [Proceed ] It will show the name and size of our memory to confirm our selection. We will select “proceed” and click enter.    [File Opt] As our memory image is a single image file and without any partition, it is printing “unknown”. Let’s click on [File opt] to review all the options.    [ Quit ] We will choose all the options to recover as many file types as possible. We will also select “Quit” to return to the previous menu and proceed to the next step.    [Other  ] As our memory file isn’t a common used file type, we will select “other” option to start our analysis.    Directory selection One last thing we need to do is point the directory where we want to save all of the output files. It takes some time to recover all the files. We can see photorec was able to recover 9294 files and saved them at our pointed directory. We will select “Quit” and navigate to the output directory to review the recovered files. All the directories with “recup” prefix are created by photorec. Let’s open one of them and have a look what it found for us. We can see it has found many format of files including .c,.h,.java,.txt,.jpg,.xml Now this makes our life lot easier and we can easily go through all of these files , sort them our and investigate further for sensitive information, malwares , machine architecture, used applications, images and so on. Let’s a have a peak of one of the random file.

On windows version many tool provides automatic report and neat graphs to give an overview understanding about the analysis. Linux memory analysis tool has still room to grow. Both volatility and rekall has a wide range of plugins. Both of them can perform memory analysis on captured memory but only rekall can perform memory analysis on a live running machine without capturing the memory first. Also rekall has a benefit of using API that allows it to see OS related stuffs very easily. All of tools that were used during practical work, allowed us to learn new techniques on Linux memory analysis from scratch, I was able to perform Linux memory analysis thoroughly and showed techniques like how to a.    Capture memory using third party tool b.   Create profile according to kernel version c.	Analyze the memory for processes (Both active and ended) d.   Analyze for process memory, kernel memory and object. e.   Extract information like cpu version, arp tables f.	Find previous activity on the target machine g.	Analyze to detect rootkit h.   Find details path of all the files i.	Perform string search to find specific thing on raw image j.	Recover all the files including hidden ones I was able to detect malwares on a machine which thought to be a clean machine , recover username, password , emails get a clear pic On the other hand, neither volatility nor rekall can do keyword search or recover the files directly, which can be easily achieved by cat , grep and photorec recovery tool. Discussion We have used third party tool LiME to capture memory for volatility analysis and LinPmem for rekall. There are many other third party tools to capture memory as well. Even though volatility supports many formats of the memory snapshot but it highly recommend to use LiME and rekall recommend LinPmem. This narrows down the option to capture the memory with different tools , on the other hand there are too many tools to capture memory and it is hard to say which ones are the best to capture the memory more accurately in it’s live state without killing or manipulating any process. In this regard, volatility should have it’s own tool to capture the memory. To create the profile one need to have the system.map file . Linux system can have more than one system.map file and it can be sometime confusing for the analyst to choose the right one. Sometime, the right one might won’t be there as if the target machine hasn’t been updated for a while and LiME failed to build or if any dependencies are missing. This can cost valuable time and if we look at the table on the previous section,  we can see volatility always require a profile to analyze the memory. Creating a profile can be time consuming as it also requires prior knowledge about the target machine and the target machine needs to have various third party plugins installed to use volatility to create the profile. This can not only delay the incident response but also there is always a possibility to make changes on the system during acquiring memory and that is a major concern as it starts up a process and add new data on the memory. The same thing happen while performing live memory analysis without capturing the memory image. This newly added data could override the original data which is vital for the investigation. Another related problem is when an analyst capturing the data, the new data is also getting written by the memory and therefore the analyst is actually mixing both the new and old data together. Like we saw, after I ran the LiME for the first time and analyzed that with volatility, no rootkit was found but later on I performed the memory analysis live on the same target machine without any major changes but it was able to quickly detect rootkits. This clearly points our Rekall has benefits over volatility but on the other hand, rekall’s live api based plugins are limited that can run without a profile. However, rekall also has live memory analysis mode that can auto detect a profile from it’s large collection of profile repository. Even though the techniques shown above were for demonstration purpose, it is highly recommended to avoid any case where there is a chance to make major changes on the target machine. For the first time it can create a confusion on the analysts mind and make it essential for  them to differentiate between old and new data. Analysts should make themselves familiarize with the footprint of the memory acquisition tool and eliminate that data quickly instead of wasting valuable time on finding what is relevant and what is not when the situation arise. It is also very important for an analyst to keep in mind that in no cost, it is possible to revert back to original state of the memory once something is been performed on that, even if someone tries to reboot and reload all the programs as memory uses different parts of it every time we start  a program, so definitely the investigation scenario after a crime occurred won’t be identical after someone uses the machine for other purposes. Volatility has different mother category for plugins that specifically point out which plugins are for what purpose . Like network analysis, rootkit detetction etc but rekall doesn’t have any specific sub category for all the plugins except filesystem and major OS. This can make it difficult for an analyst to find the required plugins in a short time when it matters the most. One of the major dilemma for an analyst is to confirm if the evidence what he/she has collected from the compromised system is authentic or not. The main reason of this dilemma is whether to trust the OS or not as there is always a possibility that an attacker can alter/ erase or insert the data into the memory what he/ she wants an analyst to see or not to see. The only way to identify is to have a details understanding about the memory structure and always use their own tool instead of relying on publicly available and easily modifiable tools. Though volatility and rekall are open source but they are dependable as they have official repository to get the original code. In the practical work, I had shown how to extract all the information from raw memory in binary or text format and save it in a dictionary.txt file using cat. I also showed how to recover hidden data and different file types separately using photorec. These extraction procedure is fast but the data is too much that it can be overwhelming for the analyst and sometime an investigator can completely be clueless about from where to start his/ her analysis or verify the findings , if a particular finding is related to the last occurred crime scene or it has happened long before in a different state. It is also very hard to say the source of the file sometime as an advanced attacker can always leave some clues in purpose and mislead an analyst. It is very important for an investigator to know the difference between something made up and original clues. All these above downside doesn’t make the tools or techniques any less significant but they are real facts that an analyst has to face in everyday crime scene. This discussion section provided a clear overview about the limitations of the tools and techniques to create an awareness for analysts so they can be prepared to face any of the situation mentioned above. Conclusion All of us admit live memory forensic on Linux is something not perfect and easy to perform. Analysts are developing new tools and techniques often to make the investigation procedure much smoother as the new technology is emerging.  The need of memory forensic has risen to a very high level and it is not possible to discredit that anyhow as attackers are finding their ways to exploit the revolving technology always. There are still many works that can be done on live memory forensic. In this paper I discussed the basic memory structure and importance of memory forensic. Some major Linux memory analysis focused work was reviewed. Some leading tools were used in practical work to show most common and required techniques in an incident response. Different methods were introduced for live memory analysis, a details procedure and methodology was developed for the convenience of analysts. A comparison was made between different tools and their features, strength and weakness were identified and listed in a table.  I also did a brief discussion about the details findings, limitation of different approach of various tools and what to expect in a real life scenario and how to overcome those challenges to perform a safe investigation. Many researchers and analysts believer attackers are focusing toward memory more than ever as they can easily execute malicious code there without getting traced back and volatile memory also a safe choice to prevent analysts from performing any reverse engineering and explore sensitive information about the attack method performed by the malicious attacker. Many analyst don’t focus on memory analysis or used the dead box traditional approach. The analysts must also adapt to the new techniques and tools related to live memory forensic as the memory focused attack are on rise. This paper explores various techniques with existing tools to encourage analysts to focus more on live memory analysis and new comers to view the forensic analysis from a new perspective in the field of cybercrime and forensic investigation.

1,Fix NTFS partitions and recover files,computers-technology," NTFS Recovery Toolkit is a suite of powerful tools and applications which help you recover lost files and partitions and troubleshoot a wide range of hard drive problems. It analyzes and helps resolve issues on hard drives and solid state drives formatted using the NTFS filesystem. As the default filesystem in all current and recent editions of Windows, NTFS is easily the most widespread file system in the world today. NTFS Recovery Toolkit works with any NTFS-formatted drive or partition even in many cases where the data is damaged or corrupt. It supports data recovery either in manual or automatic modes. Manual mode lets you analyze disk structures and use the freeware disk editor or partition manager to fix common problems. The more powerful automatic mode, which is available in the premium edition, simplifies your work and helps you recover specific data, such as certain filetypes. Recover partitions with Active@ Partition Recovery 20 Every computer hard drive or solid state drive contains at least one logical partition. Many contain at least three, and some users define additional partitions to keep their files organized. For example, you might have one partition for system files and another for your media files and documents. Anyone who dual- or multi-boots from the same storage device will also need a partition for each operating system installed on the computer. However, if a partition is deleted, all data stored on it will become inaccessible. The included Active@ Partition Recovery is a freeware utility for helping you recover your original partition structure along with all your files. Recover data with Active@ File Recovery 20 When you empty the recycle bin or format a drive, it is commonly understood that all files stored within are gone for good. After all, the operating system will warn you before you go ahead with the operation. However, the reality is quite different. The only thing that changes is the master file table (MFT), which serves as a database containing information about every file stored on the device. If a file is deleted or a volume formatted, the only thing that changes is that the previously occupied space is available to new data. Until it gets overwritten, the original data remains hidden on the disk. The included Active@ File Recovery exploits that opportunity to get back what you've lost. The latest version, which is now included in the NTFS Recovery Toolkit 13, adds support for new filetypes including AQ and documents created in LibreOffice and current versions of Microsoft Office. The NTFS Recovery Toolkit also provides several other useful tools, such as a freeware disk editor. Active@ Disk Editor is a powerful application for advanced users which allows them to view and edit the raw data stored on a physical drive. This lets them explore and analyze file structures and edit data directly in different volumes, partitions, and files. There is also a partition manager for creating, deleting, formatting, and naming partitions. The latest edition of NTFS Recovery Toolkit offers improved recovery for Microsoft ReFS file systems thanks to more stable and reliable code. The latest recovery kernel includes many improvements and minor bug fixes too. Get started today at https://www.ntfs.com/recovery-toolkit.htm ."
2,Restore accidentally deleted partitions and volumes,computers-technology," Most computer hard drives and other system storage drives are preconfigured with multiple partitions. In most new systems, there is a primary partition where the operating system and all your applications and documents are to be installed be default. There is usually an additional partition used for keeping a backup of the vendor's OEM software and configurations. This is often used for restoring your computer to factory defaults. While you can often get rid of this partition safely to increase the amount of available storage space on your device, doing so can be risky, especially if you ever want to roll back the device to factory settings later on. Partitions are used for many other reasons too. Every hard disk or solid state drive has at least one partition and usually as many as three. For example, a default Windows installation typically creates three partitions during the setup process, all of which are needed for the operating system to function properly. These are hidden from the file manager, since they don't have drive letters assigned to them. However, they can be deleted or modified using the partition manager. Again, doing this can cause severe damage to your computer if you delete or change the wrong partition, and it may even make the machine unbootable. Although it's not possible to delete your primary partition when you are actually using it, a malware infection or hardware failure might cause a problem with the file system. This could make your computer unbootable. In other cases, you might accidentally delete the partition when you're logged into another operating system. This is a common risk for those dual booting two or more operating systems at once. Another popular reason for using multiple partitions is to keep your files better organized. For example, you might have a partition for your operating system and applications and another for games and multimedia or backup. When you delete or format a partition, it is often assumed that all files stored on it are gone for good. However, the only thing that changes is the master file table and file system, which tells the operating system where to find specific files and folders on the device. The actual files and their contents will remain intact until something overwrites them. This can take weeks or even months, but you have much higher chances of success if you act quickly, especially if the computer is in frequent use. Active@ Partition Recovery exploits this opportunity by giving you the chance to restore lost or damaged partitions and individual files. It also offers a unique last chance recovery method for severely damaged filesystems. What's new in the latest version? Active@ Partition Recovery 20 supports all major operating systems and digital recovery environments, including Windows, Linux, macOS, and DOS.

4,The Essential Guide to Training Data,computers-technology," Where Can I Get More Training Data? There are three main paths to get training data for machine learning projects. The first path is to explore free options via open datasets, online machine learning forums, and dataset search engines. The second path is to evaluate your internal options and see if there is a way to repurpose the data you already have. Finally, the last and often most efficient option is to outsource training data services from a third party. In this section, we’ll look more closely at each of these methods, suggest some potential sources of data, and set out the pros and cons so that you can decide which is best for you. Free Options There are numerous websites where you can download free datasets online. Here are a few of the most popular: Google Dataset Search: In early 2020, Google took its dataset search engine out of beta, effectively releasing over 25 million open datasets to the public from various organizations and research teams. Kaggle: A subsidiary to Google, Kaggle is a very popular website for data science. It features a page for people to share and download datasets, machine learning guides, and more. Reddit: There are also many well-moderated forums for machine learning available on Reddit. There are different subreddits for various skill levels where you can get advice from data scientists all over the world, as well as find datasets, tools, and other ML resources. In particular, we recommend r/learnmachinelearning, r/artificial, and r/datascience. Scrape Web Data Web scraping is the extraction of data from various public online resources, such as government websites or certain social media platforms. Various web scraping tools can be programmed to search for new data automatically based on your specifications. A couple of good examples of datasets made via web scraping are the Wikipedia Articles Dataset and the Airline Twitter Sentiment Dataset. It’s generally legal to scrape web data for personal use, as this falls under fair use policy. However, scraping data for commercial purposes is a little more complicated. If you want to use the data in this way, make sure to do your research and read the Terms of Service for the site you want to scrape before beginning. You could also reach out to the owner of the site and clarify your position with them. Lionbridge Datasets To help you get access to the best open datasets, our staff carefully looks through various online machine learning resources and compiles the best datasets for a range of machine learning use cases. Before you start scouring the web, take a look at one of the 300+ datasets we’ve curated on our blog. You can also use our datasets page to search for datasets by field or use case. Sometimes Free Resources Aren’t Enough Most of the time, open datasets consist of information that is publicly available through government sites or social media. While there are an increasing number of useful open datasets available online, there will be times where free options can’t get you the training data you need. Luckily, there are other inexpensive ways to create custom datasets for your specific use cases. Internal Options Before opting to outsource training data services, you should first check to see what in-house options you have available and if they’ll help you to create the datasets that you need. For example, if you’re building a chatbot to handle online inquiries, you should get in touch with your customer service department to see if they have stored chat logs or email threads you can use to train your model. Of course, data availability depends highly on the problem you are trying to solve with your ML project. Create New Data from Current Resources via Data Augmentation: Before you look for datasets elsewhere, you should try to repurpose the data you already have to build a larger dataset. One common way to do this is through data augmentation. For image datasets especially, there are numerous simple ways to increase your training data through simple image rotations, color contrasts, and other image manipulations. To learn more about how to do this yourself, take a look at our complete guide to data augmentation. Paid Options Sometimes free and internal options aren’t able to provide you with machine learning datasets at the scale and quality you require. In these cases, it’s often more efficient to simply outsource training data from a data annotation company rather than build a data collection and annotation infrastructure on your own. Luckily, there are a variety of training data outsourcing options available to you. Outsourcing Data Collection: One option is to partner with a data collection company. For example, if you are building a voice recognition system and require voice samples from 200 different people, you could simply hire a company to record the audio files for you. One of the main advantages of this method is that the data collection company will handle all of the project management tasks for you. From finding and training contributors to reviewing the data for accuracy, your project is completely managed by the training data company. All you need to do is provide specific guidelines. Outsourcing Data Annotation: If you have the data, but don’t have the tools or workforce to annotate the data internally, you can offload all of your annotation tasks by partnering with a data annotation company. These companies can provide the raw data itself, a platform for labeling the data, and a trained workforce to label the data for you. Companies like Lionbridge already have platforms built to collect and annotate data, as well as a large trained workforce that can annotate hundreds of thousands of data points at scale. Once again, the main advantage of partnering with a data annotation company is that you don’t have to deal with building a data annotation infrastructure from scratch. All you have to do is build specific guidelines and QA protocols for the company to follow. If you decide to annotate your data yourself, there are a variety of options to consider. In the next section, we’ll review some of the more popular annotation tools on the market to help you make an educated choice."

Essentially, every app you intend to use with Xposed needs to be added to VirtualXposed's virtual space in order for the specific Xposed module to be effective on the specific app."
6,Website security check: Tips on how to protect your website from hackers,computers-technology," Without comprehensive and regular website security checks, website security is an element of your cybersecurity that may be compromised frequently. By breaching your site, cybercriminals aren’t only after your sensitive data - they may also use your website as a relay for spam or setup servers to publish illegal files. Common and easily-fixed website security issues tend to be exploited by cybercriminals whose work is made easy through poor security practices. While there has been a reduction of sites containing severe vulnerabilities in the last five years, this still remains a major issue for businesses - especially smaller startups who might find themselves in over their heads. Fortunately, there are ways to protect yourself from hackers on the internet. Here are a few elements you need to make part of your website security check to keep your site secure. Keep security software up-to-date While it may sound obvious, updated software is more critical than ever for your website security. This applies to server operating systems and any other software that you use to run your website. If you are with a hosting company, there is no need to constantly update your operating system as this would be taken care of by the hosting company. Software that may be running on your website such as a CMS, however, should have security patches updated regularly to prevent hackers from exploiting vulnerabilities in the system. While there are tools developers use to manage software dependencies, using these tools, alone, could make you vulnerable to missing updates. It’s crucial that you support this with frequent manual checks. Protection from XSS attacks XSS attacks, better known as cross-site scripting, involve the use of malicious Javascript, which is run on website browsers to change page content and/or steal information to send back to attackers. To prevent this, website security checks are crucial in ensuring that users are unable to inject JavaScript content onto your pages. This becomes a major issue for modern web applications that use front-end HTML to interpret frameworks. While the frameworks provide various XSS protections, the complexity of attacks is increasing. Attackers are finding more and more open-ended avenues to launch their attacks for which protection exists, but is not always sufficient. The best way to protect your website from XSS-based attacks is by relying on the XSS defender’s toolbox. This can limit certain JavaScripts that are executed on your page. Avoid uploading files and use HTTPS It is a big security risk when you allow users to upload their files onto the website. The problem with this is that files that are uploaded could contain a script, which, when executed, could open up the website completely. All files that are uploaded to the website should be considered with great suspicion. Ultimately, to protect against this type of attack, you have to prevent the execution of the script even though files are uploaded. Some options are to rename the file upon upload, which prevents the script from being executable and when possible to use HTTPS connections. HTTPS is a security protocol used to access the internet through improved website security checks. This ensures greater security through one-on-one communication between the host and the client. Due to the encryption involved, the servers that use HTTPS are considered a lot more reliable and secure. Leverage penetration testing for your website Once all the parameters are in place and you have undertaken basic fixes and reviews, it’s time to test your security settings using certain methodologies and tools. One useful way to do so is through penetration testing. Penetration testing is traditionally conducted across your computer systems, networks, and web applications, all of which can improve the overall security of your website. This type of analysis often highlights glaring vulnerabilities, with a host of possible errors that need to be addressed and fixed. Though there are manual means to undertake penetration testing, this is usually left in the hands of more seasoned professionals, who are capable of undertaking the coding that is necessary to manually penetrate a system to test its security. Nail your website security check Make no mistake - hackers will exploit all the security gaps on your website. A compromised website is a danger to you and your clients, especially at a time when concerns about secure data and privacy regulations are at an all-time high. Network security is another integral element of website security checks. Focusing on the most important elements of network security will provide a solid platform on which you can conduct website security checks that leave you and your teams risk-free."
7,10 Steps to Secure MS SQL Server Cloud Hosting,computers-technology," MS SQL is a relational database management system. Applications using windows technologies such as NET are ideally suited for pairing with an MS SQL database. Only a minority of web hosts offers Windows hosting, and not all of these are good choices. This seems to be a comprehensive window hosting packages with servers running with the latest versions. MS SQL server hosting service has a superior digital video camera is placed two feet from a human being’s face. This camera records the structure of the face of a person. This camera also records the distance between the eyes, nose, mouth, and jaw edges of the person. Users are allowed to have access to the data center facility only when the match is confirmed. Further to secure SQL server cloud hosting there are some steps. To know these steps you have to follow the content below: Steps to secure SQL server cloud hosting Step 1 Isolation of data server One must try to isolate the production database servers from other applications as much as it is possible. To make sure that only authorizes traffic can pass to it you should consider putting your SQL server in a restricted network segment depending on the size of the environment. Step 2 Tailor the DB installation You can reduce the possible inroads for exploitation by removing the pieces which you don’t need.  You have to test the feature if you want to keep a feature around the play.  You should keep the production locked as much as it is possible. Step 3 Keep it updated Both MSSQL and MySQL are patched regularly so it is necessary to keep the version up to date. Further, a regular patching schedule can help to implement updates in a test environment. Step 4 Restrict the DN processes As with most Linux applications, MySQL will typically under a dedicated MySQL user account with minimal permissions to the rest of the server. One can verify this with a simple command and make sure that it hasn’t configured to run as root. Step 5 Restrict SQL traffic By allowing SQL traffic to and designated IP address you can be sure that a malicious actor or infected client inside the firewall doesn’t hammer away at your server. Step 6 while assigning permissions use the least privilege You have to consider the granting read access to views instead of directly to tables, to protect sensitive fields if necessary. Step 7 set a strong Admin password You should have a complex password. In case someone is trying to scan your database server they will try to log in so failure to lock it down can result in total system compromise. Step 8 Audit DB logins Overall logging and monitoring should include login auditing for your SQL database. Step 9 Secure your backups Locking down Backup directories restricting the access to the server or storage hosting the data, physical security of removable media, and network access to backups and reviewing who has access to perform. Step 10 Protect against SQL injection There are several ways to mitigate the attacks of malicious code; you can utilize the stored procedures instead of direct SQL queries.  They are very specific in performing functions. The above steps will help you to keep the SQL server cloud hosting secure in case of any problem you can connect to the SQL server hosting phone number.

9,Step-by-Step Guide: Create the Best Custom Computer,computers-technology," Why do you need to build your own custom computer? Here are ten steps to making the best custom computer: You need to choose the best processor and the best motherboard you can afford. The processor you choose will ultimately determine which motherboard you choose. Electronics on the motherboard are limited to the use of specific processors that work with them. Has been prepared. For example: Socket A, Socket 939, Socket 940, Socket AM2, Socket AM2 +, and AM3 AMD are designed to work with Athlon and Phenom processors. Socket 478, Socket LGA 775, and the new LGA 1366 are built for Intel processors. Shopping online at computer hardware stores is a great resource for motherboard assemblies, including processors, motherboard electronics, and memory. This can be a great way to save money and make the selection and matching process easier. Remember, when purchasing motherboards, pay special attention to the particles of your hardware that you intend to use with your custom computer system. The motherboard chipset determines which integrated components (graphics, sound, Ethernet, etc.) are included in your motherboard. Integrated graphics aren't usually as good as dedicated video cards, they're usually suitable for simple office tasks (playing any game, doing desktop publishing, or using a computer for home theater purposes.) You need to buy a card to use it (separate video for these tasks). Choose the best computer case and power supply With hundreds of shapes, sizes, and styles available, the computer is absolutely amazing. I recommend that you consider clarifying any computer issues you are considering purchasing. Some amazing PC issues are very difficult to work with, and sometimes of poor quality. I also recommend that you look for issues that do not require the use of hand tools. These ""toll-free"" cases are usually advanced and do not require much computer construction experience to upgrade or replace parts. Most cases and motherboards utilize the ATX structure factor, normalizing segment sizes, and every single electrical association. Make sure you choose the right motherboard for your case. The right custom computer case can be a nightmare to work with your system, but choosing the wrong one will turn it into a nightmare. While there are a lot of computer issues and less than 50 power supplies, it is strongly recommended that you spend more to buy a case that has a high-quality power supply, which is at hand. Can work without the use of tools. On the other hand, it allows numerous updates over time and still looks attractive from the outside. Most motherboards and computer cases are designed for the ATX form factor. It is important that your motherboard matches the form factor of your case. Note that other standards exist and are available. Be very careful when shopping for your case and look at the form factor. It is important that the motherboard is properly protected in this case. If the installation of your computer components becomes a problem then the best case will not be worth it. Make sure you are buying a case with some useful features. Removable motherboard trays to cool your system, tool-less drive brackets and multiple fan slots are just a few of the things to look for in your new case. Cooling is one of the most important aspects of your computer's long-term health. Make sure there are plenty of places to entertain fans in your case. Find the best computer case you can afford and you won't be disappointed. Cheaper deals often come with cheaper power supplies that may not be able to power high-end custom PCs. Some more expensive cases do not come with a power supply. This can be good because it allows you to make your own choices. If you install a lot of new components inside your computer, it can increase the power supply. So before you buy a power supply, make sure you have it designed to handle all the components you are using. Ingredients strength required: Install as much memory as possible Today's computer systems can perform a variety of tasks, but these applications only 2-3-. Requires more memory than a year ago.

Conclusion: This walkthrough guide. We discuss the necessary preparations needed to begin building the best custom PC. Finally, you will be given a step-by-step way to deal with building your own custom computer system."
10,A Vintage Fashion: Vacuum Tube Radio Overview,computers-technology," 1 Introduction The vacuum tube was an essential part of early radios, used to create and amplify the electrical signals needed for the radio to work. The vacuum tube radio was a new stuff of the early 20th century, and immediately became the ""new favorite"" of that era with the launch of the radio show. Due to the continuous development of technology and the emergence of transistors, vacuum tubes were swept away by the powerful transistors in the 1960s and 1970s. With the improvement of people's lives, they have a new understanding of sound quality, and people are once again interested in the beautiful sound of vacuum tube radios. Compared with the semiconductor radio, the biggest advantage of the tube radio is that the sound quality is obviously better than that of the semiconductor radio. The second is that it is stable and elegant, with classical temperament. In addition, the history of tube radios is far greater than that of semiconductor radios, which are more valuable for collection. 2 Vacuum Tube Radio Circuit 2.1 Input Circuit The circuit from the antenna of the radio to the input of the first-stage tube is called the input circuit. It has two tasks to complete: One is to transmit the high-frequency signal voltage induced on the antenna to the grid of the first electron tube (usually the frequency conversion stage). To accomplish this task, there should be a certain coupling between the radio antenna and the input circuit to facilitate signal transmission. Second, because the antenna induces a lot of signals, it is necessary to select the radio broadcast signal you want to listen to  suppress unnecessary signals. To accomplish this task, the input circuit should be composed of a selective resonant circuit, so the input circuit should compose of coupling elements and the resonant circuit. Depending on the coupling form of the antenna and the resonance circuit. The input circuit can be divided into three types: inductive coupling (transformer coupling) circuit, capacitive coupling circuit, and inductive capacitive coupling circuit. Since the voltage transmission coefficient of the inductive coupling circuit is relatively high and uniform, tube radio usually adopts this type. In order to improve the suppressing ability of mid-frequency interference (because the intermediate-frequency detuning is smaller for medium wave, and it is larger for short wave.). An intermediate-frequency trap circuit is also applied in the antenna loop. 2.2 Converter Stage The converter stage is located between the input circuit and the intermediate amplifier stage. Its function is to change the high-frequency amplitude modulation signal into a fixed intermediate-frequency amplitude modulation signal. In order to complete the task, the frequency converter should be composed of four parts: oscillator (generating a high frequency constant-amplitude oscillating voltage with an intermediate-frequency different from the frequency of the external radio signal), a high frequency circuit (used to select the radio signal, usually it is the input circuit), non-linear components (usually pentagrid converter, used to change the frequency), the intermediate-frequency loop. The converter stage of a tube radio is generally composed of a pentagrid converter tube. The high-frequency circuit is connected to the third grid (signal grid). The oscillator is composed of the screen grid (oscillation anode), the first grid (oscillation grid) and the cathode. The anode load is an intermediate frequency resonance circuit. Therefore, the main mark that distinguishes the converter stage from the tube amplifier is the pentagrid tube and three resonant circuits. The frequency converter can be divided into single-grid converter and double-grid converter according to the different ways of inputting signal voltage and local oscillation voltage. The single-grid inverter applies the signal voltage and the local oscillation voltage to the same electrode of the inverter tube, so the traction effect is large, and the operation is unstable. The double-gate inverter adds the signal voltage and the local oscillation voltage to the different electrodes of the inverter tube separately, the traction effect is greatly reduced, thus double-bar frequency converters are commonly used in tube radios. The structural feature of pentagrid tubes is that there are two metal sheets on the second grid, called the collection screen. It blocks the electrons moving to the anode. There are two metal rods on the third grid in the gap of the collecting screen, which carry negative potential. When the electrons passing through the second grid hit the negatively charged metal rod while advancing, the electrons flying to the anode is divided into two streams, one flying to the anode, and the other being collected by the collecting screen without returning to the cathode. In this way, when the signal grid voltage changes, it will only affect the distribution of the two currents, and has little effect on the total current. Because the local oscillator adopts the total current feedback, the oscillator is basically not affected, so the oscillation frequency is stable. There are many types of frequency converter circuits with different performances, but their principle difference lies in the way of local oscillation feedback. 2.3 Detection Stage The detection stage is located between the intermediate amplifier stage and the audio voltage amplifier stage. Its task is to transform the intermediate-frequency signal into the original modulated audio signal. To complete the task of frequency conversion, the detector must consist of an intermediate-frequency signal circuit (it is the output circuit of an intermediate-frequency amplifier), a non-linear elements (usually a diode), and a load (resistor). 2.4 Intermediate Amplifier Stage The intermediate amplifier stage is located between the frequency converter stage and the detection stage, and specifically amplifies the 465kHz intermediate-frequency signal. The main feature of the intermediate amplifier stage is: in order to achieve automatic gain control, the intermediate amplifier tube generally uses a remote cut-off tube. The intermediate-frequency transformer is the main component of the intermediate-frequency amplifier, and its quality directly affects the quality of the radio. In addition, a shielding cover is usually used to avoid the parasitic coupling between the intermediate-frequency loop and the eternal to improve the working stability. The shielding cover is made of good conductors such as aluminum and copper, and is attached to the case (ground potential), to isolate the entry of high frequency electromagnetic fields. 2.5 Audio Voltage Amplifier To make the power amplifier stage output a certain amount of power, its anode current must have a certain amount of AC component, which requires that the grid audio signal voltage used to control the anode current must have a sufficiently large amplitude (voltage). The output voltage of the detector stage is usually very low. Therefore, between the power amplifier stage and the detector stage, there is always one or several audio voltage amplifier stages. Its function is to amplify the audio signal voltage to meet the input signal requirements. The audio voltage amplifier stage can be divided into a resistance-capacitance coupling amplifier and a transformer-coupled amplifier according to the different anode load forms. In the vacuum tube radio, the resistance-capacitance coupling amplifier is used mostly. The audio voltage amplifier stage and the detection stage usually share an electron tube. The input signal is generally controlled by a volume control potentiometer to adapt to different broadcasts and listening situations. Some radios have a tone control circuit connected to the output end of the audio voltage amplifier stage to flexibly change the frequency characteristics of the amplifier to make the sound pleasant. Due to the different forms of volume and tone control circuits. There are many types of audio voltage amplifier stages. 2.6 Audio Power Amplifier Stage The audio power amplifier stage is the last stage of the tube radio, and its function is to output a certain amount of audio power to make the speaker work normally. Someone may wonder, can a voltage amplifier be used instead of a power amplifier? This will not work. Although there is no difference between the basic circuits of a power amplifier and a voltage amplifier, due to the different tasks of the two, there are significant differences in the selection of electron tubes, the circuit components, and the nature of the load. It should be pointed out that the so-called power amplifier does not amplify the input power itself, but uses the control function of the electron tube grid voltage to convert the power supplied by the anode circuit DC power supply into the required audio power. From the viewpoint of energy conversion, the power amplifier is an energy converter. 2.7 Rectifier The rectifier stage of the tube radio is composed of three parts: power transformer, rectifier tube and filter. There are many forms of rectifier circuits, and the most common is a full-wave rectifier circuit. 3 Classification 3.1 AM Radio In the era when tube radios were popular. AM radios were the mainstream products. Amplitude modulation is to modulate the high frequency carrier with audio signal. Its waveform is symmetrical up and down, and the amplitude is the same as the modulated signal. After detection, the highfrequency component is filtered out to obtain the audio signal. The frequency of the carrier signal (the frequency of the broadcasting station) is the carrier frequency. AM radios can receive medium wave and short wave broadcasts, and some can receive long wave broadcasts. Since the mid-band frequency interval has been unified to 9KHz, its highest audio frequency is only 4KHz. The sound quality is affected, and electromagnetic interference is relatively large. There are two main types of AM radios: direct-amplifier type and heterodyne type. 1)Direct-amplified radio, also known as high-amplification radio, its typical circuit structure is such as: high-amplification→detection→low-amplification→power amplifier A circuit that uses a grid detector circuit and a high-frequency positive feedback, called a regenerative radio, can achieve better sensitivity and selectivity. It can receive AM telegraph signals with high-amplifier and short-wave. Old Japanese-made radios mostly have this circuit. High-frequency signals of direct-amp radios are prone to self-excitation, and the high-end and low-end gains are uneven, and there is no high-amplifier regeneration. Widespread use of reed speakers with poor sound quality made it obsolete. Out of nostalgia, some enthusiasts are still keen on getting recycled radios. The regenerative circuit can not only be applied to direct-amplified radios, but also in simple heterodyne radios, because proper positive feedback can also be used to improve sensitivity. Simple regenerative radios often use reed speakers, which have high impedance (about 10K) and high sensitivity, and can be directly used as the load of the power amplifier tube. Its frequency range is only 350~3000Hz, so the sound quality is poor. Later regenerative radios used moving coil speakers, and the sound quality was better. However, due to the low impedance, an output transformer is needed, and its primary impedance must match the load impedance of the power amplifier tube. Moving coil speakers are divided into permanent magnet, constant magnet and excitation type. In addition, excitation horns are used in AC tube radios, and their excitation coils can also be used as filter chokes. 3.2 Heterodyne Radio The heterodyne radio uses a frequency conversion circuit. The signal generated by the high-frequency oscillation circuit is different from the input signal at a certain frequency. After the two are combined, a fixed intermediate frequency signal (455~465KHz) is generated. The oscillation circuit needs independent vacuum tube as a part before the emergence of the dedicated frequency conversion tube. Some people call the oscillation frequency higher than the signal frequency by a heterodyne type. Heterodyne plus intermediate-frequency amplifier circuit is called superheterodyne. This type of circuit requires a single electron tube to oscillate. Later a multi-pole or composite tube dedicated to frequency conversion appears, such as 1A2, 6A2, 6SA7GT, 6U1, 6K8, etc. The superheterodyne type is the most common circuit of commercial radios. It has an automatic volume control circuit and can add tuning instructions. The superheterodyne radio can obtain more stable and higher gain due to the fixed frequency amplified. The disadvantage is that there is image frequency interference. The circuit structure of a typical superheterodyne radio is as follows: Frequency conversion→middle amplifier→detection→low amplifier→power amplifier 3.3 FM Radio FM is to use audio signal to modulate the frequency of high-frequency carrier. Its advantages are strong anti-interference ability, high signal-to-noise ratio, good frequency bandwidth and sound quality, and the audio frequency can reach 20~15000Hz. Because the FM audio work in the ultra-high frequency band, it can accommodate many radio stations. Because of its linear propagation characteristics, the same frequency can be reused at a distance of hundreds of kilometers, which can effectively solve the problem of congestion of medium and short-wave radio stations. Modern FM broadcasting is compatible with stereo and mono (in the early days of stereo broadcasting, two frequencies were used and received by two radios). Amateurs like to use a simple super-regenerative circuit to receive FM broadcasts. Because it works in a self-oscillation state, it is unstable and has strong super noise. 3.4 Service Life The general design life of the valves is 2000 hours (special tube has 5000~10000 hours), but in reality, many electron tubes break after using 2000 hours, for example, there is no sound. Its performance is not up to the design standard. When there is not any sound from the actual tube, it may have reached 3000 hours or more. The actual service life of the amplifier tube of the front stage is longer. To cite the simplest example: the old picture tube (picture tube is also a kind of vacuum tube) of a TV set, the actual life span usually excesses 10 years. If use it for 5 hours a day, you need to change the tube once a year to meet the actual design performance, and the replaced tube can also be used for other purposes. 4 Audio Maintenance Principle How to repair the failure of the vacuum tube radio depends on the difficulty of the failure. Under normal circumstances, the following steps are used. The first point is to seek clues. What is the difference in the use of the radio before and after the failure, thinking about whether it has been repaired, or what components have been replaced, etc. The second point is the fault display. For faults such as flashover, smoking, burning, etc. Turn off the power immediately and find the factor to avoid damage to the audio. According to the displayed failure phenomenon, rotate audio button to compress the failure to clarify where the failure may occur, and to provide necessary information for analysis and judgment. The third point is analysis and judgment. Make comprehensive analysis and judgment based on the information obtained by self-examination inference and fault display. List all possible direct causes of the failure, and develop a scientific inspection procedure. This not only prevents blind movement, but also accumulates maintenance experience and improves efficiency. The fourth point is troubleshooting. Gradually narrow the scope of the fault, and accurately detect the fault point. Sometimes it refers to (such as electron tubes, capacitors, resistors, coils, transformers, etc.) connecting wires, welding points of a certain component. Determine where the failure occurred, which is important for fault repair. Tube radios are usually divided into high-frequency part, intermediate frequency part, audio part, power supply part and auxiliary circuit according to their working frequency and circuit function. The fault should be compressed to a specific circuit, such as DC circuit, AC circuit, or the anode circuit, the screen grid circuit, grid circuit, cathode circuit, etc. Since each loop in the electronic tube circuit affects each other, a failure of a component may affect several loops at the same time. Therefore, in the inspection process, comprehensive analysis should be performed, that is, each circuit should not be isolated. The fifth point is repairing practice. The repair test can be performed after determining the cause of the failure. The sixth point is repair inspection. In the actual maintenance process, if a failure point is detected, it must be immediately eliminated and repaired. After all the faults are investigated, the radio should be inspected as necessary to ensure the quality of the repair. The specific content of the inspection depends on the specific fault and the type and quantity of the instrument. The simplest one should also be auditioned and take general technical observations. 5 Specific Troubleshooting A radio is composed of many components, and component damage is the main cause of radio failure. When the fault location is gradually reduced, the quality of the components must be checked to determine the fault. Therefore, inspecting components is one of the main methods to find the cause of failure. 5.1 Tube inspection The common faults of electronic tubes are mostly filament broken, poor contact of the electric board, broken pole, pole touching, leakage, breakdown between the cathode and the filament, aging, air leakage, and micro-sound effects. When the radio is turned on, if the filament of a certain tube does not light up, the filament may be broken or a serious leak. The tube shell is cold when the filament is broken, and the tube shell is often warm when the gas leaks. Unplug the tube for further inspection. Use a multimeter to measure the filament resistance at the ""R×1""gear. If the meter indicates infinite, the filament is disconnected. If the indicator of the needle is zero, it means that the tube is short-circuit. When the indicator of the needle indicates a constant value, it means that there is leakage between the electrodes. The smaller the resistance, the more serious the leakage. At this time, the top of the tube is usually milky white. The electron tube electrode is in poor contact, intermittently electrode touching (some are hot electrode touching), and the radio will sometimes have no sound or noise. This type of failure is characterized by being greatly affected by vibration. Therefore, you can tap the tube shell lightly. If there is no sound or noisy sound (sometimes there may be no sound or normal sound after tapping), it means that the tube electrode is in poor contact or intermittently electrode touching. When the fault is serious, the electrode is completely disconnected, which means a broken pole. The tube does not work, and the radio is silent. When the electron tube ages, the positive current and the amplification will decrease. If it was frequency conversion tube, the local oscillator will oscillate abnormally, resulting in the radio cannot receive the radio signal, low sound, or the high frequency end of the band can receive one or two radio stations, and the low-frequency end cannot receive the radio signal. The micro-phonic effect of the vacuum tube is often caused by improperly fixing the electrode, and it can be judged by tapping the tube case lightly. Sometimes it is difficult to determine whether the valve is normal or not. The easiest way is to replace it with the same type of electron tube. If the failure disappears, it means that there is a problem with the vacuum tube. 5.2 Resistor Inspection There are two types of resistors used in radios: fixed resistors and variable resistors (potentiometers). They are not easy to damage. Possible damages include: resistor burnout, resistor body broken or lead broken, internal open circuit, or poor lead contact, etc. Some of failure can be observed. For example, the increase of fault current in a certain part of the circuit, which means the resistor is burned out. At this time, the paint layer on the outside of the resistor is burnt and hot. If the resistor is internally disconnected or the resistance value changes, it can be checked by measuring the ohm gear of a multimeter. If the meter indicates infinity, it means that the resistor is internally open; if the measurement result is too far from the nominal value (the error exceeds 20%), it means that the resistance has deteriorated. The lead of the resistor body is in poor contact and will be broken unbroken, which will cause noise or sound from the radio. This kind of failure is very susceptible to vibration and produces vibration noise. Therefore, you can gently shake the resistor body to see if the sound changes. It can also be measured with a multimeter. When measuring, shake the resistor body. If the pointer is unstable, it means that the contact is bad. The potentiometer that controls the volume of the radio usually has a power switch. The common faults of the potentiometer are: dirty carbon film, wear of the carbon film, poor contact of the sliding contact, loose lead-out piece, burnt of the carbon film, broken bakelite frame of the sliding contact, leakage, and damage to the power switch. When the potentiometer is normal, the radio can only hear a very light sound after power on. If the potentiometer is closed, the broadcast voice should not be heard. After turning off the power, there is no sound. If you cannot control the power on and off, it indicates that the power switch is partially damaged; if the noise is very loud, especially when the volume is adjusted, the loudspeaker has a large sound or interrupted sound, it means that the potentiometer is in poor contact. 5.3 Capacitor Inspection There are two types of capacitors used in radios: fixed capacitors and variable (semi-variable) capacitors. The faults of fixed capacitors are usually leakage, breakdown, internal open circuit, poor internal contact, broken lead, or capacity failure, etc. The common faults of variable capacitors are bump, short circuit, leakage and so on. 5.4 Transformer Inspection Common faults in transformers are coil mold breakage, a partial short circuit, leakage and other faults. A multimeter can also check out the coil mold. When high-frequency coils and intermediate-frequency transformers are locally short-circuited, it is not easy to measure. The substitution method can be employed to test or adjust the loop frequency to figure problems out."
11,Computer and Video Games,computers-technology," Computer and video games have been famous since the 1950s. Ongoing logical discoveries show that supportive and favorable to social PC game substance has extraordinary potential for improving the lives of kids and teenagers.

These days, after homework, the youngsters invest a large portion of their time in playing electronic games. Everything has two angles: your usage defines whether it's positive or negative. For the most part, computers and video games are viewed as an interruption. Typically, parents believe that computer games can seriously influence their kids' conduct, making them forceful, extremist, and sincerely feeble. According to the latest research By the University of Wisconsin proved that computer games could change your mind. So playing computer and video games change the physical mind state of your children and improve their learning ability. As physical exercise is vital for your muscles growth same as games are the physical exercise of your brain Computer games are disapproved of by guardians as they think of time-wasting activity. Also, some education specialists feel that these games degenerate the mind. Playing vicious computer games are handily accused by the media and a few specialists as the motivation behind why some youngsters become savage or submit to the extraordinary enemy of social conduct. However, numerous researchers and therapists find that computer games can have numerous advantages like they make children smarter. Computer games may show kids significant level reasoning abilities that they will require later on. Are electronic games good or bad for children? Positive Effects Team Building:  Since it's the era of science and innovation, so the games are played on the internet. As a result, you have to interact with different players around the world. Online games enable your children to play as a team to win the game. And his/her team-building skills improved. Decision Making: Games work continuously, and most games are relentless and require the player to settle on fast choices in less than one second. Therefore, playing such games makes your child a decision-maker, even in real-world situations. Improve eyes and hands coordination: As the video games required full coordination between the eyes and hands to play them. At some point, when a kid plays these games, he/she starts to figure out how the development of their appendages influences the space and visual references around them. Improves memory: When you play actions and shooting games, they have to quickly decide what data ought to be put away in their working memory and what is needed to discard from the mind. Also, computer games require players to figure out how to ascertain all the needy boundaries quickly. Actual skill development:  Our brain starts developing a structure and makes new neural pathways and transmitters to upgrade its working when a particular inclination is repeated on various events. In times when the uncommon center is applied, the cerebrum molds itself to have the choice to handle gives snappier, which can finally, moreover, help in fathoming issues in authentic life. Negative Effects Forceful behavior: Violent computer games are highly not recommended as these games make your children restless and aggressive in their conduct. When you feel the tone of your kids is changing without wasting time, you should ban such games. Anti-social: Excessive use of everything is harmful the same as excessive computer game playing makes your child socially detached. Likewise, he/she may invest less energy in other activities like schoolwork, perusing, sports, and connecting with the loved ones among players. Wrong Teachings: Some of the computer games available in the market show kids inappropriate qualities. Savage conduct, retaliation, and hostility compensated. Arranging and other peaceful arrangements are frequently not alternatives. Females are fragile characters that are vulnerable or explicitly provocative. Less Attention towards the school:  When your child is addicted to video games, his academic performance decreases. This addiction can make kids favor computer games over whatever else, in this manner, pushing them to not focus on school work. And over time, Computer game addicts contend a ton with their instructors, battle a great deal with their companions, and score lower grades than other people who play computer games less regularly. However, the different researches have shown that game players routinely avoid their schoolwork to mess around, and numerous understudies conceded that their computer game propensities are frequently answerable for helpless school grades."

14,Email Marketing By Spoken Communication,computers-technology," Sometimes the benefits of email marketing are more distinct than initially foreseen. Most Internet marketers understand the basic concept of it which is to email promotional materials to a large group of Internet users to encourage an interest in products or services. This concept is easy for many to understand but sometimes there are added benefits. This article will discuss the basics of email marketing and will explain how sometimes email marketing can be much further reaching than designed. This additional reach can be either positive or negative depending on the quality of the original emails and reactions of the original recipients. It’s a very simple concept which is also extremely cost effective. The general idea behind it is that an email is sent to a distribution list. These emails are intended to create an interest in the products or services offered by the email originator. In theory, this concept couldn’t be simpler but can get significantly more complicated. One of the biggest complicating factors is the potential for the emails used in the marketing campaign to be viewed as spam by either the recipient of the email or the spam filter provided by the Internet service provider. This potential alone creates a major complication because Internet marketers have to make a significant effort to assure their messages are not trapped in a spam filter or immediately deleted by the recipients by appearing to be spam. Once the email messages get through to the recipient, they have a small window of opportunity to make a positive impression on the recipients and influence them to make a purchase, or at least visit the website. Providing quality content, keeping advertising subtle and, at a minimum, providing a clear call to action. All of which can help to get the message across and entice the potential customer to make a purchase, or at least visit the website. As previously stated, the goal of an email marketing campaign is to convince the email recipient to either make a purchase or visit the website. When an email recipient performs either one of these actions, it is considered a huge success. However, thanks to the power of the forward button, email marketing can actually be much more successful than anyone ever intended. A great aspect of email marketing is that when the recipients receive a message they think is worthwhile, they are likely to make a purchase and may also forward the information to a friend or family member they think might also be interested. The ability to forward email messages is comparable to complacent customers using word of mouth to publicize the quality of the products or services they received. However, with the ability to forward a beneficial email message, it’s more effective and reached an exponential rate by utilizing word of mouth. With just a few clicks of the mouse, the original email recipient can forward the message to several people at once. This can result in significantly better results than the business owner had originally considered. No additional effort on behalf of the business owner is necessary."
15,Tips for a great web design,computers-technology," The Internet is full of ""do it yourself"" instructions, which should lead to success quickly. Design Pro Studios tells the tips for excellent web design. There are moments when we can show our creativity, and there are times when it is better to keep the design simple and straightforward. When it comes to designing many different pages on a particular website, we should make them simple. Visitors to a website expect the same color combinations, fonts, logos, etc. on every page and are usually somewhat irritated by different designs. So don't make the mistake of surprising rather than delighting visitors to your website with different designs and colors, as this can quickly make the site look very unprofessional. Do you know why Google is so successful and popular with most people? Because Google enables people to find particular terms and information quickly and easily. As designers, we should use this example as our guide. Information on a page should be quick and easy to find. The correct way of doing this is to integrate a so-called ""search-box"" on the page. If a visitor then searches for a specified term, he can simply enter it in the corresponding field and quickly find it. The purpose of the particular navigation feature is that visitors to the website can see precisely where they are on the site and can quickly jump back up one level. This additional navigation is often a pleasant thing for visitors to a website, as it simplifies the control. Less means more. Obsolete articles should be regularly removed from a website. When it comes to pass contributions, they can be renewed. Only leaving them on the page often causes many visitors not to visit the page a second time. For example, if you visit a blog and see that it was 4 years ago it was last posted, would you visit that blog again? Probably not. This makes the reader assume that nobody cares about the page anymore, so it is rather uninteresting. Links must also be removed if they are no longer available. Links that no longer exist are very unprofessional and annoying. They should always be removed and replaced with new ones if necessary. Your website is by far the most important thing keeping your business running in the digital world. Make sure you have all these things covered. "
16,The Cloud is More Important than Ever For Commercial Real Estate,computers-technology," Transitioning from teleworking back into the office space will likely be full of challenges. Beyond getting back into the ‘old’ ways and keeping the space sanitized, there are more serious and intense ramifications that can come about from the decision to open back up. There are some key employment law issues that need to be addressed as the option to return to the office is introduced. It’s not as simple as just sending out an email announcing the move and expecting your team members to follow the order. In reality, this is a precarious situation that can incur major legal issues. The only way to navigate through this unprecedented situation is to be aware and ready to handle any potential issues following the ‘back to work’ announcement. Here are some key points that businesses should keep in mind as they move forward with re-openings: Understanding Your Team While the ultimate decision to re-open may lie in the hands of a single boss or higher-up in the business, it’s undoubtedly a choice that impacts many people. Re-opening during the coronavirus period is not a decision to make lightly. A portion of the team will inevitably refuse the call back into the office. This is because many people are fearful to re-enter the workforce, they don’t want to stop abiding by the ‘safer at home’ recommendations, and they don’t want to put themselves or their families at risk from interacting with others. In the wake of a pandemic, these are all more than valid points that must be taken into consideration before making the decision to go back to work. What Can Team Leaders Can Do? If you are planning to open back up, play it smart. These 3 tips will help your company ease back into the traditional workflows and mitigate reopening-induced legal incidents. ● Give advanced warning: Reopening cannot be a last-minute decision. Regardless of where your company stands on the matter, start communicating the long term plans to all team members and employees as soon as possible. The more notice they receive, the better you’ll be able to gauge the circumstances. ● Start special training: The safety of your team needs to come first. In advance of the ‘back to work’ announcement, business owners need to start training the entire staff on appropriate COVID-conscious safety protocols. ● Take protective measures first: When you do open up business again, you’ll need to provide your employees with personal protective equipment. Certified masks, gloves, cleaners, and sanitizers are a must around the workplace. Legal Considerations for Calling Teams Back to Work Even if a company is seamlessly prepared to reopen, there will almost certainly be some turbulence along the way. Team members who aren’t ready to stop teleworking, whether it’s due to fears of the virus or standing responsibilities, will likely be something you need to deal with. Here’s what you need to know about these incidents to mitigate the legal risks: Mainly, a refusal to return to work cannot legally be considered as quitting or a valid reason to let someone go. In reality, many circumstances make this claim completely valid. For example, team members that live in an area still enforcing stay home orders or ones who don’t have a safe transportation method to go to and from the office will have legitimate issues. Team members who have been exposed to COVID or have tested positive certainly cannot return to work, but they cannot be fired because of this, either. Company owners who go against this will be the ones in the wrong and can be charged for these actions. Be careful, communicate, and respond with care. In the end, erring on the side of caution is a must as re-opening becomes a close reality for businesses all around the U.S."
17,How To Backup Microsoft Office with Acronis,computers-technology," Ask a few IT professionals if you should be concerned about hard drive failure and you'll hear a common refrain. Something like ""It's not a question of if, but of when"" or ""It's just a matter of time."" Because you'll experience some sort of data loss at some point unless you prepare yourself. Data loss can occur for any number of reasons: hardware failure, human error, fire, flood, hackers and even disgruntled employees. So it is absolutely essential to implement a reliable backup solution BEFORE disaster strikes. SOME DATA TYPES ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN OTHERS Although it is always best to avoid losing data, not all types of data loss are equal. If something wipes out your hard drive and all you lose is Windows or some other OS, it's not too big a deal. It might be time-consuming, but you can just reinstall the OS and be on your way. But what if you had important letters, contracts, spreadsheets, pictures and other critical files on that same hard drive? Then things become much more painful. For most Microsoft Office users, these are the types of critical files commonly produced and often they're irreplaceable. So you have to do everything you can to prevent their potential loss or risk the consequences. WHY YOU NEED TO BACKUP MICROSOFT OFFICE Even with Microsoft Office documents and files, some are more important than others. But the general rule of thumb is that if a file was important enough to save in the first place, then it's probably worth backing up. Realistically, if you were to lose a few template letters or contract documents, you could probably just rewrite them. But if you have to spend a lot of time recreating documents, then you're losing both time and money. Consider how much time it takes you to compose a well-written letter. Now multiply that time by the number of documents saved on your disk. It adds up quickly, doesn't it? It is much less of a hassle and much less expensive to back up your data, even if you're a home user. And if you use Microsoft Office for your business, a good backup strategy could save you thousands of dollars or more. FINDING THE RIGHT BACKUP SOLUTION Just as there are countless ways to lose your data, there are also many different ways to protect it. Ask 10 different people about the best way to back up your Microsoft Office data and you'll get 10 different answers. Suggestions might range from simply saving your files to a USB thumb drive to something as complex as implementing a sophisticated network storage platform. It's no secret that any kind of backup method is better than none at all. So if all you have is a USB drive, then, by all means, use it to store your Microsoft Office backup data. But there are certainly more effective ways to back up Microsoft Office data or create a business backup of your important documents, emails and templates, regardless of whether you choose to store data on-site or off. There are merits to both types of storage. On one hand, keeping your data on a local drive locked in a vault will keep it away from hackers and protect it from malware and ransomware. On the other hand, a fire or other calamity could leave you scrambling to find ways to replace or reproduce your lost data. These days, off-site or cloud storage is generally considered a better option than backing up to local drives. But cloud storage is not without risks. Some cloud storage data centers are less secure than others, which means your valuable data could be compromised if strict security protocols are not followed. Always make sure to ask questions of cloud storage vendors to make sure their policies and facilities meet proper security requirements. Ultimately, the best approach is to follow the 3-2-1 backup strategy: Create three copies of your data so no single event can wipe out everything Save them to two different formats, like an internal drive and external media Keep one copy off-site to protect against physical disasters like theft, fire or flooding HOME OR BUSINESS - ACRONIS OFFERS THE BEST SOLUTIONS FOR MICROSOFT OFFICE BACKUPS So now you know why backup is so important.

20,How will cyber threats evolve in 2020?,computers-technology," Cyber threats are changing with the tide, every single second. Within this ever-changing security environment, the risk of cyberattacks increases on a day-to-day basis and the fallouts become considerably more damaging. In recent years, there has been a greater number of cybercrimes ranging from massive data breaches to cryptojacking and spear phishing. Like the many heads of a hydra, these threats present themselves in newer, more complicated forms at an alarming rate. So, what is the security and threat environment we’re operating in this year? How will these threats evolve in line with cybersecurity protections we’ve crafted to mitigate these risks? Let’s find out. The three key themes of cyber threats In a recent report by Threat Horizon, three key themes relating to cyber threats were revealed. These include: Disruption: In this context, disruption can refer to specific types of attacks like premeditated internet outages or employees or leaders in a company coerced into divulging protected or sensitive information. As is evident, these types of threats disrupt everyday business operations. Distortion: The spread of intentional misinformation through bots and automated sources have resulted in what is known as the distortion of information, which is a major risk for organisations and businesses in multiple industries. This could also occur through subverted blockchains, for example. Deterioration: The rapidly changing nature of technology and the conflicting issues posed by evolving concepts of national security will negatively impact an enterprise’s ability to control certain crucial aspects of their cybersecurity strategies. This is highlighted in the tension between privacy laws and greater security surveillance and monitoring. Vulnerability on the cloud The Oracle and KPMG Cloud Threat Report (2019) stated that cloud-based vulnerability will continue to be one of the biggest cybersecurity challenges that organisations will contend with this year and the years to come. With sensitive information being stored on the cloud, there is an inherent risk associated with this practice. The adoption of the cloud had led to new challenges for firms who are only now getting accustomed to this type of technology. This has resulted in an increase in Internet of Things (IoT) attacks. Given the increasing number of smart home and business devices that are connected and contain a host of personal information, a large, red, metaphorical ‘X’ has been painted on these devices. Unfortunately, the cybersecurity safeguards in place for these devices are far from where they should be, creating easily-breached openings for hackers, making the cloud even more vulnerable. AI fuzzing and AI-based cyber attacks Relying on traditional fuzzing techniques, AI is integrated to create a tool that detects system vulnerabilities, memory leaks, and other anomalies. While this tool is used by companies for cybersecurity purposes, it also becomes a deadly tool in the skilled hands of cybercriminals to start, automate or accelerate zero-day attacks. Even though it sounds like something from science fiction rather than reality, the fact that computers are learning to attack, on their own, is becoming more of a reality, every day. Cybersecurity platforms are relying on AI to overcome these types of attacks while hackers are leveraging it for more malicious purposes. A new generation of social engineering attacks Phishing is widely regarded as a type of social engineering attack used by attackers to trick victims into surrendering sensitive information like credit card information or passwords. Though these phishing attacks can be blocked by enhancing email security, cybercriminals are coming up with sophisticated phishing kits that make breaching data and committing financial fraud much easier than in the past. SMiShing (SMS phishing), in particular, is something that is expected to gain traction in the near future. The increased use of messaging applications like WhatsApp and Slack is prompting attackers to switch to this type of attack, tricking users to download malware on their phones. Mitigating critical cyber threats in 2020 and beyond Going forward, we can certainly expect an evolved and more sophisticated approach to cyber threats on the part of relentless cybercriminals. From SMiShing to IoT attacks, it’s clear that attackers are developing newer means to attack vulnerable systems. In this context, businesses stand to suffer disastrous data breaches, resulting in severe financial and reputational losses. Needless to say, this necessitates well-thought-out security strategies - now more than ever - that address modern cyber threats and attacks."

3,Forensic guide to WhatsApp data acquisition,computers-technology," Instant messaging apps have become the de-facto standard of real-time, text-based communications. The acquisition of instant messaging chats and communication histories can be extremely important for an investigation. In this article, we compare the five top instant messaging apps for iOS in the context of their forensic analysis. ACQUISITION AND EXTRACTION Speaking of iOS, there are several methods to acquiring communications going through an instant messaging app. The MITM (man-in-the-middle) attack is practically out of the question for most modern instant messaging apps; if there are exceptions, we aren't aware of those. Even on Android devices, a MITM attack would require installing a third-party SSL certificate, and even that may not work for some instant messengers. The ability to obtain communication histories from the vendor is a great tool in the hands of the law enforcement. The policies of different vendors vary greatly from near-instant full disclosure to flat non-disclosure with stops in between. Cloud extraction may be possible from several sources, which include iCloud synchronized data (including end-to-end encrypted data), iCloud backups and stand-alone backups in iCloud Drive. It's up to the vendor to decide where and how to store the data; more on that later. Finally, the data can be extracted from the iPhone device itself. For some messaging apps, logical extraction via iTunes-style backups is enough, while some other messengers don't store anything in local backups. Imaging the file system (and, in some cases, decrypting the keychain) is always enough to gain full access to conversation histories. Let us see the extraction options available for thetop instant messaging app, WhatsApp. Today, WhatsApp is one of the most popular (if not the most popular) instant messaging tools worldwide. While WhatsApp communication is based on the Signal protocol employing end-to-end encryption, that fact alone does not make WhatsApp any more secure than other messaging apps as WhatsApp keeps a backup of its conversation histories, making them easily accessible with several acquisition techniques. LEGAL REQUESTS: WhatsApp does not store conversation histories on its servers. As a result, only pending (undelivered) messages can be obtained with a legal request. VENDOR CLOUD: Facebook does not keep WhatsApp conversations on its servers, and cloud acquisition is not generally possible with one exception. Undelivered (pending) messages are still stored on the server, and can be downloaded with forensic software by authenticating as a new WhatsApp client. LOCAL BACKUPS: More often than not, WhatsApp communication histories show up in both local and cloud iOS backups (there are exceptions). ICLOUD BACKUPS: Same as above. More often than not, WhatsApp conversation histories can be extracted from iCloud backups. ICLOUD DRIVE: WhatsApp has an option to save stand-alone, proprietary backups in iCloud Drive. While these backups can be easily downloaded, they are protected with end-to-end encryption. As a result, one must authenticate as a WhatsApp client in order to decrypt the backup (e.g. using Elcomsoft Explorer for WhatsApp). This requires access to the user's registered WhatsApp number. FILE SYSTEM: WhatsApp does not feature any additional protection to the working database. Once a file system image is captured from the iPhone, extracting and analyzing WhatsApp conversations is straightforward. WHATSAPP VERDICT The acquisition of the user's WhatsApp communications is easier than average. WhatsApp conversations can be extracted from nearly every available source including local and cloud backups. Tools required: Elcomsoft iOS Forensic Toolkit and Elcomsoft Phone Viewer; or Elcomsoft Explorer for WhatsApp. Elcomsoft Explorer for WhatsApp is a tool to download, decrypt and display WhatsApp communication histories. It automatically acquires WhatsApp databases from one or multiple sources, processes information and displays contacts, messages, call history and pictures sent and received. The built-in viewer offers convenient searching and filtering, and allows viewing multiple WhatsApp databases extracted from various sources.

4,How To Extract Telegram Secret Chats from the iPhone,computers-technology," With nearly half a billion users, Telegram is an incredibly popular cross-platform instant messaging app. While Telegram is not considered the most secure instant messaging app (this title belongs to Signal), its conversation histories do not appear in either iTunes or iCloud backups. Moreover, Telegram secure chats are not stored on Telegram servers. As a result, Telegram secret chats can be only extracted from the device of origin. Learn how to extract and analyse Telegram secret chats from the iPhone file system image. Extraction options that do not work: Telegram cloud Most instant messengers, including Telegram, synchronize and store communication histories in their own cloud services. Telegram maintains its own proprietary cloud service to deliver messages, synchronize user information and store conversation histories. This information is available to the law enforcement with one exception: Telegram secret chats. Telegram developers emphasize end-to-end encryption for secret chats, which makes secret chats device specific. They are not part of the Telegram cloud, they cannot be extracted with cloud acquisition and they cannot be obtained from Telegram the company with a government request. Telegram does not store secret chats in the cloud. There is nothing to request and there is nothing to access even if one signs in with the user's credentials. However, regular chats can be extracted from the Telegram cloud or obtained with a legal request. iTunes and iCloud Backups Some messengers do keep their conversation histories in backups and some don't. For example, iMessages can be extracted from password-protected backups if (and only if) the Messages in iCloud option is not enabled in the device settings. With Telegram app for iOS, neither the regular conversation history nor secret chats are backed up. The conversation history is not saved to iTunes or iCloud backups; as a result, Telegram chats cannot be obtained from the device by using logical acquisition. Telegram does not allow its conversation histories (including regular and secret chats) in local backups, even those that are protected with a password. What does work: file system images The complete Telegram conversation history including the content of secret chats can be only obtained from the device of origin. The working database must be extracted from a file system image obtained with agent-based or jailbreak-based extraction. Telegram databases are stored in plain SQLite format; they are never encrypted (other than using the iOS file-based encryption feature). Extracting and Analyzing Telegram Secret Chats To decrypt and analyze a Telegram conversation history, open the file system image in Elcomsoft Phone Viewer (https://www.elcomsoft.com/epv.html) and use the extracted file system image to access the Telegram database. Follow these steps to view the Telegram database: Have the following readily available: file system image (.tar) extracted with Elcomsoft iOS Forensic Toolkit and the latest version of Elcomsoft Phone Viewer (EPV 5.0 or newer). Launch Elcomsoft Phone Viewer and open the file system image. Once the file system image fully loads, click on the Telegram icon. You can now browse and view Telegram chats and other information. Conclusion Of the three vectors of attack (logical, physical and cloud extraction) secret chats can be only acquired via physical acquisition. Regular chats, however, can be also extracted from the Telegram cloud service or obtained via a legal request."

6,Acronis Universal Restore Ensures Bare-Metal Restore of Dissimilar Hardware,computers-technology," Bare-metal restore is a form of complete disk-image recovery that restores a system to a computer with an empty ""bare-metal"" disk drive - a disk drive without OS or applications. ADVANTAGES OF BARE-METAL RESTORE Fast - you avoid a lengthy system configuration process, driver rollout and application installation. If you have a system image, you can reinstall and reconfigure in minutes. Easy - you don't need to build your computer's setup brick-by-brick. Instead, you get the entire house in one easy recovery! Safe - if your computer is infected by a virus or ransomware, recovering the clean image will get rid of potential sources or the results of infection. CAVEATS OF BARE-METAL RESTORE If you try to recover an entire disk image to a new system that has dissimilar hardware, it may fail to boot. Why is this? When you install an operating system, the installer analyzes your hardware and configures the OS accordingly by installing the appropriate drivers. When the operating system boots, it only loads the drivers needed for your exact hardware. For some devices, such as graphic cards or sound devices, changing the hardware is not an issue. You can reinstall the drivers when the system loads. However, when it comes to the CPU, motherboard or HDD controller, the driver must match because the system needs these drivers to boot. These devices are boot-critical and the system will not boot without the proper drivers. Consequently, if you create an image on one machine and try to recover it to another system with dissimilar boot-critical devices, the boot may fail since the drivers do not match. Fortunately, this can be easily fixed by using dissimilar hardware restore technology - Acronis Universal Restore. Available with Acronis Backup products (https://www.acronis.com/en-us/business/backup/), it can reconfigure your OS without booting by changing settings and injecting and activating drivers to ensure the system boots. This technology lets you restore a disk-image to any dissimilar hardware - even virtual or cloud! HOW IT WORKS After recovering your disk-image as-is, Acronis Universal Restore analyzes the new hardware platform and tunes the Windows or Linux settings to match the new requirements. CPU Acronis Universal Restore analyzes the change in CPU type and number, and changes the settings of the operating system to match. This ensures that the operating system can utilize multiple CPUs and/or a different number of cores. HAL Acronis Universal Restore analyzes each machine type and changes the HAL setting of the OS. This is especially important if your new system has a different number of CPUs or is a different CPU brand. Boot-Critical Hardware Drivers Acronis Universal Restore analyzes the target hardware and injects all the drivers that are required to boot the operating system. These include SATA, SAS, SAN HBA, SCSI and RAID drivers. This is the most critical part of the process. If Acronis Universal Restore cannot find the appropriate drivers in Windows, you are prompted to provide standard Microsoft drivers. In Linux, it activates the driver modules that are already part of your Linux kernel. Also, Acronis Universal Restore disables all boot-critical hardware drivers that are not needed on the new machine to eliminate compatibility issues. Network drivers To ensure network connectivity, Acronis Universal Restore injects and activates any required network drivers. On Windows, it disables and removes the configuration of the old network adapters so you don't need to delete hidden or missing devices when configuring the network. UEFI-BIOS and MBR-GPT conversions Many modern computers use the UEFI method of booting the operating system, while virtual servers and older machines predominantly use BIOS. For many UEFI systems, your hard disk is divided with a newer GPT partition layout, the BIOS systems require the old MBR partitioning style. Acronis Universal Restore automatically adjusts the partition layout, boot loader settings and boot configuration. It detects your system's ability of booting on the target machine's BIOS or UEFI platform and chooses the appropriate method automatically - no interaction from your side is required. This allows you to restore the image of the original BIOS machine to the UEFI platform as well as the image of the original MBR disk to the GPT, or vice versa. SUMMARY Bare-metal restore, paired with Acronis Universal Restore, is the fastest method to recover your entire PC or servers to the same or dissimilar hardware. This drastically reduces your RTO and reduces downtime costs, meaning that implementation of a bare-metal restore solution yields a positive ROI after a single recovery.

7,Seamless V2P Backup and Restore,computers-technology," Today's increasingly complex IT environments demand more sophisticated virtual-to-physical (V2P) backup solutions than ever. Trying to keep up with licenses, maximize storage space and manage costs while juggling virtual/physical machine issues is practically a full-time job. Fortunately, there are some new V2P technologies that can help today's busy IT departments with virtual-to-physical moves and their physical-to-virtual counterparts. Acronis Cyber Backup addresses many of the challenges involved with V2P, including how to back up and restore virtual machines on physical systems. Powered by the Acronis AnyData Engine, Acronis Cyber Backup delivers robust, easy-to-use unified data protection and disaster recovery for advanced IT environments. Using a single, web-based console to manage data protection across any environment or location, Acronis Cyber Backup also enables V2P migration and vice versa while saving companies time and money. KEY FEATURES OF ACRONIS CYBER BACKUP: Scalable architecture that supports V2P conversion of multiple machines Ability to recover an entire system down to a single folder or file when you image a virtual machine to a physical machine Advanced security to ensure extra protection during V2P backups and restores Bare metal restore capabilities that allow you to restore an image to bare metal hardware Acronis Active Restore, which reduces recovery times an average of 50% So if you have wondered how to safely recover virtual machines on physical system or how to back up VMware virtual machines to a physical system, take a closer look at how Acronis Cyber Backup works. DATA MIGRATION: AVOIDING THE THREE Ds Today most large enterprises and small- to medium-sized businesses have some combination of physical servers and virtual machines to support production environments and a variety of production workloads. Occasionally organizations need to migrate these workloads to/from virtual machines or to different hardware because of scheduled tasks like routine maintenance and system upgrades, or due to unforeseen events like disaster recovery. Unfortunately, if you have a virtual environment and need to migrate to a physical machine, no hypervisor vendor offers V2P tools. And few IT professionals know how to do it. The bottom line is that data migration isn't easy. There are a number of complications that can lead to one or all of the ""three Ds"" - downtime, delay and data loss. Acronis Cyber Backup tackles these challenges head-on. Its disk imaging technology thoroughly captures every component of the production workload, including the OS, settings, registry, application and data. The result is a safe, simple way to move server workloads and production systems to different hardware, to and from virtual machines and across different hypervisors. It also enables users to quickly migrate an entire server onto bare metal. HOW TO PERFORM DATA MIGRATION USING ACRONIS CYBER BACKUP Performing a workload migration using Acronis Cyber Backup involves three distinct stages. The Acronis AnyData Engine detaches the server workload from the original platform: The migration process starts with Acronis Cyber Backup creating a disk image - a full copy of everything that is on the disks and partitions of a particular server or virtual machine. During the copy process the data is abstracted, which removes platform specifics from the data in order to reduce it to a set of essential characteristics and put it into a general, unified format. Acronis applies the server workload to the new hardware: The next step is to apply the content of the disks and partitions to the target physical server or virtual machine. When migrating to a physical server, you don't need to install an operating system on the new machine. You simply load the image for bare metal recovery. Furthermore, the disk configuration of the target machine does not have to match the original machine because Acronis resizes the disks and partitions. The disks only have to be large enough to hold all the data. Acronis fine-tunes the server workload to match the new hardware: The Acronis AnyData Engine analyzes the new hardware platform or hypervisor and optimizes the OS settings to match the new requirements. When this process is finished, not only have you performed a successful data migration, but you also have a complete image backup of your system. That means all of your system information - including registry keys, license keys, settings and application-specific data - has been safely captured for future use.

9,Hard Drive Cloning Software - What It Is and Why You Need It,computers-technology," Basically, disk cloning is the process of perfectly copying every bit of information from one computer hard drive to another disk. Often, the contents of the first disk are written to an image file as an intermediate step. The second disk is then created with the contents of the image. What Is Disk Cloning Software? Disk cloning software replicates a computer's OS, drives, software and patches. It eliminates the time-consuming technical process of manually reinstalling and reconfiguring a system so you can perform the following: Reboot and restore a computer to an earlier version Set up multiple computers with duplicate configurations Upgrade hard drives to larger capacities or replace a damaged hard drive Complete system recovery in the event of software problems or computer failure Backup vs Disk Cloning Software Okay, so of course I want to protect my data. Isn't that what backup software is for? Not entirely. Full-image backup software and file/folder backup software are not the same as disk cloning software, though the reasons for using them may overlap. Use backup software when you want to: Back up individual files or folders to the cloud for offsite protection and remote access Back up an entire computer periodically Use cloning software when you want to: Set up one computer the way you want, clone the hard drive and then install the clone on each subsequent computer. If you need to upgrade your computer hardware, simply popping in a cloned disk in the hardware may not work. You'll need to use some operating system setup features to make sure all the latest hardware is supported, or use a backup and recovery tool, such as Acronis True Image 2020 with Acronis Universal Restore, to support restoration of a disk to a computer with different hardware than the original computer. The Benefits of Cloning Software When compared to backup software, the biggest benefit of cloning software for most home computer users is that you have a complete image of your computer at a single point in time. For example, you may want to have the ""perfect setup"" for your family or office, with all applications and settings that you can use again at any time. The data files, such as Microsoft Word documents, photos and videos, can be on a separate hard drive or volume. This way, all the computers are in sync: they have the same programs and users will have the same experience regardless of which machine they use. But, each computer can hold different data. So, there may be different Word and Excel documents on each computer, but the Word and Excel versions and the user interface - how these programs are accessed - are the same on each computer. Key Cloning Software Features The best cloning software is: Simple - Utilizes data migration to transfer data. Typically offers the easiest way to backup and restore your system. Make sure the drive cloning software is user-friendly and intuitive. Efficient - Allows you to restore multiple computers simultaneously instead of spending hours configuring each computer individually. Flexible - Offers options to define when, what, and where to backup your data. Secure - Ensures your data is protected and safe using the most stringent security available. The Best of Both Worlds: Acronis True Image Most users require both backup and cloning solutions. Acronis True Image 2020, available for both PC and Mac, efficiently and securely provides continuous data protection while maximizing your computer's performance during backups and minimizing storage space requirements.

11,Simplify your migration from QuarkXPress to Adobe InDesign,computers-technology," Graphic designers have lots of different options available to them when it comes to software. However, while the popular applications offer their pros and cons, many designers ultimately end up turning to the industry standard for the sake of compatibility and using a universal format. QuarkXPress is a robust product that offers a wide range of features and can easily hold up against other leading solutions. However, it also has its own proprietary file format, which means designers might run into compatibility issues.

13,"AAC vs Ogg, Which is Better?",computers-technology," As the revolutions of the music industry go deeper, music streaming services, as well, are taking advantages of the trend to optimize their online streaming strategies for bigger markets. Apple Music and Spotify are the two of them. For better music streaming quality, Apple Music applies AAC format as the successor of MP3 in its service. And Spotify uses open-source Ogg Vorbis format for streaming. Today we’re going to do a comparison of AAC vs Ogg Vorbis in order to help you choose the better one. What is AAC? AAC is the abbreviation of Advanced Audio Coding, which is an audio coding standard designed to replace MP3. It’s lossy and compressed, but it’s been proven to sound better than MP3 at the same bit rate. AAC is the default audio format for iTunes and Apple Music. Its file extension is .m4a. What is Ogg? Ogg is a free open-source lossy format. It’s unrestricted by patents and created to provide high quality and efficient streaming. The .ogg is used as the filename extension for Ogg Vorbis and this format is used in Spotify music streaming. What’re the Differences between AAC and Ogg? Patents AAC is part of the MPEG-4 specification, and a patent license is required for AAC codec developers. That means free use of this format is nixed. While Ogg is open-source and it is free from software patents which makes it easier to use. Compatibility AAC is the standard audio format for iPhone, iPod, iPad, Nintendo DSi, Nintendo 3DS, iTunes, DivX Plus Web Player, PlayStation 3 and various Nokia Series 40 phones. And since the Ogg Vorbis is free, it’s been utilized in a number of both commercial and non-commercial media players, along with portable media players and multiple GPS receivers. Besides, it’s been applied to Spotify songs with DRM protection. Quality Before we define the quality of these two types of audio formats, here is a brief comparison of audio quality at different bit rate. Both AAC and Ogg are lossy and compressed, while at different bit rates, their performances vary a lot and to sloppily say this one is better than the other one solely from bit rate performance is flimsy. So it’d be more convincing to compare AAC and Ogg in real context, which is to rank them based on the most popular platform they’re respectively applied to — — Apple Music and Spotify. 256kbs AAC vs 320kbs Ogg Image for post Apple Music streams its songs at highest bit rate of 256kbs AAC, and Spotify does it at highest bit rate of 320kbs Ogg. We’ve tested songs ranging from classical, jazz, rock to R＆B and electronic music, the results might be objective, but there’s a slightly perceivable cleanliness you can feel from each song played on Spotify. And since Spotify normalizes the volume, you can notice there’d be more detail from Apple Music simply because it’s louder. But the thing is, we’re testing the same songs from different online streaming services and for better comparison, the less variables are required. And so these songs should be better played on the same music player. To do so, you can download and decrypt Apple Music songs and Spotify songs in advance. Play them under one media player, and then judge them by your own listening. Final Thoughts As an ordinary user, it doesn’t matter whether you can understand how these two format work or not. But speaking of which one is better for listening to, all that stuff is based on your listening habits and how much you can feel inside the music from different audio formats. So it’s better to feel it yourself and choose what you feel comfortable with."

15,How To Take Grow Light Help In Indoor Plants,computers-technology," Warm vs. cool? “Full-spectrum?” LED, CFL, or HID? Here’s what you need to understand approximately indoor develop lighting for beginning seeds, gardening interior, or houseplants. Information the fundamentals of grow lights for indoor plant life and indoor gardening Large, LED arrays like this are not your most effective alternatives when it comes to developing lights for indoor gardening and vegetation. Indoor development gives many advantages. The biggest blessings are the most apparent: garden pests can’t get at your vegetation, and you have overall management over the climate. Yet unless you’re lucky sufficient to have a solarium or greenhouse attached to your private home, providing enough light in your plants will, in all likelihood, be an obstacle (color-tolerant houseplants excepted). South-going through windows might also offer mild enough for a tray or of seedlings. However, if you need to grow greens, or every other sun-loving plants, to maturity, you’re going to need to grow to light. The indoor lighting fixtures found in maximum homes do little to support photosynthesis. Traditional incandescent bulbs do now not have the right spectrum of light, or intensity, to supplant the solar. Household fluorescent bulbs can make powerful grow lights, but only if they’re located within some inches of the foliage and left on for sixteen hours in step with day – not perfect. Warm vs. Cool: Understanding Color Spectrum in Grow Lights When purchasing for develop lights, you’ll notice they are categorized with numbers like 2700K or 4000K. This refers to their relative warm temperature or coolness at the color spectrum – the better the range, the cooler the light. Foliage increase is typically first-rate around 6500K, though many plants need a length of warmer mild, around 3000K, with a purpose to produce plant life, and as a consequence, fruit. In other phrases, if your purpose is to clearly produce seedlings, inexperienced leafy vegetables, or root plants, you most effectively want better spectrum bulbs. If you need to grow plants, marijuana, or any fruiting plant (cucumbers, tomatoes, peppers, lemons, etc.), you’ll also require low spectrum bulbs. You can a few forms of bulbs are available in the complete-spectrum form, however, simplifying matters. Types of Grow Lights There are three major kinds of developing lighting fixtures. Indoor develops lighting fixtures for starting seeds. Fluorescent Grow Lights The popular fluorescent bulb generally denoted T12, makes a respectable develop mild for houseplants, starting seeds, supplementing the natural light of a window, and different conditions where lighting wishes are modest. They are fairly vulnerable in light intensity, but, and must be positioned within some inches of the foliage to have a whole lot of an impact. , Which are narrower in diameter than T12s (but still broadly to be had anyplace lightbulbs are bought), have a miles higher mild depth, making them appropriate as a sole mild source for solar-loving vegetation. Compact fluorescent bulbs (CFLs) are an alternative for small spaces, or in case you don’t like the look of long rectangular fluorescent mild fixtures – CFLs will screw into an ordinary incandescent mild fixture. Look for specialized full-spectrum fluorescent develop bulbs (like this, or, which fits into a popular socket) to provide the right balance of mild for flowering flowers. LED Grow Lights While they’re extensively more luxurious than fluorescent bulbs, LEDs use half the energy and final five instances longer, more than paying for themselves ultimately. The average LED bulb from the hardware keep is not designed for plant boom. However – you need special, a fantastically new generation that is increasingly more to be had from horticultural suppliers. LED grow bulbs are able to plenty of extra light depth than fluorescent bulbs and are available in complete-spectrum shape. A clean rule of thumb: Fluorescent bulbs are often used when growing only a handful of vegetation; LEDs are optimum for large quantities in view that you can attain higher light depth in line with rectangular foot. Another benefit of LEDs? They produce little or no heat in comparison to other bulbs – a difficulty which can end up problematic when you have a variety of lighting in a small space. HID Grow Lights Before the appearance of LED develops lights, have been the principal alternative for massive indoor plantings. They are extremely effective. However, they are highly-priced to purchase, consume electricity inefficiently, require unique light furniture, and supply off plenty of warmness. All that stated, they’re very effective and are still widely used. If you want to develop massive plants like tomatoes or lemon trees, HIDs are suitable bet because the light penetrates farther into the foliage than with other bulbs. There are kinds of HID bulbs. High-stress sodium (HPS) bulbs are nice for flowering (low spectrum), while MH (steel halide) bulbs are required to guide vegetative increase (high spectrum); the two types are regularly used in conjunction. Unfortunately, each kind calls for its very own fixture. How to Install Grow Lights Installation requirements vary notably, relying on the scope of your indoor lawn and the type of bulb used. But here are a few fundamental steps to get you started. Figure out how many bulbs you need. Most safe to eat vegetation require at least 30 watts in line with the square foot, but fruiting species (like tomatoes) usually received’t produce considerable extremely good vegetation without 40 to 50 watts per rectangular foot. Wattage is constantly indicated at the bulb package. Simply multiply the square footage of your developing place by using the range of watts you intend to offer (between 30 and 50); then divide through the number of watts provided by using the bulbs you intend to use. Devise a light rack. You’ll want a manner to guide the bulbs over the flowers at the right top. And unless you’re developing something a good way to remain at more or less the same height throughout its lifespan, you’ll additionally need a manner to raise the light rack because the vegetation develops. This is generally performed via a few forms of pulley system or through placing the light furniture with metallic chain – that manner, you could easily modify the peak by means of converting the link the light fixture is home from. Also, they are to be had to buy online. Add the necessary accouterments. It is typically clever to plug your lighting right into a timer to ensure they get the right quantity of light, and that they get it at the equal time every day. Are to be had for indoor developing, though a fashionable additionally works. If your lighting fixtures deliver the temperature above 80 degrees or so to your developing place, deploy an airflow gadget to prevent warmness stress. Aficionados make use of reflectors and all sorts of different grow light add-ons to obtain the most advantageous results. How Long Should I Leave Grow Lights On? Plants grown indoors require extra hours of light than those grown outside. 14 to 18 hours of light, according to today, is usually recommended for most fit to be eaten species when grown underneath synthetic lighting fixtures. Don’t be tempted to leave the lights on 24-7; however – at least six hours of darkness every day is critical to plant health. As the vegetation grows, improve the mild fixture for that reason to keep the highest quality distance, which varies relying on the form of bulb used and its wattage (the higher the wattage, the farther away from the bulb maybe). Here are the simple parameters: Fluorescent Grow Light: three to 12 inches LED Grow Light:12 to 24 inches HID Grow Light: 24 to 60 inches"

17,What Makes Online Casino Games So Popular?,computers-technology," New gaming sites seem to pop up from nowhere and they now proliferate on the Internet. How did casino games manage to translate its popularity in the real-world to global excitement in the virtual world? What attracts so many people of different persuasions from all walks of life to them? Here are the top six reasons for online casino games' popularity. (1) Newfound Accessibility. Real casino gaming had always enjoyed a sense of exclusivity. It is a world that seemed only to allow entrance to the moneyed set and their glamorous posse-people who have the means to pay exorbitant fees as well as to play fast and deep. When casino games found its way online, they suddenly became more accessible to more people. With Online casino games, there is no need to put up large amounts of money, there is no need to maintain appearances, and there is no need to pay for the side costs of a trip to a casino, i. e. airfare, hotels, allowing ordinary people to enjoy them. (2) Cozy comfort. Even players who can afford to play in real casinos have found that sometimes they do prefer to play their favorite games online. Why? Simply because of the comfort that playing from home gives. Online casino games allow anyone to play while in their pajamas, while lying in bed, or while watching their favorite cable sports channel. No one can do that in real casinos, no matter how rich or how big a celebrity they are. (3) Networking. As with anything entertaining that hits the Internet, the popularity of casinos online games spread so fast because of the power of networking. It is easy to send links, reviews, multimedia items to other people. The power of personal recommendation, made through social networking channels, blogs, emails Online casino had a multiplier effect on the fame of games and sites (4) Better competition. Because the number of players joining online casino game sites had grown exponentially, there is a heightened sense of excitement for players. All day, everyday, millions of people from all the world's time zones log in and play online casino games. That makes for dynamic, fast-paced, energetic games between so many people all seeking the thrill of a play. (5) Promise of easy money. A source of fascination and constant attraction that is shared by both real and online casino games is the promise of wealth. Real money can be won in online casino games. There are now more competitors betting which means the element of risk is steeper and the pot money is bigger. That's a potent combination many thrill-seekers would be hard-pressed to resist. (6) Celebrity. Not only can joining online casino game sites seem like an easy way to gain a whole lot of money, it is now also seen as a way to get recognition. Online winners also become celebrities within their game sites, sometimes even in social networks. That kind of celebrity can bring in endorsement deals, hosting jobs, or events appearances which equal big bucks. Sometimes, their celebrity can bring them a lot more money than the initial jackpot they got from playing games online."

19,Buying Backlinks for SEO - Is that bad?,computers-technology," Buying Backlinks for SEO - Is that bad? What is paid link building? And how that affected in your site and business. Paid links is not bad but you need to know when, from whom and why buying. Why website owners buy SEO links? In order to be able to answer these questions, you must have at least 5 years of solid experience in buying links for SEO purposes and have tested on your own sites all sorts of strategies to know what works and what will lead to problems. Paid links aren’t all bad, there are several types of paid links going around and just a few of them are: Sponsored reviews Sitewide links in-context links Sponsored Wordpress themes Off-page SEO techniques that works To improve the organic results of your website in the best search results, you need a comprehensive SEO strategy. You should first do an audit and then determine the steps you need to focus on all aspects and techniques to optimize demand. Your SEO strategy, which includes the 2 main types of SEO: on-page, and off-SEO techniques. On-page SEO shows search crawlers what a site is about. It helps Google bot understand the content in site and rank in his SERP. Off-page SEO shows search crawlers that a site is valuable and important because the brand is authoritative and popular in Internet. Its not all bad , on every pagerank update at least 80% of the people using paid links as their main advertising method end up with a website with a higher pagerank then before, doing a few shady things once in a while does not get you slapped by google. In my blog7 I am trying to explain in plain language why this is happening. Link building is the hardest part in search engine optimization and it must be done very carefully by a professional who has experience, otherwise the probability of the site being ruined is huge. One thing you should probably know or already may know is that your website is for people not search engines, search engines only provide you with the traffic needed. It’s the people, the readers who actually power your website and help you gain revenue. What matters in one link? Sites authority Content relevance Anchor text of link Number of links As you develop your own link building strategy, you should focus on getting high-quality dofollow links from reputable sites, in your niche with the right content, and the right anchor text. Otherwise the link you will receive will be of small value. Any upgrade to the website means an attraction to a considerate ratio of visitors, in my case PR is what attracts visitors here, how i did it, how they can do it, things to do, things to avoid…etc. You can’t preach something you can’t do. A good pr can make upto 60% of your revenue and if paid advertising seems like the easiest way to go about, then what the heck? Shoemoney talked about how johnchow is not found on google anymore, i agree, hes not there. But he uses google adwords now, that gives him even more coverage over relevant traffic! Chow’s blog is even growing at a faster pace then before without even being in google’s index! The paid advertising, how ever shady it might’ve been, paid off for john at the end. If you think about it, it’s not that bad really..Losing google listings in return for 50k+/month from one blog…"

1,Restore formatted disks and deleted files with Active@ UNFORMAT,computers-technology," No two data recovery scenarios are the same. There are so many things which can go wrong, even on today's machines, which are a lot more reliable than they used to be. But in spite of that, most cases of data loss occur due to human error. Most of us have experienced that dreaded situation where we have emptied the recycle bin only to realize too late that there were important files there too. It is an easy mistake to make if you are in the habit of quickly deleting files you think you no longer need. Perhaps even more common, however, is accidentally formatting the wrong hard drive or partition and deleting every single file and folder on it in the process. Of course, other situations are completely out of our control, a common example being a logical disk failure or power cut. In the end, there are lots of reasons for data getting lost, but that does not mean it cannot be recovered. In fact, in most cases, it is possible to recover everything that was deleted, but you need to act quickly. When you perform a typical file operation that involves deleting data, nothing will change at first, save for the information about the file in the master file table. The MFT is like a huge database, which stores information about all the files on your hard drive, but it doesn't include the contents of the files themselves. When you delete a file, the MFT simply deletes the entry, thus marking the disk space that was previously occupied by the file as available. The same applies when you format a drive or partition, in which case the entire MFT is deleted and the drive appears empty. Except, the drive isn't empty. All the original data is still there, hidden. Even if the drive hasn't been formatted and assigned a file system, the data is still there. But, because it doesn't have the original file system, the files will be inaccessible to your operating systems and other programs. The original data will stay there, intact, until something else overwrites it. And that's why you need to act quickly to exploit that opportunity, or the data could finally be gone for good. Active@ UNFORMAT is designed to help you do that, without requiring any special data recovery knowledge. It gives you the best chances possible to get back the files you've lost and recover entire drives which have been accidentally formatted. The new version also adds recovery support for Apple's ApFS file system. Version 10, launched on April 22, 2020, provides support for many new file signatures. This makes it easy to find files of certain types, since their original metadata will be lost. New file signatures supported include AQ, ODT, ODG, ODP, OPDS, ODF, ODB, DOCX, XLSX, and PPTX. Other improvements include better recovery on devices with the Microsoft ReFS file system and many minor bug fixes and refinements to the recovery kernel. The software also ships with the latest versions of Active@ Boot Disk Creator and the Boot Disk utilities. Get started at https://www.unformat.com/index.html ."

However, we often assume that these subjects are one. Most cyber security professionals also seem to make the same mistake. An ethical hacker, also known as a white-hat hacker, is a security professional who knows how to find and exploit vulnerabilities in systems. Indeed, it sounds just like a malicious or black hat hacker, but an ethical hacker legally uses their skills. Their job is to find vulnerabilities and fix them before the ‘bad’ guys start exploiting them. Meanwhile, the aim of a penetration tester is to find vulnerabilities, malicious content, and risks in an application. It is an official procedure that makes helpful attempts to strengthen and defending the IT infrastructure. It can be understood as a part of an ethical hacking process that focuses explicitly only on penetrating the information system. A penetration test helps to determine the preparedness against potential threats. Furthermore, it shows the strengths and weaknesses of any IT infrastructure at a certain point in time. What is the OWASP Training? The emerging impact on information security around the world has most certainly inflicted chaos. First started in 2001, the open Web Application Security Project(OWASP) training helps organizations and IT experts better manage these impacts on application security. With the rapid advancement in technology, organizations leap forward every day to use critical applications. It’s more dangerous for the experts to understand the current risk landscape and tackle emerging security threats. Necessity is the mother of invention. That’s precisely why the scope of OWASP training will only get bigger and better. After the completion of this course, you can pursue a career path in information security as a Penetration Tester. It is deemed as one of the three most in-demand jobs in the cyber security job market. ICT frame is providing the OWASP Certification training course in Nepal.

3,When to choose red teaming over penetration testing: A guide to a robust cybersecurity program,computers-technology," In the cybersecurity arena, red teaming and penetration testing have quite a reputation when it comes to ensuring business security. Given my field of work, I’ve come across plenty of clients who believe these are the same thing, when, in reality, red teaming is far more sophisticated than penetration testing. If you’ve been thinking long and hard about your business’ security defences (as you should be!), you may have thought about whether you need to have your systems evaluated with these types of assessments. To enjoy protections that work for your business, it’s important that you understand the capabilities, potential, and benefits of both red teaming and penetration testing. While certain companies may need to leverage both these assessments, others may need to rely on one or the other. With this post, I hope to make this decision more straightforward for your business. Understanding the distinction between red teaming and pen testing While many consider red team assessments similar to penetration tests, the former is both more and less sophisticated. I say this because while it may detect fewer vulnerabilities compared to penetration tests, it looks at something more important: How your organization detects and responds to cybersecurity threats and issues. Here, testers will try and access sensitive information and will actively seek to avoid detection. Their focus is restricted to exploiting specific vulnerabilities that will help them achieve what they’ve set out to do, which is completely exploiting your systems. Penetration testing, on the other hand, seeks to detect as many vulnerabilities and configuration issues as possible. Moreover, these teams go on to exploit these vulnerabilities as a way of determining the level of risk within your organization. Red team assessments are also generally more extensive compared to pen tests and take longer to complete. The average duration of a red team assessment is around a month whereas penetration tests last around 1-2 weeks. When should you choose red teaming over a penetration test? Given the more advanced nature of a red team assessment, these are usually best left for organizations that already have robust security structures and systems in place. For the most part, red team assessments are sought out by companies that have already conducted penetration tests and have detected and fixed patches and vulnerabilities. When it comes to choosing between these security assessments, the better test for your organization will entirely depend on how advanced your security setup and strategies are. If you’ve only set up rudimentary defences and don’t have any idea about your level of risk, penetration testing will be more useful for you. Once you’ve identified all vulnerabilities and have taken steps to remediate them - usually through different types of penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and other types of security assessments - red teaming is much more useful at this stage. This is because it will help you understand just how prepared your teams are to deal with a full-scale cyberattack, where the mission is to gain access to your systems and control your data. As an organization, if you’re up-to-date in terms of vulnerability detection, a red team assessment will really be like the icing on the cake for you. If you’re not at this stage yet, it probably means you haven’t baked your cake yet - is there really any point in adding the icing just yet? Speak to professional security teams for your cybersecurity testing needs Beyond just knowing what your testing needs are, it’s vital that you have the support of a security team that has plenty of experience running these types of assessments. Both penetration tests and red teaming require a fair bit of time and may disrupt your day-to-day operations. This means that when done once, they need to be done properly and help you understand the issues you may be facing; otherwise, your investment will go to waste. I’ve found that when experienced teams are brought onboard for these activities, they not only do the testing but sit down with you to ensure that you understand exactly what’s going on and are fully aware of the implications of your results. This is the hallmark of a good penetration testing team or a red team expert."
4,Securely erase your data with Active@ ZDelete,computers-technology," Did you know that the normal way of deleting data doesn't actually remove the files? This might sound strange, given how you usually receive such a warning before you empty the recycle bin or format a drive. But everything you delete can be recovered using specialized software. It's very important that you know this if you're planning to sell or donate your old computer or any other digital storage device. In such cases, data which you thought you deleted can easily end up in the wrong hands. Often, when you delete something, you're sure you will never need it again. That's fine, but if the files contain any sensitive information, the last thing you want is for someone else to get their hands on it. Active@ ZDelete helps you overcome this problem freely and easily. Firstly, however, it's important to understand how modern digital storage devices work. When you delete files and folders in the normal way, such as emptying the recycle bin or formatting a drive or volume, nothing is really deleted. Instead, the disk sectors which were previously occupied by the file are made available to the operating system. The files appear to be gone, but they're really still there on the disk until something else overwrites it. This can happen at any time but, until it does, the data can be recovered. The only thing that changes during the normal deletion process it an entry in the master file table. The only way to properly delete data so that it may never be recovered is to ensure it gets overwritten by something else. Sometimes, this can take many months or even years. It mostly depends on how often you use the drive and how frequently you write new data to it. You can't rely on general use to overwrite the files. Active@ ZDelete overcomes this limitation by giving you a simple alternative to the recycle bin. Enter the ZDelete Bin, which provides a comfortable and familiar experience much like the normal recycle bin. Only, when you drag and drop a file or folder into it, that data is gone for good. It's overwritten with zeros according to the internationally recognized US Department of Defense 5220.22-M standard. When you use Active@ ZDelete by dragging and dropping a file, a dialog box will appear providing further options. You can choose from various erasure and wiping methods, including one or multiple passes of zeros. For example, one pass zeros overwrites the deleted data with zeros. Even then, in extreme cases, the data might still be recoverable, especially if you're using a magnetic storage device like a conventional hard disk. Fortunately, you can also choose even more secure wiping methods, including multiple passes of zeros. Using the ZDelete alternative to the recycle bin, you can simply delete files the normal way too. However, when you empty the bin, it will ask you if and how you want to overwrite the data. Active@ ZDelete is now fully freeware, and you no longer need to register to use any of the erasure methods. The disk wipe procedures have also been improved for certain file systems, alongside various minor improvements and bug fixes. Download today at https://www.zdelete.com/index.html ."
5,How to recover deleted files and formatted partitions,computers-technology," Almost every computer user has experienced data loss. After all, there are many ways it can happen, most of which are accidental. It's easy to format the wrong drive or partition accidentally or empty the recycle bin only to realize too late that it contained important files. In other situations, data can get deleted by problems beyond your control, such as a malicious software attack. While it's always better to take a proactive approach and keep your data safely backed up on removeable media and online, there may sometimes be occasions where that's not enough. Fortunately, and contrary to common belief, it is possible to recover deleted files and partitions in most cases, particularly if you act quickly. Data recovery software like Active@ File Recovery gives you that last line of defense you need in such cases. How does file recovery work? Regardless of the operating system or file system your computer is running, the entire directory and file structure of a writable storage device works in much the same way. All information about the files, folders, partitions, and volumes on a drive is stored in a master file table. When something is deleted, or a drive or partition is formatted, the only thing that changes is the information in the master file table. The contents of the deleted file or partition remains on the drive, for a time at least. However, the space which was previously occupied by the data is marked as available to the operating system. This means any other file operation can overwrite the original data until the point it becomes irretrievable. This can happen at any time. While it is often possible to recover files, which were deleted weeks or even months ago, your chances are much higher if you act fast. Active@ File Recovery is designed to exploit this opportunity by performing a deep scan of the device to look for recoverable information. Operating systems don't provide this functionality by default, hence the need for third party software to do the job. Also, the original file metadata, such as the filename and location, will be lost. That's why Active@ File Recovery makes it easier to find files of certain types using predefined signatures. These include documents, media files, and many other file types. The latest edition, version 20, launched on April 22, 2020, adds new predefined file signatures for AQ, ODT, OGG, ODP, ODPS, ODF, ODB, DOCX, XLSX and PPTX files so you can search for them quickly and easily. This greatly increases your chance of finding and recovering the files. Active@ File Recovery 20 also ships with many other welcome improvements, such as added support for Apple's new ApFS file system and better support for Microsoft ReFS. Other improvements include new recovery kernel features and minor bug fixes. The Ultimate package now includes the latest Active@ Boot Disk and Active@ LiveCD. These tools help you recover data from primary system hard drives by giving you access to the storage media from a self-contained operating environment. This is important, since making any modifications to the drive you're trying to recover data from increases the risk of the data becoming unrecoverable.

Most seem to languish with the same projects year after year without making much progress while a handful of the best are growing, evolving and actively creating and solving some of today’s most challenging issues confronting Africa’s wildlife and environment today. Our team has identified the following organizations as the latest game changers who are forging significant strides in Wildlife Conservation with ingenious and innovative ideas. These nonprofits are using hi-tech, progressive and even old-school remedies to improve our planet in remarkable ways so that donors know they’re getting the absolute most bang (impact) for their buck. Fully embracing Silicon Valley’s ethos, InnovaConservation is one of the most promising and exciting organizations we’ve seen in the space in decades. This bold nonprofit concentrates solely on the highest impact innovative ideas and technology to change the world. The brainchild of Chris Minihane, a United Nations contractor and photographer for National Geographic, along with her Co-Founder Mark Sierra, a seasoned startup CFO in Silicon Valley, InnovaConservation focuses on creating and supporting disruptive, offbeat technology and extremely innovative and cost-effective solutions to address and solve some of the most severe threats to wildlife and the environment in Africa. Some highlights include Sunflower Fences and beehives to repel elephants from raiding crops and a simple light system to keep lions and collateral species from mass deaths due to poisonings. “Supporting new ideas and technology as well as funding brilliant and progressive people directly in the field who are already contributing in such significant, innovative ways is one of our biggest priorities,” stated Minihane. One of InnovaConservation’s hottest projects is going hi-tech with autonomous Spot Robots and deploying them throughout reserves and wildlife parks in Africa to bridge the gaps where rangers and dogs cannot easily traverse. The Spot robot shakes and wakes to any human face image using Trail Guard with thermal night vision technology and facial recognition. The robot is weather proof, cannot be knocked down, can traverse difficult terrain and weather and is being modified to employ pepper spray to quickly halt any killings in the event the rangers and anti poaching dogs cannot arrive in time. There’s even a rumor that InnovaConservaton is partnering up with Goolge since the giant recently bought Boston Dynamics, the company who developed the Spot Robot.  InnovaConservation states that this will be the “new generation of anti-poaching for decades to come.” InnovaConservation’s website highlights all of their programs, detailing the most unique, outside-the-box solutions that are out there today which are already making huge and significant changes to Africa’s wildlife and environmental crises. We can only say, “Wow! It’s about time!” www.innovaconservation.org Created by founders Charles Knowles, John Lukas and Akiko Yamazaki, Wildlabs is the first global, open online community dedicated to technical ideas in the field of wildlife conservation. This site provides conservationists to share ideas and connect to other experts in the field. Wildlabs also provides forums that allow members to share ideas and collaborate to find technology-enabled solutions to some of the biggest conservation challenges facing our planet. There are workshops and explainer videos that offer instructions to start building technological innovations and how to apply those inventions to conservation ideas or projects. The greatest aspect of this organization is their open data fields and collaboration forum's which allow conservationists to seek assistance or advice on upcoming technology and how to apply them to the environment and wildlife. They have built an engaging community which, thus far, has tested, advised and collaborated on several projects. This is a great concept and we hope to see Wildlabs grow and connect even more organizations and people to create technological solutions to conservation in the coming years! www.wildlabs.net. Created a few years ago by Alex Dehgan this organization’s mission is to support research and development into technology to aid conservation. Dehgan says, “Unless we fundamentally change the model, the tools and the people working on conserving biodiversity, the prognosis is not good.” One of the nonprofit’s key tactics is setting up prizes to lure in fresh talent and ideas. So far, it has launched six competitions for tools to, among other things, limit the spread of infectious diseases, the trade in products made from endangered species and the decline of coral reefs. The first commercial product to be spun out of the start-up — a portable DNA scanner — is slated for release by the end of the year. Dehgan hopes that the organization’s prizes and other initiatives will bring innovative solutions to conservation’s deepest problems. Hundreds of people have already been lured in through challenges and engineering programs such as Make for the Planet — a multi-day, in-person event — and an online tech collaboration platform called Digital Makerspace, which matches conservationists with technical talent. One innovation that has come out of Conservation X Labs is ChimpFace, facial-recognition software designed to combat chimpanzee trafficking that happens through sales over the Internet. A conservationist came up with the idea, Dehgan explains, but she didn’t have the technical expertise needed to achieve her vision. Digital Makerspace helped her to form a team to develop the technology, which uses algorithms that have been trained on thousands of photos provided by the Jane Goodall Institute. ChimpFace can determine whether a chimp for sale has been taken illegally from the wild, because those animals have been cataloged. Dehgan says that fresh approaches are needed because the field has been slow to change and is struggling to find solutions to huge issues. One problem is that the field is “filled with conservationists”, he says. Dehgan asserts that too much human behaviour and innovation are left out of conservation. As it seeks to refashion the field, Conservation X Labs is facing some challenges. Foundations find it difficult to support the group’s atypical mission as a non-profit conservation–tech effort, Dehgan says. The company must compete with large tech firms to hire engineers to build devices. And collaborating with conventional conservation organizations brings problems, too. Often, he says, the missions don’t align: many are focused on creating preserves instead of on specific human factors that might be driving extinction, such as the economics of animal trafficking. Still, Dehgan sees ample opportunity to make progress. “Humans have caused these problems,” he says. “And we have the ability to solve them.” www.conservationxlabs.com"

10,Everything You Need to Start an SEO Business,computers-technology," Starting a business is not everyone's cup of tea. While no doubt, being one's own boss has some obvious benefits, there are some invisible and paralyzing obstacles. Yet the lure of freedom and control that comes with one's business has prompted many to shed the 'employee' tag and put on the 'owners' cap. Why Should You Think Twice? ""Think twice before making any decision, because between' Good' and 'Bad,' there is 'OK.'"" There are lots of things to consider and look out for before starting a business. Even the most successful entrepreneurs and business owners evaluate all their options before starting a business. A business may look simple and straightforward to the eye, yet there are bound to be a string of challenges. Success is never a walk in the park and requires a great deal of focus and hard work. Here are a few things that you must consider before making the big leap: Can you invest your 100% effort and time in the venture? Will you be well-off without your monthly paycheck? Are you well-versed with the specific industry? Do you think you have the right skills, insights, and awareness to start a business? Do you have a working knowledge of the critical aspects of the product or service? If the answer to all the above questions is yes, then you are ready to start your own business. But remember, this is just the first step, and the journey ahead is exciting yet extremely stretching. You should be prepared to adapt, evolve, and survive if you have to build a successful business from ground zero. Starting an SEO Business Every business has a unique set of challenges and opportunities. In the SEO industry, the business landscape is continuously evolving. What works today may not work six months down the line. Hence, as an agency, you need to keep learning and keep reinventing the wheel. To make the journey less taxing for you, we have created a complete guide to help you in your quest to be a successful SEO agency. The information you will find in this guide will offer a clear picture of the SEO industry, the working methodology, the marketing, and the best practices that you must incorporate to create a successful digital agency. Let's start then! How does the SEO Industry work? If there is one word that answers this question entirely, it would be 'Visibility.' 'Visibility' is at the nucleus of the SEO industry. As an SEO agency, you would be responsible for making your client websites visible to the search engine. If your SEO methodology returns significant value to your client's business and target customers, there is nothing that can stop your SEO agency. #Step1: Work on Your SEO Methodology An excellent SEO methodology helps you create a strong foundation for the agency. With a robust method in place, it would be much easier to deliver on client expectations and grow your agency at a rapid pace. So what are the necessary elements for creating a reliable SEO methodology? The objectives of any SEO strategy are more or less the same. On-page optimization, content marketing, lead generation, online reputation management, are common goals that every SEO strategy has to achieve. However, the execution part varies considerably from one client to another. A reliable SEO methodology serves exceedingly well in this regard. When creating an SEO methodology for your agency, make sure to incorporate the following key elements: Hire an experienced and expert team of SEO professionals, developers, designers, and analysts. Identify the industry domains you want to serve and hire digital strategists who have ample experience in that niche. Create a robust project management team to handle client expectations and fulfillment efficiently If your outsourcing client SEO requirement, consider joining hands with a white label SEO solution provider (You will enjoy complete ownership for the work without compromising on your brand name) Last but not least, create an environment that promotes continuous learning. Search engine algorithms are updated frequently. Continuous learning allows the agency to learn, adapt, and update strategies consistently. #Step2: Integrate Project Management Tools For a digital agency to deliver on client expectations, every team must work as a single unit towards a common goal. As such, collaboration and communication must remain uncompromised. Project management tools help keep agency teams on the same page while ensuring seamless team collaborations and communication. Some popular project management tools for digital agencies include: Slack Basecamp Zoho Teamwork #Step3: Always Sign a Contract Once your agency has made a client, it's essential to have a written agreement that clearly states the client's expectations, the length of the contract, the SEO services offered, and other minute details. It will help prevent any misunderstandings and conflicts in the future. The contract can also include payment terms, costs charged against each service, the time of invoice generation, invoice due date, and payment methods. #Step4: Marketing Your Own Agency Your agency may have the best SEO professional, topline digital strategists, exceptional project managers, premium customer support, but you won't succeed by waiting for clients to knock on your door. Instead, you will have to do the same thing that you will do for your clients' Market your SEO services.' Create a website and optimize so that your potential clients can find you online Ask your current clients to share their feedback and review Reach out and engage with a potential client on social media Share case studies, portfolio, and quality content to create a strong social media footprint Make most of the business listings websites and paid ad campaigns to promote your services Continuously prepare and refine your email distribution list for business use #5. Focus on Process Creation and Business Continuity It's the well-defined processes and workflows that transform a good company into a great company. Initially, when the client list is limited, as an agency owner, you may overlook the need for putting into place a well-defined process and workflows. But this is not an ideal strategy for the long term. Remember, as your clientele grows, so does your workloads and client responsibilities. Productivity will take a significant hit without well-defined processes and workflows. Over time, this will negatively impact delivery timelines, client fulfillment, retention rates, and much more. In the worst of cases, lack of proper process and workflows may lead to bad word of mouth for your brand, both online and offline, which more often than not spreads like wildfire. Hence, it is a must that you pay considerable attention to building robust processes and seamless workflows. Here are a few tips that you can follow: Identify repetitive tasks Identify who is accountable for each step and assign roles and responsibilities Prepare a document with workflow diagram and share it with all teams Test for the efficiency of the workflow Gather feedback for teams Make changes where necessary and keep improving in short intervals In-House Vs. Outsourcing? Running an in-house SEO team is not easy. There are so many variables to look after. Agency owners are left with little time to focus on other business needs like marketing, sales, and scaling. Again, as the agency grows, there is this constant need to increase team strength. Not every agency owner, especially those who are new, have the capital and flexibility to scale on demand. Outsourcing is a welcome solution to this recurring challenge. Notably, white label SEO partners like DashClicks take the weight completely off your shoulders. They have a fully automated white-label platform that offers a complete end-to-end SEO solution from client onboarding to fulfillments. All you have to do is focus on business growth and scaling. And DashClicks helps you on this front as well. There is a dedicated education hub where you can get all the information to grow your agency and make consistent revenue."
11,Types of Cables and Wires Found in Modern Technology,computers-technology," Every year technology is propelled forward which helps create smaller and thinner gadgets. Phones, televisions, and computers, are all much more complex than their historical counterparts, all while being more compact. On top of smaller chips sizes, creating smaller tech required smaller wires and cables as well. In fact, some cables today are as thin as paper which are utilized to great effect in small devices like mobile phones, computer monitors, and super thin television screens which need to fit several systems in an extremely small or thin exterior. Here is a breakdown of some of the wire and cables types that are found in most modern day technological devices. Flat Flexible Cables (FFC) Flat flexible cables are extremely thin, flat cables found in high-density electronics. Devices such as modern televisions, smartphones, and tablets all utilize FFCs in order to stay thin and compact, as well as keep them lightweight. They are highly flexible, easy to fold, and provide a strong and reliable connection between device components. Custom FFC cable is an increasingly popular and necessary type of cable in a world where technology is getting smaller and more compact. Flexible Printed Circuit (FPC) Flexible printed circuits are similar to flat flexible cables in that they are extremely thin and are found in devices that require tightly assembled electronic packages, such as cameras. The greatest advantage of flexible printed circuits is that they allow the replacement of rigid boards or connectors that take up way more space and cannot be used in foldable technology, such as foldable cell phones. Another benefit of the thin design is being able to stack multiple FPCs on top of each other. Mirco-Coaxial Cables Cables with a multi-layered structure with a center conductor covered with an insulator layer along with an outer conductor and jacket are called coaxial cables. The coaxial cable outer conductor plays the role of electromagnetic shield so the electrical signal transmitted through the center conductor is less susceptible to electromagnetic waves (electromagnetic noise) from the outside. Micro-coaxial cable is widely used for signal transmission between module boards inside devices such as PCs, tablets and smartphones, as well as precision instruments used for medical, industrial, automotive, aviation, etc. LVDS Cables Low-Voltage Differential Signaling (LVDS) is a technology addressing the needs of today’s high performance data transmission applications. LVDS uses high-speed analog circuit techniques to provide multi gigabit data transfers on copper interconnects and is a generic interface standard for high-speed data transmission. Any device that is used for communication, including phones and computers, will likely use LVDS cables in their design. DF9 Cables A DF9 cable is soldered and molded to laminated flat flexible cable and is typically used for board-to-flat panel display connections. DF9 cables are narrow, save space, and create a low profile with devices. They provide a reliable connection and are easy to fold and highly flexible. DF9 cables are frequently found in video displays, monitors, and HD television displays. The Future of Cables Technology will continue to become more powerful as it gets smaller. The future of cables and wires will go hand in hand with other advancements in technology. For the moment, these cables and wires are the top of the line designs you will find in most technology currently available to consumers."
12,Why Backlink Checker Tool is Very Important for Digital Marketer?,computers-technology," The backlink checker tool is an efficient SEO tool that lets you check backlinks easily and quickly.

That is why every web site owner must analyze their backlinks to keep it running and forward. And what better tool can assist you to do that than the free online backlink checker tool?"
13,What is a session in Google Analytics?,computers-technology," What is a session in Google Analytics? It is the timeframe the user is active on a particular website interacting (“known as hits”) with the webpage. Example: whatever the user does on a website like browsing, reading, exploring, purchase, downloads…etc. be it anything that the user does is defined as a session time frame that the user is active before they leave the page or website. Multiple sessions could be opened by a single user, all these could be continuous or at a random time interval of a week or a month or it could be on a same day. There are 2 different ways through with the session will end, they are : Time out: After 30 minutes or at Midnight Change of campaign: if the campaign changes & the user arrives through a new campaign The above sessions would be explained bellow with examples to understand in detail : Sometimes the user would just not do anything, a user might just open the landing page of the website & could continue browsing on some other tab. So Google by default set that time to 30 minutes. In short it’s a way to find out the number of visits and activity, active users on the website. Active users will help the website to measure the website interactions with the user. Wherein the passive users won’t distort the data on the website. Is an user continues to be on the webpage for more than 30 minutes he will still be counted as a same user but with an additional session count. If a user continues to visit the webpage again on the same browser or the same device the user will be marked as a repeat user & similarly the user would increase the session counts. If a user logs on to your website at around near midnight 11 : 59 and logs out around 12 : 01 that will be counted as a unique user / repeat user with two session. You can rest the session timing based on the service you are offering. Example if you are offering a banking service the session timing will be much short compared to the webpage offering a long read journals. Benefits of tracking sessions on Google analytics It will help us know if the campaign is working or not. It would help us understand the bounce rate without any activity during a session It will help us know if the session counts no of unique visits or repeat visits Similarly many more . . . Thus session in Google analytics help us monitor & track various behaviour of a user in this digital marketing era of understanding & providing a better experience to the users."

15,The History of Link Building,computers-technology," There are never ending algorithm updates, company tweets and excessively in-depth analysis of every word spoken by Google employees. All of this confuses the search engine industry. This lack of clear rules of the game, leads to market confusion. This market confusion leads to a lot of questionable ‘sales tactics’ being pushed on small businesses who simply want to be found online. 15 years ago, senior Google managers would attend, and often do the Keynote speeches at the major search industry conferences. They told us attendees all the secrets. They answered questions and offered honest advice. The registration fee of $1,200- seemed like a good value for a small agency like ours.  Their corporate philosophy, algorithms and general philosophy were simple. They wanted to be the best search engine. That meant giving relevant results for queries and getting rid of the spam.  That would set them apart from everyone else. And it did. The way they would decide on ‘relevance’ would be based on quality content, a high traffic keyword focus and back links. This philosophy hasn’t changed, but their definitions of these has. Most importantly, backlinks now have many, many rules and restrictions. In the early days, Google said “Build Links”. The industry responded. Link directories boomed. Costs ranged from free on the low quality directories to $25- for more prominent sites. Even Yahoo was selling links to their directory for $200-. We ran a directory submissions site and  charged clients $750- to get them ‘a bunch of back links’. It worked well and their rankings improved. Then, several years later, Google decided that not all links are created equal. They rated link quality and even went so far as to penalize sites with spammy back links. We never heard that links could be spammy. They enacted an ex-post-facto law; what was allowed before was not allowed now. What we sold to our clients to improve their rankings was now potentially doing harm. How embarrassing. Based on the new rules from Google, a new service was developed; Disavowing Links. Also a profitable niche for the search industry because it could be sold as an urgent service. You MUST do this. Google says so. We are a boutique SEO agency in Delray Beach that deals with local businesses. I just want to be professional, follow industry best practices, and help everyone make some money, not look clueless because the rules keep changing. Google, and the other major search engines, have still insisted all along that links are the primary ranking factor in their algorithms. So, we need to build links.  One way that people gain authority on the internet is by posting comments and advice on tech blog sites. If you had a problem, and searched for help, one of these authoritative bloggers probably had a good answer. The way they got their authority: a backlink on their signature for every post they wrote. Well, guess what. The SEO industry jumped on that, abused it, and blog posting links suddenly became toxic. Contributors that built their reputation on offering help and advice  were now getting penalized for something that was encouraged in prior years. Now, there are huge agencies that sell Article Submissions. For $200- to $500- per article, you can get a contextual back link included. So, for now, that’s a proper way to get backlinks. Next week, I’ll be selling a service to remove all the back links that were compliant today. Check or credit cards accepted."
16,Ten Words That Meant Different In a Pre-Internet World than Now,computers-technology," The 20th century was an era of inventions! This glorious period blessed humans with some life-changing inventions including the Internet. We have noticed a significant change not only in our lives but also on the culture and linguistics.

20,5G to the rescue! - who is going to benefit from it the most?,computers-technology," With the creation of the Internet, the whole world was turned upside down. It became possible to contact one person to one side of the world from the other side of the world. We can find everything, play online and work conveniently. But the speed of the Internet was not always so fast as it is today. And even right now, the innovative 5G proves that there are no boundaries. In this article, we will talk about the main beneficiaries of the 5G Internet. Why improve speed? Why increase the data transfer rate? Are modern speed indicators not enough? It all depends on the task that needs to be addressed. For the average user, the increase in speed is, for example, the ability to download a movie in Full HD resolution in just a few seconds or play in virtual reality without interference. The 5G standard is necessary for the large-scale functioning of the Internet of Things. Thanks to this technology, tens of millions of devices can be connected to the Internet - from unmanned vehicles to smart electric kettles. The fifth-generation provides opportunities for the introduction of new technologies in various sectors of the economy. It is about increasing the productivity of robots in enterprises and remote control of agricultural machinery. Telemedicine with 5G will allow you to perform remote operations in real-time. Main beneficiaries of the 5G Gamers Gamers will certainly benefit from the 5G Internet, especially customers of real live casino games and all all sorts of other online games. When customers play casino games online, high speed and low latency is the foremost priority. Gamblers are not fond of the fact that a particular game is lagging and the gaming process is complicated. Cloud gaming has changed the traditional way of gaming. While earlier it was necessary to have a high-end computer to launch modern games now with the help of Google Stadia or Geforce Now people can actually stream games. However, the speed of the Internet is necessary, and the 5G will help games enjoy gaming to the fullest. As for the online games, like League of Legends, Dota, CS: GO the speed is necessary as well. Thousands of gamers lose games just because their Internet is lagging and causing lots of problems. Healthcare industry One of the primary beneficiaries of the 5G will be the healthcare industry. With the help of the newer generation of the Internet, workers will be able to detect illnesses and symptoms accurately and faster. It will help provide the likelihood of getting various diseases. Sound amazing, right? And what’s more, data about a person’s origins, parents, etc. will be evaluated more precisely. Financial industry Information delay in finances is harmful to people. With low latency and the 5G, it will no longer impact the price of goods and assets, thus making it more comfortable for financial experts to provide analytics accurately. Education Covid-19 forced people to work and study from home. Zoom has seen a surge in the recent period as a tool to conduct video lessons. But it has been characterized by bugs and complications at some point. The 5G network will solve these problems immediately. The educational process will become swift and convenient, and students will not have to worry about latency and the low speed of the Internet. Conclusion There are more fields we can add to this list which can hugely benefit from the incorporation of the 5G Internet. The speed and the convenience which the new-generation Internet offers us is valueless. It has a massive potential to help people make the most of their technologies and improve our lives significantly. And of course, considering all of the conspiracy theories associated with the 5G satellites we can be sure that nothing like this will happen."

1,What is a Creative Content Studio,computers-technology," A look into why every brand needs one. Look anywhere and creative content is all around you. It comes in the form of a brand film, physical installation, social media post, ad, etc… You get the picture. Back in the day, everything was so segmented. Print media was for the print people, Video was for the video people. Motion graphics didn’t exist. Fast forward to today. Consumers expect every brand to entertain, and all of the traditional mediums have merged to become a sort of kissing cousins. The burden of creating falls on in-house creatives, multiple studios and occasionally project-based freelancers, but often results in missing the mark due to unclear vision. Creative Content Studios play a strong role in unifying all of these issues, into one problem to solve. Vision. How everything stews together in the giant pot of Brand Identity. These days, brands have options. There is no shortage of creative talent to hire for a project across many companies. Finding the talented folks to create digital media is not the issue that brands run into. Rather, the issue lies in ensuring that the final product is cohesive with brand direction when it is finished. Anyone can have vision, but, too often, what happens is that when multiple people are involved in a project, they develop their own sort of tunnel vision to keep them on target to create the work necessary to making the project a success, which may not necessarily translate into the cohesive message/vision that the brand is aiming for. It’s not their fault; They were hired to do a job, and that job was to make a specific thing. Brands simply do not have the time or the manpower to manage all the different moving parts, while trying to ensure that the message is conveyed. Content Agencies solve this problem through a multidisciplinary approach. Being well-versed in all aspects of media creation, the studios manage the process of content creation across all media, but with a focus on preserving brand identity on all completed assets. Typically, they have good working relationships with other Digital Agencies, to make sure that the brand moves forward in a clear direction. Content Studios serve as a Brand’s guide to create content that is engaging, but also resonates with the audience watching it. Because of technological advances, smaller studios now have the ability to produce the same level of great work as larger agencies or studios, and can pivot much faster on creative, business, and budgetary needs. Growing brands need a clear direction as to who they are and where they plan to grow. The supporting visuals need to reflect that on a grand scale, and there cannot be any competing elements. How can content studios help Here’s where we come in. We don’t replace marketing and creative departments; we complement them. There are some things best left in-house, but with the content studio helping to guide the visuals. In a utopian world, there would be unlimited budgets, and unlimited tasks for us to do, but that simply isn’t real life. We work with brands to determine where time and energy should be spent on their creative, and implement a sustainable process in which brand content is carried out on a consistent basis that supports a larger goal. We don’t want to make media for media’s sake. We want the media that we produce together to win brands fans, extend reach, and drive impressions. A content studio is invested in your success. Sometimes, it is more economical to do smaller things in-house, and then to work on larger projects with outside companies who have a bird’s-eye view on the creative as a whole. Ok, everyone loves a good bullet point. How Creative Content Studios are different than typical production companies More holistic approach to creative. Rather than working on single projects, the studio is brought in earlier in the process, and work directly with brands to develop a clear road map for creative over an extended amount of time. More creative ideas. Because the Studio is involved in multiple aspects of creative (Video, Motion Graphics, Design, Products, Installations), they can see from a broader view what the brand is moving toward. Being Creative Professionals, they know the answers to the questions other creatives will have, thus saving brands the headaches of not knowing what is hindering progress. How Creative Content Studios can help any brand Brands can focus on the “why” they are making something without having to get their hands dirty on the nitty gritty, such as things like: Project management Talent recruitment Production value Budget-depleting errors due to lack of eyes on details Specialization. Creative Content Studios specialize in one thing; creative content. Services such as marketing, and deployment are best done by other agencies that specialize in it. Feel free to reach out if you have any specific questions about how we can help. Omnislash Visual is a creative content studio based in Connecticut, USA that works directly with brands that want to create evocative content and diehard fans."

3,Business mistakes contact centres make during cloud migration,computers-technology," We all know the technical benefits of a cloud-based contact centre, as opposed to a conventional contact centre. However, while there is no denying the benefits of lower operating costs and scalability, these benefits cannot be realised through technology alone. Many contact centres struggle to utilise the full potential of their cloud-based platform, not because they have neglected the technical aspects of agile migration, but because they failed to consider the business side of the operation. As someone who has worked with contact centres for over a decade, it surprises me to see the divorce between the technical and business aspects of cloud migration. The two are far more interconnected than anyone acknowledges and ignoring the connection only hurts ROI on cloud migration. While there is no denying the technical importance of cloud migration, the business side deserves just as much attention, which is what is addressed here. Business mistakes in agile cloud migration Failing to future-proof their technology Cloud platforms make an excellent online investment, but their full potential will not be realised overnight. It can take months or even years to adjust to the day-to-day operations of a cloud platform, by then, the industry would have moved on to something else. The tech world moves at a fast pace, and contact centres need to have their finger on the pulse of the industry to stay ahead of their competitors. However, many contact centres fail to account for the future when planning cloud migration. In other words, they fail to future-proof their vendor of choice. Contact centres should prepare for the future by ensuring that their platform of choice can integrate new features with minimal disruption to customer service. This requires due consideration to both the technical and business side of the contact centre platform. On the technical side, contact centres need to ensure that the cloud’s architecture is set up for easy configuration, and integration with future systems. When it comes to business, contact centres need to ensure that integrating new features and expanding functionality is specifically mentioned in the contract. Failing to engage all stakeholders Deploying to the cloud is not a matter of switching over to a different platform and turning it on. Contact centres need to account for the business needs of all their stakeholders before switching to a different model. Yet, many contact centres fail to communicate with their stakeholders, hurting the migration process. Some of this is due to difficulties of getting departments across the board to agree on a common agenda (put simply, office politics). Other times, it is difficult to account for the business needs of every department in the centre, but more often than not, the main reason is negligence. Contact centres often neglect to account for the different needs of their respective departments. For example, customer care needs a platform that makes router switching fast and efficient, while the business department wants a dashboard to measure SLA dependencies. The lack of unity and synchronisation across different departments hurts the migration process in two ways: Slowing the rate of migration, and not realising its full potential because different departments struggle to leverage its full value. To ensure greater unity between technical and business-oriented departments, contact centres need to ensure all their stakeholders have their requirements met. Failing to consider the pros and cons of the shift One business-related mistake of cloud migration is failing to consider the pros and cons of each technique. Contact centres often fail to consider the true cost of the migration phase against the ROI of the platform because they want to complete the job as quickly as possible. For example, 'Lift and Shift' is a common method that involves moving to the cloud without adjusting the new platform. The advantages of the Lift and Shift method is the cost of migration and ease of setting a baseline performance. It is a lot faster to migrate data and easier to set a baseline to compare performance between the old and new platforms. Unfortunately, the Lift and Shift method denies contact centres the chance to take full advantage of their native features unique to the cloud platform, which could hurt ROI in the long run. Failing to upskill customer agents Most contact centres migrate to a different cloud platform to provide omnichannel customer service to their clients. However, one mistake contact centres make is not upgrading the skills of customer agents. Some agents excel at voice-to-voice communication, able to pick up nuances in tone, while others excel at text-to-text communication. Customer agents need to excel at both to truly provide omnichannel service. While technology is important, customer service skill is just as important for providing maximum ROI on cloud platforms. Preparing for a shift in the cloud migration While there is no denying that cloud migration comes with several benefits, businesses errors hinder the ROI of migration. If contact centres wish to make the most of their cloud platform, they need to pay attention to both the business and technical side of the migration process. By paying attention to both sides, contact centres can ensure the process will be a profitable move in the long and short run. Agile cloud migration is more than just selecting the right cloud vendor, it is also a question of making the right business decisions and setting the right processes."
4,Why Is WordPress Bad?,computers-technology," WordPress is currently the most popular Content Management System in use today. It requires no coding skills or even a basic understanding of HTML.  Anyone can build a website with little knowledge of technical web development or internet marketing. However, some large corporations use WordPress to build beautiful and highly functional sites. They look good and work great, as long as someone is monitoring and updating them on a regular basis. Many successful marketing agencies build, and offer the needed ongoing support, for WordPress sites. They are stylish and work well. The customer sees a beautiful, functional site that brings them traffic and prospects. Well, we do a little internet marketing work for some of our clients and have thus become familiar with some cheaply built websites. At first, we did not understand why some of these sites were being penalized by Google. On several sites we were optimizing the rankings unexpectedly went bad, and a couple sites disappeared from Google altogether. It turned out that the sites had been hacked through some ‘free’ plug-ins that their web guy used. That’s one of the biggest problems we see. A free theme or add-on is often a malware loaded script that is used to spread viruses. Even the major plug-ins can have problems. Yoast is a popular, free SEO plug in. Last year, their automatic ‘update’ created issues and over 110,000 websites were penalized by Google; i.e.; many were removed from the search index. (do a search for Yoast plugin causes Google rankings drop) Here’s how a WordPress project usually goes wrong. First, the business owner does not have any expertise on the marketing project that a modern website is. The thing they do understand is price. So, they get a sales pitch that says WordPress is cheap and they can do all the updates and additional content themselves. Sounds good, especially when compared to an agency wanting to charge a few thousand dollars and then a monthly fee to keep the site and code updated. When these WordPress developers are confronted with the hacking problem the typical response is that the customer is responsible for doing weekly updates to the WP theme and all the plug-ins. From a search engine optimization standpoint, after doing significant work to get high rankings on a website it can all be wiped out by a hack. Google will remove the site from their index. While we can submit a ‘Re-inclusion Request’ to Google, it’s a lot of work and usually, the rankings never recover. The best fix is to start all over with a new domain name and new website. Today, based on Webmaster Guidelines and search industry best practices, most small businesses just need a well-optimized single page website. It’s easier to rank and, most importantly, when someone is searching on a mobile device it’s much easier to get your message and Call to Action in front of them. They don’t have to deal with site navigation. Mobile device users don’t need the extra pages to search through. They need a quick description of the product or service, a call to action, and a clickable phone number at the top of the page. We now recommend building a site created in pure HTML code. It is not hack-able, there are no third party scripts that can hide malware. Companies like DynoWebsites offer these services."

6,Stopping Fax Spam,computers-technology," FAX machines started gaining wide use in the early 1980’s. They were a magical machine. It was going to put an end to the post office. Just crazy cool technology at the time. They were very cool but not much business was really being done with them yet. However, people really wanted to play with them. They started sending joke lists around to everyone with a machine. This was the original electronic spam. Soon enough, businesses started to send unsolicited faxes selling stuff. Then scammers started sending out ‘notices’ for toner and paper. So many companies fell for this is was incredible. Send a bill through a fax machine and they will pay it. After sending payment, and never receiving anything, there was no way to track the origin of the original fax. It was a profitable scam for a couple years until the word, and warnings, got out. The real problem with these original machines was that every fax was automatically printed out. Getting spam actually cost money. The toner and thermal paper were expensive so it was a real issue. The old school managers were not happy with this new techno – expense. Eventually, faxing became more mainstream and the toner and paper costs came way down. However, the spam never slowed down. Today faxes arrive digitally, usually in your e-mail. While spam is still a problem, at least they don’t automatically print out anymore. Faxes are still used by many businesses. It's considered a 'safe' way to transmit documents because they can't deliver malware to your computer. However, there are some downsides to this antique technology. Unlike e-mail, we don't really have a fax spam filter. Since your faxes arrive vial e-mail all from the fax service provider, you can’t block them there or you would block all faxes going to your inbox. There’s a fix, but it’s a bit cumbersome. However, it does stop the fax spam. One of the ways a fax provider fights spam coming into the fax servers is to block all traffic from about 35 countries. (Russia, China, North Korea, etc.) Also, blocking individual numbers that show higher than expected traffic. However, all of that is an inexact science. It’s playing a game of defense for the never ending new attack methods. If your fax number is really all spammed up then the only real fix is to get a new number. Of course, that will be inconvenient, at best. However, here's the best fix: Sign up for a new internet fax service account and choose a new number. For a few months, you would continue to run both fax numbers. During that time, you will start the notification process. Update your website, business cards and other listings. Send updates and notices to your customers and suppliers. Then, once you see that the old number stops getting traffic you can delete that bad fax number. All the spam will stop. If a customer tries to send a fax to the old number, they would get a fax failure notice. They will look up your website or call you to get the new fax number. It’s a bit of work, but your spam will stop and productivity will improve. Now if we could do something about junk snail mail."
7,What Is Data Democratization and Why is it Needed?,computers-technology," “Data democratization will catapult companies to new heights of performance — if done right”- Eric Matisoff, InfoWorld “Every business is inundated with data from every angle. There is pressure to use insights we glean from the data to improve business performance. As a result of this incredible amount of data to process and new tech that helps non-technical people make sense of the data, there is desire and demand for data democratization.” ""Data democratization means that everybody has access to data and there are no gatekeepers that create a bottleneck at the gateway to the data. It requires that we accompany the access with an easy way for people to understand the data so that they can use it to expedite decision-making and uncover opportunities for an organization."" ""The goal is to have anybody use data at any time to make decisions with no barriers to access or understanding.” says Bernard Marr, bestselling author of Big Data in Practice. You can read the original article by Bernard Marr quoted above here. It is an excellent article and Bernard is well respected in the industry so it is well worth your time. So now that we have an understanding of what data democratization is, and what the benefits are for an organisation, let’s take a dive into the factors that contribute to achieving data democratization within an organisation and realizing the associated benefits. Three Main Customer Problems Identified We tried to get to the root cause of why companies fail to get data democratization right, and what works for those companies who do manage to get it right. We looked at how companies are managing their enterprise data analytics functions today and using the architecture pyramid we discussed earlier as a reference point, we uncovered three key elements which need to work together to achieve effective data democratization within an organisation. The Key Elements of Data Democratization Now that we have uncovered the ‘secret sauce’ of effective data democratization, the next challenge is how do we implement it. There are only finite human resources available who have the talent to implement each of the key elements, so in order to deliver a scalable solution which can be replicated across many organisations we will need to rely heavily on automation. Imagine if you were able to build a product with automated data democratization using industry-leading techniques and strategies, and then offered this product as a service for your business. What would this be worth to you? We went out to the market to work out the scale of the problem facing customers today, how they are currently addressing it, and the value they would place on a solution which solves this problem for them. Finding Potential Customers To Interview We set out to validate our understanding of problems facing data analytics customers today.In our previous blog post, we invited our customers and users to share their views on the data analytics problems facing companies today, and their thoughts on what is needed in the next generation of data analytics products to address them. The Response We interviewed a range of customers to uncover some answers, we have collated our data below. How Big Is the Problem Facing Customers? We asked customers to rate on a scale of 1–10, how big the problem is to build, manage, and support each of the three enterprise data analytics tiers for their organisation. What we found is most customers are relying on humans to solve the problem, who are supported by using tools including Excel and main cloud service providers (GCP, Azure, AWS). There is no single tool on the market today which solves this problem completely. Therefore, customers are relying on a combination of people power as well as tools to manage their enterprise data analytics capability. Customers are hiring specialist teams, either in-house or from a consulting agency, to solve these problems for them. A common theme we found was that customers said there was a lack of data analytics maturity and skill within their organisation, and that training and change management were large contributing problems for them. “In the industry I see a lot of problems around change management. Changing infrastructure or platforms is seen as risky. People aren’t taking advantage of the platform and tools to their fullest due to a lack of training and knowledge” – Data Analytics Customer Specialist, Cloud Platform Provider Another common theme we found is that it is not the initial setup of the infrastructure, tools and data insights which is their biggest problem, but rather it is the ongoing maintenance, change management and ensuring consistency throughout their organisation. Existing Tools vs. Cangler We asked customers to rate on a scale of 1–10, how well their existing tools solve their problem and how well Cangler would solve their problem after describing our solution to them. Across all customer problems, Cangler solved the problem better than the tools on the market today, but we believe we can do even better What we found was that across all three customer problems, Cangler was viewed as solving the problem better than their current tools. This difference was particularly noticeable in the data acquisition & integration customer problem where Cangler was viewed as being almost 3 times better than the existing tools used today. We found that the tools on the market today do not adequately solve the problems for customers on their own, so customers are solving this capability gap by hiring third-party data analytics consulting firms to provide the human resources and the expertise to build, operate, and manage their data analytics tools and projects. According to consultancy.uk, $43 billion was spent on data analytics consulting services in 2017 and more than two thirds (67%) of the executives polled said they expect their organisation to increase analytics consulting spending in future. Looking at the consulting cost per company, if we assume that a company will hire 5 data analytics consultants to help them that is a cost of $7500 per day ($1500 / day x 5 consultants). Now if we extrapolate that cost over 261 working days in a year that adds up to a cost of $1,957,500 per year for an organisation in consulting fees alone. Which companies are working on solutions to solve the problem of data democratization? Data democratization is a relatively new field in data analytics. With that said, there are already some companies working on developing solutions to address data democratization in the enterprise such as Databricks, Teradata, Domo, Alteryx, and of course, Cangler. Each company has their own unique approach to solving the problem. Only time will tell which approach companies will approve of and will adopt as their data democratization solution. One thing is for sure, the race to solve this problem is on."

9,Surviving a Work-At-Home Environment During COVID-19 Crisis,computers-technology," Ever since this pandemic started work hasn’t stop but a new modality has taken place, Work-At-Home, for many this has represented a real challenge and the Adult hosting industry is not an exception. During the pandemic, adult hosting companies as many other companies, all around the world have shifted their operations to a working at home environment but for many employees this has become a tough challenge: working from home for the first time, full time. Even if you have done it before, nothing compares to this situation, and suddenly it has become an uncharted territory for many. Host4Porn has a few tips to help you survive this challenge while staying productive. -Get dressed and ready for work. Although is very tempting to stay in pajamas all day while working remotely, this is one of the worst mistakes you can make because it will slow your work process and you will become less productive. You don’t need to dress formally but the simple act of bathing and changing your clothes will wake you up and get things started. Do not underestimate the power of dressing for public specially during this period of quarantine, it will make you feel human, more confident and it will help you draw the line between being at work and being at home. -Assign a specific workspace. One of the biggest challenges of working remotely is keeping your work and home life separated. All career coaches agreed that if you never fully disconnect from work, your work productivity will suffer and your home life can take a hit as well. It is easier to do this physical separation when you head to your work office everyday but since this crisis has force all working environments to be remotely; in order to keep healthy work and home habits try to create a special space in your house to be use as an office so you can complete your work tasks without mixing your home activities. -Define a working schedule. By doing so, you will get your best work done and be most ready to transition back to the office if you stick with your regular hours. It’s normal that you feel yourself tempted to extend your work hours because you aren’t doing anything in the evening due to the current crisis but tell yourself it’s time to put work away, recharge, and start tomorrow with a fresh mind. -Maintain fluent communication. If you are not used to working remotely you will experience many bumps in the road but having a fluent communication with coworkers and specially with your manager will help smooth those bumps. This is a new situation for almost everyone, if you experience a problem don’t hesitate to reach out to the same people you would usually turn to for help, even if you’re not in the same building as them. Don’t limit communication only to text, find other ways to check in with your boss and coworker like phone calls, video chats and even virtual meeting. -Don’t forget to socialize. Cutting off a lot of the casual social interactions you’re used to having throughout the day while working is one of the biggest challenges during quarantine. Socializing will not only help you feel less lonely but also it is meant to break up the monotony of work. People tend to forget they need to be around others because it’s the small talk and random fire alarms that keep your days feeling unique and when you work from home you don’t experience that. Combat this by talking to your coworkers, for example you can make zoom conferences or use telegram… ask about their weekend, keep this up, this little interactions go a long way. All the above doesn’t just apply to the workday and people you work with; you may not be able to meet up with friends for dinner after work, but you can organize a group of people to discuss a book or TV show or just to catch up using other media tools available. Host4Porn encourages you to try to keep your life as normal as possible even throughout the quarantine, for when it is all over, the transition back to your normal lifestyle routine will be easier."

12,Everything You Need to Know About the Best Software Company in Bangladesh,computers-technology," Today, we are standing on a stage where technology is widespread and has a broader spectrum than ever before, and the onward movement of technology is consistently increasing. The software has a lot to do with the multi-tasking technologies that we use every day. But, the development of great software has never been an easy task. Sure, a few little tricks might get you a software, but it wouldn’t be any good unless every step while developing it was done perfectly. Codewareltd is a software company that offers to provide you with software that is developed diligently by a team of experts who have years of experience and proper knowledge in the field. What is Software development? The simple answer we give when we are asked about software development is that coding and programming is software development. But we only wish software development were that easy, the software cannot be properly built with just coding – lots of planning and thinking go behind the software making process. There are different parts of developing software that a software company offers to complete for its client, and if you want up and running software then you must be sure that your software has successfully been through the required steps. The steps of developing software As we have stated above, software development is not just programming – it needs a lot more than that before the development, and after the development. And if all of these requirements aren’t met properly, be prepared for your software to leave you with a mess. Every action needs to be accurately planned, and since the software is prone to errors, it needs more planning and thoughts before the developers put their hands into the actual coding. A good software developer would create a blueprint, the layouts, eliminate the flaws, add the necessities, and plan until he gets the clear cut form of the software. The developers of the software company in Dhaka, Codeware.ltd also focuses a lot of time in this planning session. As difficult as it sounds, the more time you spend with the layout, the better and easier it will be to do the later steps. Now, that the planning is done, the software must be designed so users can access and navigate it easily. Some of us don’t realize how important it is to design the software in a way that makes the users easily navigate through it. Unfortunately, many otherwise good software lose their users due to the difficulty of navigation. A meticulous software company leaves no stone unturned when it comes to software design. Now, the programming and coding part – there are two parts of programming, one is front-end programming, and the other is back-end programming. Front-end coding is about the design and the UX of the software, it is done with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. The back-end defines the behavior and controls data of the software, and Python, Java, C++, etc. are used to do the back-end coding. Before the software is released to the market, a typical software company tests the software for any inconsistency and error and debugs them. The first impression of the software must be as perfect as possible, otherwise, there isn’t much hope to gain popularity once it gets a bad reputation. Launching the software on the perfect platform is a skill itself. So, don’t think launching is any less than the previous procedures. Even after fully launching in the market, the software must be regularly maintained, updated, and debugged to assure its usability. What services you can get from a software company? Software development companies give many different services to their clients, although there are some variations, ultimately the services are the same, more or less. Let’s see what you can get from a web development company – App development and web development Codeware.

Clients come the developers with their ideas and issues, and they are given solutions to those ideas if possible. Business Assistant Businesses face a lot of obstacles, and to overcome these hurdles, they seek software companies that can help them with their issues and give them insights about how to proceed. Sometimes, to improve and update their business status, people come to web design companies to obtain services and solutions. How to recognize a good software company? Indeed, how to tell if a particular web design company is any good? And if it is capable of doing what it claims to do? Look at the requirements of a good software development company below – A good web development company will guide the client through the whole process of the development, so later, the client can run the software without any issue. A good software development company will always give its top priority to the clients’ needs. It will consider the clients’ ideas, wishes, requirements, and proceed based on them.

13,How to create a landing page for more conversion,computers-technology," At times, we tend to under-gauge the significance of the greeting page. It is maybe one of the most significant things that we can make when we are building a site. Compare the point of arrival with the early introduction that you would need to make when you are meeting an outsider. Any new client, incidentally or purposefully going to your point of arrival resembles that more interesting who you need to establish a decent first connection with. With the assumption that all clients would be outsiders, it could get essential to invest a great deal of energy fixing and re-fixing the point of arrival. Luckily, for us, there are some attempted and tried techniques that one can work with, so as to make an excellent beginning stage for the client's excursion. Make a consistent excursion There is one misstep that generally happens during the site-building process and that is making a field structure with such a large number of inquiries directly toward the beginning. No client needs to begin his excursion on your site, by responding to an excessive number of inquiries. Despite the need to make a database, it likewise gets imperative to just request fundamental data, for example, Name, telephone number, and Email, instead of placing in extra fields. It can seem to be urgent and can likewise prompt you losing a lot of clients. Be exact and shrewd with your substance Once more, this is something that we do, while setting up our substance procedure. While we are making content, we tend to include a mess of substance to the point of arrival which can without much of a stretch overpower the guest. Things being what they are, what would it be a good idea for one to do, while setting up this? Your substance ought to be to the point, ought to have a positive purpose behind being there, and should lead the client to a point where you can foresee a change and furthermore a point where the guest can feel a feeling of achievement. On the off chance that there is an excessive amount of substance or it isn't organized in a simple-to-understand way, the potential client is in all likelihood not returning to a similar page twice. Build up your believability Building up your believability in this time of 'counterfeit value's is maybe one of the most significant things to deal with. Put yourself in the shoes of the client, likewise on the grounds that you are a client on another person's foundation, so attempt to see how you might want to feel when you are on somebody's greeting page and plan YOUR point of arrival in like manner. When you are setting off to somebody's site, are characteristics, for example, trust and value critical to you? All the more significantly, has the site been licensed, has it gotten any honors, any honors? Does it have any tributes from its clients? These are for the most part the things that you should consider while arranging out your point of arrival. Enhancement is Vital It is nothing unexpected that the cell phone age is blasting and that an ever-increasing number of individuals are getting to things in a hurry. This is the place enhancing your site for cell phones additionally comes in. This is the place you can make a responsive site, something that doesn't need to be a problem, on the off chance that you make a responsive subject or layout, which can be adjusted without any problem.

15,make money online during lockdown,computers-technology," A Quick Guide on How To Make Money Online THIS HAS PERSONALLY HELP ME TO MAKE UP TO $2500 WITH JUST ABOUT 4 HOURS OF WORK WEEKLY CHECK IT OUT Regardless of what others may think, there is money to be made online. There are numerous business models to work for and work from and your earnings will only be limited by the work you put in. This quick guide will present methods on how to make money online and help you determine which is the best option for you. Let's start. There are thousands of online businesses today that are eager to hire skilled and talented individuals. People that know how to design, write, program, code and teach are often what they look for. A talented and skilled person in these fields can easily find work online. Most of the time businesses offer project-based, part-time, and full-time work. PROS: It is easy to find work and there are hundreds of job opportunities to choose from. You also have the freedom to work whenever and wherever you want as long as you finish the job assigned to you. Your earnings are determined by the quality of time and hard work you put in. Unlike, in most but not all, office jobs that salaries and wages are fixed. CONS: You are working for an online boss. You have to answer to someone. If you're not a fan of working for someone then this might not be for you. Another con is the isolation. You're office boss might be the worst person you had but you could bear it because of your friends. Now eliminate the friends and leave the boss in. Sounds a little sad, right? First and foremost, let's differentiate the two: Authority sites are websites that have proven their expertise in the world wide web. This means that many reputable people on the internet have deemed it to be the ""go-to"" website because of their service or product. Niche sites on the other hand are websites that contain and talk about only one specific niche, one specific topic throughout the blog. Where is Earning Money online fit in all of this? How to make money online creating a website is by monetizing it. a. Monetizing it using Google AdSense Many people have made thousands of dollars with Google AdSense. However, it's really hard to get approved by Google. Your website should need around 16-25 quality articles to get approved. Though getting approved isn't a guarantee of making money. Your site visitors should also click the ads by Google. If ads are utilized and placed well, you can earn a significant amount of money. b. Affiliate Marketing Affiliate Marketing is promoting other people's products and services on your site. You are basically promoting their products and you get a commission if a site visitor buys your product. c. Membership website You create a website that is full of content and quality products that are only exclusive to members. A person may only be able to get the full access to your website is to pay you a membership fee (which you will set). This is a good business model because it is recurring (members pay their fee monthly) and it'll generate income long after you finish the website. PROS: You can create recurring passive income for yourself and you can live a lifestyle you've always wanted. The sky is the limit when talking about the potential earnings in creating Authority sites and Niche sites. It's because the earnings will only be limited to the time, effort, connections, and investments you put in the website(s) you have. The more blood, sweat and tears you put on the websites, the more successful the website will be. Certainly, more success = more money. CONS: A lot of research, promotion, money and time should be invested in creating an Authority site or Niche site. You will also hit a learning curve since you need to learn many things, such as online language jargons, methods and techniques, copyright, online legal matters and many more. ""The people that really make the BIG MONEY are the Creators and the Sellers of the product(s). Everyone in between is working for them."" -Anonymous Nothing beats being the ""source"" of a quality product. It might be an Ebook, Podcast, Magic Toolbox, Furniture, T-Shirt and etc. As long as you are confident that what you are selling is the BEST, then sell the heck out of it online! Create a way for people to find your product -- either create a website or put it on sale on a website. Start off from there and slowly build your business. PROS: When your product takes off, you'll have what every person wants -- Passive Income. You will be accessible online 24/7 and you are open 24/7. The earnings will be determined on how valuable and useful the product is. If you consider it the best product then the money will come. CONS: Promoting the product will be a struggle; especially if you don't have a website or connections online."
16,Tech Sector to Weather Economic Storm,computers-technology," Nobody's denying that the U.S.—and likely the world—is about to feel an economic slowdown. Some expect a recession or full-blown depression and the unemployment rate to exceed 10 percent. But web and software development—and most of the tech sector—have been growing much faster than the average employment sector for many years. So many in the tech fields are wondering, how is the economic downturn going to affect them? The short answer is, they're going to be a whole lot better off than most people, according to many experts. And here are the three main reasons. Reason 1: Websites just became more important For many businesses, the web just became the only way customers can interact with them. So their websites just became a lot more important, and many don't have the talent in-house to make the improvements they need to serve their customers online. Many independent IT and web developers have gotten busier since the shutdown, despite other employees suffering furloughs or layoffs, said Joshua Knapp, co-owner of AnHonestHost, an independent hosting service in Riverside, California. ""I am seeing a spike in activity (from independent IT and web developer clients), especially for developers who have had a working relationship with businesses that may not have had their website at the forefront of their marketing and sales strategy,"" Knapp said. ""Businesses are having to adapt an online-first mentality."" His own clientele count has seen a spike because many companies are looking for a new host to handle the sudden increase in web traffic to their sites. ""In some cases, the hosting provider may suspend the (company's) site because of too much activity, or other problems are now becoming more apparent due to the increased load on the hosting provider’s servers,"" Knapp said. One tech businesses that has taken advantage of this opportunity is Studio54, a London-based web development agency. ""We have happened on a niche to help us sustain our income through this,"" said Scott Krieger, founder and head developer at Studio54. ""We are helping businesses that are not online getting online quickly to help them sell their products and services, such as restaurants that don’t offer delivery before but have now pivoted, since they can’t allow people to eat at their premises anymore."" Reason 2: The field is about to be less crowded A lot of companies are about to go out of business, which will eliminate a lot of competition from the field for those companies that survive. And businesses that are most likely to go belly up are the ones that have been neglecting their online strategies, said David Moise, President of Decide Consulting, a software and IT consulting firm in Houston, Texas. ""We expect web developer and other IT/software roles to rebound quickly,"" Moise said. ""If the COVID crisis has taught us anything, it has taught us that the further along the digital transformation spectrum a company is, the better they are doing and the more likely they will leapfrog competitors."" Reason 3: In bad economies, freelancers and agencies get busy When the economy turns south and companies have to lay off full-time staff who receive retirement and medical benefits, freelancers and outside agencies have to fill the void. That's more business for the outside agency or freelancer. ""I've seen a 25 percent increase in business due to COVID-19. Every retailer and restaurant is scrambling to get products online to maintain some level of cash flow,"" said Brian Robben, CEO of web development agency Robben Media. Robben has advice for any developer hoping to take advantage of the lockdown. ""Send a custom email to every restaurant in your city offering to build them a website with a purchasable gift card feature, carryout system and even merch,"" he said. ""The same goes in reaching out to retailers who don't have an E-commerce store to sell their apparel. The opportunities are endless for web developers when the world is stuck at home and still shopping online."" Though some clients have tightened their budgets for their marketing because of the uncertainty that the lock down presents, but they'll likely be increasing their budgets once things begin to return to normal, said Josh Eaton, president of Reaktiv Studios, a WordPress development agency based in Temecula, California. ""I think that consultants and agencies that are well run will still have plenty of opportunities next year as companies reduce in house staff and have to outsource more web work,"" he said. If you want to get into freelancing, some experts say now is a good time. Here are three tips to build your clientele. Job market facts Web development has been growing at 13 percent and software development has been growing at 21 percent, both much faster than the growth for the average of all U.S. job sectors, which is 6 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The International Labour Organization, a United Nations agency, has forecast that the virus shutdown will wipe out 6.7 percent of working hours globally in the second quarter of 2020 – equivalent to 195 million full-time workers. Four sectors will likely be hit hardest: food services, manufacturing, retail and business and administrative activities. Twenty-three states saw jobless rate increases from a year earlier, 3 states had decreases and 24 states and the District of Columbia had little or no change. The national unemployment rate rose by 0.9 percentage point over the month to 4.4 percent and was 0.6 point higher than in March 2019."

3,How GTA V made its way into sports betting,computers-technology," It’s no secret that the recent pandemic has caused a lot of trouble for the world of sports as well as all other industries, which are directly or indirectly connected to sports. One of the sectors which suffered the most is sports betting - as lots of people don’t no longer have a stable source of income, sports fans all around the world had to temporarily pause their money making hobby in order to cut costs. Couple that with cancellations and postponements of world’s top sporting tournaments and events and you will get what we have now – bookmakers, who were unable to adapt quickly enough or were too conservative to look into new solutions are out of business or quite close to that. Apart from football (soccer is what I am referring to), basketball and perhaps horse racing, tennis is likely the next biggest thing is sports betting, both coverage and revenue-wise – tennis events are quick and lots of them can fit in a single day, each event consists of a significant number of ""bettable"" segments (sets, games and points), this provides a lot of betting opportunity and revenue as a result of that. Lately e-sports has generally taken the lead in sports betting due to lack of everything else, obviously games like CS:GO, LoL, Dota, etc. were always popular among punters, however e-sports disciplines like FIFA, Nascar simulator and NBA haven’t been widely used for betting and now they are on the rise. A logical question from a bookmaker’s product staff member’s perspective would be ""can we find a substitute for tennis?"" and it looks like one has actually been found – it’s GTA V. GTA V has a tennis mini-game which, compared to everything else out there at the moment is the most realistic and down-to-earth option available right now. Especially if you throw VR in the mix, you will get a pretty decent tennis simulator which is perfectly suitable for sports betting and live streaming purposes – and a number of bookmakers worldwide are actually already embracing it, worth to mention that African bookmakers are one of the first to actually consider offering this, likely they will already have something available within the next couple of days, top European bookmakers might tag along by the end of the week. Not sure how all of this is going to pan out and whether GTA V virtual tennis betting will stay with us as a legit e-sports discipline after all of this is over, but it is rather interesting to see how what will the situation be like 6 to 8 months from now."

6,Robotic process automation (RPA),computers-technology," Robotic Process Automation is the technology that allows anyone today to configure computer software, or a ""robot"" to emulate and  integrate the actions of a human interacting within digital systems to execute a business process.  RPA robots utilize the user interface to capture data and manipulate applications just like humans do. They interpret, trigger responses and communicate with other systems in order to perform on a vast variety of repetitive tasks. Only substantially better: an RPA software robot never sleeps and makes zero mistakes. How RPA different from other enterprise automation tools? In contrast to other, traditional IT solutions, RPA allows organizations to automate at a fraction of the cost and time previously encountered. RPA is also non-intrusive in nature and leverages the existing infrastructure without causing disruption to underlying systems, which would be difficult and costly to replace. With RPA, cost efficiency and compliance are no longer an operating cost but a byproduct of the automation. ·         Fast benefit realization ·         Minimal upfront investment ·         No disruption to underlying systems ·         Led by the business, with support from IT ·         Highly scalable, adapts to changing business environment How does RPA work? RPA robots are capable of mimicking many–if not all–human user actions.  They log into applications, move files and folders, copy and paste data, fill in forms, extract structured andsemi-structured data from documents, scrape browsers, and more. What are the business benefits of RPA? Robots are here to stay. The faster you harvest their potential, the faster you create a competitive edge for your business. Robotic Process Automation delivers direct profitability while improving accuracy across organizations and industries. Enabling RPA to handle any processes will not only transform and streamline your organization’s workflow. It will allow for superior scalability and flexibility within the enterprise, doubled by fast, tailored response to specific needs. Software robots are easy to train and they integrate seamlessly into any system. Multiply them, and instantly deploy more as you go. They constantly report on their progress so you can go even bigger and better by using operational and business predictability, while improving strategically. ü  Better accuracy Robotic Process Automation software robots are programmed to follow rules. They never get tired and never make mistakes. They are compliant and consistent. ü  Improved compliance Once instructed, RPA robots execute reliably, reducing risk. Everything they do is monitored. You have the full control to operate in accordance with existing regulations and standards. ü  Fast cost savings RPA can reduce processing costs by up to 80%. In less than 12 months, most enterprises already have a positive return on investment, and potential further accumulative cost reductions can reach 20% in time. ü  Super scalable Across business units and geographies, RPA performs a massive amount of operations in parallel, from desktop to cloud environments. Additional robots can be deployed quickly with minimal costs, according to work flux and seasonality. ü  Increased speed and productivity Employees are the first to appreciate the benefits of RPA as it removes non-value-add activities and relieves them from the rising pressure of work. What are the pitfalls of RPA? RPA isn’t for every enterprise. As with any automation technology, RPA has the potential to eliminate jobs, which presents senior management with challenges managing talent. While enterprises embracing RPA are attempting to transition many workers to new jobs, few research studies estimates that RPA software  will threaten the livelihood of approximately 9-14 percent of the global workforce. Future of RPA Enterprise RPA is the disruptive force in digital transformation. It is the obvious next big step in markets around the globe as it is covering a widening range of enterprise processes and delivering more competitive advantages. Enterprise RPA delivers powerful outcomes at unlimited scale, helping companies become digital businesses faster and gain a valuable advantage on their path to AI."

10,10 Best Data Annotation Companies for Machine Learning,computers-technology," Many machine learning companies struggle with finding solutions for rapidly build datasets to train their algorithms. In this piece, we outline the best outsourced data annotation companies and the services they provide. Data annotation is the process of adding contextual information to raw data to serve as training examples for machine learning models. For more information about what AI training data is, check out our article on the topic. Before deciding to annotate data internally or externally, consider the following factors: How much training data do you need? There is no standard answer for the amount of data required to achieve adequate model performance — this very much depends on the type of model, the training method you’re using, as well as the acceptable tolerance for errors. Do annotators require specialized expertise? Building a medical imaging model and an entity extractor are two different problems, each with its own unique set of issues. Medical, legal or technical data generally requires specialized skills to annotate, meaning annotators will need a significant amount of education and training prior to handling data.

12,How ADN Helps Crypto Funding Evolve,computers-technology," ADN has made another solution to help crypto’s trademark crowdfunding effort to have another viable option for it to continue evolving. Every approach mentioned has its advantages and disadvantages. Security Token Offerings As the name implies, STOs are a crowdfunding process wherein the issuer is selling its investors its tokenized securities. In financial courses, securities are assets which take the form of bonds, stocks, notes, etc. As in the case with stocks, investors can earn interests when the company they have funded in makes profits and raises its net worth. Security tokens are a means to spread the reach of securities to the cryptocurrency world. Compared to ICO, STOs are deemed more secure by some because the tokens are attached to a real-world asset. There will also be minor incidences of activities that the ICO has been infamous for because these need to be compliant with financial controls. Blockchain technology has yet to reach its maximum potential, and it is for that very reason that many decentralized applications and other blockchain-based initiatives are being planned for. Initial Exchange Offerings IEOs are the more popular alternative to the traditional ICOs. In this case, cryptocurrency exchanges facilitate the crowdfunding, allowing the ICO project proponents to relax and receive the funding they need to sustain their operations. Crypto exchanges market the token to the investors and provide an automatic listing on their exchange once the event has concluded. IEO participants can entrust their money on the exchanges because these have solidified their credibility through the years. They can also be sure that the tokens that they purchase will have a better chance of stabilizing in price because they are automatically listed on the exchange shortly after the conclusion of the token sale. The ADN ICO Wallet ADN believes in the sincerity of solutions. One of the most important advantages of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology is the option for decentralization. That is why ADN is offering a decentralized solution that will protect the interests of investors and ensure the quality of token sales held on the platform. ADN coin price may vary on the ICO wallet. One of the best features is the ICO Wallet, which comes in the form of an app that can be accessed by any ADN user. In the case of an IEO, it is the exchange that decides whether a token sale would ensue. With the ICO Wallet, it is the ICO participants who will vote after each stage whether it will proceed to the next one or not. Blockchain world has proven its detractors that ICO is not dead. It is most definitely alive and thriving in the form of STO, IEO, and the ADN ICO Wallet. ADN will continue to innovate and provide more viable options in the future to ensure that every crypto user will have the option to choose which crowdfunding platform works best for them."
13,The Future of Data Analytics: 5 Predictions for Where We Are Headed,computers-technology," At the basic level, data analytics is simply the usage of data to make a better-informed decision. This is something most of us do everyday. We look at the weather report to determine if we should carry an umbrella. We check movie ratings to see if a film is worth watching. At the business level, access to big data allows companies to analyze their customers or potential customers, as well as track progress for certain campaigns. For example, online blogs track the amount of visitors and time spent on articles. They can also track which articles lead to conversions in the form of sales leads, product purchases, subscriptions, and more. With the advent of artificial intelligence and easier access to data repositories, the potential of data analytics has grown tremendously and will continue to grow in the near future. In this article, we will give five predictions on what the future of data analytics looks like, areas it will grow, and things that may hinder growth. In the next 10 to 20 years, user data will become increasingly easier to access. This means that private companies and government organizations will track, store, and use your personal data more aggressively. An everyday example of this is the monitoring of your internet activity on your PC and mobile devices. Part of Google’s terms and services (that virtually no one ever reads) allows them to track your online activity. One way Google uses this data is by personalizing what advertisements you are shown based on your online shopping history and internet browser history. We accept similar agreements with the apps we download and programs we use. However, most people don’t care or don’t even know that this is happening. With the Internet of things (IoT) continuously expanding, this farming of our user data will become more and more commonplace. Devices like smartwatches and smart homes will be able to use that data to make our lives more convenient. While this connectivity will make our lives easier, it also means much more of our personal data will be given to organisations like Google who will use it to understand us better and market their products. As consumers, it is our responsibility to support companies based on whether we agree with their practices. As an example, more and more people who are against Google’s tracking system have chosen to use search engines like DuckDuckGo, which do not track your search history. However, even if there were a public outcry to enforce laws around data farming, governments have proven to move rather slowly. On the Joe Rogan Podcast, Tech tycoon Elon Musk explained his lack of faith in government legislation to slow down the pace of AI, citing the example that it took around 10 years just to enforce seat belts in automobiles. It is likely that both AI and data analytics will experience a similar slow pace of government intervention. Data farming will likely ramp up before it slows down. In the near future, companies will have to create moral codes of conduct for their prescriptive analytics models. What is Prescriptive Analytics? Simply, prescriptive analytics is the usage of data forecasts to decide the next course of action. A good example is the usage of predictive models for stock trading. A simple model could trigger the purchase of stocks after certain increments of growth, like if a stock rises for 3 consecutive days. This model could be set to give you an alert with a prediction of how much the stock is expected to grow within the next month, with a list of best courses of action. Similar models and systems could be created to track a company’s sales, worker output, and more. As better models are developed, it’s likely that more large companies will turn to them to help form business strategies. For example, let’s say you create a prescriptive analytics model to find ways to increase profits by 10% in one year. For argument’s sake, imagine the analysis comes back pointing to a list of options: Let go of 20% of your HR workforce Shut down your manufacturing warehouses and move them to a lesser-developed country Cut your advertising budget by 50% and hire additional sales staff While these suggestions very well may boost profits by 10%, each would have huge ramifications. More importantly, the suggestions could break ethical codes of conduct. This leads to the question: should we ever make such big business decisions based on data analytics alone? Back in 2015, Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates all made public statements to warn the world about the risks of AI. They all cautioned about developing AI without first learning about how to avoid the associated risks that come with the technology. Likewise, with prescriptive analytics, the creation of strict guidelines must become a standard business practice if not legal legislation. Companies both large and small will begin to outsource data analytics services, which will lead to a rise in data analytics outsourcing companies. One fairly obvious and certain prediction is that data analytics will become more common, not just within large companies, but small companies as well. The same way search engine marketing (SEM) is now the most important element of marketing & advertising strategy, data analytics will also become just as integral. However, smaller companies often don’t have the budget to hire data engineers or data scientists to do this work in-house. As a result, just like with SEM, many companies will turn to vendors that outsource data analytics services. One of the most interesting use cases for data analytics technology is to improve the education system. However, it is likely that public schools will be strongly hesitant to implement data analytics tech into their current workflow and protocols. The reason is simple: the more red tape something has, the longer it takes to implement any change. There are few institutions with more red tape than the public school systems in many Western countries. On the other hand, private schools will likely be quick to adopt the technology. Private schools, and private universities especially, have more freedom to operate and innovate as they see fit. Moreover, there are many ways that data analytics could help university students remain on track and lower the drop out rate. Undergraduate degrees are meant to be completed in four years, but only 50% of students in the United States complete their undergraduate degree within six years and 20.5% drop out within 6 years. While better counseling could lessen the attrition rate, Time magazine reported that the average university in the United States has 1 counselor for every 1,737 students. A data analytics model could learn from student data, and find patterns in students that have dropped out. These patterns could be missed classes, failed tests, or a decline in overall GPA. The model could then look for those patterns in existing students, and alert counselors with lists of students exhibiting similar issues. Data analytics could help schools prioritize at-risk students, get them the help they need, and prevent them from dropping out. Perhaps more precisely, virtual assistants will harness data analytics technology. While not at an Iron Man x J.A.R.V.I.S. scale, merging natural language processing technology with a data analytics model would greatly improve user experience. This would in turn lessen overall time spent analyzing data and creating the next course of action. We are already seeing the early stage of this with Google Analytics. Google Analytics is a tool used by webmasters to track website data and monitor changes. However, instead of looking at every report, you can simply type in questions or commands like ""show me any anomalies this month"". The system will then show you spikes in or drops in important metrics. Simply adding an ASR model to this system could create a user friendly virtual assistant for web data. … Above were just five predictions for the future of data analytics. With greater advancements in machine learning technology, we will surely see the data analytics market grow as well.

14,10 Data Analytics Terms Every Beginner Should Know,computers-technology," If you are just starting out in data analytics and are unfamiliar with some of the basic terminology, don’t worry. At Cangler, we’ve got you covered with ten basic data analytics terms that everyone in the field should know. From the different types of data analytics, to the crossover between data analytics and machine learning, this article will serve as a necessary introduction to some of the simple, yet fundamental concepts and processes used in the field today. This article will cover the following data analytics terms: Data Analytics, Descriptive Analytics, Diagnostic Analytics, Predictive Analytics, Prescriptive Analytics, Data Mining, Cloud/Cloud-based, Machine Learning, Dataset, Big Data/Big Data Analytics, ... What is Data Analytics? Data analytics is simply the collection, presentation, and evaluation of data to help inform decisions. This analysis could range in complexity from analyzing weather patterns to evaluating Twitter posts to predict stock market fluctuations. Data analytics is divided into different types or processes based on the end goal of the analytics task. What is Descriptive Analytics? Put simply, descriptive analytics is the presentation of data in a clear and easily digestible way for your target audience. With descriptive analytics, your data is normally transformed into visuals in the form of graphs, charts, and other infographics. While other sectors of data analytics deal with how to analyze and draw conclusions from data, the goal of descriptive analytics is simply to present your data in the most efficient medium. This is especially important when dealing with historical business data, such as the rise and fall of sales numbers over time. It is also the duty of descriptive analytics to present data accurately and in context. Simply showing the rise of your company’s sales this year might not be enough if, when compared to last year, your sales have dropped significantly. In such a case, it might be better to plot both the sales of last year and this year on the same graph to show how you are performing compared to the year before. What is Diagnostic Analytics? While descriptive analytics seeks to simply present data, diagnostic analytics seeks to deep dive into your data to find the answer to why something happened. For example, why do your sales numbers spike in April? Why are April’s sales for this year lower than last years? Diagnostic analytics gives insights into why data points have remained static or moved in a certain direction. With diagnostic analytics, sometimes you must look outside the data itself and draw from other sources of data both internally and externally to propose probable correlations. What is Predictive Analytics? As the name suggests, predictive analytics focuses on using statistical data to find patterns and forecast the movement of data. In practice, predictive analytics can be used to try to predict problems before they occur or forecast things like sales growth and other business metrics. From streamlining maintenance schedules to analytics marketing campaigns, predictive analytics can benefit various industries. A good example of predictive analytics that you are likely familiar with is the recommendation system on Netflix and other streaming websites. By using data such as your viewing history, your search history, and ratings, Netflix’s system uses an algorithm to predict which shows and movies in their catalogue you would enjoy. Similar systems are used by Amazon to recommend items and Google to choose which ads to show you. What is Prescriptive Analytics? Taking predictive analytics one step further, prescriptive analytics seeks to use the actionable insights given by the data. Whereas predictive analytics provides you with the raw data projections, prescriptive analytics seeks to give you various plans of actions based on the data. Projected results and risks associated with each plan would also be included, so that they can be compared and acted upon. What is Data Mining? As the name suggests, data mining is the process of extracting useful information from various forms of unstructured data. This data can be in the form of text, images, audio and more. The key distinction of unstructured data is that it has not yet been processed, labeled, or formatted for use in data analytics or machine learning algorithms. A modern example of data mining is sentiment analysis of social media posts to determine brand recognition. This is done by scraping a social media platform, such as Twitter, and collecting a large number of posts. These posts are then examined to learn about the public opinion of your company or brand. What does Cloud or Cloud-based mean? A term not exclusive to machine learning, ""the cloud"" refers to a digital space that exists online. Therefore, when you hear a term such as cloud-based data storage, that refers to a storage system where your data is hosted on remote servers and not stored on premises. That means the data is not directly held within the hard drive of your computer, but instead on servers that you access through the internet. What is Machine Learning (ML)? Machine learning is a field of study that uses algorithms to process and learn from data similar to the way humans do. It is thanks to machine learning that we have amazing technologies, such as self-driving cars and voice assistants, available to us today. As the machine learning industry grows, more and more people are using ML-based algorithms for data analytics. What is a Dataset? A dataset is simply a set of data, often organized into rows and columns. When training a machine learning or data analytics algorithm, datasets are divided into training and testing splits. The training dataset is used to develop the model and the testing dataset is used to evaluate the model for accuracy. What is Big Data or Big Data Analytics? From internet traffic to user behavior, numerous companies both large and small have access to incredibly large, often unstructured, datasets. Big data refers to data analytics methods used to process large datasets often containing hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of rows of data. ... These were just some of the most common terms you’ll hear in data analytics today. Hopefully, these terms will help you understand more complex articles about data analytics throughout your journey."

16,Image masking go hand in hand,computers-technology," Image masking go hand in hand Advertising is an essential part of a company's marketing plan. In fact, advertising is a huge industry here and now. Advertising is done with promotional material such as posters, flyers, infomercials, brochures, brochures, datasheets, and catalogs, just to name a few. The reason is to spread the word about a business. But it is necessary to do with image masking or clipping path? Let's find out. The images or photos play a fundamental role for people to buy a product or service. Product photos make people excited. When it comes to product imaging, image masking is a technique of great importance. To make an image more attractive, image masking is the best option for image editors. It is done through the clipping path with the help of the pencil tool in applications such as Photoshop. It may seem easier because you just have to trace the edges of different products. Well, it may or may not be easy. It is easier if you have to edit some images, but it is much more complicated if you have never tried to edit an image yourself. Once you've successfully outlined an image, your next move is to replace the image's background with a relevant theme. This will leave a lasting impression on potential customers. Typically, images that have gone through the image masking technique are uploaded to eCommerce websites and blogs where the images are exposed to millions of visitors daily. Users look at the product images to get an idea of what the actual product will look like. It goes without saying that ad agencies have expert designers who are adept at using Adobe Photoshop or other software programs like Illustrator. You can make a couple of simple images on your own. But do you think you can edit hundreds of thousands of images by yourself? Your answer will be negative. In this case, you will have no choice but to enlist the help of a company that offers clipping path and image masking services. So, if you are already running an eCommerce site, you may want to use the services of an expert designer to get a really nice product image for your site. If you have never hired an image editing professional, make sure they are well trained and experienced. That's!"
17,Protect your files with drive image backup software,computers-technology," Almost every computer user is aware of the importance of keeping information safely backed up. After all, there are many things which can go wrong and potentially claim all the data installed on your device. Some examples are ransomware attacks, hardware failures, accidental deletion, or even just a power cut preventing the computer from shutting down correctly. Yet while we might all understand why it's important to back data up, the actual way people do it often isn't sufficient enough. All too often does something important get left behind. After all, not all of the important files on a device are necessarily in the documents folder. You also need to consider things like system settings, installed software licenses, and a multitude of other data spanning across the many gigabytes or terabytes of files on your device. That's why drive image backup software provides the optimal solution, since it leaves nothing to chance. TeraByte Drive Image Backup and Restore is a complete solution for backing up all the date on your hard drive or any other storage device, including removable media. It makes a byte-by-byte copy of the storage device so that nothing gets left behind. If you are making a drive image of your system hard drive, this also means backing up your entire operating system, all your programs, and your personal files. When you restore the image using the included restore function, your computer will be exactly as you left it. In that sense, it works a little like the built-in restore feature in Windows, but it's far more inclusive, since it goes a long way beyond just backing up key system files. While this also means your backups take up a lot more storage space, TeraByte Drive Image Backup and Restore offers the answer by compressing your backups, updating them incrementally as changes are made, and even letting you move them to the cloud. Another huge benefit of using drive imaging software is that it allows you to provision new computers in far less time, with minimal interacted needed. For example, if you build or buy a new computer, you ordinarily need to install your operating system before manually downloading and installing all the drives and applications, optimizing your settings accordingly and, finally, copying over your personal documents from a backup. This can end up taking hours and doing it at scale becomes a practical impossibility. For example, if you are running a business with a large network, imagine having to manually install everything on each individual computer. It can quickly end up taking months, which is why many businesses are reluctant to upgrade their operating systems and other software. Fortunately, with a drive image, you can provision new computers automatically and in far less time. This is also ideal for home users who want to replace their system hard drive, or they want to use a new computer. The latest edition of TeraByte Drive Image Backup and Restore, launched on February 28, 2020, offers several improvements including corrected Unicode registrations and a changed default for the /fddc command which now uses lazy write mode by default.

External refers to the backlinks that you will be earning from other websites and internal refers to how well you can link your webpages to make it easy for your audience to get the information that they are seeking."
20,Why haven't fully reusable rockets been attempted yet?,computers-technology," Why is Rocket Reusability Important? Right now, we are entering an exciting new era of space travel and exploration. There have been many advancements to the technology used for space exploration, including the vehicles that enable us to reach space in the first place: rockets. However, rockets are still extremely expensive. The Delta IV Heavy, manufactured by the United Launch Alliance(a launch service created as a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing), costs approximately $350 million USD per launch. NASA originally intended for their space shuttles to solve this problem and ultimately bring down the cost of space travel The shuttles were capable, but they wound up being extremely expensive as well, averaging a cost of around $450 million dollars per launch. Why is it that rockets are so expensive? Well first off, rockets are made of expensive materials and require thousands of man-hours to manufacture. Also, the more important reason is because almost every single rocket that has ever existed was expendable. That means that, after launch, and successful payload deploy, every single part of the rocket is thrown away. Imagine having to buy a new car every time you need to drive somewhere, and then promptly smashing it to pieces afterward. That’s basically what rockets do, except on a much, much larger scale. How Existing Rockets Deal with Reusability One rocket has managed to break the mold of rockets being one-time use vehicles. The iconic Falcon 9 rocket, developed by a private aerospace company called SpaceX, has a reusable first stage booster. To explain what this means, you must first understand that  rockets have different sections called stages. They often consist of a first stage, and a second stage on top of it. The first stage is generally the more powerful stage, lifting itself and everything else out of the thick parts of the atmosphere and to space. But that’s not all; in order to deliver the payload to a proper orbit and not just fall back down again, the spent first stage separates and falls back down to the earth(usually into the ocean) and the second stage takes over. The second stage is, basically, a smaller, new and unused rocket sitting on top of the first stage. This stage is usually the more efficient stage, with an engine optimized for the vacuum of space. After taking over, the second stage accelerates itself and the payload to at least the speed of 7,800 m/s or about 17,500 mph, in order to reach orbital speed. After deploying the payload, the second stage usually then performs a retrograde(opposite to the direction of travel) burn in order to de-orbit itself, and burns up on reentry in the atmosphere. What SpaceX does to actually reuse their first stages is that they land their first stages using propulsive landing techniques they’ve nearly perfected over the years. After stage separation, the first stage coasts up to its apogee, or the furthest point from the earth that the stage reaches, after which it will begin falling back down. It then uses tiny thrusters called RCS(reaction control system) thrusters that can change the pitch, yaw, and roll of a spacecraft to orientate it to the angle it will be at when it re-enters the earth’s atmosphere, engines first. It also deploys a set of grid-shaped fins. When it reaches the point where the atmosphere begins to thicken, it burns three of its nine engines for a ""re-entry burn"" in order to protect it from atmospheric entry heating and massively reduce its velocity in the process. The rest of the way down, it uses the constantly thickening atmosphere to its advantage and gets rid of most of the rest of its velocity, all while steering it by adjusting the grid fins. Finally, it reaches the point where it begins the final landing procedure; this is the hardest part of the whole landing, and must be timed perfectly. It activates one of the nine engines in what’s sometimes referred to as a ""suicide burn"" or ""hoverslam"". This one rocket engine has to activate at the perfect time to slow down the stage to the perfect velocity at the perfect altitude; too early and the first stage starts ascending again, too late and the stage violently collides with the surface. SpaceX has managed to be able to do this consistently without numerous failures since 2015, when they first managed to land a first stage booster successfully. After the landing, the boosters are taken to SpaceX’s facilities to be refurbished. ""Refurbish"" would be the slightly more accurate term here, as SpaceX still needs to do some substantial work to get the booster ready to re-fly. Their eventual goal is to be able to land the booster, have a period of 24 hours where they merely clean it and check it, and re-fly it, ten times in a row. This is something that can be achieved with even more experience and small tweaks to the design. SpaceX has achieved something that has never been done before, which was once thought impossible to do. Their first stages are reportedly substantially cheaper to refurbish than build new. However, there is one more step in reusability that they have not taken, which is to reuse the second stage as well. This seems like the natural next step, but for now, SpaceX decided to not pursue second stage reuse in order to focus their efforts on the creation of their next-generation rocket, the starship/super heavy rocket which is designed to take humans to mars. Second stage reuse is possible and viable, but no one has ever attempted it. So why haven’t they? What are the main challenges presented by second stage reuse? The Challenges of Second Stage Reuse Firstly, the main challenge of second stage reuse is the amount of heat an orbital spacecraft experiences during re-entry. This is the one of the biggest challenges in creating a spacecraft that needs to re-enter the atmosphere, such as NASA’s space shuttles. Re-entry heating happens because when something is entering the atmosphere, it encounters more and more air molecules as the atmosphere thickens closer to the earth. Orbital spacecraft have so much velocity that the air molecules accumulate at the front of the craft. The air molecules essentially start to get more and more compressed. This concept can be explained with the law of conservation of energy, which states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, but rather transferred or converted into a different form. The accumulation of air molecules begins to take away the kinetic energy from the craft in the form of drag, reducing its velocity, but it also becomes thermal energy. The air heats up enough to actually start glowing and also creates a layer of plasma which envelopes the spacecraft. This is enough to rip apart spacecraft into fiery shards upon re-entry. To get over the problem of re-entry heating, spacecraft that need to survive re-entry will have to employ the use of a heat shield. Heat shields are made with many different materials, and there are different types of heat shields used for re-entry. The most common of these, however, is the ablative heat shield. Ablative heat shields are specially designed to slowly burn off, in the process creating a gas which takes the heat energy away by convection. This sounds easy enough to solve if you’re designing a reusable second stage; just put a heat shield in front of the second stage, and it’ll survive re-entry. However, the fact that the ablative heat shield would often have to be replaced between flights may or may not be desirable, since the point of a fully reusable rocket is for it to be fully reusable. Ideally, in between flights you’d not want to have to swap out anything, and instead just have to clean and refuel your reusable rocket stages. There are other types of heat shielding available however, such the reusable thermal protection system on the space shuttle. Instead of using ablative heat shields, the NASA space shuttles used many different materials to provide a robust and reusable heat shield. The space shuttle used a composite reinforced carbon-carbon material as a coating on its nose, wing leading edges and other areas where the heat was extreme, thousands of high and low temperature surface insulation tiles mostly on the underside of the shuttle, and many other types of heat shielding. These systems would be able to be reused, which was the main goal of the space shuttle: to be an economical, reusable, capable launch system. However, the heat shielding on the space shuttle was easy to break, which led to the Columbia disaster, when a piece of insulation foam hit the heat shielding during launch and broke a part of the heat shield significant enough that the shuttle burned up in the atmosphere on re-entry, killing all seven crew members on board. Also, the tiles on the space shuttle had to be meticulously checked between flights, and massively contributed to the shuttle’s long refurbishment time and large cost. Thus, a shielding system similar to the space shuttle could work on the second stage of a rocket, but maybe some other heat shielding system could be more efficient and less costly. Well that was pretty simple, just put a heat shielding system on the front of your spacecraft and you’re ready to go. However that’s not the only challenge of creating a fully reusable rocket second stage. All the dangers of re-entry could theoretically be solved with one system or the next, but the one thing that adding protection systems can’t solve is the decreasing amount of payload for each piece of hardware added. Basically, for each kilogram or pound of weight you add to the second stage in reusability hardware, you have to take away a kilogram/pound from the payload capacity. This means that maintaining a similar payload capacity as expendable rockets will be a much bigger engineering challenge. An economical near-fully reusable rocket would have to be slightly more powerful than an expendable rocket of the same size, while also being more fuel-efficient. Another slightly smaller but still very important issue is due to basic physics. This issue due to the fact that you’d have to put a heat shield on the opposite end to the engines. The stage would need to remain with the heat shield pointed prograde(in the direction of travel) in order to prevent the risk of other sensitive parts of the rocket overheating. However, any falling object would naturally, because of basic physics, want its heaviest point facing forward in its trajectory. For an empty/nearly empty rocket second stage, this would be near the engines. Thus, a second stage trying to make it safely through the atmosphere would naturally try to flip over to its engine pointing forward, which is absolutely not ideal. This would most likely cause the entire stage to overheat and burn up in the atmosphere. To solve this, the spacecraft would have to have something that keeps this oriented through the atmosphere. The tiny RCS(or Reaction Control System) gas thrusters typically used on spacecraft would be sufficient in the vacuum of space, but not once the stage enters the atmosphere. The craft would have to employ the use of some kind of aerodynamic stabilization mechanism, an example being the titanium grid fins used on the Falcon 9. This would have to be all carefully thought out as the heat from the re-entry of an orbital velocity craft would melt many metals, running the risk of destroying the fins. The last issue to solve is the issue of landing the stage. So your second stage has survived atmospheric heating. Great! Now you have to figure out a method of landing it. You cannot simply flip your stage around and use the vacuum optimized engine for propulsive landing like a Falcon 9 first stage. Firstly, the amount of fuel left over might not be enough, and also, vacuum-optimized engines typically can’t operate safely at sea level. The better option here would be to use the more conventional parachute system. We might soon see someone decide to attempt second stage reusability, and be able to perform it consistently and economically. For now, SpaceX isn’t pursuing second stage reuse on the Falcon 9 in order to focus on the development of their highly ambitious next generation Starship/Superheavy fully reusable mars rocket. But who knows, maybe one day they’ll come back to it. Maybe some other space agency/aerospace company will do it first. A practical medium lift rocket capable of full reuse would be a truly revolutionary development in the space industry, and could be used to help bring down the cost of resupply missions to the international space station, for one. Reusability is really the technology that will bring space travel to the next level. For now though, we’ll just have to wait and see what exciting new designs are developed."

1,Five Benefits of CCTV Cameras That Go Beyond Video Recording,computers-technology," 1.Motion Detection CCTV systems with motion detection support let you configure your camera to begin recording handiest when it has detected movement within its field of view. This manner, the simplest footage that carries relevant statistics might be stored. This saves you money on storage, backup and archiving, and makes it simpler to browse and retrieve statistics whilst you need. Infra-purple CCTV cameras use cheap, widely-available components, so infra-crimson abilities do no longer always add a whole lot in your camera’s price. However, you have to steer clear of the less expensive models, which regularly have insufficient illumination levels, or which cannot modify the illumination stage automatically (or at all), main to poor-satisfactory pictures. Two-way Audio is one of the greater left out superior CCTV features. Two-manner audio lets in the operator within the manipulate room to converse with the person in front of the CCTV Fixing. The conversation itself may be recorded and archived, similar to any other sort of footage. The fee of this gadget lies now not so much within the feature itself (that's interesting, however in any other case little more than a workout in pc vision) as in its integration with archiving, access management and parking management software, and inside the analytics value of the information that it could provide. Facial popularity is a very effective CCTV characteristic, that's used in lots of settings where security or customer support are of extreme importance. It can be used, for example, to identify and track VIP clients in inns or casinos — or, similarly well, to realize folks that are not allowed to be on a business’ premises or suspected criminals."
2,Separating the Wheat from the Chaff: How to Find a Genuine Remote Computer Repair Service,computers-technology," With the world in the grip of the coronavirus pandemic, millions of people are confined to their homes and spending lots of time on their computers, both for work and for pleasure. Inevitably things go wrong with computers, and issues arise, and there has never been a greater need for computer support that doesn’t require the technician to come into your home. I recently published a blog post about Remote Computer Repairs and was shocked to read an unpleasant comment on a third party site a few days later, accusing me of computer fraud/scam/control/hijacking/stealing and calling me scum. Whilst it was upsetting to be labelled in this way by someone who knows nothing about me, it got me thinking about how you can distinguish between genuine honest businesses which are there to provide a much-needed service, and those whose only purpose is to deceive and manipulate for their own gain. When used correctly and legitimately, remote computer support is a powerful tool which means that issues can be resolved without the need for the technician to come to your place. This means no travel time for the technician, resulting in a lower cost for the client, particularly when the issue is resolved within a few minutes. However, the whole remote support industry has been given a bad name as a result of numerous scams which have happened in recent years and which continue to abound. In fact there have been so many fraudulent remote ‘computer repair’ providers on the internet that Google no longer allows any computer repair company to advertise using their Google Ads platform. David Graff, Director of Global Product Policy at Google, stated in August 2018, ""We’ve seen a rise in misleading ad experiences stemming from third-party technical support providers and have decided to begin restricting ads in this category globally."" This step has had a huge impact on the computer repair industry worldwide, as many small local computer repair businesses have found their ads removed from Google’s platform, resulting in a vastly reduced stream of new business. The Unsolicited Call Most of us are familiar with that phone call. Someone purporting to be from Microsoft, or from your telco, or your antivirus provider, or from some other company that you trust, calls you out of the blue and tells you there’s something wrong with your computer or your internet use and they need to resolve it urgently. To do so they require access to your computer and they’ll talk you through how to install whatever remote access software they’re using, so that they can control your computer and do whatever they want. These phone calls are normally very convincing and somewhat intimidating as they use well-honed (and often successful) techniques to convince you that the issue needs to be addressed right away. I’ve assisted many clients who’ve fallen prey to these scams, and either been swindled out of money as payment for the ‘service’ rendered, had their bank accounts accessed, or found their computers to be unusable following the intrusion. The cardinal rule with these calls is simple: never never grant access to your computer as a result of any unsolicited call, and always give the caller extremely short shrift before they have the chance to persuade you otherwise. The Pop-Up Many of us are also familiar with the pop-up. It will usually be either a small window, normally at the bottom right of your screen, or a larger window right in the centre. You’ll be warned that there’s something wrong with your computer and that you need to either click through to a certain website, or call the number listed to have the issue resolved. The message may appear to have come from Microsoft, or from a third party. The cardinal rule here is also simple: never click on the link provided or call the number listed. Having seen the pop-up you may well be concerned about the health of your computer, but you should never follow the instructions given as the real problems will only begin after you follow these instructions. Either run a malware/virus scan to eliminate the source of the pop-up, or get in touch with a legitimate computer repair professional who will be able to assist you in an honest manner. The Search for a Genuine Remote Computer Repair Service There will be times when you will need to find a computer repair professional who can work remotely to resolve whatever issues you’re having. If you don’t already have someone who performs this service for you then you’ll need to find someone whom you won’t actually meet in person, but in whom you’ll be placing your trust to resolve your issues from a distance. In general, when you search online for a computer repair or service , the results which come up in the organic search section on the first page of Google (or Bing) will be reputable companies you can trust. The reason they are there is because they’ve earned the right to be there. Google looks for high levels of Expertise, Authoritativeness and Trustworthiness (E-A-T) in order to rank pages highly, and with the increasing intelligence of its algorithm, it’s become more and more difficult for low-quality, spammy websites to rank well. Having said that you may find that, for whatever reason, none of the highest-ranking sites are quite what you need. Perhaps you’re looking for a cheaper option, or a more low-key service. You may then find yourself looking through online directories, or comparison sites, or elsewhere, comparing prices and trying to find the ideal computer repair service for you. There are usually plenty of good options in these places too, but it may be harder to sift the wheat from the chaff. When searching in this way, and comparing computer repair services, ask some of the following questions before you make your decision. •	Does the computer repair service have a company name? I regularly receive emails from people wanting to assist me with my Search Engine Optimisation (SEO), with no company name, no website, and very little that gives their pitch any credibility. •	Do they have a website? If they don’t then its very difficult to find out much about them. •	If they do have a website, is it a substantial site, with good helpful content, or is it a one page site that could have been thrown together in an hour? Does the website look ‘spammy’? Is it filled with adverts? •	Is the website entirely anonymous, or does the company tell you something about themselves, their history, and their personnel? •	Search the internet using the company name and see if you can find other external references to the company. If there’s nothing else out there about them it’s likely to be a reason to be suspicious, though of course it may also be that they just haven’t been around that long. •	Are there testimonials on their website? If so, do they look genuine? The more testimonials you can find the better. Even better is to find testimonials on independent review sites and elsewhere, for example on Google My Business. The good news for you is that there are lots of genuine remote computer repair services out there. Once you find someone you can trust you’ll likely want to stay with them and for this reason it’s often best to find a company in your own geographical area, who also offer on-site service. Not everything can be resolved remotely and at some point, when the coronavirus pandemic has settled down and social distancing is no longer a necessity, you may require a technician to come to you. Good luck with your search!"
3,How much does a slow computer cost your business?,computers-technology," A slow PC can seriously impact productivity in a business – which means it becomes a cost to your business. One computer can be the most effective tool across an entire business. However, if it is not maintained correctly, it can quickly become the most cumbersome. We all know that budgets are tight, and that business owners and managers make tough decisions every day on where to allocate limited resources. What most people don’t think about is how the decision to not spend money could end up costing a lot more. The cost of using slow computer hardware A Techaisle survey reveals the cost of repairing an old computer can be higher than buying a new one. The study finds that businesses are spending an average of $427 per PC that is 4 years or older on repair cost, which is 1.3 times the repair cost for a PC that is less than 4 years old. The repair cost therefore either equals or even exceeds the purchase price of some new PCs. Besides increasing your vulnerability to hackers, viruses, malware, and other cyberthreats, outdated hardware puts you at risk of irretrievably losing data and information. While every business should have a comprehensive, redundant data backup and data recovery plan, many don’t. Old computers and software are more prone to problems that can mean your data is lost forever. Older computers inhibit productivity. Older computers have trouble running multiple applications at once, consume more power, and have a shorter battery life. The study found that an average of 42 productive work hours are lost per year while older computers are being repaired. For PCs less than 4 years old, only 21 hours of repair time are needed, cutting downtime in half. The cost of lost productivity quantified For the sake of simplicity, we’ll consider the numbers in the context of a normal business with slow computer equipment. Opportunity cost is the amount working hours lost that could have been used to complete business as usual. Assume a user experiences slowdown for 5 minutes every hour, and they work 7.5 hours per day. This translates to a loss of productivity for almost 40 minutes each day, or around 3 hours per week. In a year, that is approximately 145 hours per year of lost productivity. (220 days x 40 minutes). With a salary of $20,000 per year, that is an estimated opportunity cost of $1,740 per user. The bottom line Never put up with a slow computer again. Next time an employee in your business complains about working on a slow computer consider the actual cost to your business. The upfront and underlying costs of a slow computer to your business can be significant. For a small outlay, avoid the cost associated with using old computer hardware.

5,How to Use Blogging to Promote a Website,computers-technology," You’ll hear it said time and time again that blog posts are a key marketing tool, but it’s equally possible to spend countless hours on article writing with negligible results. Today we’ll be covering a few key tips that will get you on the right track and help you to use your blog to bring increases in traffic and sales. Write extensive articles that answer customer questions There’s a saying among bloggers that goes like this – content is key. So whatever your niche, make sure that your content is of the highest quality that you can produce. Consider starting with a question that one of your customers might ask or giving a list of tips, such as ‘How to choose the best budget camera’ or ‘5 tips for getting new clients through social media’. Once you’ve found your topic, cover it in as much depth as you can. If writing is something you struggle with, it may even be worth employing someone else to create content for you. The reason is simple – the higher the quality, the more time readers will spend on your page, engage with your business and want to share your article with others. ‘Content is key’ doesn’t just cover your text, but images and any video that you include as well. Consider resizing images to make them unique and using a paid image site for graphics to enhance quality. Find a niche Research articles from similar websites in your business area. Is there a topic you find customers asking about frequently that is rarely or never covered in blog posts? If so, you’ve found a great gap in the market for content! Creating a unique piece of content will mean that your article is likely to rank higher in search engines and therefore bring in that all-important traffic. Share, share, and share once more Once you’ve created your high-quality niche blog post, it’s time to share. Post your article on social media and ask others in your industry to share it. Another good tip is reaching out to other bloggers in your industry to see if they can add a link to your article in their next roundup post, as this will help your site rank higher and get you more readers. You can also seek out Facebook groups or forums for your subject areas and share your content there. Internal linking Always add links in your article that lead to other links on your website such as similar pages and descriptions of your services, as this will lead to customers spending more time on your site. Conclusion I hope that you’ve enjoyed reading this article and good luck with writing and promoting your next blog post. In summary, create incredible content that nobody else has thought of, share it with the right people and sit back, relax and reap the rewards!"
6,Generate More Leads and Get Return On Investment by Using WordPress Web Site for Your Business.,computers-technology," What is WordPress? At its core, WordPress is the simplest, most popular way to create your own website or blog. In fact, WordPress powers over 60% of all the websites on the Internet. Yes, more than one in four websites that you visit are likely powered by WordPress. On a slightly more technical level, WordPress is an open-source content management system licensed under GPLv2, which means that anyone can use or modify the WordPress software for free. Many years ago, WordPress was primarily a tool to create a blog, rather than more traditional websites. That hasn’t been true for a long time, though. Nowadays, thanks to changes to the core code, as well as WordPress’ massive ecosystem of plugins and themes, you can create any type of website with WordPress. For example, not only does WordPress power a huge number of business sites and blogs, it’s also the most popular way to create an eCommerce store as well! With WordPress, you can create: Blog or Personal Website Business Website eCommerce Job Board Business Directory Question & Answer Website NonProfits and Religious Websites Portfolio Websites Online Communities Coupon Website Auction Websites Multilingual Websites Knowledgebase / Wiki Websites Podcasting Websites Niche Affiliate Websites Photography Websites School or College Websites Private Blogs Family Blogs WordPress was created as a standalone project all the way back in 2003, originating as an offshoot of a previous project called b2/cafelog. WordPress is open-source software, so nowadays it’s made by a huge community of contributors. But if we were to trace WordPress’ origins back to its roots, its original creation was a collaboration between Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little. Since then, Matt Mullenweg has largely become the face of WordPress. And he’s also the founder of Automattic, which is the company behind the for-profit WordPress.com service. The history of WordPress between its founding as a blog platform back in 2003 and today is a long one… But suffice it to say, WordPress has pushed forward and, thanks to its contributors and huge community, developed into the most popular solution to create any type of website. One of the questions that we often get asked is: Why should I use WordPress? Isn’t my old site good enough? Why do I need to switch to WordPress from another platform? If you’re asking these questions, here are important reasons why you should use WordPress. WordPress is Free as in Freedom WordPress is a free software.

7,Factors to Consider While Buying a Robust Antivirus,computers-technology," Are you looking forward to buying antivirus software with robust security features then you continue reading this informative article further? In case you are going to opt for Norton, then you kay continue doing so because this software comes with PC cloud backup and family safety features that are ought to be there in an effective antivirus solution. On the other hand, Norton conducts various tests based on comparison and review in its lab. These tests are specifically done for antivirus software, tools for malware removal, and other security software that are available for various operating systems. You can secure your System by deploying Norton Antivirus that can be installed via Norton.com/Setup without any hassle. Why opt for Norton? The security products are developed for everyone you care about and it has been years now since Norton has been protecting users from various threats and malware. If you have Norton on your device, then worry no more while exploring through the world of the web. With its several findings and researches, Norton keeps its users updated about the digital dangers that could potentially be harmful in many ways. But, if you are going to opt for an antivirus from any other manufacturer, then look for the following features in it. Carry out your research based on the following The first thing your research should be based upon is on the fact that if you are going to opt for a paid version of the product or the free one. If you are considering the free one, you should be aware of the fact that free versions are not as effective as the paid ones. Those who are opting for the paid subscription should consider if the product is giving value for money or not. Paid versions are known to provide robust as well as cost-effective services along with a comprehensive end to end protection. For some basic services, a free version will do but it may trouble a user in terms of adware and so on. On the other hand, a free version might have been developed for the purpose of collecting user info and then selling it to third parties. Hence, considering this factor is the first thing you should do. It also provides a platform i.e. Norton.com/Setup from where you can easily set up the software on your device. Most of the antivirus software available in the market may slow down your PC and makes it respond slowly. The programs may also run slower than usual. But, if it is embedded with the latest technology then it will not. In case the performance of the antivirus is superb but it is slowing down your PC, then you may opt for this one. A user should not compromise with a performance at no level. Checking the system requirements of antivirus should also be in this consideration list because if it isn't compatible with the device you are having, then there is no meaning to buy such software. One should consider buying that software which shows its compatibility with maximum devices present in your home. Sometimes, you purchase antivirus software for a specific reason. For example, if you are looking for an antivirus with an effective firewall, then look for the product that offers one such feature. Buy an antivirus from a reputable and well-known brand. Final words After considering all these factors, the last thing you should look further into an antivirus is that it comes with customer support and services or not? This factor is very essential in terms of when a user faces difficulty in using the software."
8,How to choose your tablet?,computers-technology," Which graphics tablet should you choose to get started? For a first drawing attempt on a graphic tablet, it is largely preferable to go on an entry-level tablet, at less than 80 €. Whether you are already an artist or not, the feeling of drawing on the tablet, as well as the drawing method, is very different from drawing on paper and mastering drawing on graphic tablet is difficult. This is why the initial investment must be light, many designers try themselves a dozen times on a tablet before reselling it. For the choice of brand or size of the tablet, there is no particular recommendation to follow. Wacom markets tablets of good quality, but other manufacturers offer equivalent products at more aggressive prices. For the size of the tablet, the A6 or A5 formats are preferable in order to acquire a cheap tablet, but the other formats are not to be excluded if you think you feel more using on A4 or A3. Which graphic tablet to choose instead? For users who have already used a graphics tablet for several years, changing the graphics tablet is more difficult. For the brand, Wacom is certainly the only choice, their tablets and styluses being the best on the market. For the choice of the model, the opinions of professionals on the Web are very rare. Logical evolution would require you to purchase the top range model or the latest update for your current tablet. Rather, it will be your budget that will determine the range of graphics tablets you purchase, while the tablet size is generally the same as your previous tablet, but this may be an opportunity to change. Which size of graphic tablet to choose? There is no size more suitable than others, it is rather your workspace and your preferences that determine the size of your tablet. The small shelves are practical, because the entire drawing space is accessible with a small movement. The A3 and A4 tablets require much larger gestures, but some designers like to make larger gestures. It is all a matter of personal preference, but if you plan to buy your first tablet, think carefully about the size since it will be your preferred size later. For a second tablet, a format change is possible, but do not skip the steps, for example from A6 to A4. What is the difference between a graphics tablet and a touch pad? Graphics tablets are real drawing and digital painting tools, use to create very precise illustrations. The touch pads are intended for conventional use: internet, e-mail, videos, etc. Unlike graphics tablets, the touchscreens are not designed for artists, even if some of them start using an iPad for digital painting. Not all touch pads offer a stylus, but if necessary, a Wacom brand stylus provides precision equivalent to a tablet from the Bamboo range, on iPads and Android tablets. In itself, a touch pad can be very practical for a designer who likes to sketch outside."
9,How to Shrink the Size of My 4K UHD videos?,computers-technology," I used WinX HD Video Converter Deluxe, which reduced the video to 24MB in less than 20 seconds. HandBrake reduced it to 21.3MB but worked the processor harder and took a minute longer. There are lots of free video compression programs that will do this job, so it's just a question of finding one you like. Pro tip: Handbrake (V1.3.1) can convert a smartphone's variable frame rate videos to a constant frame rate for editing. (It stops the sound going out of sync.) To compress video size, a key factor is the size of the image, just as it is with still photographs. You can also reduce the file size by arbitrarily reducing the data rate or, for preference, by using a more efficient video compression system. The current favourite is MPEG-4/H.264/AVC (Advanced Video Coding), which is usually called MP4 for short. Technically, MP4 is the file container while H.264 is the codec that codes and decodes the video. There are some good reasons for reducing video file sizes. For example, you might want to customize a high-resolution video for a low-resolution screen. You might also want to fit several videos on a device with limited storage, such as a smartphone or tablet, or an optical disc such as a CD-Rom or DVD. You might want to send the video to someone else; reducing the file size will reduce the upload and download times. In general, however, it's a bad idea to reduce the size of irreplaceable videos just to save space. Disk drives are cheap, and a 70 4TB drive can hold thousands of videos. You can also use cheap or free online storage at sites such as pCloud, Mega.nz, MediaFire and Yandex.Disk. Screen resolutions keep increasing, and 640 x 480-pixel VGA videos that used to fill a screen now look tiny on today's 3840 x 2160-pixel 4K screens. So, always shoot at the highest resolution that's practical, and keep it. In the long run, you will need every pixel you can get. Before we get to the details, a warning: never edit an original video file. Always keep external backups of original files, and always work with copies. Of course, this also applies to personal photos and audio files. However, losing a 2GB video of your holiday or a kid's birthday party will hurt more than losing the odd photo. Reducing resolution The resolution of the video - the number of pixels on screen at any one time - has a huge impact on the resulting file size, but also how good it looks on modern screens. A standard computer screen with a resolution of 1280 x 1024 shows 1,310,720 pixels, which is 1.25MB. Your Samsung Galaxy S10 can shoot videos at an even higher resolution of 3840 x 2160 pixels or UHD (ultra-high definition), where a full screen image needs 8,294,400 pixels or 7.9MB - more than six times as much. Even with compression, 30 frames per second adds up. To get some real numbers, I downloaded 4K Sample2.mp4 from the Samsung section of Ashok Patel's AppsLoveWorld website, which offers a few free mp4 video files for testing or demo purposes. If you just want to look at it, it's also on YouTube. It has been shot from a drone so perhaps not a phone, but either way, this 63-second video takes up 165MB. Reducing the resolution from 3840 x 2160 pixels (UHD) to 1280 x 720 (HD) cut the file size from 165MB to 24MB, so I could almost fit seven videos into the space previously occupied by one. And while it no longer filled my 4K screen, it still looked good quality to me. Aspect ratios Reducing the resolution of a video is an excellent way of cutting the file size, but may be detrimental in the long run. When reducing video resolutions, it is very important to keep the same aspect ratio (width to height). If you don't, clocks will no longer look round and faces will be distorted so they are either squashed or elongated like a Modigliani portrait. Here's a guide to the most common resolutions for people who can't divide 1024 by 576 in their heads. Today's most popular video format has a 16:9 aspect ratio, which is widescreen. This covers HD (1280 x 720), Full HD (1920 x 1080) and UHD (3840 x 2160). You can also use 1024 x 576, 1600 x 900, 2560 x 1440 and other resolutions while keeping the aspect ratio the same. Yesterday's most popular format had a 4:3 aspect ratio, which used to be the standard for TV sets and early monitors. You can convert these videos to and from 640 x 480 (VGA), 800 x 600 (SVGA), 960 x 720, 1024 x 768 (XGA), 1440 x 1080, 1600 x 1200 (UXGA) and 2048 x 1536. If you have a video with an odd aspect ratio, such as 16:10, then reprocess it to a popular widescreen width while keeping the height in proportion. Cutting data rates Changing the bitrate of a video can help reduce the file size without changing the resolution, but too low and you will drastically reduce the quality of the video. When you reduce the resolution of a video, it fills a smaller area, so you don't need to send the screen as much data. However, in some video editors, you can set the data rate to almost anything you like. This will reduce the image quality as well as the file size. Many people don't perceive or don't care about the difference in sound quality between mp3 music files at 128kbps instead of 256kbps or 320kbps. Similarly, many don't care if their videos run at 2-3Mbps instead of 20Mbps or more. In fact, movie-streaming websites may reduce the data rate from 10-20Mbps to 2-3Mbps because it saves a huge amount of bandwidth. When I converted the 4K sample above, HDVCF automatically reduced the original bit-rate of 21,722kbps to 3,346kbs, which is reasonable for the size. Any Video Converter reduced it to 996kbps, which was too much. I should have changed the quality setting from normal to high. Alternatively, I could have retained the original resolution and reduced the data rate to a not-too-shabby 8,000kbps. Doing this in HDVCF reduced the file size from 165MB to 61MB, with watchable results. Dropping it to 2,659kbps (I asked for 3,000) reduced the file size to 20.2MB while retaining the original resolution, but with poor results - too many visual artifacts. This approach works best with static subjects. A video of a talking head doesn't need as much bandwidth as an ice hockey game. Change the compression Switching to a more efficient compression system will save space, but may make sharing or playing back the video more difficult. One of the best ways to reduce the size of a file is to change the way it's compressed. Today's leading codecs, mainly H.264, are much more efficient than the ones typically used in old mpg, wmv (Windows Media Video) and avi files. Video transcoding programs usually take it for granted that you'll want to convert any old video into some form of MP4/H.264/AVC."

11,Challenges Faced by the IT Industry during COVID-19 Crisis,computers-technology," During this time of crisis data center operators are facing the same challenges as any other organization, staying open providing services while keeping staff and customers safe. As more people work remotely using digital communication tools and consume online entertainment, the demand on the global network and data center infrastructure is greater than ever; so is the importance of ensuring this infrastructure doesn’t fail. As the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) continues to develop, data centers play a critical role in maintaining a safe and secure digital infrastructure during this time of crisis. Data centers are also taking precautions in order to protect their employees, customers, facilities and mission-critical workloads; at the same time handling large amounts of traffic as more customers move their daily operations online and employees transition to remote work environments. In response to the current situation, as any other business data centers are also facing challenges like reducing foot traffic to their facilities, postponing non-critical maintenance and/or construction projects, complying with local restrictions, among many other measures to prevent the spread of the virus. It is a fact that because of the COVID-19 data centers are needed more than ever before as all businesses across the globe go virtual. Facilities must maintain fully operational as companies that rely on them, specially those in the medical areas, who can’t afford to go dark. So far, the network is stable and enduring all the amount of traffic is required from it. The premier adult hosting provider Host4Porn is actively monitoring the situation and all precautions that we take will not affect our capability to deliver robust and reliable services.

12,How COVID-19 Will Affect the IT Industry?,computers-technology," With this recent health crisis that affect us all, many are fearing a possible network failure that will add more tension to an already concerned population. China and Italy have been so far the most affected countries, and although many measures have been in place to try to contain the situation… the virus is spreading fast all around the world. Governments worldwide are implementing numerous actions like to make citizens stay at home in hopes of avoiding the disease to spread even more; but many are wondering if this particular situation could break the internet. Now, the amount of traffic on the network around the world has increase over the last months specially since this disease started hitting hard other countries outside of China; but certainly the systems have hold their ground and are not being overwhelmed so the risk of a imminent failure is minimum. Compare to the amount of traffic handle by ISP during big events like the Super Bowl or the Olympic Games, the network has been coping with the demand required so far. As the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) continues to develop and hit hard world powers and anything in between, data centers play a critical role in maintaining a safe and secure digital infrastructure during this time of crisis.

13,There Is A Lot To Consider When Setting Up A Private Medical Practice,computers-technology," Starting your own private medical practice can be an exciting venture, but there are a lot of things that you need to think about and sit down and plan for. Furthermore, unless you are independently wealth (unlikely) or come from a wealthy family (still unlikely), you are going to have to borrow a considerable amount of money in order to get started, so you need to budget very carefully. You don’t want to have to scrimp and scrape, yet by the same token you don’t want to borrow more than is necessary. Having said that, when you have calculated your budget, most experts would tell you to add on 10% to cover unforeseen expenses or miscellaneous fees or charges. Just to begin with, you need premises from which to operate, and once you have located a suitable site you are going to have to fit it out as a doctor’s surgery, which is almost certainly going to be very different from whatever the property was used for beforehand. Just doing that is going to cost a fair old chunk of money. Next you need to identify which costs will be one-time, which will be monthly, quarterly, and so on. This will help you to manage your budget better and get everything off the ground smoothly so that you don’t get caught out later on. In addition, you need to consider which costs are capital expenses and which may be variables for the practice. The precise costs for starting your practice will depend on a number of variables, not the least of which is the type of practice that you are starting. If you are starting a specialist practice you may need some items which are not required in a general practice, for instance. Another factor is the area of the country in which you are opening your practice, since rents in some parts are a lot less than others. Rents in London, Birmingham, Manchester, and other major cities are a lot more than somewhere like Swanage in Dorset or Bamburgh in Northumberland. You also need to get your timing right. If you get it wrong, the costs and charges can begin to escalate out of hand, and furthermore any delays in opening your practice will simply have an impact on your revenue stream, because there won’t be any until you do open. Even then, you have to advertise for patients, whether that is using social media or direct advertising. It takes time to build up a steady stream of patients coming through the door, and then you have to bill them and wait for payment, unless you set up an EFTPOS machine in the practice reception so that patients can pay before they leave. This would help to reduce the number of invoices that you would have to send out. Then there is the potentially very large investment in hardware and medical consultant software for your business. According to some experts, starting your business in the cloud can save a considerable amount. This cuts out a large investment in servers, hardware and IT support staff. It also cuts out many ongoing operational costs. Furthermore, you will always be using the very latest software, because cloud suppliers have to keep up to date with the latest technology or they would start to lose business. In effect, using the cloud, you are simply renting the services that you need. In addition, you are not paying for medical consultant software or systems that you may not use very much. Of course, another major cost that has to be taken into account is staffing. This will increase year on year, so anything that you can do to keep staff costs down is a help. Automating repetitive admin tasks can help you to save money, not just when you open for business, but ongoing. Setting up any sort of medical practice from scratch is going to be expensive, but when you consider your budget, it is best to overestimate rather than underestimate, since that way you won’t get caught out over something that costs more than you planned or that you hadn’t accounted for in the first place. If all goes well, you can cut down on your borrowing, but you can be confident that the money is there if it is needed."
14,How Blockchain can Help fight Climate Change and Save the Environment,computers-technology," If you haven’t noticed by now, negative and alarming news about climate change has been getting more and more frequent. If not every day, we get some kind of disconcerting news about climate change every single week now. The data that scientists have been using as a frame of reference for predicting the climate change has simply proven to be incompatible, as there are, and always were, thousands of factors that we can’t have realistically accounted for. This is precisely the reason why some of the changes that have been predicted to happen way far ahead into the future are already taking place today, way faster than predicted. This is one of the main reasons why such a large amount of mass hysteria is taking over the world. No matter race, gender, nationality or political alignment, it’s very hard to find someone who’ll argue against the fact that climate is definitely changing for the worst, and it’s changing fast. The amount of fires that have taken place only in 2019 is mind-blowing. Everyone is aware of what happened in Amazon and how long it took for the situation to come to a relative pacification. The size of the forest that was burned is absolutely mind-blowing, and so is the amount of damage to the environment that ensued. Beyond that, we had also witnessed one of the biggest fires in Australian history where over 1 billion animals died. To top it all off, there also were huge fires in Siberia, Russia, and it was so bad that they couldn’t even attempt to fight it until it reached the territories where it could be worked with. These fires, increasingly warm temperatures and melting ice all around the world is not a coincidence. It’s all connected to the changes that are a direct result of human interaction with the planet and its natural resources, as well as our technology and production processes that leave a very large carbon footprint. We’re directly responsible for every change that occurs due to our way of being, and it’s our duty to come up with solutions. With such an unexpected, unpredictable and unordinary turn of events, extraordinary and creative measures need to be taken and implemented to combat these changes. Blockchain technology has shown some great potential to become one of these extraordinary solutions to the problem. Blockchain, in recent times, has been discussed and regarded as one of the most potentially helpful technologies to combat and alleviate climate change. Let’s look at some of the specific ways it can be used for this purpose. How can Blockchain help increase efficiency? Today, even some of the most commonly used and far-reaching energy networks are extremely outdated, overly power-consuming and centralized. As the need for more energy and power increases, more power plants and other energy sources need to be built, while simultaneously working in harmony with the older ones. This leaves a lot of security flaws and opens up opportunities for cyber attacks. Broad implementation of blockchain technology would be ideal in this case. According to the Bitcoin Revolution team, an AI blockchain trading robot, the integration of blockchain in all sectors and fields will lead to an increased general level of efficiency and decreased carbon footprint. As an actual example, solar panels and wind turbines can be automatically harmonized with each other to balance and match their exact energy requirements at hand, leading to a scenario where no energy would be wasted. This will also provide some very accurate measuring tools for increased statistical analysis. The development of blockchain technologies, coupled with the advancements in the relevant computer software, can eventually lead to the point where AI can measure and determine exactly how efficient systems are in specific factors, after which it can make necessary adjustments as needed. With sophisticated AI technology like Google’s DeepMind, weather and wind turbine data may be used to predict energy generation reasonably accurately. As the world becomes increasingly more digitized and the demand for technological advancements naturally increases, it is exactly measures like these, like increased efficiency and optimization, that will play the biggest role in combating climate change and eliminating as much environmental damage as possible."

17,What is the Difference Between CNN and RNN?,computers-technology," In machine learning, each type of artificial neural network is tailored to certain tasks. This article will introduce two types of neural networks: convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN). Using popular Youtube videos and visual aids, we will explain the difference between CNN and RNN and how they are used in computer vision and natural language processing. What is the Difference Between CNN and RNN? The main difference between CNN and RNN is the ability to process temporal information or data that comes in sequences, such as a sentence for example. Moreover, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks are used for completely different purposes, and there are differences in the structures of the neural networks themselves to fit those different use cases. CNNs employ filters within convolutional layers to transform data. Whereas, RNNs reuse activation functions from other data points in the sequence to generate the next output in a series. While it is a frequently asked question, once you look at the structure of both neural networks and understand what they are used for, the difference between CNN and RNN will become clear. To begin, let’s take a look at CNNs and how they are used to interpret images. What is a Convolutional Neural Network? Convolutional neural networks are one of the most common types of neural networks used in computer vision to recognize objects and patterns in images. One of their defining traits is the use of filters within convolutional layers. Convolutional Layers CNNs have unique layers called convolutional layers which separate them from RNNs and other neural networks. Within a convolutional layer, the input is transformed before being passed to the next layer. A CNN transforms the data by using filters. What are Filters in Convolutional Neural Networks? A filter in a CNN is simply a matrix of randomized number values. The number of rows and columns in the filter can vary and is dependent on the use case and data being processed. Within a convolutional layer, there are a number of filters that move through an image. This process is referred to as convolving. The filter convolves the pixels of the image, changing their values before passing the data on to the next layer in the CNN. As the filter convolves through the image, the matrix of values in the filter line up with the pixel values of the image and the dot product of those values is taken. The filter moves, or convolves, through each matrix of pixels until all the pixels have been covered. The dot product of each calculation is then used as input for the next layer. Initially, the values in the filter are randomized. As a result, the first passes or convolutions act as a training phase and the initial output isn’t very useful. After each iteration, the CNN adjusts these values automatically using a loss function. As the training progresses, the CNN continuously adjusts the filters. By adjusting these filters, it is able to distinguish edges, curves, textures, and more patterns and features of the image. While this is an amazing feat, in order to implement loss functions, a CNN needs to be given examples of correct output in the form of labeled training data. When transfer learning can’t be applied, many convolutional neural networks require exorbitant amounts of labeled data. Where CNNs Fall Short CNNs are great at interpreting visual data and data that does not come in a sequence. However, they fail in interpreting temporal information such as videos (which are essentially a sequence of individual images) and blocks of text. Entity extraction in text is a great example of how data in different parts of a sequence can affect each other. With entities, the words that come before and after the entity in the sentence have a direct effect on how they are classified. In order to deal with temporal or sequential data, like sentences, we have to use algorithms that are designed to learn from past data and ‘future data’ in the sequence. Luckily, recurrent neural networks do just that. What is a Recurrent Neural Network? Recurrent neural networks are networks that are designed to interpret temporal or sequential information. RNNs use other data points in a sequence to make better predictions. They do this by taking in input and reusing the activations of previous nodes or later nodes in the sequence to influence the output. As mentioned previously, this is important in tasks like entity extraction. Take, for example, the following text: In the first sentence, Roosevelt should be labeled as a person entity. Whereas, in the second sentence it should be labeled as a street name or a location. Knowing these distinctions is not possible without taking into account the words before them, ""president,"" and after them, ""street"". RNNs for Autocorrect To dive a little deeper into how RNNs work, let’s look at how they could be used for autocorrect.  At a basic level, autocorrect systems take the word you’ve typed as input. Using that input, the system makes a prediction as to whether the spelling is correct or incorrect. If the word doesn’t match any words in the database, or doesn’t fit in the context of the sentence, the system then predicts what the correct word might be. Let’s visualize how this process could work with an RNN. The RNN would take in two sources of input. The first input is the letter you’ve typed. The second input would be the activation functions corresponding to the previous letters you typed. Let’s say you wanted to type ""network,"" but typed ""networc"" by mistake. The system takes in the activation functions of the previous letters ""networ"", and the current letter you’ve inputted ""c"". It then spits out ""k"" as the correct output for the last letter. This is just one simplified example of how RNN’s could work for spelling correction. Today, data scientists use RNNs to do much more incredible things. From generating text and captions for images to creating music and predicting stock market fluctuations, RNNs have endless potential use cases. Hopefully this brief introduction to CNNs and RNNs helped you understand the difference between the two neural networks. While the ability to process temporal or sequential data is one of the main distinctions, the structures of the networks themselves and their use cases are vastly different as well."
18,Alternative for a self-ordering kiosk at your restaurant,computers-technology," Self-ordering kiosks for restaurants have been on the rise over the past years. Especially for quick service restaurants, self-ordering kiosks have proven to be very effective. These self-ordering kiosks are convenient for guests of quick service restaurants. It’s a way for these guests to avoid having to wait in a line to order. However, self-ordering kiosks are not cheap. A self-ordering kiosk can cost your quick service restaurant more than $ 5.000 per kiosk. Next, there is also the space it takes in your restaurant. A self-ordering kiosk itself requires 10ft2. If it gets very busy, you even get lines for the self-ordering kiosk. What alternatives are there for a self-ordering kiosk? There are better, cheaper alternatives for a self-ordering kiosk in quick service restaurants. At Table Duck, we’ve developed a chatbot that can take orders and payments for restaurants. A guest can place an order via messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp and for you as a restaurant owner, it goes fully automatically. It uses the smartphone of the guest instead of physical hardware in your quick service restaurant and it can take orders for table service, delivery and pickup, all in one channel. Payments are handled in the chatbot via more than 10 national and international payment methods, including credit card, Apple Pay and PayPal. Learn more about how the chatbot works Data to improve guest experience in your quick service restaurant The beauty of using chatbots instead of self-ordering kiosks to take orders is also the collection of data. By using a chatbot, you can collect individual preferences of guests. It’s a 1-1 relationship you’re building. Next, you can easily send promotional messages, even if the guest is not in your quick service restaurant. ""It’s Friday night. Do you want to order pizza for delivery again?"" How convenient. Self-ordering kiosks for quick service restaurants have been a good first step in using more digital technology in restaurant. However, digital technology never stops to develop, so new ways and tools are coming."
19,7 Questions to Ask Before You Buy a Best Commercial Pressure Washer,computers-technology," 7 Questions to Ask Before You Buy a Best Commercial Pressure Washer Is the Supplier an Internet Only Operation? This is obvious with most any purchase, especially when buying expensive wash equipment. A company with a P.O. Box has very little investment. Where will they be tomorrow, come warranty time? You want to deal with a company that has experience, parts and service personnel. Before you buy, ask yourself the question: Will this company take care of my future needs? Does the System have a 12 Volt Burner? Before you buy, ask how the burner is powered. Yes, perhaps you will save money on the initial purchase of a 12 volt system, but you will need the money you saved for the future repairs! 12 volt units draw their power to run the burner system from the battery. The engines diodes recharge the battery. The problem is that the diodes do not generate enough amps to keep up with the burner. As a result the fan motor slows down and the heating coils soot up from the lack of air flow. This huge engineering problem creates a mess and requires the coils to be cleaned more often. Vibration, operator controls, elevation, engine RPM all affect the engine diodes and we have not seen any other system that is reliable! Get pressure wash equipment that has their own separate generators - producing 115 volts to power the burner system! Obviously a 115 volt system with its own generator has 10 times the voltage and therefore is 10 times more reliable in operation. The 12 Volt exception is if the burner has a belt driven alternator. Just like your with your car, the alternator will push about 65 AMPs to the burner system. More than enough electricity to drive the burner mechanism efficiently. Is the Equipment from a Franchised Dealer? Are franchised brands the best? Not necessarily! Often the big dealers use imported parts to cut costs making the machines more likely to have breakdowns. Not a good thing when your in the field. Most major brands are owned by foreign companies. Ask your local dealer where their equipment is manufactured? If it is made outside the United States, do you really want to buy a foreign made machine? Get a unit with components that are non-proprietary, meaning they are not private labeled. Non-proprietary components are readily available in the market, therefore you can obtain service and parts nearly anywhere, rather than being tied to a dealer. If it's not engineered for easy service - don't buy it! Most units are poorly engineered - they might look fancy, but what about changing oil on the motor and pump? Rebuilding a pump? Changing belts? Access to burners? etc. Every machine needs service! Beware of the poor engineering! Does the Equipment come with a Written Warranty? Ask your dealer for a written warranty. If they can't provide one or give you a verbal buyer beware. Is the Equipment the Right Size for my Needs? If you are using your Pressure Washer for heavy duty cleaning, say at a construction site, or most commercial applications, don't buy a light duty consumer pressure washer it just won't hold up. Make sure you purchase a best commercial pressure washer that will fit your needs and application. Is the Equipment Belt Driven? Belt drive pumps will last longer and perform better over the long haul. Direct drive pumps will eventually fail which usually require a full pump replacement. Direct drive pumps spin way faster which causes more wear and tear on the ceramic plungers etc. Is the Soap Injection Upstream or Downstream? A lot of equipment comes with upstream or high pressure soap. This may work fine in the short run but will cause issues with your pump ceramics much faster. The ceramic plungers degrade much faster when exposed to various types of chemicals. A high pressure system places the soap into the water before it hits your pump. Downstream introduces soap into the water after the water exits the burner. This is good because the soap will not have any adverse effect on your valuable equipment components. Do your home work! It will pay off in the long run. Visite pressurewashermachine.com  for more knowledge"
20,How Brand Image can Help Improve SEO,computers-technology," You may be wondering, what does branding have to do with Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)? If you are just getting started with SEO, it may seem like the focus is purely on keywords and link building to really improve your website’s ranking. However, your business’s branding and brand image can contribute and improve your SEO too. Remember that SEO is not something that can just be added to websites to rank, it is a core part of content creation and optimisation. Branding insinuates the same: it is a core foundation of your website and can dictate the meaning, mood, image and message of your business. Here are 5 ways Brand Image can Improve SEO Recognition A brand image is a powerful technique for business as it creates a recognisable and positive impression on consumers. There are many elements to branding but it all contributes to making a lasting impression, attracting customers and providing a particular experience. Not only this, but your brand will be focused within a niche market and strive to establish it as an expert in the field. Long tail keywords and LSI keywords allow Google to associate your brand name with certain keywords and related queries. Additionally, obtaining links from authoritative websites within the niche will strengthen your brands authority. Click Through Rates SEO is all about getting to the top spot on search engines, if not the top spot then the top page as click through rates are shown to dramatically decrease after page 1 of Google results. But, what if you make it to first page and still no traffic? This can be due to the high competition of recognisable brands. People are more likely to click on a brand name that they recognise as they trust the information they are providing. Therefore, building a brand image is important in order to gain traffic and be recognisable to your target audience. Backlinks Link building is a huge part of SEO as it establishes a connection between your website, authoritative websites and your niche. By maintaining a strong brand, your business will be recognisable to your competitors as well as other websites and attract more backlinks. Also, with a brand in place it gives your business a strong voice and image to build relationships and conduct email outreach. In addition to gaining links through branding, search engines also factor in brand mentions or implied links in search engine ranking factors. A strong and authoritative brand can be recognised and referenced or mentioned all over the internet including on social media, this can all contribute to websites SEO. Content Creation As established earlier, branding is not just about the logo but also determines the user experience and recognition on all of your content. So when creating content, you need to consider factors for both SEO and your readers. This is because search engines recognise the value of content, length, visuals and analyse the keywords, authority of the website and links. Therefore, your brand contributes to the content that you create, the way you communicate with your audience and therefore can also improve your website’s SEO. Branding provides consistency, focus and trust to both your audience and search engines. Social Media Brand image is exclusive to just your website, it needs to be seen across all platforms including social media sites. Although social media does not directly improve search engine ranking but can contribute to other ranking factors. Building a brand image that is relatable and popular on social media websites can lead to increased backlinks, engagement and shares. Social media profiles are also indexed by search engines and have the chance to be included in SERPs. Users also use social media sites in a similar way to search engines which makes your brand even more discoverable. Therefore, you need your brand to make an impression outside of your website too. In conclusion, SEO is not just about link building and adding keywords to optimise your website, it is also about your brand and the business you are building. A brand image makes an instant impression on your audience and other websites as it influences the user experience, content, keywords and overall SEO."

1,Get Machine Learning Training Data Using The Lionbridge Method [A How-To Guide],computers-technology," In the field of machine learning, training data preparation is one of the most important and time-consuming tasks. In fact, many data scientists claim that a large portion of data science is pre-processing and some studies have shown that the quality of your training data is more important than the type of algorithm you use. As a result, more and more companies like Lionbridge have entered the AI market to help serve this demand for training data. How do you Get Machine Learning Training Data? There are three main ways to get training data: Find open-source datasets online through websites like Kaggle, Google Dataset Search, or a dataset aggregator. Build the dataset yourself: collect/create the data and annotate it internally. Outsource data collection and annotation services from a training data provider. For personal projects or school assignments, sometimes open datasets can provide a sufficient amount of data for the tasks you need to complete. However, when building and training AI solutions for commercial purposes, open datasets are often not available for your use case or can’t be used for profit. Furthermore, sourcing and annotating your own training data in-house is often inefficient when you have thousands of pieces of data and just a handful of staff. This leaves us with the third option: outsourcing training data services. Machine Learning Training Data Services Lionbridge helps clients improve their models through a variety of machine learning training data services. Some of our core services include: Data Collection: speech/utterance data, handwritten data, chatbot training phrases Image & Video Annotation: bounding boxes, polygons, circles, lines, keypoints Text Annotation: sentiments, entities, entity linking, classification Audio Annotation: verbatim transcription, intelligent verbatim, audio classification Content Evaluation: ad evaluation, search evaluation, geo-local data evaluation Lionbridge AI: From Translation to Training Data At Lionbridge, we harness the expertise of our global community of data scientists, computational linguists, translators, and annotators to create high quality machine learning training data for a variety of use cases. With our expert community and all-in-one data annotation platform, we provide development teams with tailored training data solutions for their machine learning models. Why Translation Companies are Perfect for Data Annotation Why did we expand into AI? The reason is simple. We realized our global community is the perfect workforce for data annotation. For natural language processing (NLP) especially, professional linguists are the perfect annotators for entity extraction, search query classification, and other language-based annotation projects. After thorough testing and training, this same workforce is easily able to perform various image annotation tasks for computer vision. Now, for both NLP and computer vision, some of the world’s largest companies turn to Lionbridge for data annotation outsourcing. Our expertise in localization and linguistics enabled us with the tools, the knowledge, the contacts, and the workforce to provide training data services at scale. Does Quality Translation = Quality Training Data? Not necessarily. However, quality assurance processes in translation are incredibly similar to QA protocols for AI training data. For example, one of the QA processes for localization projects is editor review. With translation, we normally have one or multiple editors review a translator’s output. Similarly, with many of our AI projects we have multiple contributors annotate the same piece of data to check for agreement. A lot of the time, managing quality means managing contributors. We have numerous gates that your data must get through to ensure accuracy. At Lionbridge, our community guards each of those gates, making sure the end product matches your specifications. Managing Output With our community now at 1 million strong, as our network grows, we grow with it. We have numerous protocols in place to make sure each contributor is performing to the best of their ability. For example, we check for inter-annotator agreement to make sure that each annotation is accurate. This process also helps us verify that the data itself is clear and that the task is straightforward. For some projects, we’ve had up to five contributors annotate the same data. Furthermore, we can also implement self-agreement checks to ensure that each contributor is consistent with their work. A great example of QA for machine learning training data is our process for utterance/speech data collection: First, we have sound engineers make sure that each contributor said the phrase correctly. They make sure that the contributor hasn’t missed a word and that they speak in their natural tone of voice (as opposed to monotoned reading). Next, we send the audio files to native speakers of each language who review the sound clips according to the script. Lastly, we send the files for audio quality checks to make sure there is no noise within a certain threshold, among other criteria that the customer requested. These are just some of the QA measures we have in place, which are constantly being adjusted to match each project and improve our crowd. Data Quality is Subjective At the end of the day, we know that the definition of data quality is dependent on the project. ""When you speak of quality in terms of training data, there is no objective definition. It depends on what you are trying to do,"" says Cedric Wagrez (Lionbridge’s Director of AI Services for Japan). ""Quality is relative to your end goals and various factors, such as your KPIs, precision,  and tailored use case."" High quality machine learning training data is data that is collected, annotated, and calibrated in a way that helps you achieve your goal. At Lionbridge, we know that before we can start to manage quality, we first have to understand what it means to you. Trial Projects Before the project even begins, we provide you with a free consultation to explain the best ways to collect or annotate your data. Next, we run tests and a trial project to align with your expectations. Let’s say you have 10,000 pieces of data to be annotated. To ensure that we’re all on the same page, we would take the first 100 pieces of the data, set the project up in our system, and have our community label the data. If the end result is exactly how you imagined it to be, we then go ahead with the rest of the data. If there are things to be changed, we would recalibrate based on your feedback. It’s important to remember that quality data is not just about clear images and tight bounding boxes. The people you choose to label the data, the guidelines you give them, and the environment in which you collect the data all has to be taken into account. Data Collection and Annotation Tools for Text, Audio, Images & Video Have the workforce to label your data, but need a platform to label it on? We recently announced the release of our data annotation platform as a consumer product. Our engineering team and internal data scientists have built this state-of-the-art platform from the ground up. Our platform has a simple and seamless UX, allowing you to create quality training data, with a short learning curve. Furthermore, you can easily manage your project, monitor progress, and track worker statistics via the dashboard. Now, you and your team can label data internally through our intuitive annotation interface — no coding required! The AI industry is expected to add 15 trillion dollars to the world economy within the next 10 years. As the market continues to grow, so will the demand for training data. Thus, we will likely see more and companies like Lionbridge enter the machine learning training data industry. Whether you need 1000 or 1 million pieces of data, Lionbridge can help you construct the best training data solution.

5,Best Modem & Routers for Satellite Internet Connection,computers-technology," Satellite internet is so confusing, there are a lot of elements that go behind getting a satellite internet connection up and running. You need a lot of equipment for a satellite internet connection. Satellite dish (which is provided by your Satellite internet provider), Satellite Modem and satellite Router. The question that pops up is Which is the best Modem & router for Satellite internet connection. Satellite Internet Equipment Functions: Satellite Internet Dish: If you live in a rural area then you might have come across these ugly pieces of technology more than once. It is a dish that receives internet signals. Your satellite internet provider will provide you with it as well as install it Satellite Modem: The job of a modem is to translate the signals received from your ISP so that all the devices in your home can connect to the internet easily. Your ISP will most probably provide you with this as well. If they don’t you can always go out and buy one of your own! Be careful while choosing as it can be not compatible with your connection. Router: A router receives signals from a modem and then transmits in every direction to create a wireless internet network. Without a router, your devices can not connect to an internet connection. Do You Need Both Modem & Router for Your Business? You do need a modem for Satellite internet and the satellite internet service provider will lease rent it to you as a part of your internet plan. You need a modem to translate the signal you get from your ISP. However, if you wish to get better connectivity, you will need a Modem that is better in terms of connectivity and compatibility. Renting a router would cost you more in a year then buying it one time. What is the Best Modem for Satellite Internet? You don’t have to spend additional money on modems, people end up buying both Modems & routers. One thing you should know is that you won’t find a better compatible modem for your internet connection than the one provided by your internet service provider. As of now, there are only two companies that offer satellite internet connectivity, HughesNet & Viasat. Both of them offer almost the same type of modem to their users. The Modems have built-in Wifi routers in them. Modems you get from Viasat have more ports and give you better security options. Here’s a list of Specs of modem provided by both Satellite internet service providers. Band: 2.4 GHz & 5 GHz Protocol: 802.11 a/b/g/n Security: WPS, WEP & WPA Ethernet Ports: 4 Includes adapter for Viasat voice options Band: 2.4 GHz & 5 GHz Protocol: 802.11 a/b/g/n Security: WPS Ethernet Ports: 1 Best Router for HughesNet Satellite Internet HughesNet offers the HT2000W modem and wifi combined unit to its consumers. This unit will work just fine for most of the users but if you better connectivity and security options then you can choose from the below-mentioned options. Band: 2.4 GHz & 5 GHz Protocol: 802.11 ac Security: WPA/ WPA2 Ethernet Ports: 4 Antennas: 3 Band: 2.4 GHz & 5 GHz Protocol: 802.11 ac/ad Security: WPA/ WPA2 Ethernet Ports: 10 Antennas: 4 Best Router for Viasat Satellite Internet Viasat is widely available as a satellite internet service provider. You get more plans, better security options and more flexibility with Viasat. Although the case is the same here, you can use the same piece of technology offered by your satellite internet service provider. Viasat also doesn't publish the model no of the Modem + Router they offer but we’ve found few best Wifi routers for Viasat satellite internet. Band: 2.4 GHz & 5 GHz Protocol: 802.11 ac Security: WPA/ WPA2 Ethernet Ports: 4 Antennas: 3 Band: 2.4 GHz & 5 GHz Protocol: 802.11 ac/ad Security: WPA/ WPA2 Ethernet Ports: 10 Antennas: 4 Should I Rent or Buy the Modem? Most ISPs offer you to rent the modem and router at minimal costs. When you sit down and calculate, these modems and routers can cost you as much as a new modem and router during the time span of a year. When you talk about HughesNet and Viasat, both of them offer you a combo device of Modem and Routers. You should use the modem for the best compatibility but you can turn the router off if you want to use your own! You’d still have to pay a monthly fee for the modem even if you use your router. Normally we advise against using rented equipment but when it comes to the satellite internet connection, you should use the device you’ve got!"
6,Website Architecture: Things to know before starting your next website design project,computers-technology," Are you planning to develop a new website for your company or for the client of your agency?

At the end of the day, always create a website by keeping in mind the people and not for search engine bots."
7,Top Cybercrime Trends you need to be Aware of,computers-technology," Cybercrime is becoming a serious problem day after day and a study conducted by the concerned officials predicts that it will cost the world trillions of US Dollars in the upcoming years. The number can increase if we do not take cybersecurity measures seriously. But, there is nothing new in it as the cybercrime trends have helped us in knowing the range of attacks. Hence, we should know about the cybercrime trends of 2020 to keep ourselves updated. Nowadays, we often get to hear about how big organizations fall victim to data and security breaches. So, here are the details of the trends which were the headlines of the cyber-criminal news.  You can secure your network by deploying Norton Antivirus that can be installed via Norton.com/setup. 5 threats that may take over in 2020 Deepfakes It is a combination of two words and one of them is ""deep learning"" which means using artificial intelligence to enhance knowledge. The other word in the combination is ""fake"" which means some false or untrue. When these two words are merged together we get a combination which means scammers create fake images and sounds to implement a threat. This is done by using artificial intelligence so that seems to be real. Using this, they may also create video in which a speaker’s words are manipulated which affects his reputation negatively. Not only this, but they can also cover up a popular face onto someone else’s body. Use of synthetic identities This is a type of identity theft where a scammer tries his best to fabricate the identity of a person. He does so by merging the fake as well as actual details of a person and creates an illusion that it is someone real. By doing this, he may carry out some evil tasks on his behalf and accomplish what he desires. Misuse of AI Using this, cyber-criminals create programs that impersonate some of the behaviors of human beings. By using such programs, hackers fool people in such a way that they are bound to share their details. Moreover, they can insert bad data into the program through the use of Artificial Intelligence. Fake news on Social media Fake news, also known as disinformation means spreading of unauthentic content or stories on social media platforms. This news is specifically designed to instigate people on religious beliefs and because of this, they take a few unnecessary or harmful actions. These days, social media has become a platform from where people give voice to their opinions. But, hackers are misusing this platform to accomplish their evil goals. Challenges to 5G network As we all know that 5G is going to rule the digital world in the year 2020 but with this, it will give way to more cyber-crimes. It will be more difficult for businesses and the government to handle such a situation. There will be more attacks on the Internet of Things networks because it might lack security in terms of hardware and firmware. Conclusion Along with the aforementioned threats, we will get to witness vehicle cyber-attacks, cloud jacking, ransomware attacks, and more. On top of that, hackers may try to sell information regarding hospital networks and other such organizations. To fight with these originating threats to the world, an individual should navigate to norton.com/setup and download the desired antivirus protection from there."

10,ElcomSoft Phone Breaker now supports iOS 13.2 and macOS Catalina,computers-technology," Recently, Elcomsoft Phone Breaker has been updated to deliver a new iCloud downloading engine and low-level access to iCloud Drive data. Thanks to the new iCloud engine, the tool can download backups produced by devices running all versions of iOS up to iOS 13.2. The new and improved iCloud downloading engine, the new iCloud Drive analysis core and the many bug fixes make EPB a highly recommended update. The updated iCloud download engine is not only faster but significantly more robust. The newly implemented iCloud Drive structure analysis features enable access to files stored in secure iCloud Drive containers for users with multiple Apple devices running a mix of updated and outdated OS versions. Thanks to the new iCloud engine, version becomes the first and only on the market that can download iCloud backups produced by Apple devices running all versions of iOS up to the latest iOS 13.2. Elcomsoft Phone Breaker finalizes support for local (iTunes) backups produced by release versions of iOS 13.x. The Mac edition now fully supports the release version of macOS Catalina. The new and improved iCloud downloading engine, the new iCloud Drive analysis core and the many bug fixes make EPB a highly recommended update. Advanced iCloud Drive Structure Analysis In addition to the new iCloud engine, we have also improved support for iCloud Drive. Advanced iCloud Drive structure analysis is an optional feature allowing users to enable deep, low-level analysis of iCloud Drive secure containers. These secure containers may contain data produced by the OS, built-in and third-party apps, the latter storing stand-alone backups and synchronizing data. High-level, file and folder based access to iCloud Drive provides a safe and compatible way of extracting information in most cases. Changes to iCloud Drive API's seemingly do not matter; file and folder access only requires the use of the latest API. However, if the user has a mix of Apple devices running updated as well as outdated OS versions, some information may only be accessible to those particular devices due to legacy API's. Attempting to access iCloud Drive in those scenarios may return incomplete information. This is why we built advanced iCloud Drive structure analysis, and this is why we made the feature optional: high-level file and folder access is all you need in most circumstances, while low-level extraction will return the missing bits and pieces scattered around in legacy containers. Access to iCloud Drive low-level structures is severely limited and lacks any public API or documentation. Elcomsoft Phone Breaker becomes the first tool on the market to implement low-level access to iCloud Drive containers. Elcomsoft Phone Breaker is the most powerful iCloud analytic solution that is able to retrieve significantly more information from iCloud than competitors and even Apple. The updated iCloud engine enhances access to synchronized data as well, making access to synchronized categories significantly more robust. The importance of synchronized data is hard to underestimate as Apple pushes more and more information from device-specific backups into synchronized containers. Elcomsoft Phone Breaker offers extensive access to synchronized data categories, which includes information Apple does not provide to the law enforcement when presented a binding order. This includes the iCloud Keychain with all of the user's passwords, Health information featuring information about the user's physical activities such as steps and heartrate, Screen Time passwords and messages (SMS and iMessage). Also, the new build enables experts to download conversation histories, messages, media files, contact lists and metadata directly from the user's Microsoft Account. In addition to existing data, Elcomsoft Phone Breaker can extract metadata for files and conversation histories deleted within the last 30 days. For chats and media files purged from Skype servers, Elcomsoft Phone Breaker can obtain metadata such as the date and time, size, file name, sender, and chat name. Elcomsoft Phone Viewer was also updated to display Skype data. Elcomsoft Phone Breaker 9.40 is immediately available for Windows and macOS. The update is free of charge to all customers with currently valid licenses. Discounted renewal is available to customers whose maintenance plan has already expired."

13,An overview of Cloud 3d Print’s objectives,computers-technology," As 3d printing became more and more popular, there was a massive increase in the companies that began to offer 3d printing services. As of now, there are hundreds of companies operating worldwide that offer a variety of 3d printing solutions. As Cloud 3d Print’s team comes with years of experience in the 3d printing business, we have identified some core areas through which we can really add value to the 3d printing experience. Below is a short overview of the main objectives that the Cloud 3d Print software aims to achieve: Reducing failed prints and shortening printing times One of the main issues with 3d printing platforms is a rather turbulent and haphazard way in which they carry out the entire process. Improper bed level, a wrong Z-gap or an unclean print surface are some of the factors might lead to a failed print. Our team figured out that just by streamlining the entire process, these unwanted errors can be eliminated and that can drastically reduce the number of failed prints. Streamlining the process gives more predictability and easy repeatability of the entire process. This also translates into shorter printing times and cost-saving in the long run. After streamlining, it is essential that the entire process is monitored and tracked in real-time so that any issue or anomaly can be instantly detected. This allows the user to immediately halt the process thereby saving precious material resources along with time. For real-time monitoring, our team has chosen a simple yet effective computer vision technology. Creating a comprehensive management software After rigorous market research and project feasibility study, we found that software that could completely initiate, manage, prioritize and control all the important aspects of any 3d printing business was completely missing from the market. In other words, there was no software available that could act as a complete package and allowed the users to run their 3d printing operations in a holistic manner. This gave our team the impetus to develop a complete 3d printing management software much like the Windows operating system for computers. In our research phase, we did come across three software that were offering the same management platform as Cloud 3d Print. But a little bit of investigation revealed that their software packages and solutions were limited in utility and were based on open-source codes. The biggest issue with open-source software is that they tend to offer little to no customization options to the end-users. The users are always restricted in terms of the things they are able to accomplish with such software. To address this issue, the Cloud 3d Print team developed a novel infrastructure for the software. Furthermore, data transfer was completely optimized and it was ensured that the entire data transfer remains under the internal data structure. These basic changes have led us to develop a product that is tailored to produce fast, accurate, reliable results with ensured repeatability. Establishing ourselves as market leaders The Cloud 3d Print team members have really had a great deal of exposure to the 3d printing industry. This had led us to establish great business ties with the leading manufacturers, distributors, and customers. This allows us to attract a great amount of business from the market and extend our services in various domains. Here’s a brief overview regarding how Cloud 3d Print’s services are crucial and of much importance for the leading manufacturers, distributors, and customers today. For the manufactures: Most manufacturers put in a lot of resources and capital towards hardware development. However, much more needs to happen if manufacturers want to stay ahead of the curve and survive in the market. Customer satisfaction is one such core area that helps the manufacturers to move forward. Since customer satisfaction is almost always guided by customer experience, smart software that helps the user to efficiently execute and manage 3d printing goes a long way in achieving happy customers. Since manufacturers often lack the resources to develop state of the art software in house, they can always benefit from Cloud 3d Print and what it brings on the table. For the distributors: Distributors often depend on more customers for their profit. More customers mean that distributors can always sell more 3d printing accessories and parts to the consumers. Furthermore, since Cloud 3d Print allows to track and estimate the amount and types of materials required, distributors can have a better idea about which material is more in demand and can be sold to regular customers. In addition, distributors can always sell the Cloud 3d panel and earn more profit. For the customers: For the consumers, Cloud 3d Prints offers an enhanced 3d printing experience with lower costs. Whether you are a school teacher, run a 3d printing farm or business or just an enthusiast, Cloud 3d Print contains all that you need for an amazing 3d printing experience. With these core objectives in mind, Cloud 3d Print comes forth as a result of continuous iterative efforts by our team. With the kind of services the platform offers, it comes with the promise of adding considerable value to the market."
14,Inside Luxatia 4th World eSIM summit,computers-technology," Inside the 4th World eSIM Summit: Welcome to the future A few days ago, the future of the embedded SIM (eSIM) was presented at an important conference in Berlin, the 4th World eSIM Summit. Organised by Luxatia International, leaders of the eSIM world discussed the latest developments occurring in this very exciting field. From industry-leading manufacturer updates to security concerns and solutions, here is your inside guide to the 4th World eSIM Summit. eSIM updates from industry giants Earlier this year, Motorola announced the first eSIM-only smartphone called the RAZR 2020. This is the world’s first eSIM-only phone and thus, does not have a physical SIM slot. Having hit the US market last week priced at $1500, it has set the stage for other manufacturing giants to announce their commitment to eSIM technology. News at the summit, is that it looks very much like Nokia will launch their first eSIM-fitted smartwatch at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona later this month. Their holding company, HMD, has recently filed a patent for an eSIM-related feature called ‘SMILEY’, expected to be related to both their smartwatch and new smartphone. It will be interesting to see what other eSIM devices are launched over the next few weeks. MWC has now been cancelled due to coronavirus, however one would imagine that there will still be product launches. eSIM applications in the most unlikely of places On a positive note, the summit’s host city gave its attendees very good exposure to a real life eSIM application in the form of eScooters that were available to rent. All you had to do was download an App, and enter your credit card details and the number of the scooter that you had found. An eSIM in the scooter enabled it to be activated for the appropriate timescale and you were on your bike. The possibilities are endless. Equally interesting is that Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) will be shipping their new Defender shortly, with two eSIMS fitted into the model; one to control the telematics automation that is built into the car and the other for the infotainment system inside. Clearly it won’t be long before every new vehicle launched will have built-in communications as a connected car. And when low latency 5G service eventually becomes available, the driverless car will become a reality thanks to the eSIM. JLR are cleverly comparing the two eSIMs to the two halves of the brain: ""Like the brain, one side of the system looks after logical functions, while the other takes care of more creative tasks."" GSMA’s predictions for the next five years The GSM Association (GSMA) – which oversees eSIM standards and specifications – presented an array of research at the summit, indicating enormous growth in the field; 33% of the installed base of smartphones globally would have an eSIM in 2025, while in Europe, it is forecast that nearly half of all the 500 million smartphones being used in 2025 will have an eSIM fitted. In addition, the GSMA expects there to be around 3 billion Internet of Things (ioT) cellular connections by the same year, driven mainly by the Chinese market. eSIM growth raises security concerns However, a considerable amount of the discussion at the summit concerned the importance of KYC (‘Know Your Customer’) requirements for the global acceptance of eSIM technology. It is clear, in the long-term, that the regulators in most countries will not accept a situation where someone can buy and download a mobile service without any form of ID authentication of the person making the purchase. For this reason, the industry is working on various methods of ID verification. These are identical to the ones used by banks and involve ID scan submissions which are processed through automation. This kind of authentication can typically be done in a couple of hours, but times may shorten as methods of digital authentication are adopted. Central among a lot of the approaches for pure digital authentication is the Mobile Connect standard from the GSMA. The main players in the field are the eSIM manufacturers, including Thales, who have begun launching their own platforms for ID verification. Taking the approach of turning every set-back into an opportunity, it was suggested that if eSIM were able to make ID authentication easier then they could be used universally in other applications that require ID verification However, in some countries the requirements for security are being taken further. For example, Turkish regulation requires that the eSIM Subscription Manager (SM) is actually located in Turkey. If this stringent approach was adopted by many other countries it would severely slow down the roll out of eSIM services. GSMA eSIM specification in IoT or M2M applications Another common thread among the presentations at the 4th World eSIM Summit was the desire to start using the consumer GSMA eSIM specification in IoT or M2M applications. It is clear that the connectivity decision-making process when users purchase an ‘open market’-IoT device is very different from that for a ‘service provider’-supplied IoT device. In the former, it is the consumer that will choose the connectivity service. The most obvious thing holding this back are the limited User Interfaces (UI) present in IoT devices and the current requirement in the GSMA specifications for ‘user consent’. This prevents the user from simply scanning a QR code in the same way that they would for a smartphone. It seems generally accepted that the best way around this is to use a companion device (smartphone) to scan the QR code and communicate this through a Bluetooth-like technologyto the IoT device. Interestingly, a developer from Apple presented his work on Web Bluetooth using a light-weight OS called ZephyrOS, with the LPA split between the companion device and IoT device achieving this. Unfortunately, however, the current version of GSMA specification does not seem to support this. IoT SAFE Initiative Another widely discussed topic at the World eSIM Summit 2020 was the IoT SAFE initiative from the GSMA. This is a method for providing secure end-to-end communications in IoT applications using a SIM STK Applet. ARM presented their method of implementation on their ISIM platform, while Oracle reinforced the benefits of using Java to achieve this. This application is not specific to eSIM as it can be used on conventional removable SIMs and ISIMs. The next iteration of eSIM technology What was clear from the summit was that there is a battle going on with regards to the next iteration of eSIM technology – the integration of the eSIM functionality inside the actual System On a Chip (SoC) that contains the GSM modem. ARM are heavily promoting their ISIM solution based on their Kigen SIM OS, Deutsche Telekom (DT) have launched a light-weight integrated IoT solution called nuSIM, while the GSMA and ETSI are working out a standard. The nuSIM reduces the profile size down to 500 bytes, allowing the use of a smaller memory chip and providing a faster download. It would appear that a lot of industry players are supporting several approaches at the moment as both ARM and DT are claiming support from most of the big actors. It would appear that, in the end, it will come down to whatever ARM and Qualcomm are able to push, with Apple – perhaps – having a say. It should be interesting to see the demonstrations from the various players at MWC. Private LTE networks enabled by eSIMs It would appear that because of the ease of getting a license in some countries, there is a growing market for private LTE networks. It was agreed that eSIM technology would make it easier for users to register on these private networks. It was even suggested (perhaps wishful thinking) that if the eSIM could provide a ubiquitous ease of registration to private LTE networks, then these might start to replace WiFi networks. Upcoming events and more information All in all, the 4th World SIM Summit was a very informative and thought-provoking conference. Expectations are high for eSIM technology to progress further and there should be some planned product launches in the next few weeks in place of Mobile World Congress."

16,Automated Picking Systems,computers-technology," In assembling and client support industry, picking takes more labor and working hours than some other movement. Similar assignments, now and then with insignificant varieties, are rehashed day by day by a similar workforce, which lessens the benefit on account of the wastage of HR. Computerized picking frameworks were acquainted with counter this shortcoming. Four of the most well-known request picking procedures are Piece, Zone, Batch and Wave Picking. Robotized picking frameworks are incompletely kept an eye on and independent advancements that comprise of a similar basic strides of customary picking strategies, yet are increasingly precise, without the danger of human mistake. They are utilized in solidified, prepared, dairy, dessert shop, pet nourishment and pharmaceutical enterprises. The effect they have in any can be arranged into classifications: • Increased productivity: Unlike humans, robots do not get tired after working for long hours, do not work in shifts, do not need breaks and are relatively faster than humans in speed.  Automated picking systems are always communicating with the rest of the process. Automated picking systems significantly reduce the picking time hence increasing the production rate, which led to increased profits. • Establishment cost: It might appear that introducing a programmed picking framework is costly yet it costs far short of what you may think. The human workforce requires preparing in the underlying stages and time to turn into an individual from the framework to maintain a strategic distance from hinders brought about by human mistake. A solitary computerized picking framework can supplant whole human workforce and can begin working day in and day out just after establishment with no startling postponements. • Safety: Repeating the same task causes tiredness, which leads to mistakes and sometimes these mistakes come at a huge cost. Employees work near moving parts for example belts, chains, conveyors and gears and an unfortunate accident could lead to irreversible disability, loss of life and to a lawsuit, if the conditions do not meet the safety standards. Automated picking systems can either get worn out or damaged, both of which are either replaceable or repairable. Endangering human life is never an option. • Better utilization of resources: The workforce and time which was previously dedicated to picking and sorting items can now be utilized in an optimized way in other sections of the industry. Staff who previously did picking can now be trained to supervise the activity of the automated picking system. Since 1933, Chocolats Halba in Wallisellen, Switzerland, has been creating high-end Swiss chocolate. On holidays such as Easter and Christmas, the demand for chocolate delicacies increased at a rate that was hard to reach by the company. Before the installation of automated picking machines, chocolates were brought to the packing machine at a lagging rate of 70-80 pieces per minute. This delay reduced the efficiency of the entire plant. However, the rate escalated to more than 100pieces per minute after the installation of an automated picking machine by the Sigpack Systems called the Delta robot. The Delta robot was responsible for increasing the productivity of the entire plant and the company showed satisfaction on the investment cost spent on acquiring the automated packing robot, the Delta robot."
17,Industrial Robots and Cobots - Your future Co-Workers,computers-technology," The latest mechanical robots look like petting zoo versions of the tremendous machines found in various bleeding edge handling plants – small, beguiling and you can play with them. Regardless, don't be boggled by their cuddly appearance. They can change the way wherein individuals work with machines and upset the present market for current robots. The gigantic diverge from this new period of robots is that they don't have to work in shut off locales. Or maybe they can safely work close by and even collaborate with human workers. Subsequently, these machines are regularly called aggregate robots or ""cobots"". Totally motorizing a mechanical office isn't continually appealing because bleeding edge creating associations need flexibility to quickly change their systems for a collection of things and customisation. Or maybe, makers in such settings are continuously scanning for robotization with a human touch. This is the spot cobots can come in. Whether or not full automation with greater, faster mechanical robots is dynamically successful, cobots can empower creation lines to fabricate their yield while holding a degree of flexibility. Until further notification, cobots are used for unequivocal assignments. For example, cobots take up the bleak and dull task of making sure about all of the affixes a battery pack from the hands of their related individuals. Rather than replacing human livelihoods, cobots may make new openings in applications, in which their quality, continuation and precision is gotten together with human artfulness, flexibility and basic reasoning. A promising use is in mechanical social affair where various parts are consolidated in a last thing. Right now the collecting methodology, individuals despite everything do 90% of the endeavors. Later on, cobots will pick, spot and mount the portions, and the human master will settle and check the yield. Problematic advancement For mechanical robots, in any case, the peril of being displaced by cobots is extensively more veritable than for human workers. For now, offers of cobots structure under 5% of the market for present day robots, wherein two or three gigantic associations despite everything overpower. Regardless, we fight the mechanical innovation industry is prepared for dangerous headway by reasonably minimal new candidates. The inhabitant associations will all in all focus on standard, significant weight present day robots for tremendous volume gathering of vehicles, equipment or sustenance things. Regardless, these robots moreover overshoot the necessities of little and medium-sized firms that miss the mark on the advantages or authority to use such systems. Cobots, of course, can achieve things that aren't commonly significant for current customers of gigantic scope present day robots, yet which are charming to various customers. For instance, they can be moved around the creation line floor and adequately be refitted with grippers for new applications. Cobots are definitely not hard to course of action and change, particularly versatile, and can cooperate with individuals. Additionally, these capacities will be particularly critical as continuously new customers grasp cobots and find new uses for them. Our assessment on meanders aimlessly has demonstrated that the capacity of new headways is every now and again past what even their creators can envision. Collaborating: Widespread Robots As cobots' speed, exactness and ability to pass on significant weights continues improving in coming years, they will dynamically have the alternative to fight with traditional present day robots as there's a better than average chance that standard customers will start to grasp them as well. This speaks to an issue for the officeholder makers. Any similarity to ABB, Kuka and Fanuc have a next to no bit of the pie in cobots interestingly with the new members, for instance, Denmark's Universal Robots. This is in light of the fact that they are so used to considering the prerequisites of their present customers and it is all the more sincerely to understand the necessities of cobot's customers in the creating industry segment. In any case, they could get around this issue by rather checking out their own agents who starting at now use cobots to create mechanical robots. This would empower the officeholder firms to get some answers concerning rising customer needs and shield them from the best in class interference. While it is difficult to anticipate the future, it looks really possible that the ""social aptitudes"" of cobots will end up improving them more than the mechanical robots eventually. Right now they may emit an impression of being little ponies, yet one day cobots could transform into the versatile and astonishing work horses of the mechanical office."

1,How To Write A Great Blog Post With CareerSteering,computers-technology," Have you recently considered writing blogs? Maybe you’ve created your own website for your own company, and you want to give people advice on a specific topic. Maybe you are a freelance writer who works from home and might desire to take on blog writing to expand your available services. Regardless of what the case may be, you now wish to know how to write them like a pro. First, let me start off by saying that writing blogs is always a good idea. If you keep your blogs interesting, people will always come back to check for updates and new blogs. And customers who hire you will always circle back around and hire you again for more work. According to hubspot.com, approximately 77 percent of all internet users read blogs on a regular basis. And according to marketingprofs.com, an average of around 70 percent of consumers would rather learn about a company or brand from a blog post rather than an advertisement. Those statistics speak for themselves—blogs are needed for a strong internet presence, so if you work on the internet, it is a great idea to learn how to write amazing blog posts. The point of this blog here, ironically enough, is to teach you and help you write your own blog. Use these tips to write your own practice blogs and then compare them to popular blogs online—see how you measure up. This practice will help you to gain blog writing insights and help you see where you can improve. Select a Topic To begin writing a great blog, you need a topic that speaks to your target audience. This is completely up to you.  Whoever you are writing the blog post for will help you determine the topic to write about. So, that is your first step prior to even beginning the post writing process—again, choose a great topic for your target audience. Opinion Post Vs. Research-Driven Posts Some blog posts might be truly off the top of your head. These are called opinion posts. Opinion posts are 100% filled with your thoughts and your thoughts only. That is fine, but if you happen to be writing on a specific topic that requires evidence, you must do research on that topic. Invest time and source a few web pages worth of vital information that you like and pertain to your topic; then extract the pieces of information that you need for your blog in support of your point/topic. Remember, do not plagiarize. You are simply learning something, and then relaying the information to others through the blog post. Besides, the internet bots have gotten pretty savvy at picking up on duplicate posts and plagiarism. Just don’t do it. Create A Title People want to be captivated. Always think of a title that makes you want to click on the web page. Don’t just create a random title. Also, don’t use ‘clickbait’ to gain traffic. You will attract traffic that is not interested in what you are writing about and your bounce rate will go up, making your post less relevant in Google’s eyes—which means bad rankings. Write your post Time to write your post. Remember, same as with the title of your blog post, make the intro to your blog post captivating to the people who will come across it. No one likes to be bored. Another thing to note is that you need to have a structure for your blog post, just like any other form of writing. The main structure for a blog post is relatively simple. It should go look something like this: Introduction. About two to three paragraphs explaining to your visitor what they are about to read and what they are about to learn. Body. This is where your research and main topic come in. Here, in the body, you will write a few paragraphs sharing what you wish the readers to know and learn. Conclusion. This is where you wrap everything up. You’ve got your point across, and you have said everything that you felt needed to be said within your blog post—and you’ve said it nicely. Great job! So now you send your readers off with their newfound information and hope that they put it to good use! Add Pictures and Links You should always add pictures or links to your blog posts. People like to see eye-grabbing visuals. Also, add on-topic links to other blogs and videos as well. This will make your blog post better all around; it will boost the amount of traffic flow to your site as well. By the way, search engines love this too! Proofread Take some time to read over your work a few times. You might be surprised at the tiny errors you did not catch as you were furiously smacking your fingertips against the keyboard."
2,Implement full support for NTFS file systems on Mac,computers-technology," Apple has long been criticized for vendor lock-in thanks to its very limited support for other operating systems and software which hasn't been designed for it. The very limited support macOS provides for the NTFS file system is perhaps one of the most glaring examples. Yet as the default file system for all Windows computers from Windows 2000 right up to the current Windows 10, NTFS is by far the most common digital storage format. It's the industry standard in consumer and business computing. Even if you're exclusively an Apple user, chances are you've encountered external drives like USB flash disks, which have been formatted in Windows with the NTFS file system. But when you try to connect the drive to your Mac, you'll be unable to do much. While macOS does allow you to ready data on NTFS drives, but not much more. If you want to edit the contents of the drive, such as by saving or changing a document stored on it, your only option is to reformat it and start from scratch. Tuxera has developed a solution that makes that unnecessary. As formatting is hardly a desirable option, given that it means deleting all the data on the drive, Tuxera NTFS brings full native-like support for the file system to your Mac. This helps you overcome the serious interoperability problem and work with NTFS drives just as you would with those originally formatted for macOS. It lets you use the drives just like you do with the proprietary Apple File System, and there is no difference between functionality. Also, the instantly familiar user interface makes it easy to forget you're running additional software, since it integrates seamlessly with the file explorer. It provides a rich set of features as well, with an easy setup process and full support for NTFS drives which are divided into multiple partitions. Users can enjoy complete control and protection over their data. The current version works with every version of macOS, as well as its predecessors from OS X 10.4. Tuxera greatly expands on the limited capabilities of other solutions. It even lets you use features specific to the NTFS file system, such as the extended file attributes, data encryption, and virtualization. Now you can enjoy the full capabilities of the world's most popular file system without even having to use Windows! As a plug and play solution, it does not demand any learning curve or familiarizing yourself with any commands or complex documentation. It's designed with both casual and advanced users in mind. Whether you're trying to access some files on a pen drive a friend lent you, or you regularly use both Windows and Apple devices at home or work, Tuxera NTFS for Mac will no doubt become an invaluable tool. There is also a disk utility app included, which helps you manage logical partitions on your NTFS drives just as you would in Windows. From the moment you install the program, you can start browsing, opening, editing, and saving files on your NTFS storage devices with ease. Do everything with Windows drives on you Mac starting now at the official website."
3,How Cloud Management Values Change Your Business,computers-technology," There’s something about every successful company that makes it successful. If your company has been in business for several years and you’re generating a profit, chances are good that you have some core competencies or skills and abilities that help you stand out from the competition. In order to continue being successful you have to focus on the things that make your company great, while working to expand upon those abilities further. One of the best ways to do this is with technology. With technology you can manage cases more effectively, get more done and really maximize those competencies. Maximize Your Biggest Asset In law it’s important to have qualified secretaries, and to have a high quality information network available to you, but the most important asset you have is your knowledge and expertise. Each time you waste time doing some administrative task you’re taking away from your biggest asset. You are squandering your knowledge on a task that isn’t maximizing it fully. That’s why you can enhance your assets or make the most of them when you have the technology you need to get the job done effectively. Technology can help you share information faster. IT can help you put together case files in less time, and help you keep your research with you wherever you go. With the right technological tools you’ll spend more time thinking, planning and building on your successful cases, and less time working on tasks that don’t play to your strengths. Manage Your Time More Effectively Time management is a mixture of prioritizing tasks; knowing when to outsource work and learning new techniques that let you get more done in the same amount of time. Imagine that you’re a farmer and you have to plow and plant a 100 acre field. This is no small undertaking, and tackling the job with a simple hoe and bags of seed probably isn’t the way to get the job done. In order to complete the task you’ll have to rely on heavy machinery, you’ll likely hire off some of the work to employees, and you might have to decide to skip some less-important tasks like trying to maintain the beauty of your field during the process. It’s the same when working as a lawyer. When you’ve got a long list of clients to serve or you want time to develop a long list of clients you have to learn how to get things done more effectively. Adding cloud based law practice and other advanced tools to the mix help you outsource tasks more effectively, it allows you to get through standard tasks in less time and it even helps you cut out some of those unnecessary tasks along the way. Earn More Money Businesses thrive on the money that they bring in. Earning more money will let your company expand further, it will allow your business to improve its services and to help more people overall. Whatever core competencies your business has, that’s what earning you money. By growing those competencies to include impressive management technologies, and dedicating more time to your legal skills you can bring in new clients, win projects more consistently and really improve the business overall. By adopting cloud computing for lawyers technology you can enhance what makes your company great, cut out all the muddle that’s holding you back and really further your business. It’s not a difficult task, but the move will require some adjustments to be made. In the end all the hard work of adopting new technologies will pay off with you getting a more effective business, earning more money and being happier with the company that you have overall."

5,Why You Must Be Making Use Of a Drawing Tablet,computers-technology," If you have actually ever had a huge image-retouching project, working with a mouse normally makes it a less-than-precise and also laborious venture. After years of experience using a mouse, I have refined my capability to make use of a computer mouse to modify pictures. Nonetheless, there are better devices than mice available to make your image modifying quicker, simpler deal with noticeably much better outcomes. Working with a mouse can be tedious since your wrist is flat, and also you can just work making use of unrefined dragging activities that involve your entire hand. Generally, a computer mouse is inaccurate and clunky in your hand, and after prolonged usage, your hand will start to constrain. A computer mouse is fine for surfing the internet, scrolling, or doing simple work, yet a drawing tablet computer allows you to complete more detail-intensive much more conveniently. An attracting tablet normally comes with a stylus pen, which is closely pertaining to a pen in shape. They are usually much easier as well as much more comfy to keep in your hand than a computer mouse, and also they enable an amazing degree of accuracy in your job. Wacom tablets have up to 2400 various levels of stress sensitivity. Computer mice only have 2 degrees of stress level of sensitivity; clicked or otherwise clicked. This provides tablets a massive benefit over mice, especially for detail-oriented image editing and enhancing. When utilizing Photoshop, the stress sensitivity puts on your brushes also. This makes it a lot less complicated to blend colors, add effects, and apply retouching methods. With a stylus, you can turn the pen, and also move your hand as well as wrist right into a natural drawing setting. This allows you to have far more control over the strokes that you make.

6,5 Computer Vision Companies to Follow in 2020,computers-technology," Computer vision technology is the poster child of artificial intelligence. It is the sector of the industry that gets the most media attention because of the tools and benefits the technology can provide. From autonomous vehicles and drones to cancer detection and augmented reality, technologies that once only existed in science fiction are now at our doorstep. However, none of them would be possible without the companies that built them. This list will cover 5 computer vision companies to follow in 2020. While these companies operate in different industries, all of them build or help build the computer vision technology rapidly changing our world today. 1.Athena Security Location: Austin, Texas Industry: Security and Surveillance In 2019, there were a total of 417 mass shootings in the United States alone. While law enforcement does their best to protect their citizens, improving standards for surveillance and security could help create a safer society. Athena Security provides an AI surveillance system that uses computer vision technology to detect guns, knives, and other weapons in real time. Once detected, the system can alert security or inform law enforcement of the threat immediately. Athena Security already has around 1000 cameras actively guarding numerous schools, religious institutions, and businesses around the world. The company raised $5.5 million in seed funding in mid 2019 and hopes to help prevent gun-related crimes in the United States. Sample of Lionbridge's Image Annotation Platform Location: Waltham, Massachusetts (headquarters) with offices worldwide Industry: Computer Vision Training Data From autonomous vehicles to face recognition apps, computer vision tech wouldn’t be possible without high-quality training data. Lionbridge is the sole provider of AI training data for some of the world’s largest computer vision companies. With an internal team of data scientists, and a community of over 1 million contributors, Lionbridge provides various crowdsourced data annotation services. Lionbridge’s services are used to create computer vision training data at scale to build and train industry-leading AI models. They are also well known for providing ad hoc on-site data collection services for Fortune 500 companies. 2019 was a good year for the company, beginning with the acquisition of Gengo AI and ending with the announcement of a major contract with the Canadian government. Furthermore, they were named the 2nd largest language services provider (LSP)  in the world as well as one of Forbes Top 500 Large Employers of America. In early 2020, Lionbridge is set to release an all-in-one data annotation platform for images, audio, video, and text. Location: West Lafayette, Indiana Industry: Visual Search, 3D Printing The widespread use of the Internet and the advent of the Google search engine changed the way people search for information. Similarly, breakthroughs in natural language processing has led to greater voice recognition technology, which in turn has led to increased use of voice search. According to Quoracreative, 40% of adults now use voice search daily. However, with increased access to image data and the increase of computer vision companies entering the AI market, visual search could be the way of the future. Owned by Imaginestics, VizSeek is a visual search engine that could revolutionize the ecommerce, manufacturing, and engineering industries. VizSeek allows customers to search for products or parts in a database by simply taking a picture or even drawing a sketch. In December of 2019, the company received a 1.5 million dollar grant through the United States Air Force. Imaginestics will use VizSeek in the creation of an Additive Manufacturing Advisory System for the Air Force. Location: Menlo Park, California Industry: Virtual Reality (VR) Gaming Oculus is the company behind the famous Oculus Rift, one of the first-ever VR gaming devices. However, when competition in the VR industry grew, devices like the HTC Vive, PlayStation VR, and Microsoft HoloLens took up large portions of the market. In March of 2014, Oculus was acquired by Facebook giving them more resources to compete against the likes of Microsoft, HTC, and Sony. 2020 is looking to be a very big year for Oculus. In December of 2019, the company announced the release of hand tracking capabilities for their VR headsets. Oculus VR headsets, such as the Quest or Rift S, can now use built-in cameras to track the player’s hands. Essentially, the player’s hands become the controller, eliminating the need for traditional controllers altogether. With more updates to come in 2020, superior hand tracking could thrust Oculus far ahead of the competition. Location: La Jolla, California Industry: Medical Imaging One of the most promising and important use cases for computer vision technology is improving radiology. To become an expert in radiology takes years of study and practice. As a result, lesser-developed countries have poor access to proper medical care. For example, in Nigeria there are less than 60 radiologists for a total of 190 million people. Furthermore, even in countries that have a sufficient amount of radiologists, false negatives still occur. Specifically, Mammogram screenings have an overall 20% error rate. This means that with traditional mammogram screenings, 1 in 5 cases of breast cancer can go undetected. CureMetrix hopes to use computer vision for medical images to help solve these problems. The company utilizes computer vision technology to build their state-of-the-art Computer Aided Detection (CAD) software, cmTriage. CureMetrix is building this software to aid radiologists in mammogram evaluation, thus reducing healthcare costs and improving standards of care. In 2019, the company received FDA clearance for cmTriage and has drawn more and more attention from both the press and clinicians around the world. Interest and investment in artificial intelligence is on the rise. Therefore, we’ll likely see more and more innovation in the field of computer vision. Above were just five computer vision companies that show potential for large growth in 2020.

7,Why do you need SEO?,computers-technology," Everyone wants traffic and sales. Simple. However, not everyone knows what it takes to actually succeed in that. Do you? As with everything in life and digital marketing, there isn’t one legitimate solution to everything. It may be tempting to reach for the shiny and promising marketing tools like Search Engine Optimization, but first and foremost you should start with the ""Why"". Why do you want to implement SEO on your website? Define what are your business goals, and only then you’ll know which channels it will take to reach them. ""Why do need SEO?"" ""Well, you should know, right? Rank high in Google."" ""OK. Why do you want to rank high in Google?"" ""To get more traffic to my site."" ""Uh-huh. And why do you want more traffic?"" ""Duh. To get more sales, obviously."" ""Right. Now we’re talking!"" When we talk about Search Engine Optimization, there are a lot of assumptions, leading people to think that it will automatically increase sales. However, that may not always be the case. ""SEO""or any other channel alone isn’t The Holy Grail of digital marketing. What if your landing page design is sloppy? What if your content doesn’t appeal to your visitors? Or your checkout process is too challenging? What if people aren’t just ready to buy from you yet, and you don’t set up any retargeting or follow-up through marketing automation? There are a lot of ""what if"" questions you should consider before reaching for SEO to get more traffic, leads and ultimately sales. To fundamentally define how it will be possible for you to reach a certain target, you should consider all aspects that go into the making of that goal. SEO is just one out of the many digital marketing tools. Surely, it can have a great impact on increasing traffic and generate sales. Nevertheless, in the end, it’s not about the tools. It’s about reaching goals. How do we work? We like to know our customers’ ambitions, and then pick the right mix of tools to help them get there. Once the sales or leads start coming in, or whatever goals they set are being achieved, they often couldn’t care less about the tools used."
8,Long-tail Keywords- Why You Need to Focus on Them?,computers-technology," Keywords can be either short-tail or  long-tail. Short keywords or keyphrases, often referred to as head words come  with generic meaning like, ""men’s dress"", ""online furniture"", etc. As long-tail  keywords are longer and specific, they are used to show a particular concept,  such as ""cheap women’s shoes"", ""jungle safari in India"", ""affordable resorts in  Bali"" and more. People who are new into SEO are  unfamiliar with the long-tail keywords concept and fail to understand what  potential these phrases hold. Once an expert finds out what long-tail keywords  can help online businesses, there is no turning back. If you want your business  to flourish, ask your hired professionals offering SEO consultant services in London to have a good understanding of  long-tail keywords benefits and tap into it. Take a look at their hidden  capabilities. Less competition The longer the keyword is, the lesser sites you will get  to match it. Thus, it is less competitive in nature, making it easier to  achieve high rank in the search engines. Instead of trying to fetch a rank for  ""men’s clothes"", it is easier to get ranks for ""French designer men’s clothes"".  The latter has the ability to appear in the top 10. Real traffic A single long-tail keyword is not enough to get you plenty  of keywords, but do not forget that long-tail can work like wonders. If ""men’s  dress"" and ""designer dress"" are the main head words, these can be extended to  different long-tail keywords, and altogether, it leads to almost thirty-five  per cent of traffic or maybe more. Better targetted traffic Keywords are used to describe a  particular trait or feature of an object. The better it describes a product or  services, the chances of finding the product or services increase. The visitors  may end up on your business website typing the long keyphrases that you are  targetting. Better conversion rates There are users who search on the  Internet using specific terms rather than generic terms. Normally, long-tails  fetch in more and more visitors who get convert into leads. Hence, investing in  long-tail keywords is a surefire way to get ROI. Long-tail keywords include short-tail keywords In long-tail keywords, you will  already find short keyphrases. For instance, ""Gucci designer women’s purse""  already has ""women’s purse"" nuclear term in it. In this way, you can target a  wider base of audience. Easier to optimise It becomes easier to do on-page optimisation if you are  settling for long-tail keywords. This is because you do not need plenty of  long-tail key phrases on a page, just a couple of them is enough. Rather than  incorporating several short phrases on a page, you can go for a few long  phrases, improving user experience and conversions. Suitable for PPC Many SEO consultants would say that long-tails are mostly  used for PPC.  In Pay Per Click, you need  to pay each time when an individual clicks on your ad. If you bid on generic  terms, you will have fewer click-through rates and fewer conversions, which  will lead to money wastage on ill-targetted traffic. Once, you start bidding on  specific terms that describe your product or services in a better way, you are  likely to grab the eyeballs of the right visitors to your website. Long-tails beat personalisation Nowadays, search results are  getting personalised. It is becoming custom-tailored to a user’s sex, age,  location, interest and more. People searching for one or the same keyword may  see various search results on the Internet. However, with the help of long-tail  keywords, you can optimise the website for different users. For example, you  can have separate pages for ""designer women’s purse"" or ""designer men’s shoes"",  so that visitors know which page is suitable for them. As you can see there are plenty of reasons to  optimise your website for long key phrases. The mistakes that novices do is  avoid these phrases and miss out some of the best SEO opportunities. Now that  you know how useful these keywords are, take them into heed and put them into  action."
9,Manga Rock Shuts Down Due to Piracy and Starts MR Comics,computers-technology," Recently, I was looking for places where I could read the Your Name manga online. I came upon one of the most famous manga sites and manga apps in the world, Manga Rock. Unfortunately, the company has closed down. Manga Rock online and the Manga Rock APK on the android and iOS app stores have been taken down. Like me, you’re probably wondering why and the answer is piracy. ""There’s no excuse for the negative impact aggregator sites like ourselves have created for the comic industry and creators,"" says Manga Rock. The company has admitted their faults in full and genuinely wants to right their wrongs. Only, they are not simply taking down their site and app, they are completely rebranding and recreating their company from the ground up. Via their new brand, MR Comics, the company plans to create a new platform. This platform aims to make comics accessible to fans all over the world. With over 10 years of experience building tech and catering to manga fans, the company shows great promise. Numerous Youtube commentators have already expressed their support. Creating a Netflix for Manga Everyone loves manga, but are people willing to pay for it? The answer seems to be yes. One user named Adishnu asks ""Can’t you make it like a Netflix for manga? One [fee] and unlimited reading, but like affordable? [Because] I wouldn’t mind paying that small amount, as long as I [can] keep reading."" Adishnu brings up a good point, one that I’ve been wondering for a long time. Why doesn’t someone come out with a Netflix for manga? After all, streaming services like Netflix have significantly cut down movie and television piracy. It’s easy to believe that a similar platform would do the same thing for manga. Youtube commentators have shown almost universal support for such a platform. However, it’s likely easier said than done. There are copyright laws in place that may be different per country or per company. One huge benefit MR Comics advertises is tools for creators. The company plans to provide creators and publishers with AI-assisted tools to help them with their work. Until the platform takes off, however, we will have to read manga the standard way: buying them in stores or online."
10,5 Best Image Annotation Companies for Big Data Outsourcing,computers-technology," Need annotated image data to train your model? As you may know, sourcing the raw data is only half the battle. However, like many development teams, you may not have the time nor the workforce to annotate the data in-house. In such cases, outsourcing image annotation services is often the most efficient option. To help you find the perfect annotation solution, this list will introduce five of the best image annotation companies for big data outsourcing. While some of the companies below offer a variety of services, all of them provide image annotation services for machine learning projects. What are the Best Image Annotation Companies for Big Data Outsourcing? With over 20 years of experience, Lionbridge is one of the largest language services providers in the world. They are an industry leader in entity annotation, sentiment classification, multilingual transcription, and more. By acquiring Gengo AI in 2019, the company branched into all areas of data collection and annotation for machine learning, with added investment in state-of-the-art image annotation tools. They have since landed major projects with some of the world’s largest tech companies. Lionbridge’s image annotation services include: 2D Bounding Boxes Cuboids (3D Bounding Boxes) Polygons Landmark Annotation (Keypoint Annotation) Lines Circles Image Classification Semantic Segmentation Image Transcription With a community of over 1 million contributors worldwide, Lionbridge is a go-to company for big data outsourcing. Furthermore, the company is set to release an all-in-one data annotation platform in mid 2020. The tool will be capable of supporting various types of image, video, audio, and text annotation. With this platform, project managers can invite their own annotators, create projects with multiple annotation types, and track worker statistics. Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is an online platform where you can outsource jobs, surveys, and more to individuals all over the world.

12,Is it Time to Switch from Shared Hosting to VPS?,computers-technology," What’s the difference between shared hosting vs. VPS? If you’re just building your first website, or even if you’ve had one for years, you may not understand how it all works. Hosting seems to be one of those things that people know they need, but they don’t actually understand why. It’s easy to see how it could all get confusing if you don’t have a background in tech – at first glance, all of the different hosting plans look pretty much the same. But here’s our expert tip for the day: if you’ve been using a shared hosting plan just because it was the easiest option, it may be time to switch to VPS. Here’s why: What’s the difference between shared hosting and VPS? Let’s start with the basics. Many first-time website owners start with a shared hosting plan. Why? Because it’s almost always the cheapest option and using it doesn’t require any specific knowledge of the capabilities of shared hosting vs VPS. Shared hosting is when one physical server machine hosts anywhere from two to hundreds of different websites, all in the same space. All of the sites share the server’s resources (including storage and bandwidth) in a sort of first-come-first-serve fashion. That means that if any one site on the server has a particularly large surge in traffic or runs a lot of large graphics or apps, it will likely use up more than its fair share of the resources, negatively affecting everyone else. How is VPS different? Well, like shared hosting, many different users all share one physical machine. But unlike shared hosting, each site is allotted its own share of the data and bandwidth that no one else can touch. In effect, the server is partitioned into dozens of different compartments, and each one operates individually from all the rest – sort of like a mini dedicated server. Why should you switch to VPS? There are lots of different reasons people choose to make the switch from shared hosting to VPS. More often than not, it’s simply because their website has outgrown their hosting plan. Do you think you’re in that same boat? Here’s how to tell: Your website has been lagging. Are users regularly complaining of slow load times or of elements (like videos or graphics) not functioning correctly? Shared hosting often results in some, or all, of the hosted websites running slowly or even crashing. Too much overload could even cause the whole server to crash, causing costly downtime for everyone involved. You’re expecting a jump in traffic. Often, when websites are just starting out, traffic is low and slow. Shared hosting is fine in instances where the site doesn’t receive much traffic or is something super simple, like a static blog. But if you’ve been in business for a while and your fanbase is growing, that increase in website traffic might mean it’s time to switch to VPS. Making the move before things get too busy will help avoid unnecessary downtimes or service interruptions. Your site requires more security. Some businesses, like those that collect credit card information from customers, are just more sensitive by nature. A breach in security could be a huge embarrassment – and a huge liability – to you. Shared hosting, of course, is not the most secure environment. Because there is no separation between your site and the others that share your space, any virus or malware that affects their sites can also affect yours. Likewise, if a malicious user gains access to any one of the other hosted sites, he can also gain access to yours. VPS, however, is inherently more secure. Because your site is virtually separated from all the others, it is much more difficult for malicious users or harmful viruses acquired by the others to affect your site or its performance. You want root access. If you have a little more tech knowledge than the average user and you’d like more control over your own site, VPS is the way to go. Unlike a shared hosting environment, VPS allows you to install custom software, configure the server to suit your specific needs, and even run multiple operating systems if you want to. Bottom Line When it comes to shared hosting vs. VPS, we think VPS is the clear winner for many small business owners. If you’d like your business to thrive and grow, you need a website that can keep up. VPS ensures that you have the resources to make that happen."
13,Is Shared Hosting Right for My Business?,computers-technology," In today’s fast-paced world of internet business, many people realize that they must have an online presence to survive. To that end, many people starting out online are not sure if a shared hosting is the right choice for them or if they should choose another package such as a VPS or dedicated server. If you are running a small business and you have decided to take the plunge and set up a website, here’s what you need to know when you decide what type of server you will need. First, a Warning Before we begin, let’s talk about what you should absolutely, positively avoid. Many hosting providers are trying to draw people in with offers of ""Free Hosting."" First, it’s not really free. Many of these come with hidden fees or long-term contracts that will wind up costing you more in the long run. Secondly, they are generally the lowest tier/sub-standard when it comes to quality. And finally, if you are not really sure how to run a website, you will not be well served here because you won’t be able to count on technical support. In this case, let the buyer beware. Shared Hosting With a shared system, your website and its data will be placed on a server along with other websites that have paid for your same level of service. All of you will have access to the resources on that server, but it’s not going to be a fifty/fifty split. Instead, the resources will be used up as needed by all of the websites. So, if a website has a huge run on traffic and eats up a lot of bandwidth, then your website will probably suffer by slowing down significantly. Additionally, if you are planning to run an e-commerce website that needs encrypted data to protect your customers’ information, then you should not choose a shared host. These are not as secure as some of the other options. Really, a shared hosting is great for personal websites or for companies that just want to dip a toe into the waters and get some online presence. But when you are ready to dive in, you are going to need to look at the upper tiers. Virtual Private Server The next level that you should look at is a VPS. If you are serious about running a business, this should be the minimum level of provider you are aiming for. A VPS costs slightly more than a shared hosting provider but it has your website on a shared server that has been ""blocked off"" into miniature virtual servers. Basically, you will not have to worry about the other sites on your server compromising your website and making it less secure or run slower. However, the resources are still limited by the hardware it is kept on. It will still not run as quickly or securely as the next step up. This type of server is more secure than shared hosting and, if you decide to run an e-commerce storefront, you can get an SSL certificate to encrypt your data for protection from hacking. Dedicated Server This is the highest priced tier, but you can see that it is for websites that are serious about taking care of business. On this type, you have a server all to yourself. You don’t have to share resources with anyone and your website will run as fast as possible on that particular computer. Additionally, you’ll be able to count on top-notch customer support should you need it. For larger businesses that expect a great deal of web traffic, this type of server is essential for your success. When it comes to choosing a shared hosting, a VPS, or a dedicated server, the type you choose should ultimately be determined by your site’s personal needs.

Ryan is that the Strength and Conditioning Coach for the National women's team also because the conditioning coordinator for the National Luge team. Needless to mention 2010 has been an exciting and busy time for Ryan. Read on as Ryan shares with us a touch bit about his background to bring him to where he's , his training philosophies, with specific emphasis on hockey, what working for the National Team has been like also as his dream team of practitioners and therefore the best resources he has found to permit him to possess had success together with his athletes. So sit back and luxuriate in a 1 on one with Ryan Van Austen. Background Chris Collins - Where did you attend school? What made you would like to try to to this for a living? What was your sports background? Who were a number of your mentors along the way? What are a number of the interesting places you've worked? Ryan Van Asten - Master of Science (Exercise and Health Physiology) - University of Calgary Bachelor of Science (Honours) (Subject of Specialization - Life Sciences) - Queen's University, Kingston Ontario Bachelor of Physical and Health Education - Queen's University, Kingston Ontario Certifications: CSCS (NSCA), Certified Exercise Physiologist (CSEP), NCCP Level 1 Olympic Weightlifting, FMS Certified My sports background was varied as a toddler (i.e. hockey, soccer, lacrosse, baseball, alpine skiing, water skiing, wake boarding, etc.) but specialized in Hockey and Lacrosse as an adolescent . Eventually, just focusing on hockey I played Provincial Jr. A in Ontario, 4 years collegiate (Queen's University), 1 year semi-professional in Germany - retiring at age 24 to peruse my graduate degree in Calgary. As a results of my sports background, dry-land training was always a neighborhood of my life and that i loved every second of the training. While at Queen's University i used to be fortunate enough to figure with and play hockey with Anthony Slater (now a serious a part of a corporation called Athletes' Performance within the United States). Anthony (although young himself at the time) put me on a educational program one summer and therefore the results were astonishing because for the primary time in my life i used to be on a per iodized program that wasn't centered around bench press. then i used to be hooked and couldn't get a hold of enough information on training - i used to be digesting the things love it was my job...one problem: it wasn't. At the time i used to be just finishing my Bachelor of Science degree and wasn't sure which direction to travel ...this had all changed by that time , I needed to figure in sports performance. therefore the following year I enrolled within the Bachelor of Physical and Health Education program at Queen's to bring me closer to my goals. it had been in 'Phys Ed' where I met David Frost (a engineer who also had a passion for training and bio mechanics). Dave was an enormous guy who loved to coach and knew a hell of tons more about just about everything than I did - so I spent time with him tons and since we were the old guys during a class filled with 18 and 19 year olds we clicked directly . Training with Dave brought my strength to a good greater level, however, it had been not necessarily do to the physiological aspects anymore - Dave was skilled at breaking down and assessing bio mechanics and he tweaked just about everything I did and my strength went through the roof. this is often once I realized that it's not about the exercise or the exercise selection; it's about the coaching and therefore the implementation of the exercise in an appropriate manner that are the important factors. Evidently, today Dave is finishing his PhD at the University of Waterloo where he's mentored by Stuart McGill (now famous within the realm of strength and conditioning). My first two mentors (and still be to the present day) in strength and conditioning were Anthony Slater and David Frost. I then moved to Calgary and commenced my graduate research - working under Dr. Smith and Dr. Stephen Norris (two of the foremost prominent exercise and sport physiologists within the world) my knowledge expanded even further. i used to be also fortunate enough to urge exposure to excellent Strength and Conditioning coaches at the Canadian Sport Centro - Calgary (I am one among them now...ha)(Matt Jordan, Scott Maw, Mac Read, and Matt Price) - These are guys who have training numerous Olympic and World champions in both summer and winter sports and that i have learned tons from all of them and still learn from them on a day to day."

19,Stay Competitive with Trending SEO Aspects,computers-technology," Driving organic traffic to your website is no joke. With Google and other search engines coming up with an updated algorithm to improve user experience, it is crucial that you approach a reliable SEO consultant. This article discusses some of the trends unfolding in 2020 so that you can modify your existing strategies for your business in Bradford in 2020. Impact of Technical SEO on User Experience Right from the opening interaction on the SERP to the landing page experience and also the impression when the traffic has left your side -everything constitutes the user experience. Technical SEO plays a very important role in enhancing UX. A large percentage of users generally abandon a site if it takes over 3 seconds to load. Besides assisting to generate site speed reports with the help of Google Search Console, the search engine has also declared that ""slow warning badges"" will be added to the under-performing websites. It highlights the significance of increasing page speed. SEO experts hope to notice a dynamic shift to a more technical SEO ecosystem, which has Progressive Web App, JavaScript frameworks usage and SEO automation. So, it is important that you improve your technical foundation by including advanced features. BERT Algorithm Now that Google has incorporated BERT into the ranking algorithm, search has become more intent matching than string matching. BERT is a neural network-based technique, which aids Google to recognise the context of words in a search query. Google has provided many instances of how the application of BERT may influence search results. For instance, before, a query such as ""math practice books for adults"" displayed books for Grades 6-8 at the initial organic results. With BERT, Google shows a book titled ""Math Refresher for Adults"". Even though the books for Grades 6-8 are not completely gone from the Search Engine Result Page, the books specifically meant for adults rank above it as these are better oriented with the searchers’ intention. This alteration of search engines to intent from keyword matching is definitely going to stay in and after 2020. Therefore, it is crucial for SEO experts to emphasise on delivering user-centric content and be relevant all the time to fulfill the needs of the users. High-quality Content Everything in SEO - site structure to link building strategy - moves around content. In 2020, keyword obsession is going to get slow. Rather than targeting many keywords in an average content, a single long-tailed keyword in a highly informative content can fetch higher traffic. Instead of focussing solely on keyword research tools, it is vital to prioritise suggested queries as the source of content creation. Hence, creating and optimising engaging content for users and not for the search engines needs to be the perfect approach. Relevant and valuable content can assist in building your site authority and have a positive impact on the return on investment. Thus, churning out a methodically recognised and informative content which offers a total idea and satisfies the user’s query should be the main objective. E-A-T in SEO The parameters of E-A-T (Expertise, Authority, and Trust) help to determine the overall reputation of a brand or website. As Google tries to deliver the best user experience, it ranks the website that it trusts fully. Therefore, centering on a company’s trust value is important. Reviews and feedback are manifestations of trust issues that can make or break a company. In this situation, a business suffering from a poor reputation and customer service problems will have a challenging time winning the competition. Put in simple words, offline is impacting online. So, instead of paying all attention only to SEO strategy, boost your customer services to acquire generous feedback and earn the trust of Google. Professional SEO marketing companies in Bradford implement these changes to make your site perform better. Develop your site for humans instead of search engines and get a higher rank on SERP soon."
20,SEO Ranking Factors 2020,computers-technology," When looking at how to optimize your website to make it rank higher in search engines, the most important thing to consider is SEO. This refers to the optimization of your website through article marketing, blog posts, websites, and many other methods. To get a website ranked on the first page of Google, Yahoo, or any other search engine, you must have your website optimized well. Before SEO, people wrote articles that promoted their products. Nowadays, SEO takes the form of writing articles and submitting them to article directories, such as EzineArticles, Squidoo, HubPages, etc. A company can make the SEO process in the direction of creating backlinks, which, in turn, will direct users to your website. Through backlinks, you can get better rankings from search engines. Google has a fantastic way to help you get ranked well in the search engine. It has its algorithms for the rankings of websites. These algorithms are very useful and easy to understand. An excellent way to know how to optimize your website to get it on the first page of Google Pagerank is to look at the current rankings of your site. Remember that Pagerank is calculated by using a formula that takes into account a lot of factors that impact search engine rankings. This will help you know if your site is worthy of getting on the first page of Google. An expert who has insight on SEO will say that even though they recommend that you get the Google AdSense, you should not do so immediately. After all, AdSense does not guarantee that you will be on the first page of Google. It is also a known fact that the more backlinks that you get to your website, the better it will get on search engines. Of course, that is how Google works. So it is advisable to focus on getting a lot of backlinks instead of just one or two. Backlinks help improve your rankings when search engines consider it. The more backlinks that you get, the higher your ranking will get. SEO experts advise that you must keep all your essential pages with links intact and not add any extra backlinks to boost your rankings. These may sound ridiculous, but they are true. If you add a link to one page, it means that you need to find another page to provide the link to. If you want to get a better ranking in Google, you should avoid adding links on one page. A better strategy is to do this on separate pages. It will help you gain better backlinks faster, without having to find another page that can link to another. Another key strategy that SEO experts suggest is that you should have good keyword research. Search engines have specific rules about keyword usage, so it is important to know the right keywords to use. Before you start to optimize your website, you should try to get a good understanding of the techniques that are used by search engines. Then, you can focus on getting a high ranking on Google."

0,Blogging / Forums,computers-technology,
1,History of SEO,computers-technology," Webmasters and content providers began optimizing websites for search engines in the mid-1990s, as the first search engines were cataloging the early Web. Initially, all webmasters only needed to submit the address of a page, or URL, to the various engines which would send a ""spider"" to ""crawl"" that page, extract links to other pages from it, and return information found on the page to be indexed.The process involves a search engine spider downloading a page and storing it on the search engine's own server. A second program, known as an indexer, extracts information about the page, such as the words it contains, where they are located, and any weight for specific words, as well as all links the page contains. All of this information is then placed into a scheduler for crawling at a later date. Website owners recognized the value of a high ranking and visibility in search engine results,creating an opportunity for both white hat and black hat SEO practitioners. According to industry analyst Danny Sullivan, the phrase ""search engine optimization"" probably came into use in 1997. Sullivan credits Bruce Clay as one of the first people to popularize the term.On May 2, 2007 Jason Gambert attempted to trademark the term SEO by convincing the Trademark Office in Arizona that SEO is a ""process"" involving manipulation of keywords and not a ""marketing service."" Early versions of search algorithms relied on webmaster-provided information such as the keyword meta tag or index files in engines like ALIWEB. Meta tags provide a guide to each page's content. Using metadata to index pages was found to be less than reliable, however, because the webmaster's choice of keywords in the meta tag could potentially be an inaccurate representation of the site's actual content. Inaccurate, incomplete, and inconsistent data in meta tags could and did cause pages to rank for irrelevant searches. Web content providers also manipulated some attributes within the HTML source of a page in an attempt to rank well in search engines. By 1997, search engine designers recognized that webmasters were making efforts to rank well in their search engine, and that some webmasters were even manipulating their rankings in search results by stuffing pages with excessive or irrelevant keywords. Early search engines, such as Altavista and Infoseek, adjusted their algorithms to prevent webmasters from manipulating rankings. By relying so much on factors such as keyword density which were exclusively within a webmaster's control, early search engines suffered from abuse and ranking manipulation. To provide better results to their users, search engines had to adapt to ensure their results pages showed the most relevant search results, rather than unrelated pages stuffed with numerous keywords by unscrupulous webmasters. This meant moving away from heavy reliance on term density to a more holistic process for scoring semantic signals. Since the success and popularity of a search engine is determined by its ability to produce the most relevant results to any given search, poor quality or irrelevant search results could lead users to find other search sources. Search engines responded by developing more complex ranking algorithms, taking into account additional factors that were more difficult for webmasters to manipulate. In 2005, an annual conference, AIRWeb (Adversarial Information Retrieval on the Web), was created to bring together practitioners and researchers concerned with search engine optimization and related topics. Companies that employ overly aggressive techniques can get their client websites banned from the search results. In 2005, the Wall Street Journal reported on a company, Traffic Power, which allegedly used high-risk techniques and failed to disclose those risks to its clients. Wired magazine reported that the same company sued blogger and SEO Aaron Wall for writing about the ban. Google's Matt Cutts later confirmed that Google did in fact ban Traffic Power and some of its clients. Some search engines have also reached out to the SEO industry, and are frequent sponsors and guests at SEO conferences, webchats, and seminars. Major search engines provide information and guidelines to help with website optimization. Google has a Sitemaps program to help webmasters learn if Google is having any problems indexing their website and also provides data on Google traffic to the website. Bing Webmaster Tools provides a way for webmasters to submit a sitemap and web feeds, allows users to determine the ""crawl rate"", and track the web pages index status. In 2015, it was reported that Google was developing and promoting mobile search as a key feature within future products. In response, many brands began to take a different approach to their Internet marketing strategies."
2,Types of hosting,computers-technology," Internet hosting services can run Web servers. The scope of web hosting services varies greatly. Shared web hosting service One's website is placed on the same server as many other sites, ranging from a few sites to hundreds of websites. Typically, all domains may share a common pool of server resources, such as RAM and the CPU. The features available with this type of service can be quite basic and not flexible in terms of software and updates. Resellers often sell shared web hosting and web companies often have reseller accounts to provide hosting for clients. Reseller web hosting Allows clients to become web hosts themselves. Resellers could function, for individual domains, under any combination of these listed types of hosting, depending on who they are affiliated with as a reseller. Resellers' accounts may vary tremendously in size: they may have their own virtual dedicated server to a colocated server. Many resellers provide a nearly identical service to their provider's shared hosting plan and provide the technical support themselves. Virtual Dedicated Server Also known as a Virtual Private Server (VPS), divides server resources into virtual servers, where resources can be allocated in a way that does not directly reflect the underlying hardware. VPS will often be allocated resources based on a one server to many VPSs relationship, however virtualisation may be done for a number of reasons, including the ability to move a VPS container between servers. The users may have root access to their own virtual space. Customers are sometimes responsible for patching and maintaining the server (unmanaged server) or the VPS provider may provide server admin tasks for the customer(managed server). Dedicated hosting service The user gets his or her own Web server and gains full control over it (user has root access for Linux/administrator access for Windows); however, the user typically does not own the server. One type of dedicated hosting is self-managed or unmanaged. This is usually the least expensive for dedicated plans. The user has full administrative access to the server, which means the client is responsible for the security and maintenance of his own dedicated server. Managed hosting service The user gets his or her own Web server but is not allowed full control over it (user is denied root access for Linux/administrator access for Windows); however, they are allowed to manage their data via FTP or other remote management tools. The user is disallowed full control so that the provider can guarantee quality of service by not allowing the user to modify the server or potentially create configuration problems. The user typically does not own the server. The server is leased to the client. Colocation web hosting service Similar to the dedicated web hosting service, but the user owns the colo server; the hosting company provides physical space that the server takes up and takes care of the server. This is the most powerful and expensive type of web hosting service. In most cases, the colocation provider may provide little to no support directly for their client's machine, providing only the electrical, Internet access, and storage facilities for the server. In most cases for colo, the client would have his own administrator visit the data center on site to do any hardware upgrades or changes. Formerly, many colocation providers would accept any system configuration for hosting, even ones housed in desktop-style minitower cases, but most hosts now require rack mount enclosures and standard system configurations. Cloud hosting This is a new type of hosting platform that allows customers powerful, scalable and reliable hosting based on clustered load-balanced servers and utility billing. A cloud hosted website may be more reliable than alternatives since other computers in the cloud can compensate when a single piece of hardware goes down. Also, local power disruptions or even natural disasters are less problematic for cloud hosted sites, as cloud hosting is decentralized. Cloud hosting also allows providers to charge users only for resources consumed by the user, rather than a flat fee for the amount the user expects they will use, or a fixed cost upfront hardware investment. Alternatively, the lack of centralization may give users less control on where their data is located which could be a problem for users with data security or privacy concerns. Clustered hosting Having multiple servers hosting the same content for better resource utilization. Clustered servers are a perfect solution for high-availability dedicated hosting, or creating a scalable web hosting solution. A cluster may separate web serving from database hosting capability. (Usually web hosts use clustered hosting for their shared hosting plans, as there are multiple benefits to the mass managing of clients. Grid hosting This form of distributed hosting is when a server cluster acts like a grid and is composed of multiple nodes. Home server Usually a single machine placed in a private residence can be used to host one or more web sites from a usually consumer-grade broadband connection. These can be purpose-built machines or more commonly old PCs. Some ISPs actively attempt to block home servers by disallowing incoming requests to TCP port 80 of the user's connection and by refusing to provide static IP addresses. A common way to attain a reliable DNS host name is by creating an account with a dynamic DNS service. A dynamic DNS service will automatically change the IP address that a URL points to when the IP address changes. Some specific types of hosting provided by web host service providers: 1.File hosting service: hosts files, not web pages 2.image hosting service 3.Video hosting service 4.Blog hosting service 5.Paste bin 6.Shopping cart software 7.E-mail hosting service"
3,Dedicated Servers vs. VPS Servers,computers-technology," Choosing a hosting provider is hard enough, but choosing the right hosting plan can add to that frustration, especially if you don’t know the differences between them. For this guide, we are going to discuss two of the more secure options for hosting plans, VPS and Dedicated. What is a VPS and Dedicated Plan? Before we discuss the differences, let’s talk about the plans themselves and what makes them unique. VPS. A VPS, or virtual private server, is similar to a shared server in that the server has multiple clients on one server. That’s where the similarities end. While you are sharing a server with other clients, each client is allotted certain space and cannot interfere with another client. This is done using a hypervisor (which sounds way cool). A hypervisor is a virtual partition used to separate clients from each other and ensure that they don’t interfere with any data or usage of the other clients. Dedicated. A dedicated server is just what it sounds like, dedicated. You are the only one using that server and only your data will be on there. How nice it is to have a server dedicated to your business – but it does not come cheaply. So What’s the Difference? Besides what type of servers these two plans use, speed, security, price, scalability, and management all play a huge role in making these two plans different. -Speed. When it comes down to it, a dedicated server will have the advantage here. There are no partitions or dividers or anything to stop data being transferred or requested. This improves page load times and, as you may know already, the faster a page loads the more likely a visitor will stay on your site. -Security. When considering hosting providers, security is another score for dedicated servers. This is not saying that VPS security isn’t good, it’s just that security for dedicated servers is commonly better. The main reason is that there is only one way for attacks to happen on a dedicated server: externally. With a VPS there is always the chance that a neighbor on the server you share could become corrupted and affect your site. -Price. Without a doubt, a VPS plan is going to cost much less than any dedicated plan. The discount comes from sharing a server and is usually a pretty big difference. -Scalability. When it comes to expanding your site or increasing the amount of storage you need, a VPS takes the cake again. Having the advantage of being virtual, upgrading your storage can be done by simply allocating more to you from the server you are on. With a dedicated plan, if you want to add more, you will need to physically add more to the server. This costs money and time and can cause downtime on your site. -Management. Dedicated prevails when it comes to management. Although both plans offer management, having to only deal with one set of data, rather than multiple, is a big bonus. Server technicians will be able to focus solely on your data and not have to deal with issues that may be coming from other client’s data.

4,How Can You Integrate SEO and PPC in Your Marketing Strategies?,computers-technology," SEO and PPC are two different fields of search marketing, but their  objectives are the same - to drive traffic, obtain visibility and get revenue  from search. This is why it makes sense to integrate them into your marketing  strategy and benefit from their unique identities. As PPC and SEO complement  each other, you can expect your overall strategy to improve and bring better  results. Before discussing how they can be integrated into your marketing  strategy, here are some of the basics. SEO SEO is a process of optimising different parts of a website so that it gains  visibility in the SERPs and drives more traffic. SEO primarily focuses on  helping websites rank in organic search. This is a long-term process and  results can be seen after a considerable amount of work and time has been  invested. This is one of the main reasons why many websites consider paid  results to attract initial traffic as paid results appear above organic search  results. PPC PPC is a way of driving traffic to the website by paid ads. A fee is charged to  the advertiser every time someone clicks their ad. Paid ads appear above the  organic listings to encourage clicks. These ads help to yield instant results. Difference between  PPC and SEO A properly  planned and executed SEO campaign yields long-lasting results even after the  campaign has finished, but it is an ongoing process. The benefits got from PPC  campaigns finish the moment the campaign is stopped, which might be due to  spend/budget or time limit. From the above information, it might seem to you that PPC and SEO  operate on their own. Below given are ways by which both these strategies  complement each other and ensure a more effective and successful marketing  strategy. PPC can be used to find and test keywords for SEO  campaigns Identifying and  finding relevant keywords is one of the foundations of a successful SEO  campaign. Even though there are various tools that can help you, the best  source will be the search engine where you want your website to be visible in.  Google AdWords provides a detailed insight into the CTR and conversions of the  keywords that have been selected for a PPC campaign. This can help you to  determine the keywords that will fetch you better results when applied to your  SEO strategy. Improve your website’s metadata If you want to get paid clicks, you need to  create ads. Google AdWords allows advertisers to create multiple ads targeting  the same keywords. It lets advertisers conduct A/B testing. By taking a look at  what your competitors are doing, you will be able to identify the factors that  are driving users to click. You can refine your ads by collecting data on CTR  and conversions. You can also use this data to improve the metadata on your  website, which will boost your SEO strategy. Sharing strategies  can maximise online visibility Integration of  PPC and SEO can result in several benefits like, maximising online visibility  in both organic and paid results. By aligning the efforts of both these  strategies, you can dominate organic and paid listings on a single SERP. This  will make your website an authority in your niche and help maximise traffic and  boost conversions. So, the integration of PPC and SEO can help to make your marketing  strategy powerful and more effective. It can help you achieve your business  objectives and dominate the search engine results. If you are unsure how to  integrate them, you can seek the help of a professional SEO agency in Liverpool. By leveraging the expertise and experience of SEO professionals, you will be  able to derive maximum benefit from both your SEO campaigns and PPC campaigns.  But, make sure to join hands with an agency that has a stellar reputation,  provides you with open lines of communication and is willing to personalise  solutions to your needs."
5,Should You Work For The NHS Or Enter Private Practice?,computers-technology," That is an interesting question. Here is what one doctor, who shall remain nameless, had to say about it just over four years ago. He said that he had worked for the NHS in one of the allied health care professions for seven years but owing to cost cutting and service reorganisations the opportunities for career progression had drastically (his word) reduced over that period. He had recently managed to gain a promotion to the next pay grade, but his job would not change as he had been functioning at that level for a number of years waiting for a role to become available. At the same time, he was offered a position with an independent practice which offered to match the pay scale and leave entitlement that he already had in the NHS. While he had not yet seen a contract, he felt that they would be unable to match other benefits of working for the NHS such as the pension, sick pay, and so on. However, he considered that going private would enable him to have a very reduced caseload of patients where he would be able to make a great difference to the lives of individuals rather than – as he put it – ""plastering over the cracks"". He also thought that a big drawback was that he would then only be able to provide his services to people who could actually afford to pay for them, but overall felt that he would have better job satisfaction working privately. His long-term aim had always been to run his own practice and he felt that by working for one that was already successful he would be able to learn how to do that ""from the inside"". He questioned whether he should give up the job security and pension of the NHS in favour of a less stressful working day. There, no doubt, is something that has occurred to many doctors working in the NHS. There is probably no simple answer. However, it is true that there are many benefits to working privately, particularly if you start your own practice. The simple fact is that you can dictate your own terms. You can decide how many hours you want to work, and you can decide your own rate of pay. Provided that you build it up into a successful business, you will be able to put money aside into a pension pot of your own, which could finish up being a lot bigger than the NHS pension. However, here’s the rub. In a private practice you are, indeed, running a business. In the NHS you get a pay cheque at the end of the month, but in a private practice your pay cheque is dependent on the number of patients that you see and also how well they pay you. Some patients will always pay quickly, but others may drag their heels. This is true of any business. This means that in a private practice you are suddenly faced with a lot more admin than you ever had in the NHS. Bear in mind that the only time you are earning money in a private practice is when you are spending time with patients. Admin is simply nothing other than an overhead. If you are going to enter private practice you need systems to handle all the admin and that either means using your own servers and software or outsourcing it. Fortunately, today you can outsource your admin to software providers who offer a choice of medical management systems so that you can choose one that fits your needs. You can use your own hardware, or perhaps better still use a service that provides everything that you need in the cloud. Medical management systems in the cloud offer a number of benefits. First, you don’t need your own hardware and you don’t need to purchase software because, to all intents and purposes you rent it and pay for it as you go. You can access a cloud-based system from anywhere on the planet that has an internet connection and it is open 24/7/365. It will always have maximum security and the very latest software updates, so you don’t need to worry about any of that. All this leaves you more time to spend with patients rather than on admin, which gives you greater earning power. At the end of the day, only you can decide which way you want to go, but the benefits of private practice are certainly alluring."
6,A Smart Way to Use an IT Nearshoring Model,computers-technology," We all know of the famous adage ""measure thrice, cut once."" Here’s another one: ""you gotta make money to spend money."" But just like you don’t need to reinvest all of the money into your business, you can’t always wait until you have 100% of information to take a leap of faith. Sometimes, a solid 95% will do. Any decision involving resources (whether time, money or human) shouldn’t be taken lightly. Throwing resources at your business won’t guarantee success. On the other hand, being too cautious can put a dent in your growth plans. Investing isn't about a sudden influx of cash, nor is it something you do and forget about. It’s a tricky area where experience and strategy are very much welcome. The first step is identifying what you want to improve and figure out how to go about doing it. Whether it’s growing your revenue, efficiency, product expansion, or team - it all requires certain knowledge, experience and time commitment. You can’t be everywhere at once Business owners are not strangers to constraints and making do with what they have. At the same time, many of them have tasks that negate the pleasures of running their business. For some, it could be the administrative work, for others, it’s a marketing campaign or creative writing. Whatever the case, it makes excellent business sense to outsource these activities to third parties. But doing so doesn’t have to be fraught with fear and anxiety. Rather, it can unlock a number of benefits for your business. Saved time Sometimes you work in your business for so long, that you forgot to work on it. This is particularly true for small business owners, who get so caught up in the grind that they don’t realize their time can be freed up for more important activities. Saved money Expanding the team is costly: there’s overhead, rent, training, as well as accounting and taxes to consider. Consequently, you should still be mindful and avoid outsourcing work that may be easier, faster or more beneficial to perform yourself. Saved energy While money and time are important, your strategy in choosing what, when and how to outsource is what makes the biggest difference. It’s an energy that could be focused on everything from managing more effectively to coaching, training and instilling in your team a sense of pride and purpose. The problem with freelancers Inconsistency Most of us work in different ways, and there is little consistency is the ways freelancers work, deal with feedback or handle revisions to the finished product. It makes the workflows inefficient and adds an extra layer of stress for businesses. Inefficiency Businesses usually operate on a tight schedule, yet freelancers tend to juggle numerous projects at once. Since they may not be available at a moment’s notice, freelancers can’t quickly react to changing directives or deadlines. Unpredictability Even if you do manage to build a perfect, long-term relationship with a high-quality freelancer, there’s no guarantee they’ll move on to greener pastures. Without a personal relationship or legal ties to the company, there’s less desire to stick around. The problem with hiring more Say you’re deliberating between adding freelancers versus expanding your team. How do you know which investment will prove to be the most financially viable? Consider all the potential cost-benefit scenarios, as well as the return of any activity and their risks. For example, if you’re interested in redesigning a website, but there is no guarantee that the ROI of hiring a web designer and developer will net you more in six months. That’s why taking the time to research the feasibility of nearshoring a particular job is so important. Explore how other businesses performed in similar challenges and markets to yours. The solution is near... Nearshoring The classic definition of nearshoring is hiring workers in a country geographically close to you. Nearshoring limits cultural or time zone differences while offering significant savings over hiring in the same country. An example would be an American company hiring customer support staff in Mexico. This can be done by the company or through an IT nearshoring consultant such as Mobilunity. Here’s the catch with the idea of nearshoring: every company is different. That’s why defining your core needs is a must to bring out any significant value out of nearshoring. Let’s say you run a marketing team and can’t afford to bring on a full-time graphic designer. You rule out hiring freelancers due to their overhead, inefficiency and potential unpredictability. Nearshoring a designer could be that ideal ""sweet spot"" in your situation. Nearshoring shouldn’t take away from business goals A robust and well-designed nearshoring strategy will save you time, money and depending on your industry, offer you a unique competitive advantage. What it should not do is create bottlenecks in your processes and add to your stress levels. Thankfully, all this can be avoided by properly vetting your nearshoring service provider. Create a playbook or guideline for remote employees to streamline communication with your team. This can iron out a lot of misunderstandings and make your processes more efficient. Properly implementing nearshoring has the power to impact your revenues, operations and profits. Just be sure to ""measure thrice"" before making any large human resource decisions."
7,The U.S. Government and Zero Day Vulnerabilities,computers-technology," May-24-2016 In May, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter addressed reporters at a news conference in California, where he talked about technology and cyber defense.Carter spoke about the United States’ use of electronic attack methods to disrupt the activities of ISIS. But, he warned, we are not the only country with those types of capabilities. Technology is an equalizer.This has pretty much always been true.A lot of technology allows us to do old tasks in new ways to get things done faster, and this is also true for military technology. Considerable time and resources are required for an airstrike or an espionage operation. It takes much less effort to develop and deploy an electronic weapon that could have similar effects. Experts estimate that Stuxnet, the infamous worm that destroyed hundreds of nuclear centrifuges in Iran, cost a million dollars to develop. That sounds like a lot to you and me, but keep in mind that Congress budgets hundreds of billions of dollars for the Department of Defense every year. Stuxnet’s development costs are within the reach of a small country, or even a very determined group of individuals. This is why Defense Secretary Carter was in California with other high-ranking policy officials to meet with technology companies. Relationships between technology companies and the government have been strained lately, as law enforcement calls for breakable encryption. But, the encryption controversy aside, cooperation between technology experts and the government is essential for national security. The government needs the technology expertise of the private sector, and vice versa.Cyber defense, however, requires innovative thought, not just money. A major obstacle to effective cyber defense is the unpredictability of zero day vulnerabilities. Zero days are security holes that are unknown and unpatched before an attacker uses them. Security researchers around the world identify zero days, and some of these zero days are sold on the open market. One of the purchasers in the market for zero day vulnerabilities is the U.S. government.Zero day vulnerabilities give our military and intelligence communities an edge as they develop cyber weapons and surveillance tools. But these security holes are discovered, not made. If we can find it and figure out how to use it against people who want to hurt us, there is also nothing stopping those people from using the same security holes against the U.S. military, U.S. infrastructure, and U.S. citizens. This should concern the technology companies—the software vendors—that are being asked to collaborate with the government on cyber defense. Our critical infrastructure has to be protected and civilians have to be protected too. But by supporting the market for zero day vulnerabilities and exploits, the U.S. government is tacitly condoning everyone else’s efforts to develop cyber weapons, regardless of whether this is in the best interest of the public. Even if the U.S. government moves all zero day research in-house (in other words, the government agencies look for the zero day vulnerabilities themselves, instead of buying them from others), anyone else could find the same vulnerabilities with enough resources and time. Offense and defense may be more closely related in cyber conflict than in any other context. Cyber defense isn’t just about building a better wall to keep out better weapons. The ""better wall"" has to be designed with specific weapons in mind, and the technologies of these weapons need to be integrated into this wall to some degree. Only by giving cyber defense at least as much emphasis as cyber offense will we be able to mitigate threats to our society and our way of life. Author – Jay Kesan"

10,Has Your Phone Been Hacked? Here's How to Tell,computers-technology," These days you’re likely walking around with your life in your pocket.  Your phone is used for everything from taking pictures of your kids, to taking care of banking, to dealing with small work issues when you’re away from the office.  When a hacker gets access to your smartphone not only do they get your passwords, they also get access to your photos, your financial accounts, and other personal information like who you’ve talked to and the places you’ve recently visited.  This is all valuable information. Hackers have a number of ways to access your phone even if they never physically put a finger on it.  And yet it’s too easy to think your device is fine because it’s always been ‘safe’ in your possession. That’s why it’s important for you to know the warning signs of a problem. How to tell if your phone has been hacked Most hackers try to keep their nefarious activity as unnoticeable as possible so they can dig into your accounts and your data as long as possible.  But if you pay attention to your device, you’ll notice something is wrong quickly and can take action to block them. This is often the first symptom you have a problem.   Unauthorized bank charges, weird Twitter posts you didn’t make, or emails in your history you know you didn’t send are all strong evidence of a problem.   You might also see outgoing texts or calls to your contacts you didn’t make. If you’re suddenly barraged by ads on your device when you never were before, you’ve probably been infected with adware, otherwise known as malvertising.  While the majority of these ads are more annoying than they are dangerous, some can lead you to malicious sites designed to dive deeper into your phone.  Don’t ignore the problem. Subtler clues may include an increase in data usage and a decrease in your battery life.  Both of these may be indicators of background programs running malicious code or some kind of malware. As malware makes a home in your phone, performance will probably decrease.  Your phone may begin to ‘glitch’ more often.  It may also suddenly run hot as malware ramps up the demand on your phone’s RAM and CPU. Why does this happen Hackers can get access to your device via several pathways.  Unsecured public WiFi gives these unethical technicians a chance to access information you share over the network and use it for their own benefit, including any passwords you might use.  It’s also possible to be a victim of ‘phishing,’ where someone gains control of your device through a false email, text, or pop-up.   Or it’s possible an infected application was installed that inadvertently gave your phone over to hackers as permissions were set. What to do if you think your phone has been hacked If you think your phone has a problem, your first action should be to limit exposure.  Disable your phone’s GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.  Then use one or more pieces of mobile anti-malware software to look for the problem.  Disable and remove any applications you don’t recognize. Be aware you may have to wipe the phone completely and restore it to factory settings.  This is why it’s always good to back up files, to reduce the pain of a factory reset.  And don’t forget to quickly contact your bank through a secondary line to block any unauthorized charges and to change those passwords. Going forward, make sure to only install applications purchased from a trusted source.  Question the permissions you give to each app; how many games really need access to your camera and microphone? Lock your device when you’re not using it so strangers can’t access your information.  And consider hitting up your settings to minimize the amount of data that remains stored in your browsing history and cache. Remember: phones are now more like a computer in your pocket than a simple communication device. We’re using them to manage our lives but we’re not protecting them like we do our computers.   Meanwhile, more scams and mobile threats are emerging all the time.  Make it hard on the hackers and easier on yourself by securing your phone now."

13,Router and Access Point - What's the Difference?,computers-technology," Router and access point - what is the difference between them? This is a frequent question of our customers, especially those who purchase equipment for home or office. We will try to answer it in this article. Strictly speaking, it is impossible to save a classic router and a classic access point. These devices have completely different purposes. Strictly speaking, it is impossible to save a classic router and a classic access point. These devices have completely different purposes. What is an access point? An access point (AP) is simply a wireless ""extension cable"" for a wired network, which is most often used in two ways: It receives incoming Internet traffic via cable and distributes it wirelessly (access point / base station mode). An example is a home access point for desktop or wall-mounted placement, which is most often confused with a Wi-Fi router: An example is a home / office ceiling mount access point : It can also be a powerful access point with an antenna, which is used by the provider to broadcast Internet traffic to subscribers via WiFi. Here is one, for example: There is also a mode of operation of the access point, in which it receives and transmits traffic over a wireless connection - repeater or repeater mode. It is preferable to use other modes if possible, since with such a transfer, the speed drops significantly. In all these operating modes, the classic access point simply broadcasts traffic , without any operations with it. If several devices are connected to a WiFi point, then the bandwidth between them is divided equally, as in a simple switch. The wired interface at indoor access points is usually limited to one LAN port. What is a router? A router (router) is a more ""smart"" device that not only receives and transmits data, but also redistributes them according to various established rules and executes the given commands. He can: Route data packets (Internet traffic) between different networks and subnets; Assign IP addresses to computers and other devices that are connected to it; provide their network protection (firewall); limit the speed of traffic and much more - depending on the type and high cost of the model. Prior to the popularization of wireless technology, routers were released without WiFi support. The classic router had only a wired interface and no one would have thought of comparing it to a WiFi access point. And now multi-port carrier-class models are available without a radio module: The confusion arose precisely when the routers equipped with WiFi transmitters, and, in fact, combined the functionality of the router and access points in them. This has spawned many modifications. The most common question: ""What is the difference between an access point and a router"" arises in relation to access points for rooms and inexpensive wireless routers for the SOHO segment. They are not much different both externally and in cost. From the foregoing, a few simple key differences can be deduced: An access point is just an access point. A WiFi router is a router + access point , two in one. The WiFi router in most cases is designed for indoor use. Access points are very different - for rooms and for the street, for connecting several clients and for connecting one, with a built-in antenna and with the need to buy an antenna separately. An internal access point most often has only one port for connecting a cable - for incoming traffic. A wireless router usually has several ports so that devices can be connected via a WiFi connection and using a network cable. What is the difference between a WiFi router and an access point in practice? Theory, of course, is good. But what exactly are the possibilities of buying a Wi-Fi router? Is it worth paying more for it (if it is more expensive)? As we discussed above, it makes no sense to talk about expensive carrier-grade routers. Compare solutions for home and office. WiFi router	    Access point By connecting the router first to the provider's cable and setting it up once, you do not have to configure separately each computer or laptop connected after it to the home / office network. 	 The device located on the network after the access point will need to enter the provider settings. after it to the home / office network. The device located on the network after the access point will need to enter the provider settings. You can easily organize a home network: the router acts as a dhcp server, distributes IP addresses within the network, you only need to connect the devices to the configured router - it will do the rest. You will have to bother with the settings of your home network, including, possibly, getting additional IP addresses from the provider. The router has the functionality of a firewall, built-in firewall, which means it provides improved network protection. The access point does not have any protective functionality, except for simple traffic encryption. If you need a high connection speed for some tasks - you can always connect the computer to the router using a network cable and get the maximum speed that the provider gives. Most access points do not have a wired interface for transferring data to end devices, and the speed of a wireless connection is not suitable for all tasks. For the operation of some highly specialized programs / interfaces, it may be necessary to configure port forwarding on the router, since the internal IP address of the devices is not available ""outside"" from the router subnet. The access point transparently translates traffic, and for some highly specialized tasks, this is good. The IP address of the end device is accessible externally without additional settings. Conclusion In most cases, to distribute the Internet to several home devices - a computer, laptop, smartphone - it is better to purchase a WiFi router and connect the provider's cable to it. Especially if the router is inexpensive. For other purposes: receiving traffic from the provider wirelessly, organizing a seamless WiFi network in the office, HotSpot in a cafe or hotel - you need an access point. If you need advice, we will help you find a solution for each specific task."

19,Create and burn ISO images with Active@ ISO Manager,computers-technology," While physical media like CDs and DVDs aren't as popular as they used to be, there are plenty of situations where you still need to use them. Even if you're trying to phase them out, you will still need a simple way to copy over the data onto your computer or other storage device so that you can continue to use it on any modern computer. After all, a lot of laptops no longer even have optical disk drives installed, since it's no longer an industry standard in widespread use. In other cases, you might need to copy over data from a hard drive or other storage device to an optical disk so you can easily transfer it to an older system. Whatever your situation, there are still cases where you need an interface between the old and the new, and that's where ISO files come in. Active@ ISO Manager is a freeware solution for working with ISO files. An ISO file is a type of image file that contains a complete, byte-by-byte snapshot of the layout and all the data stored on an optical disk. This includes CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray disks. It's the industry standard format for optical disk images, and it's supported by all modern operating systems, as well as those which have been around for decades. Although you can read ISO images in Windows, Linux, and most other operating systems, the options for authoring, editing, and burning them tend to be somewhat limited, which is why it's usually necessary to install a third party solution like Active@ ISO Manager. One of the most common uses of an ISO file is to burn it to a blank CD or DVD. For example, if you want to buy and download Windows and perform a fresh install, you'll need to create a bootable disk. One of the easiest ways to do this is download the latest ISO image from Microsoft and burn it directly to a DVD. You'll then be able to use it to install Windows just like you can with a hardcopy purchased in a high-street store. With Active@ ISO Manager, you can use ISO images just like they're drives in their own right. You can create and mount virtual optical disk drives, or you can simply open the ISO image and browse it just like a ZIP archive or any folder on your computer. This lets you move files to and from the image before burning it to a disk. Remember, that you can't simply copy over an ISO to an optical drive - all you'll end up with is a copy of the file on the drive, which means it won't work as intended. Instead, you need to extract and burn the image to the drive, which Active@ ISO Manager can also do. This works both in Windows with the Joliet ISO extension and in Linux with the Rockridge ISO extension. The latest version of Active@ ISO Manager features several improvements. Most notably, it's now completely free with no registrations required. This update also sees several functionality fixes and improved ISO management. Try Version 7 today!"
20,Restore deleted files with Active@ File Recovery,computers-technology," Although today's digital storage devices are far more reliable than they used to be, data loss remains a constant source of frustration and worry among home and business users alike. That's why having a proper backup and disaster recovery strategy has become mandatory in the workplace, as well as being highly advisable for individuals. After all, no matter how reliable your technology might be, there's always a risk of something going wrong. Sometimes, a power failure during a file transfer operation can be all it takes to lose important data. In most cases, however, human error is the culprit and, while essential, there's no such thing as a perfect backup or recovery system either. Sometimes, you need a last-resort option to recover data which has been lost just in case you don't have a current backup. Most people assume that formatting a drive or emptying the recycle bin is final, and that the files are gone for good. After all, operating systems usually warn you before you go ahead with the operation. Nonetheless, most of us have experienced that dreaded feeling of deleting a file or folder or formatting a storage volume only to find out moments too late that it was a mistake. Fortunately, there is a window of opportunity during which you should be able to get back what you lost. That's because the data isn't deleted during these operations. Only the entries pertaining to the deleted files in the file system are changed, thereby marking the space previously occupied by the files as available. That means the original data could be overwritten at any time but, until that happens, it is hidden on the disk. Active@ File Recovery 19 is a full-featured file recovery solution designed to exploit that opportunity by scanning any writable digital storage medium for recoverable data. Sometimes, it is even possible to recover data months or even years after it has been deleted. But it's always better to act fast to be on the safe side and avoid using the drive in the meantime. Active@ File Recovery works in its own self-contained operating environment, which allows you to recover data from a system drive without risking making any further modifications to it. Even if your computer won't start up at all, you can boot up and scan any connected drive for recoverable data. Ultimate users will have access to the latest version of Active@ Boot Disk, which has recently been upgraded to the WinPE version based on Windows 10 Build 1903 to provide a modern and familiar operating environment. Other improvements in this new edition of Active@ File Recovery 19 include an additional two predefined file signatures to support Canon Raw Images (CR3) and Finale Notation Files (MUSX). These file signatures allow you to look for deleted files in specific formats, which is important since the original filename and location will no longer be available. There's also an improved NTFS recovery, support for Windows Storage Spaces, and disks with sectors of 4KB. To make the process easier, the software is more stable with failing drives, and the welcome and registration screen has been overhauled. Find out more at the official website."

The face of your company is a professionally-looking medical website which can convince visitors to turn to you for medical services or buy products from you. Use of marketing strategies A clinic or medical institution always sets objectives to attract the maximum number of patients. One of the ways to reach this goal is to use hospital marketing by setting advertising campaigns with the help of Google Ads and social media. Medical web development is fundamentally different from software development because the main goal of medical website developers is not to make an entertaining website, but to build a website that will meet the needs of your patients. Medical website development needs a profound understanding of this sphere, thus the best idea is to turn to a professional software development team. You should get the following services from a medical web development company: Research target users, their needs, and possible expectations for the website Create functional specifications for the website Create an intuitive and appealing design based on the best practices Develop corresponding functionality Provide ongoing support and maintenance Don't forget that the success of your website does not depend only on the professionalism of the medical web development team, but of different stages and strategies."
5,Colocation Types: Rack vs Cabinet,computers-technology," There are plenty of colocation solutions available in the market today, but before hiring a services make sure to know which one will suit you the best. You want to invest your money wisely by renting space in a data center facility, but the amount of choices for colocation solutions are plenty and you are not quite sure which one to choose. As you go on digging deeper in all the colocation services available you will come across terms like Rack and Cabinet; you might even think that they both serve the same purpose so they are the same thing. Let me tell you that that´s not the case, they both accommodate server equipment but there are some fundamental difference between the two. A server rack is a structure which is built with a series of shelves stacked one above another. It has an open frame designed for mounting multiple electronic equipment modules to hold servers and IT equipment like: PSU, motherboard, CPU, RAM, etc. It´s size will vary a little depending on the manufacturer but the industry standard is 19 inches wide and 36 inches deep. Cabinets on the other hand serve the same purpose as rack do, by holding multiple electronic equipment and gears; but its main difference is that cabinets are enclosed on all sides with doors and panels. A cabinet measuring around 20U or 24U is considered a standard half cabinet while a 42U is a standard full cabinet. When talking about advantages between these two, cabinets have the lead in security; while racks are open and have better air flow; cabinets are enclosed with doors that can be locked providing a better security. In terms of size since racks are open it has a lot more space when compared to an enclosed cabinet. Another point for racks is that in case you have many cables to deal with, organizing them is much easier with this type of colocation solution than with a server cabinet. We all know that server equipment heats over time and ventilation might be a concern in your mind right now but both (racks and cabinets) offer great ventilation systems to keep your gear cool. Racks are open and allow air flow and even though cabinets are enclosed they come with clever ventilation systems for optimal cooling. Pricing is another issue to consider when choosing between a rack and a cabinet; racks are rented depending on the units you require so price will vary depending on your needs, while cabinets are a bit more expensive due to the privacy and security they offer. At Whitelabel ITSolutions we offer many colocation solutions. We will elaborate a colocation package that´s right for your business; whether you require rack space or cabinet our team of industry experts will work hard to design customized managed colocation solutions to fit your needs in our world-class facilities."
6,Coronal Mass Ejection Effects on the North American Power Grid,computers-technology," Historical Record Imagine a solar electromagnetic disturbance strong enough to energize telegraph wires independent of their power supplies. Imagine operators transmitting and receiving messages on keys disconnected from their batteries, sustaining random jolts of electricity nonetheless. Imagine the aurora borealis appearing before the wondering eyes of sailors in the Caribbean. This really happened during the well-documented Carrington Event of 1859, a solar super storm that disrupted emerging technologies during the Victorian era. A 2008 National Academy of Sciences report stated a similar solar event today would have an economic impact on the United States equivalent to sustaining 20 Category 5 hurricanes at the same time. More recently, science journalist and consultant Lawrence E. Joseph speculated that severe solar effects have the potential to knock 100 million people off the power grid for two years. The sun is entering a highly active sunspot phase after an abnormally quiet period that lasted beyond the expected 11-year solar minimum. Unfortunately, the planets orbiting around it may be in for some interesting times through 2013 as the result. Earth's North American continent may bear the brunt of the onslaught with far-reaching consequences for its technologically developed nations. Space Weather Basics Solar flares are huge eruptions of hot gases and electromagnetic radiation resulting from storms on the sun's surface. The radiation races to the Earth in a matter of hours, disrupting radio communications and causing power grids to flicker briefly. Flares are often followed by coronal mass ejections, highly charged electrical particles much larger than the original eruption. CMEs travel more slowly and take 24 to 48 hours to reach the Earth's atmosphere. Their speed and potential for producing catastrophic results depend on the initial speed of the preceding flare. Fortunately, only a portion of this energy reaches the Earth. The majority is deflected by the atmosphere and passes into space with few consequences to our planet. However, given the right set of circumstances, we could experience conditions similar to those of the Carrington Event. The side of the Earth facing the sun during a strong CME event would be most affected but the entire globe would share in the consequences. Long-term prediction of the occurrences and magnitude of solar flares and CMEs is in its infancy. Scientists and emergency services planners regard these events in much the same light as earthly hurricanes. They know that it is impossible to cover all the bases but they have developed tactics for mitigating the worst of the effects. Power Grid How is that the effects of a severe CME event could be so much more catastrophic today than they were in 1859? Our modern-day culture is heavily reliant on electricity to function, and the power grid is its Achilles' heel. This is particularly the case in the Northern Hemisphere and especially so in the United States. Most of its power generation and distribution facilities are located in northerly latitudes. If you've seen the aurora borealis, you probably live in a vulnerable area. A direct hit with the energy from a CME grounds itself in the earth. This energy wreaks havoc on the normal transmission pathways of the power grid. Arcing, sparking and blowouts of electrical transformers are the result. A similar event in Canada in 1989 knocked out the grid in many areas for weeks. Since then, the North American power grid has grown in size and complexity. Power distribution centers rely on huge transformers to step down the voltage to a level usable by industries and consumers. Once overwhelmed by the energy surge from a CME, they overload. Their internal windings actually melt as they did during the Canadian event. These transformers are huge and cannot be lifted out and replaced in one piece. Technicians would have to physically crawl inside them to repair any damage. Replacing a hopelessly damaged transformer requires a lead time of at least 12 months at present. There are hundreds of these in the United States and Canada and with industry crippled by the loss of the grid, manufacturing new transformers would take even longer. The sheer size of the power distribution network precludes widespread shielding against a massive CME event. Therefore, engineers and scientists from NOAA and NASA have teamed up to work out a solution that everyone hopes will work. Since shielding is impossible, the next best choice is disconnecting transformers and associated systems from the grid's wires. Of course, this would mean short-duration power outages in a densely populated region. On the other hand, this inconvenience would be a small price to pay when compared to the potential long-term effects. A few hours without electricity bears no comparison to plunging 100 million people back into the 19th century for a couple of years. Grid engineers would require some advance warning to disconnect the power system. NOAA and NASA expect to be able to give them 24 to 48 hours' notice. NASA has put into orbit a series of satellites as a distant early warning system, the best-known being the Advanced Composition Explorers. The ACEs are NASA's equivalent of a canary in a coal mine These satellites would be the first line of defense, sensing the magnitude of the energy pulse hurtling toward Earth. Data would be collected and transmitted to the supercomputers at the Goddard Space Center's Community Coordinated Modeling Center. If the computers' calculations indicated a severe disruption were likely, the CCMC and other organizations would alert grid engineers. Even with this cutting-edge technology, they would have 30 minutes or less to disconnect the grid. Satellites, Spacecraft and Aircraft The ACEs are specially designed to withstand high levels of radiation. On the other hand, navigational satellites and GPS birds do not have the same degree of shielding, nor do the navigational systems aboard spacecraft and commercial aircraft. The highly charged particles blasted from the sun in turn supercharge particles in the Earth's atmosphere. These particles are capable of corrupting the expected electrical impulses used by guidance and propulsion systems' computers. This data corruption could potentially alter software commands to essential operating systems. If these were disrupted in a satellite's propulsion system, the bird's orbital speed could drop low enough to cause its spirally slowly out of orbit toward the Earth's surface. The same particles degrade the efficiency of solar panels powering spacecraft. A CME's effects on a GPS extend downward from space as well. Financial systems use GPS to timestamp monetary transactions. Slowing down their computer clocks by even a fraction of second Hardening satellites is possible and but very expensive. A more cost effective way to guard against their malfunction is similar to that employed to protect the power grid. Satellite owners, including governments, would shut down the crafts' nonessential systems until the geomagnetic storm passed. Astronauts, commercial aircraft crews and passengers, and people living at altitudes above 10,000 feet would receive higher doses of ionizing radiation than anyone living near sea level. Depending on the severity of the CME event, exposures could range from near-normal up to the equivalent of receiving 100 chest X-rays. Astronauts would be at greatest risk and are routinely monitored throughout their space careers for cumulative exposure. If the International Space Station were to take a direct CME hit, the crew would be warned in advance and advised to move to the better-shielded interior areas of the structure. Earth Communications Communications systems on Earth rely on electricity to operate. A power outage cuts off electricity to phone systems. While telecommunications providers are required to have generators for back-up power, generators eventually would run out of fuel. The high level of charged particles would also disrupt transmission and reception across the radio frequency spectrum. Cell phones, shortwave and high-frequency radios, and satellite TV would experience disruptions for at least a few hours up to a few days even on the side of the Earth facing away from the CME. Not only would FM broadcasts be disrupted but also emergency responder radios, something that seemed to have happened on the U.S. Gulf Coast in early 2011 when the first of the solar bursts occurred. Security cameras would likely experience degradation of images at least in the short term. Traffic signals operate on electronically controlled timers, so that daily commute could be even worse for a time. WiFi signals are more or less immune to the effects on the radio spectrum. On the other hand, generating their radio waves depend on grid power. If that were disrupted, surfing the Internet for CME information would be out of the question. In real terms, cell phones would not burst into flames. Computers would not lose their internal magic smoke. ET could still call home. The real issue would be getting the grid back online so there would be someone able to take the call. Misconceptions There is a lot of erroneous information floating around in popular culture. Internet forums are full of bad advice regarding protecting your head by wearing a reflective hat. Others tout generous applications of SPF 45 sunscreen. The truth is, the earth's atmosphere filters out most of the direct physical effects on humans. People have been requesting the locations of video cameras for viewing the impact of the CME in their neighborhoods. Unfortunately, the really cool stuff will happen a few million miles out in space. They will see no apocalyptic sheets of flame in the streets unless they're standing too close to a power plant that didn't disconnect from the grid in time. With enough advance warning, a CME or solar flare would result in relatively minor annoyances for most people. Lacking sufficient notice, the disruption of the power grid would create ramifications on a global scale because of technology's extreme reliance on electricity."

8,Running Their Own Private Practice Is The Dream Of Many NHS Doctors,computers-technology," If you work in the NHS as a doctor or consultant, or in any other sort of medical capacity, it may well be that you are thinking about going it alone and starting your own private practice. And why not? After all, there are very many advantages to working for yourself, which is what you would be doing, as compared with working for someone else, which is what you are doing in the NHS. In the NHS, by and large you have to work the hours that the manager requires you to work, and if that happens to include working all night, so be it. Yes, you do the work for the love of the job and for seeing the amazing results that you can often get for patients who have been suffering, but working from 10.00 pm until 8.00 am is not a lot of fun, unless you like that sort of thing. When you are doing that, it doesn’t leave you a lot of time for family and friends. That said, working for the NHS does have its’ advantages. The pay is good, and it arrives on time every month. You never have to worry about how you are going to pay the next electricity bill, like many people do. However, there are downsides – as there are with everything – and one is that you are at the beck and call of managers who may need you to help cover missing people who are off sick or on holiday, and work some exceedingly long shifts as a result. All of which means that the prospect of running your own private practice may be something of which you dream. When you do that, you are your own boss – no managers – and you can decide your own hours. You never have to work nights again! That alone may be enough to convince you. However…….. Yep. You guessed it. There are a lot of advantages to running your own practice, but also disadvantages. Not the least of these is that you need somewhere to practice. That means that you need to rent a building in which to do that. Unless, of course, you are so rich that you can afford to buy one, but we’ll assume that if you are working in the NHS that is not the case. Not only do you need to rent a building, but you need to buy all the medical equipment that you need in order to attend to patients. In the NHS, that is all provided. In private practice YOU provide it. All of this means that you may need a fairly hefty bank loan in order to get started, and of course that has to be paid back. Then you have to get patients. That means that somehow you have to find patients. Yes, a lot of people prefer to see a doctor on a private basis rather than through the NHS, but you have to let them know that you are there. Since you are not going to get a flood of patients through the door on day one, it usually means word of mouth, which also means that it is going to take some time to get started. Of course, once you are up and running, you can earn a lot more than in the NHS, but first you have to get up and running. Another thing that you have to consider is that you are now going to run a business and that means there is a lot of admin that you don’t presently have to do in the NHS. Not the least of your problems is invoicing and getting paid. This is why you need to invest in a medical consultant system to handle all of the admin. A medical consultant system is absolutely essential in a private practice and can deal with the admin so that you don’t waste your time doing it, leaving you free to see your patients, which is what you should be doing anyway. It can handle your diary schedule, patient notes, procedures and diagnosis, and especially all your accounting. Furthermore, some types of software are available in the cloud and can be accessed from anywhere there is an internet connection."
9,Why should you use two way radios on your job site?,computers-technology," Health & safety are always the primary concerns for any institute, company, school, college, and/or business setup. Of course, the use of mobile phones is more frequent than hytera two way radios perhaps because there are a lot of misconceptions about these two way radios. Many business owners are making use of the two way radio technology for their superior functionality apart from the fact that it is way cheaper than any other technology including mobile phone tech. In order to prevent accidents and improve the safety and health of workers, two way radios are specifically designed for effective communication devices. Oil & gas fields, construction sites, and mining fields are not only dangerous but also harsh to operate. Health and safety are the main concern for any institute, and this is what these radios can provide without any doubt and confusion. While operating in hazardous and harsh surroundings, it is in your best interest to make use of safe and health-friendly communication devices such as two way radios. The use of cell phones is not uncommon is job sites apart from the fact that it is not a hundred percent safe approach. People use mobile phones because they are convenient, easy to carry anywhere, keep in their small pockets, and enjoy a lot of additional options to enjoy. It is all right to use mobile phones for personal use and enjoy those extra recreational and fun features, but it is not risk-free to use them on your job site. On the other hand, you can make use of two way radios as they are safe especially in sensitive sites such as mining, etc. Of course, mobile phones are multi-functional. Gone are the days when they were used as the sole means of communication only. In this day & age, people use them for more than one objective such as listing to music, watching movies and much more. The availability of too many apps has made it hard to opt for the right one and opt against the wrong one. In a situation like that, you must able to make an informed decision with some knowledge in advance. Even though the use of mobile phones is all right no matter where you are but the use of the same is not recommend on the job sites as it might cause sudden trouble especially because most Jobsites are sensitive. What is the best choice then? The best, cheapest, latest, and safest choice is the use of two way radios without any doubt and confusion. The worst part about mobile or cell phones is that they often fail to work in emergencies. On the other hand, two way radios never fail to work you, and that is why you might have noticed them in natural disasters. It is obvious that landlines and cell service towers often go abortive in the case of a disaster or emergency. Many people make use of mobile phones on their job site that’s why we hear news of mishaps each week that passes. The time has come to adopt two way radios for a better outcome and safer result."
10,Spyware – Yet Another Cyber Menace,computers-technology," The Deceitful Software That Can Take Any Computer User for a Ride No one will perhaps believe the fact that simple acts such as keyboard strokes made on a computer could make it vulnerable to the deviousness of a spyware. Spyware is actually a form of malware through which cyber criminals seek to invade computer systems to collect user information that is absolutely personal or confidential in nature. A kind of tracking software medium, spyware is a malicious program clandestinely introduced into the system to first watch the usage pattern and then slowly takeover partial control of the information setup, without giving the user even the tiniest of a hint. Called a spybot in the Internet context, it is introduced into the computer either as a virus or in the form of a new program. It then begins to spy over the entire information bank and pass on the relevant ones to the unscrupulous originators of the program – the cyber criminals who manipulate the personal information so gathered for their own benefit. Spyware does not possess the inherent quality to replicate – like the viruses and worms do. Unlike virus or worms, it also does not spread, directly. How is Spyware Introduced into A Computer? One could introduce spyware in a machine by using any of the following modes: Pop-ups. These are small windows abruptly appearing on the computer screen interface asking the user to download some program. While a pop-up can be timed to make its appearance, it can also be programmed to appear following a mouse click or a mouseover. Pop-ups may also appear when the user pulls down a menu or taskbar – also as little message boxes that pop up time and again whenever the mouse is scrolled over a specific point on the text or the task bar. Drive-by Download. A drive-by download is a program that can get installed into a system without the user knowing anything about it. This method is considered far more devious than an ordinary pop-up, since it does not seek any permission to get itself downloaded, like pop-ups always do. Drive-by download can happen even when a user is simply accessing a website or screening an HTML-scripted e-mail message. Adware. Adware generally refers to a software application that can cause an advertisement flash on the computer screen without the user’s consent. While majority of the advertising-supported software could be genuine and not engaged in spying over a private domain, there are many fraudulent ones who covertly induct spyware into the machine through adware pop-ups. For example, the revenues from the ads are unscrupulously diverted to a site that is not the one shown on the advertisement. There have also been instances of adware that can track personal information and transmit it to third parties for unethical gain. As newer strategies are being adopted by computer criminals with every passing day, it becomes imperative for a user to learn to recognize the telltale signs of spyware invasion from all possible sources, including this one from Microsoft. Anti-Spyware Solutions A host of good anti-spyware programs are now available in the market – online too - to tackle the spyware problems. A basic anti-spyware programs can work in either of the following two techniques: Real Time Protection! These solutions provide real time protection against intrusion of spyware into the system. What they actually do is to scan the entire data - that the user sift through while accessing various websites - for spyware and block all the suspicious elements. This action is almost identical to an anti-virus scan. Detection and Elimination. The second type helps in finding and isolating/destroying spyware, which have already intruded into the system. Easy-to-use and relatively more popular, these solutions are programmed to scan the contents of windows registry, operating system files, and other installed programs. At the end of the scanning process, the result is displayed on the screen. In case any threats are found, the user is presented with diverse options to deal with them in a manner he deems appropriate. For better management of the program, one can schedule the scanning on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. Combating the spyware problem has become a vital area of action for every computer user. It is therefore essential that one must find the right solution – or a combination of more than one – to fight the menace."

13,Helpful Tips to Bulletproof Your SEO Strategy,computers-technology," Search engine optimisation is a long-term investment in Edinburgh and if you are implementing the right tactics, you can get results for months to come. However, the problem is that SEO is an online marketing technique that is constantly evolving and changing. The only way to get any results from this strategy is by adapting to the various algorithm changes of the search engines and trends. Below given are a few tips that you can consider to boost your SEO strategy. Perform keyword research in a scientific way An SEO keyword is a phrase or word that Internet users are using to search for products or services online. If you want to increase your website's visibility in Google and other popular search engines, you must invest time and resources to perform keyword research in a scientific manner. Thanks to the advent of voice search, it is recommended that you avoid short-tail keyword and stick to long-tail keyword. Also, it is crucial to conduct a competitive keyword analysis before shortlisting the keywords that you would want your website to rank for. If you lack the time or the keyword research tools, you can connect with an online SEO agency in Edinburgh. Develop a content marketing plan Developing a solid content marketing plan might seem like a daunting task, but it is a necessity. If you do not have any writers within your company, you can hire the content writing services of a digital marketing agency. The professional writers will help you in coming up with fresh, new content ideas for your blog section. They will craft content based on the keywords that you have researched, which will help your website gain online visibility and drive more traffic. Also, the professional writers can help you come up with articles and blogs that are crafted as per the rules and regulations of Google's featured snippets. Having your content featured here can get you more brand awareness and help you achieve the new position zero. Establish a link building strategy Contrary to what a lot of webmasters are saying, link building continues to be an important SEO tactic. Building links can help you gain authority and earn the trust of your potential customers. However, you must not give in to backlink schemes. Black hat link building strategies will get you into trouble. You may get a lot of links in a short time, but the moment Google finds out that the links are not of good quality, your website will be penalised. So, make sure that your link building strategy is based on white hat tactics as set by Google and other search engines. Also, always give importance to quality over quantity when it comes to getting links. So, these are a few of the SEO tactics that you can consider to implement for the year 2020. This can help to make your SEO strategy bulletproof and fetch you the results that you desire. However, if you want to know specific strategies that work for your website, partner with a professional agency."
14,How To Choose The Right Material For You HDI PCBs,computers-technology," High-Density Interconnect (aka HDI) technology is gaining market approval lately as many electronics designers are trooping to get it. It is of note that HDI sales double that of its conventional lines based on the latest market trends. Ordinarily, any electronics designer must select the correct HDI PCB materials regardless of which application they are building. But with HDI, choosing the right equipment is particularly important because you are working with light, small, and powerful PCBs. The pitch is often below eight mils (equiv. 200um) while its aperture is usually below ten mils (equiv. 250um). What is an HDI Stack-Up ?: This section briefly outlines the definition of HDI stack and its role in determining its performance. The Dielectric Material Properties To Consider Before Choosing: This section describes that the best performance of HDI depends on the correct choice of dielectric materials, and is introduced from the following aspects: 2.1: Decomposition Temperature (Td) 2.2: Glass Transition Temperature (Tg) 2.3: Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) 2.4: Delamination Time 3.1: Dimensional Stability of Flexible Materials 3.2 Fluidity Control of Cladding Adhesive 3.3 Low and Thin Profile Copper Foils 3.4 Material ’s Resistance to Electron Migration of Binders 4.1: Moderate speed and loss These are currently the most popular PCB materials. They belong to the FR-4 family. Their ratio of dielectric constant to frequency response is not flat and therefore suffers from higher dielectric losses. Consequently, it can be found useful only for analog or digital applications that do not require high GHz. 4.2 High speed, low loss This category of HDI materials has a Dk. to frequency curve flatter. The result is a significant low dielectric loss, which is up to half of what is obtainable with Medium Speed materials. Applications with approximately 0 GHz requirements will find it most useful. 4.3 High speed, low loss, high signal integrity Dk's curve. The frequency is equally flat, and the dielectric loss is also quite small. Another advantage is that they eliminate unnecessary electrical noise common in other material categories. 4.4 High speed, shallow loss, high signal integrity, RF and microwave Of all the HDI materials discussed, this type of Dk.to frequency curve is the flattest. Also, they have the lowest dielectric loss. This material category is most suitable for applications with GHz requirements up to 20. In principle, materials with lower Dk and Df.

15,What is HEVC&#65311;How HEVC better than H.264&#65311; What are the advantages of HEVC&#65311;,computers-technology," Why HEVC better than H.264？ The HEVC codec offers more and better improvements than the h.264 codec, H.264 codec was first developed in 2003, it’s been a while. HEVC offers many new features, but the following benefits are of interest to consumers. Better compression Compared to the h.264 codec, HEVC offers significant improvements in compression. In fact, HEVC compresses video twice as efficiently as h.264. With HEVC, video of the same visual quality occupies only half the space.Alternatively, video with the same file size and bit rate can render better quality. To better understand the advantages of HEVC, we need to understand some of the concepts of h.264 /AVC. When you watch a Blu-ray disc, a YouTube video, or a movie from iTunes, it isn’t identical to the original raw video that comes out of the editing room. In order to fit that movie on a Blu-ray disc—or make it small enough to comfortably download from the web—the movie has to be compressed. Advanced Video Coding, also known as AVC or H.264, is the best standard for video compression in widespread use, and there are a few different methods it uses to try to reduce the file size of your video. For example, in any given frame, it can look for areas that are mostly the same color. Take this still frame of me and picture—much of the sky is the same color blue, so the compression algorithm can split the image up in to chunks—called ""macroblocks""—and say ""hey, instead of remembering the color of each pixel, we can just say that all of these chunks along the top are the same color blue."" That’s a lot more efficient than storing the color of each individual pixel, which lowers the file size of the final frame. In video, this is called intra-frame compression—compressing the data of an individual frame. AVC also uses inter-frame compression, which looks at multiple frames and notes which parts of the frame are changing—and which aren’t. Take this shot from Captain America: Civil War. The background doesn’t change much—most of the difference between frames is in Iron Man’s face and body. So, the compression algorithm can split the frame up into those same macroblock chunks and say ""you know what? These chunks don’t change for 100 frames, so let’s just display them again instead of storing the entire image 100 times."" This can reduce file size dramatically. These are just two over-simplified examples of the methods AVC/H.264 uses, but you get the idea. It’s all about making the video file more efficient without compromising quality. (Of course, any video will lose quality if you compress it too much, but the smarter these techniques are, the more you can compress a video before getting to that point.) HEVC/H.265 Compresses Videos More Efficiently, Perfect for 4K Video High Efficiency Video Coding, also known as HEVC or H.265, is the next step in this evolution. It builds off a lot of the techniques used in AVC/H.264 to make video compression even more efficient. For example, when AVC looks at multiple frames for changes—like the Captain America example above—those macroblock ""chunks"" can be a few different shapes and sizes, up to a maximum of 16 pixels by 16 pixels. With HEVC, those chunks can be up to 64×64 in size—much larger than 16×16, which means the algorithm can remember fewer chunks, thus decreasing the size of the overall video. Improved interframe motion prediction A major factor in video compression is the predicted motion (or lack thereof) between frames. The smart video codec can save space by referencing the pixel while it’s still (solid state background image) instead of reproducing it. With improved motion prediction, HEVC can provide smaller file sizes and higher compression quality. Improved interframe prediction Video compression actually benefits from analyzing the ""movement"" within a single frame, so that the single frame video can be compressed more effectively. This can be achieved by describing the pixel layout using a mathematical function rather than the actual pixel value.This feature takes up less space than pixel data, reducing the file size. However, codecs must support sufficiently advanced mathematical functions for the technology to really work.The interframe prediction function of HEVC is more detailed than that of h.264, which supports motion prediction in 33 directions, while the latter only supports 9 directions. Parallel Processing HEVC can encode and decode the partial unit and fragment layer of the frame independently. This means that the decoding process can be split across multiple parallel processing threads, taking advantage of more efficient decoding opportunities on existing standard multicore processors. With the increasing resolution of video, this efficiency improvement requires decoding video at a viewable speed on low-end hardware. Maximum higher frame size The world is becoming increasingly ""HD"", and HEVC supports this. Using HEVC, video can be encoded up to 8K UHD or 8192×4320 pixels. Currently, only a few cameras can produce 8K video, and very few monitors can display this resolution.But just as HD is today’s standard, we can expect 4K, or even 8K, to eventually make similar breakthroughs. HEVC main IPTV program head end system, based on this as the core derived a variety of streaming media applications, such as Netfli, video conference, online teaching system, web celebrity live and so on…. Here is a brief summary about the HEVC hardware and software encoder of the author’s personal choice for your reference: Explain the importance of encoder in IPTV solution, the core of streaming video and audio encoders is to provide high quality and stable live streaming, then send it to the streaming service for distribution, and finally the client accesses the streaming server to watch the program. Because it is a very important source in the whole scheme, it is necessary to analyze the streaming media video and audio encoders. 1.Hardware video encoders use independent SOC chips to encode and push video and audio signals, the ENC5 Ultra HD h 264 h 265 hardware video encoder encoding algorithm is used to transmit it to the network in the form of network packets. Since it only focuses on one thing, it is stable and has very low power consumption,It can provide 100ms low latency live streaming.As for video and audio quality, it mainly focuses on encoder main chip provider, please check Chip algorithm evaluation. (I recommend ENC5 hevc compression,As shown in figure 3.1) 2.The software encoder adopts the combination of video and audio acquisition card and computer, video and audio signals are encoded and pushed by computer software. 10 years ago, our client would build such a system, but now it is basically on the verge of obsoletion. The advantage of this system is that video has good quality with low code rate and flexible extension function, but running on high code rate or H 265 coding algorithm requires a lot of computer configuration requirements, and it is very unstable to use Windows operating system at the same time,It cannot provide low latency live streaming.(As shown in figure 3.2) Why Do I Need a Hardware Encoder? The answer is simply that it really depends on what you’re looking to achieve. The average video streamer using a live streaming service can often get away with using software encoding. However, for professional applications, hardware encoders are turnkey devices dedicated solely to the fast, efficient and reliable encoding of video streams. Hardware encoders have far superior processing power, use high-quality video inputs like SDI and HDMI, and will allow users to stream higher quality video at lower bandwidth rates with lower latency. Example use cases of HEVC encoders by industry include: Broadcast – for backhaul, live remote interviews, return feeds and remote production Enterprise – for internet streaming of your all-hands meetings, remote contribution as well as IPTV and digital signage House of Worship – for online streaming and multi-site delivery Defense – for mission critical Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) applications"

17,The Reasons Why You Need EICR Testing On Your Property,computers-technology," All electrical installations will deteriorate over time, but we often overlook this fact because the wiring is hidden away inside the walls and ceilings and under flooring, so we never see it. The old saying ""out of sight, out of mind"" very definitely applies in this case. How fast it deteriorates will depend on the amount of use it gets, the working environment, and the maintenance schedule, if any. In order to ensure the safety of employees and customers, the electrical installation should be inspected at appropriate intervals as part of a preventive maintenance programme. Not only does this prove that your premises are compliant with the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989, but it also resolves any issues with insurance if there should a fire or any other electrical issue, because the inspector will have issued you with an EICR certificate – an Electrical Installation Condition Report – which shows that everything was in order. Indeed, more and more commercial insurance companies are insisting that testing is carried out on a regular basis. If there should be a fire or other accident involving electricity and you are found to be at fault you will be deemed to have committed a criminal offence, and insurers will not pay any compensation or fines resulting. The Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 state: ""As may be necessary to prevent danger, all systems shall be maintained so as to prevent, so far as is reasonably practicable, such danger"". The Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 require an employer to ensure the safety of equipment used, whether fixed or portable, that requires the use of electrical energy. The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 requires the employer to ensure the health and safety of everyone in the workplace, and that includes customers, visitors, any contractors, or the general public. Finally, the Management of Health and Safety Work Regulations 1999 require an employer to carry out risk assessments to ensure the lowest level of danger for employees and ""ensure the safety of the workplace as far as is possible."" So you can see that there are quite a number of laws covering safety and security. As far as an EICR certificate is concerned, the electrical industry has come up with some guidelines that say that industrial premises should have the wiring checked every three years, other commercial premises every five, and domestic premises every ten years. Additionally, an inspection should be carried out every time the occupancy of premises changes. There are, however, reasons why an EICR should be carried out more frequently, one of these being the age of the installation. Older installations should be checked more often. Environmental conditions may also have an effect. If the property has a swimming pool an EICR should be carried out yearly, but only in regard to the parts relating to the pool. If vandalism has occurred, an EICR should be carried out, and also if a homeowner has any concerns about the electrical installation. Furthermore, an EICR will show up any situation that may deteriorate and result in considerably more expense later than if any alterations are carried out straight away."

19,Restore deleted and damaged hard drive partitions,computers-technology," Almost every computer user has experience data loss on at least one occasion due to accidentally deleting files, formatting a hard drive, or removing a hard drive partition. Although most computers only have one physical hard drive, they're usually logically divided into two or more partitions, which each act as separate hard drives. Windows, for example, typically creates at least two partitions, with one being used for system files. This may be hidden from the operating system, since there's no drive letter assigned to it. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) often include at least one further partition for recovering files and programs which shipped with the computer. Sometimes, it's safe to delete these, but there's always a risk of accidentally deleting the wrong partition. Windows always warns you before deleting a partition, stating that all data stored on it will be deleted. Fortunately, that's not really the case. When you delete a partition, it disappears immediately, and you can use the disk space it previously occupied to create a new partition or extend an existing one. If Windows were really going to delete all data byte-by-byte, it would take much longer. What really happens is that the previously occupied space is made available to the rest of the operating system, which means it may eventually be overwritten when you install new programs or create or copy over new files on it. Until that happens, you have a window of opportunity for using data recovery software to get back what you lost. Sometimes, it's even possible to recover partitions and files which were lost ages ago. Active@ Partition Recovery is a freeware toolkit which was designed to help you exploit that window of opportunity. It allows you to recover deleted or damaged logical drive partitions under Windows, WinPE, Linux, and DOS operating environments. To minimize the risk of any further damage or the chances of overwriting deleted data, thus permanently destroying it, the software runs in its own self-contained boot environment. That means you can use it with your primary hard disk, even if there isn't an operating system installed on your computer. It also recovers data from external hard drives and USB flash disks and memory cards. Furthermore, you can use the software to recover from a wide range of file systems natively supported by Windows and Linux. The latest edition sports a new and improved recovery kernel with lots of tweaks and performance upgrades. Version 19, released in October 2019, has also been redesigned to offer a more modern and user-friendly experience with an overhauled registration and welcome screen. Recovery routines have also been improved for volumes with 4KB sector sizes. The Last Chance recovery methods, which you can use to search for and recover deleted files of specific formats, has seen some upgrades too, with added support for Canon Raw Image (CR3) files and Finale Notation Files (MUSX) file signatures. Now you can easily recover data from your computer or external devices lost due to accidental deletion, damage by malware or power failure, and more.
