1,Choosing the Right Kind of Dental Floss,shopping," At a glance, it might seem like all dental floss is the same. However, when you visit your local store for oral hygiene products, you’re likely to find a ton of different options to choose from. It can be hard to know which one is right for you. The following post covers the various dental floss types that your dentist might recommend based on your situation. Unwaxed Floss Unwaxed floss is a very common kind of dental floss made of a nylon material comprised of several strands twisted together. It’s much thinner than other types of floss, meaning it can fit more easily in smaller gaps between your teeth; it’s also unflavored, so you don’t have to worry about any chemicals on the floss. The downside is that unwaxed floss is more likely to shred or break, so you need to be especially careful when using it. Waxed Floss Waxed floss is made the same way as unwaxed floss except it’s covered in a layer of wax. This adds extra strength to the floss, making it less likely to shred or break at the long time. The wax also makes it easier to move the floss between your teeth. However, the additional wax layer makes this type of floss slightly thicker than unwaxed floss, meaning it won’t fit into smaller gaps quite as easily. The choice between unwaxed and waxed floss usually comes down to what’s easier to use with your particular mouth. Dental Tape Dental tape is much thicker and flatter than regular dental floss, to the point that it resembles actual tape. It’s usually not suitable for anyone who has teeth that are close together; it’s mainly meant for those with larger gaps that call for thicker floss. It comes in unwaxed and waxed versions depending on your preferences and needs. Polytetrafluorethylene Floss (PTFE) Compared to the material usually used to make dental floss, polytetrafluorethylene is quite strong and is less likely to become damaged. It’s also a very smooth material and can very easily slide into the gaps between your teeth. However, the creation of PTFE floss involves perfluorooctanoic acid, which is a carcinogen that can damage your immune system. It is therefore not recommended to use this type of floss for an extended period of time. Super Floss Super floss comes with a stiff end threader that makes it easier to maneuver under dental bridges and through braces. It’s extremely useful for people who have any kind of dental fixture they need to work around during their oral hygiene routine. That said, this type of floss may not be suitable for those with especially small gaps between the teeth, as it can be difficult to fit the threader through. Flossing is essential for preventing gum disease and cavities between the teeth, so you’ll want to make sure you’ve chosen the right tool for the job. Talk to your dentist at your next checkup. Once they’re done examining and cleaning your teeth, they can give you tips on what kinds of oral hygiene products are best for you."

4,How to put a summer wardrobe together,shopping," Ah, Summertime! Don’t you love that time of the year? warm weather, the beach, the sun and the ability to wear different clothes would be impossible in cold weather. If you look through your wardrobe and are lost at sea at what to wear this summer, I have the right tips for you to put together the perfect summer wardrobe and look fabulous this season. With no further ado, let us dive in. Understand the weather Know your style. Understand your lifestyle. Consider your body shape. Take your budget into account. Find out suitable fabrics for summertime. Know the basic summer essentials you need. Understand the weather. The weather is the first thing you need to consider before spending money on any clothing item. I say this because the temperature in different summer locations varies from mildly warm to hot and humid. The summer clothes a person would need to wear in a warm place like London would be completely different from a person who lives in New York where temperatures can be as high as 40 degrees. For example, a person living in a place where summer temperatures are mildly warm with low humidity levels l can wear a pair of jeans trousers but the latter that live in a hot and humid environment will fare better wearing a pair of shorts. Know your style. The second thing you need to consider is your style. Here is another crucial element that needs to be considered when you are putting together a summer wardrobe. In other words, you need to ask these questions: Do you like bold colours, patterns and silhouettes or prefer neutral colours with classic lines? Do you like flowy silhouettes and are inspired by Western and prairie styles? Are you drawn to styles worn by 40s, 50s and 60s movie stars like Sophia Loren, Elizabeth Taylor and Dita von Teese? Are you a fan of chunky jewellery or do you prefer simple but statement jewellery? Do you like to look Glam, Laidback, Chic or Boho? Answer all these questions and more before you go shopping. That way, you can build a summer wardrobe that consists of clothes you love wearing at all times. Know your lifestyle. Thirdly, take a look at your lifestyle before putting together your summer wardrobe.. Ask yourself these questions? What kind of activities do you like? What places do I visit? Do I have an active social life? After all, there is no point spending money on that sexy swimsuit you see n the mall when you don’t go out in the pool or go to the beach. It also doesn’t make sense for you to buy that blazer dress when you don’t go clubbing. Do you get the idea? Think about that so that you won’t waste money buying inappropriate clothes. Know your physique. There is nothing as atrocious as wearing summer outfits that don’t compliment your body shape. There are certain questions you need to ask yourself when you are creating your summer wardrobe. Are you pear, rectangular, inverted triangle, apple or hourglass-shaped? After you have answered these questions, identify what type of clothes compliment your figure. There is no point wearing a crop top when you have a large belly or a tank top when you have flabby arms. Here is a quick tip to choosing summer clothes that compliment your body shape: Pear shape. Women with this body shape have heavy hips, thighs and narrow shoulders. Best clothes for pear-shaped women ladies are: Dark coloured flowing trousers, skirts and shorts. Bright coloured tops with details on the chest and shoulder area. Strapless maxi dress. Mid to high rise shorts sewn with soft fabrics. For swimwear, pear-shaped ladies should wear strapless or bandeau style bikini tops. Also wear bikini tops with ruffles to add volume to the bust area. When picking bikini bottoms, high waisted bottoms or sarongs compliment pear-shaped ladies. Apple Shape. This shape has a thick torso. Ladies with this figure should wear clothes that elongate the body. Clothes that flatter ladies with apple-shaped figures should wear: High waisted shorts. Rompers. Maxi dresses are cut under the bust. For swimwear, choose swimwear with a Deep V-neckline to accentuate the bust and lengthen the body. Also, wear high waisted bikini bottoms with control/side panels to cinch in the waist and stomach. Rectangle Shape. Ladies with the body shape are straight from top to bottom without a defined waist. Best summer clothes that fit rectangle-shaped ladies are: Bermuda shorts, Flowy trousers and skirts. Mini skirts and dresses. For swimwear, one-piece swimsuits, tank tops, halter neck tops and tie-side bikini bottoms flatter women with this shape. The inverted triangle Ladies with this body shape have broad shoulders, a defined waist and narrow hips. The best summer outfits that flatter the inverted triangle are; Tops with deep v- neck, tank tops Tank tops Flared dresses Mini flared skirts. Bright coloured shorts Flared trousers. Boyfriend shorts Mid-rise shorts. For swimwear, women with the inverted triangle should choose the ones that make their shoulders look narrower and create volume in the bottom. Choose bikinis tied at the sides and swim shorts with ruffled skirts to make the hips look wider. The Hourglass Hourglass-shaped women have the best of all worlds because they have balanced bodies with a defined waist. They need to choose summer outfits that show off their feminine shape. Best summer outfits for hourglass shaped women are: Mid to high rise shorts. Maxi dresses Midi wrap dresses. Shirt dress with a belt. From swimwear, any style of bikini would be good. Know your budget. We know that shopping can be hard especially if you don’t love it or have limited resources. If you have enough money to buy clothes for a summer wardrobe, follow the tips above. However, if you are on a budget, follow the tips below for your summer wardrobe. Know where to shop. Check out consignment, thrift stores and even flea markets for summer clothes.

5,Top Tips to Choose the Best Mascara for You,shopping," Finding the best mascara for your needs is never easy. Every year, thousands of beauty products make their way onto UAE shelves. Each product promises to achieve amazing results, but few deliver. According to Business Wire, the UAE cosmetic industry will be worth more than $3 Billion by 2025. The booming industry means that even more products will make their way to your favourite beauty store. However, finding the right products will become a lot more difficult. Luckily, By Mina Al Sheikhly is here to help. Here are our tips to choosing the right mascara every time. Focus on Formula If the eyes are the windows to the soul, the mascara formula is the window frame. There’s a reason why beauty brands invest such a great deal of time in developing and protecting their formulas. Without a good formula, the mascara will not give your lashes the desired effect. The first step to finding your mascara match is to decide what your needs are. Mascaras can lengthen, thicken, curl, and volumize the appearance of your lashes. Knowing exactly what you need will make the process that much simpler. Understand Your Lash Type For each lash category, there’s a By Mina Al Sheikhly mascara. Short Lashes – avoid mascara wands with thin bristles. Thicker brushes hold more product, which will capture naturally short lashes to create a fluttering look. Uneven Lashes – this usually happens because of damage. If you have been wearing fake lash extensions, you may notice more of your eyelashes falling out. A mascara filled with natural oils with a bigger brush can nourish your lashes and help them regain even length. Straight Lashes – a curling mascara will enhance the natural length of your lashes, while adding allure to your eyes. To add a lift and curl to your lashes, focus the application on the corners of your eyes. This will create a bold cat eye effect. Long Lashes - if you already have long lashes, opt for a more natural look. This will create the effect of having extension lashes even without wearing one. Or, if you want, you can add even more volume to make your eyes pop. Choose a Dark Mascara When selecting your shade, it’s important to keep your skin tone and natural hair colour in mind. The shade of your mascara will impact the type of finish it creates. Dark mascaras are excellent for creating bolder, lengthened looks. They can open the eyes and give your lashes a naturally thick and full effect. Depending on the application, your dark mascara can also be toned down to create a more natural look. Choose the Best Brand The right mascara brand will be cruelty-free, have an excellent formula, and also have a trusted range of products for you to choose from. By Mina Al Sheikhly is a brand designed with your needs in mind. Produced and packaged in Milan, Italy, our products provide premium results in the comfort of your home or wherever your makeup bag leads you. During the design phase, our founder, Mina Al Sheikhly scoured the globe and partnered with industry experts to refine each product’s formula.

And you’ll learn about the journey that tights have taken to become so popular! The history of tights The first pantyhose were created in the early 11th century and served the function of promoting proper circulation of the legs. They were also meant to protect against the cold. Interestingly, at first, they were reserved only for men of aristocratic families and were mainly made of silk. A breakthrough in the 20th century It was not until the 20th century that tights started to appear in women’s closets, however, at that time they were stockings combined with panties. A breakthrough came when the Du Pont company introduced the first synthetic fibre, nylon, from which tights are still made today. The comfort of wearing the first tights was very low, they were uncomfortable and slipped off the legs. Despite this, many women could not imagine life without them. With the solution to the problem came a scientist Allen Gant. He introduced the so-called “Panti — Legs”, which were a combination of stockings and panties. They conquered the hearts of all women in the world and that’s when the golden moment for tights came, in the 1960s. They became an indispensable accessory to every little black dress. No woman could imagine leaving home without them, because they beautifully expose the legs. Lace boom A great hit turned out to be the introduction of tights made of lace, which took place as late as in the 1980s.

7,Why CBD Boxes are Becoming so Popular Nowadays,shopping," CBD boxes have been increasingly popular in recent years. This is due to their ability to make delivery far more convenient for customers. There are a variety of reasons why CBD Boxes are useful for shipping things, but the most important reason is that they are inexpensive and can provide excellent protection for whatever you are delivering. Here are a few of the advantages you can expect if you purchase them. Advantages of CBD Boxes Over Others To begin with, when you get personalized boxes from a provider, you will receive a warranty. This way, if something goes wrong with your shipment, the company will stand behind it and make sure you get your money back. If your things do not come with a warranty, you should buy the basic boxes because they are less likely to be damaged. However, there are times when regular delivery simply isn't sufficient. Available in Multiple Sizes You can select from a range of materials when placing your order. You can order the materials ahead of time to ensure that they are ready and delivered when you need them. They're also available in a range of sizes, so you'll have plenty of options. If you have a big number of items to mail, consider having them packed together in larger boxes. However, depending on the size of your things, you can ship whatever you want, whether it's a small box or a large one. Different Types of CBD Boxes The boxes are built in a variety of ways when it comes to the actual construction. The most popular type is made of cardboard, although there are also several made of synthetic materials. You'll want to be sure that whatever you purchase is sturdy enough to hold whatever you intend to place inside. If you have any worries about how durable the box should be, look at the evaluations for some of the most well-known brands. Customer reviews are an excellent way to ensure that you are getting the greatest boxes for your money. Even when you acquire the boxes, you need to make sure that you have them protected. You'll want to double-check that they're properly insulated and that all of the edges are shut. This will help to safeguard all of your products from anything that can happen during delivery, such as spills or tears. Great Design of Custom CBD Boxes When it comes to these boxes, one thing to consider is how you want to use them. You'll want to go with a design that's both useful and appealing. You should also pick a hue that complements the items you're selling or showing. Consider your company's general design and feel, and choose something that will complement rather than detract from it. Most consumers buy CBD boxes because they like the look and feel of the goods, so make sure your boxes match the goods. Add Attractive design to Your CBD Boxes You can make your CBD boxes even more useful and personalized by including some humor in them. There are a variety of accessories on the market today that can help your bespoke boxes stand out and be more appealing to consumers, so you might want to think about it. You can buy novelty cutouts of popular cartoon characters, have letters put on the boxes, or even make your own labels. When it comes to adding fun to the presentation of your business products, the alternatives are boundless, and the amount of creativity you can apply to the objects themselves is limitless. Conclusion: If you need boxes for your business that aren't in stock, there are a lot of vendors online like OXO Packaging that can provide you with high-quality CBD bespoke boxes at a reasonable price. You may quickly purchase the boxes you require and utilize them to carry out the essential functions of your business, ensuring that you always have something new on hand to suit your consumers' needs. This can help you establish a solid business reputation, which will encourage clients to return to buy more things from you."

10,What is the deal with Barefoot  Shoes?,shopping," This is what I hear often. A lot of people do not get the fascination, the love for barefoot shoes. The words used for them are; ""Ugly, Weird, Goofy Looking, Painful.""  I had said some of those many years ago back in 2011, before my very first pair. Vibram Five Fingers KSO's was the ""it"" for me. Since I have tried other brands out and you know what? I'm hooked!  The comfort, the space, the general ""This is amazing!"" feeling I get when I wear them. Recently I had been wearing regular tennis shoes to work(medical) and I have been hurting these past few months. My feet kill me, my knees, hips, and back are all sore. I knew I had to return to full-time barefoot shoe-wearing, and not just saving it for the weekends. So, I started checking my favorite brands to see about a barefoot tennis shoe that can go pretty well with my line of work.  I was so down because they were so expensive. I didn't want to pay a high price for shoes that can be potentially ruined by my job. So I settled for a name-brand clog, that everyone swore was comfy. 2 weeks in, and my whole body was screaming ""No!!!!"" I desperately scoured Youtube for reviews of barefoot shoes, just hoping.  Aha!!  Xero Shoes! I googled them and was looking at a pair of their Prio's for $89. Not bad, but I didn't get them at that moment, and a few days later I got an email. I did sign up for marketing and saw they were having a sale on a new line which was the  Spring 2022 line so I checked it out. I was impressed and thought one was so cute! The Kelso, it came in 3 colors for ladies. Black and White, Pink, and White. I honestly wanted the Pink but knew the Black/White is better for my scrubs. I ordered these the 1st and let me tell you this, they don't play with shipping! I got them on the 4th!! I was so impressed just by that. I ripped open the box, and man these felt great just in my hands! I threw my clogs off and put these babies on. Wow!!  I was in heaven! I honestly can't describe the feeling except as perfection. It was everything I needed in a barefoot shoe. Very light on my feet, soft and supple but protect them against rocks, sticks,etc. And so cute with my casual and work clothes!  I took my dog out for a hike the next day and not once did my feet hurt. I've been wearing them since and planning on my next 2 pairs from Xero Shoes. I'm loving the wide, roomy toe box which allows our toes to naturally spread out as they should. Our feet carry such a load every day, and my years working in nursing homes, taught me one important thing. If you take care of your feet, they will take care of you! What we wear on our feet doesn't only impact them, but our knees, hips, and back as well. Be comfortable, and take care of your feet!!"

12,Affordable Jewelry To Gift Your Lady Love,shopping," We've all heard that a little sparkle goes a long way when it comes to wooing your girl. Especially, if she wasn't anticipating the dazzling gift in the first place. What we mean is that everyone, including you, gives jewelry as a gift on important occasions such as Valentine's Day or an anniversary. As a result, the entire endeavor becomes predictable, and the element of surprise gets removed from this equation of love. But if you offer her a beautiful jewelry gift on a random day of the year to show your appreciation, it will make her feel extra loved and special. She will understand that you are not just buying her something because the occasion calls for it. But because you value her presence in your life. So heed our advice and buy her something incredible like a pair of Dakota silver huggies and give it to her on a day when she will be least expecting it. Maybe after a tough work week? The huggies will surely cheer her up, and make the moment memorable for years to come. Now, you may be wondering, ""Do I really want to spend money on fine jewelry when it isn't even a special celebration?"" Here's a little secret: You don't need to spend a fortune to showcase your adoration. You can easily buy fashion jewelry that looks as good as fine jewelry. And to be honest, jewelry is jewelry, regardless of the type. Here Is Our Affordable Jewelry List Just for You! Both hoops and huggies are great alternatives to the same old studs. And they make a great addition to the jewelry collection because they serve two distinct functions. Huggies contribute to a simple style with a touch of shine, whereas hoops function as a dramatic statement piece. There are many other types of huggies, but the Dakota silver one provides an easy and fashionable look with its pleasing pink body. And if she likes wearing flashy pieces, she'll appreciate a set of 14k gold hoops. Furthermore, why not give both? They are budget-friendly, so you will be able to afford them both and she will have pieces for both subtle and bold looks. Another great thing about these baubles is they are super comfortable. Both Dakota silver huggies and 14k gold hoops are neither too big nor too little and have secure claps that ensure they remain in place. Chains with a gleaming golden luster are the hallmark of high fashion. They can range from delicate to chunky, depending on size and length. You can get both types, exactly like the hoops and huggies, because she will be able to use them to accommodate her different styles based on her mood and events. We recommend stainless steel pieces with 14k gold plating, just like the 14k gold hoops. The thickness of the plating determines the piece's durability. So, better plating means a sturdier chain. Additionally, she'll appreciate that you thought about the quality of your gift, and it will be the perfect alternative if you don't want to buy something made out of pure gold. Since the gift is not for any special occasion like an anniversary or engagement, you don't have to buy anything like eternity or solitaire rings. Instead, go for a stackable ring set that compliments her style! And right now meaningful motif rings are all the rage. So you can get a handful of these, and she can use them to make her own unique ring stacks. Just so you know dainty, motif rings go really well with the design of the Dakota silver huggies.

To save you from this unwanted havoc, some guidelines have been listed below that would help you in buying appropriate makeup: Consult A Dermatologists: What major bungles do people usually make is that they purchase beauty product which they think is right for them however not even slightly mulling over the fact that whether or not it is liked by their skin? To avoid such mix-ups it is always advised to know your skin type and other necessary facts from a dermatologist before stepping your feet in the ""makeup universe"".

Go For Reputable Brands Only: Gather information about what type of makeup you want to buy, is not enough but the real skill is to differentiate between the authentic and scam makeup products thus it is always recommended to buy cosmetics from those outlets that are well-grounded and renowned because they already have an enormous clientele as they've gained their customers trust through meeting their expectations, therefore, there are no to zero chances of any glitches however a substandard makeup would show its true colours once you wear it.

15,What is the Best Setting for an Engagement Ring? ,shopping," Soon after a person meets the love of their life, the next step is to get a perfect diamond engagement ring to experience an unforgettable proposal. However, another decision to be made in this step is paying attention to the ring setting. A perfect ring setting helps boost the sparkle and beauty of a diamond ring. The right setting holds the stone and the whole look of the engagement ring. The Solitaire Ring Setting The most classic and common setting for engagement rings is the solitaire ring setting. The center stone captures the user’s eyes and holds the factor of simplicity. This makes this setting more appealing. It belongs to prong settings with small metal claws that keep diamonds in the right place. Maximum light passes through the diamond, reflecting it back for viewers to see. It is highly popular these days and is the correct fit for people who want an elegant design and symbol of commitment. Three Stone Ring Setting This setting contains three stones and is another version of the side stone ring setting. Two other expensive stones flank the center diamond in this ring. The side stone contains sapphires or other diamonds. The best thing about it is that the center diamond easily blends with the side stones. Most people consider a diamond flanked by two small side stones more appealing than a diamond flanked by two large stones. Tension Setting In this type of ring, pressure holds the previous gem or diamond in the right place. The jeweler cuts tiny grooves into the metal where the diamond comes in contact with the band. The diamond edges are pushed forcefully and tightly by the tension of the metal into the grooves. This type of tension set ring is very unique and holds intrigue. It allows diamonds to sparkle and be visible. Claw Setting The claw setting holds the gem or diamond ring by claws or tiny slivers of metal. These claws give a shape of a basket around the diamond. The claw tips secure the stone’s edges firmly. The best advantage of this claw setting is that the setting allows the maximum light in the diamond, so you get the most sparkle. Channel Setting A channel setting holds the diamonds and gemstones very firmly by setting into a two-metal strip-made groove. This type of setting looks great and is enhanced in engagement rings. This type of setting goes around the whole band. A channel setting secures the diamond, which doesn’t snag on clothes easily. This ring setting goes with a contemporary and sleek appearance. This setting provides impressive glitter as little diamonds are also set into the ring’s band. There are fewer chances of entangling this ring setting in your clothing. Pave Setting Pace set diamonds add a great dazzle in engagement rings, and tiny metal beads are used in this setting to closely and securely hold the diamond and get a dazzling surface. Pave set diamonds are used mostly in engagement rings as enhancement while they may be main features in other rings. Small diamonds are paved in this setting. They are placed next to each other directly without gaps, as these little sparkles give the impression that the setting has been made with diamonds. Diamonds are inserted within ring metal in pave setting, and using mini prongs, they are held securely."
16,36 DD - The question for the perfect bra and the surprises along the way.,shopping," As any woman can attest to, finding the perfect bra is a challenge that is not only frustrating, but essential to the modern woman’s wardrobe. No one, myself included, likes to wear any item of clothing for several hours only to want out of it in a matter of minutes. Yet this is often the situation with bras. Have I found myself doing precisely that? Yeah. Is it possible to find the perfect bra? Good question. When I started this endeavor, I wasn’t sure, but I was more than willing to try. So, as the saying goes, challenge accepted. One disclaimer for my search is I did not go to a bra boutique where they measure and try to help you find the perfect size and bra for your figure. I thought before approaching this task that most women don’t despite being told in numerous articles, podcasts, influencer videos, etc., that it’s the only way to get the perfect bra. Several years ago, I did go to a boutique that claimed to have the “best-fittings in the city”, but I honestly didn’t find the experience worth it. I’ve found that the key is to measure yourself several times, be honest, and accept the size based on your calculations. I wanted to pursue my goal in a systematic manner and decided that the first thing I needed to do was do a quick look through the internet and a few stores, okay, a lot of stores, to see what my criteria was for a perfect bra. This included the best balance I could determine for the best bra for the best price. If I couldn’t find one, then I was going to try and find one that was as close to perfect as possible. Did you notice I used the term “my criteria”? Above all else, bras are a highly personal purchase since there is more than one difference between one bra and another as well as one person to the next. No two people are the same with the same tastes and comfort factors. While my search for the perfect bra may not be exactly what you hold as the golden standard for yourself, hopefully you will benefit from my experience. I looked at a ton of bras online and in stores and realized that there were two things that I looked at when initially looking for a bra. (To be completely honest, there are three, but I took it as a given that while size is an option, it should not be a visual factor in the search for a bra. Besides, that’s a different article all together. So, please trust me when I say that I did my due diligence. I measured a bunch of times, made the calculations, took the average, and found my REAL size of bra.) The two aspects of a bra that first grab my attention? Color. Style. That’s right. I found the initial features that attract my attention are color and style. I don’t think I’m the first person to ever say that seeing the usual bra colors for a well-endowed woman can be pretty underwhelming. How exciting is it to find white and black bras? Or…the coveted nude / beige? Yeah, not exactly the highlight of my day, week, or month either. So, color in a larger cup bra is pretty unique and checks one of my “covet” boxes. As for style… this is another category that I find both equally appealing and frustrating. I love the flexibility of demi-cups, (appealing) but most are either flimsy for my cup size (which isn’t that large) or fail what I like to call the “jiggle” test (frustrating). This involves bending over at the waist and shaking your shoulders side to side to see if anything jiggles out of the cups of the bra. At the same time, I love full-coverage bras for the over-all wearability and support (appealing), but most look like something my grandmother would have approved of (frustrating). Another style of bra I love is the minimizer bra since these lovelies make it possible for me to wear button front shirts without having the buttons pop open (appealing).  Problem is, they rarely stand-up to holding the girls snug without becoming uncomfortable or the underwire digging into areas of the human body that should not happen (frustrating). I have to admit to one other little aspect that really appeals to me and despite more representation as of late, it remains mostly elusive to those of us who are not small, in either cup size or band width. Lace. I love lace. The more lace, the better. Colorful. Plain. Ornate. Multi-hued. Soft. Lots and lots of lace. Did I mention I love lace? As you can imagine, I find simply LOOKING at bras an appealing and frustrating task, but the effort can be worth it, especially when you find a gem and get a bra that is as close to perfect as you’ve imagined. The list of traits I use to consider a bra perfect for me, after the initial look are: Underwire. I love keeping the girls where they are supposed to be. Lots of people argue that non-wired bras are better for you in the long run, but I have never found a bra without wire that is comfortable and keeps the required separation between the ladies. Lace. I think I covered this one already. Keep in mind, I’m looking for the perfect bra. PERFECT. Support. There is absolutely no point in strapping on a bra that doesn’t give some kind of support. I’m not looking for a sports bra that keeps them from moving even an inch while I’m doing burpees or jogging. I’m simply referring to an everyday, this is going to look and feel great, kind of bra. Wider shoulder straps. No matter what the bra expert or novice bra influencer says, I refuse to wear a bra without reasonable straps. They offer stability. They offer support. They offer comfort. I could go on a real word rampage on this one, showing all the reasons why a wider strap is better than a pencil thin strap for women who are in the same situation as myself, but I’ll save that for another day. Again, my bra. My opinion. 2 to 3 hook closure. This impacts the overall support of the bra. If the hooks in the back are simply meant to hold the bra together, I’d think a one hook closure would be enough, but that isn’t really what they are there for. The number of hooks can directly impact the level of support offered to the bra. I like both, depending on the bra. Supportive coverage. Demi bras and full-coverage bras can offer the same supportive coverage depending on how well they are made. Prior to this experience I would have sworn it was impossible to find a demi-bra that would give me what I was seeking, but I did. Yeah, I was surprised too. Nevertheless, my go-to is usually a full-coverage for daily attire and now, a demi-cup will be for those occasions I need something just a little more “open” across the front. Comfort. Is the fabric soft? Silky? Not itchy? The feel of the fabric combined with all the other features should lead to a comfortable bra. When the bra is on, it should feel like you are wearing a bra, one that you are happy to wear all day. Quality. I want to believe that most companies out there do their best to build a great bra. Otherwise, they’d be out of business faster than they could think up a solution to poor craftsmanship. The stitching, type of elastic, quality of fabric, finishing touches, everything that goes into the making of a bra needs to be done with quality as a focus. If the bra is of poor quality, it will fall apart and the repeat business for the company who made it can kiss follow-up sales good-bye. (Results coming…) My goal was to find the PERFECT bra. I tried on what I felt was a respectable number of bras, 20. I felt that with a lot of online research that included looking at customer reviews as well as articles about great bras, I should be able to find a perfect bra without trying on a thousand, okay a hundred, bras.  Honestly, I don’t think my sanity could handle trying on that many bras. I was not interested in purchasing a bra, or five, that would be okay. I wanted a perfect bra or one as close to perfect that I could find. At times, this challenge felt impossible. The reviews were a great tool to filter out the majority of poor-quality bras, but they lead me to try on a few that were not at all what I would expect for the price and hype. The articles were educational and directed me to trying on several bras, but again, there were a few that didn’t match up to my expectations, especially when it came to the reputation of the publisher for the various articles. Nevertheless, I had accepted the challenge and was determined to see it through. With all of that said, here’s what ended up happening. I eliminated well over half of the bras after the first try since they were so far from tolerable that I barely had them on before I was desperately reaching for the clasp. They were horrible. I will not mention the names of the brands since I feel that these bras didn’t work for me, but they may for someone else. It wasn’t my goal to run a smear campaign on the brands that didn’t work. Furthermore, many of these bras were from companies that are well known in the industry and have been in the business for ages. While many women are obviously fine with their products, I wasn’t. What made them horrible? Great question and one that I will happily reveal to you. Besides, you deserve to know where I drew the line on my top features for a perfect bra and the rest that didn’t make the cut. First… BULLET BRAS!  I honestly thought the bullet bra shape or cone shape that was popular from the 40’s to the 60’s in America was well over. Yet, here I was, 2022 and I found bras with that cup shape…on me. I didn’t think my breast shape is that strange, but… Second… ARE YOU SURE THIS IS THE CORRECT BAND SIZE? I’m an average size band, 36, and a few of the bras were so tight I couldn’t get the hook and eye closure close enough to touch, let alone fasten. Again, I honestly thought maybe there was something wrong with me. I had to remind myself that I had done my due diligence prior to the try on phase of this adventure in bra trials. I watched multiple bra sizing videos, measured myself multiple times, and found my best size. These bras were not the right band size. Third… YOU CALL THIS FABRIC? If I couldn’t stand touching the fabric because it was too rough, I was not willing to sacrifice my delicate skin to an all-day exfoliation procedure. I like soft skin as much as the next person, but that long is torture, plain and simple. It really surprised me to find bras from prominent brands that had fabric I couldn’t stand. Finally… SUPPORT? WHAT SUPPORT? I tried many bras that were padded and not padded. I was not looking for a bra to improve the perceived size of my breasts. I wanted a light padding that provides a little coverage and helps maintain the shape of the lace cups and gives some support to the girls. I have found that if a bra doesn’t have any padding, the cups tend to stretch out faster. Was I successful? Yes…and no. Allow me to further explain. Out of all the articles and research I did, everyone that encourage bras for the curvier figure, suggested ones that looked great and felt great on someone decidedly smaller than me. By a lot. Not cool. Not cool at all. How is someone going to find the perfect bra for a curvy figure if no one actually tells the truth about these bras? The articles should be informative and offer some realistic suggestions, not be used as an advertising platform. So, I will share my top bras as well as a couple honorable mentions. I found 4 bras out of the 20 I tried that were as close to perfect as I could find. Out of those four, one stood out ahead of the rest. The bra I would declare my fourth favorite is a great fitting bra, by a company called Bali and the bra name is Women's Lace Desire Non-Foam Underwire Bra and can be found in a lot of different physical locations as well as online. It isn’t my absolute favorite because it isn’t lined with any form of padding, the straps are a little narrow, it only has a two hook and eye closure, and the side panels are narrower than the other three. You’d think I wouldn’t purchase it; however, it was super pretty, with a delicate lace pattern, it’s a full-coverage bra, and it fit rather well (comfortable). It’s the kind of bra that I prefer to wear in the summer heat. Honestly, it’s so sheer that I won’t be able to wear it in polite company under a thin top. Oh! Another factor against it…it was white. So…lace, but no color. My third favorite bra is also a lovely but didn’t quite hit all the points on my perfect bra checklist. It’s by Vanity Fair called Women's Beauty Back Lace Full Figure Underwire Bra and can be found online and in physical stores. It’s a bra that holds the girls in without cutting into the shoulder. The sides are wide, providing side coverage and it has a three hook and eye closure. This is a great sheer top or t-shirt bra since it’s fully lined so there won’t be any unwanted exposure. Sounds like a perfect bra, right? Well, it was close, however two major marks against it bumped it down to third place. One, it had very little lace, so little that the bra is more utilitarian than pretty. Two, it’s beige. It’s an underwhelming yet functional bra, that’s comfortable. My second favorite bra was a super close runner-up to my favorite. It’s from a prior unknown company called ROSME and the bra name is Women’s Balconette Bra with Padded Straps, from their ""Eliza"" line. I discovered it on Amazon. It’s a lovely demi-cup bra, with lots of lace, wide padded straps, high side panels, a three hook and eye closure, and fully lined. Honestly, it fit well and was quite comfortable, however, it missed two things. One, if you bend over very far, you pop out. Yikes! I know demi-cup bras are supposed to go rather low and wide across the top of your breasts, but I like to stay in my bra when I happen to lean over to pick something up off the ground. So, a point against the bra. Second, it’s black. Again, another underwhelming color for an otherwise lovely bra. So little imagination when it comes to these bra colors for larger busted ladies. Finally, my top pick is another bra that I’d previously never heard of but was recommended to me by a friend and after reading the reviews, I gave it a try. I have to say, I was super surprised. It’s by De La Ville Pleasures and can be found on Amazon. I selected the Jolie bra and boy was I impressed with the bra. It has lots of colorful lace, lightly padded, wide straps, a two-hook and eye closure, and wide side panels. What set this bra above the rest is the rich color combination on the lace, which covered the entire cup of the bra, and the look of a demi-cup with the hold of a full-coverage bra.  The lace was primarily white, but there were these great shots of vibrant multi-color in a floral pattern throughout. (They offer a bunch of other colors as well, which is a real treat in my size category.) I tried my bend over test to see if I fell out and even wiggled a little, but I didn’t. Yeah! My only fault with this bra is the hook closure. I prefer three hooks, but for a two-hook closure, it provided a surprising amount of support where it’s supposed to. Now for my two honorable mentions. My first honorable mention is by Prima Donna called the Women's Madison Full Cup Bra. It’s a bra with great reviews and although it is out of my personal price category, I gave it a try. I selected the bluebell color, since I have a preference for all things colorful. The straps are wide, the side panels as well. The lace is minimal, just a shot at the top of the bra cup, and the fabric is not quite what I was expecting.  It fit well enough, but I expected more from a bra that cost over 100 USD. My second honorable mention is the amarsex Women's Sexy Lace Bra Unlined Sheer Underwire Bras Floral See Through Plus Size Full Coverage Bra from Amazon. It’s a company I’ve never heard of but based on the reviews and some personal recommendations from friends, I gave it a try. It’s a sheer bra with a pretty lace pattern across the cups. The bra is in a soft pinky lavender color. The side panels are wide, and the fastening is my preferred three hook and eye closure. However, it just isn’t as comfortable as the other bras. While the other bras, including the other honorable mention held firm to the breastbone between the cups, this one did not. The support wasn’t quite as I’d hoped based on the reviews. Well, that’s my long story of trying to find my perfect bra. I felt fortunate to find four that were so lovely and felt so comfortable that I kept all of them. What surprised me most was my top two favorites are from brands that aren’t well known but should be. Take a risk, try something new and I hope my experience helps you in finding your perfect bra."
17,Batteries and Power Stations for your Home,shopping," The cost of batteries is falling, driven by economic scale and technological improvements for rechargeable lithium-ion LiFePO4 batteries. These are now used in everything, including our laptops, power tools, PCs and smartphones. With a large bank of batteries or a handy good performing power station, homeowners can also store excess electricity generated by their solar panels during the day and draw from the batteries at their convenience. The developers and technicians at Houny are producing stop start lithium ion (LiFePO4) battery LiFePO4 battery packs and portable power stations for your homes. There is no battery technology today that can economically store enough electricity for weeks of blackouts, let alone months. LiFePO4 batteries work very well in conjunction with solar panels so homeowners with solar panels, still needing to tap into the electricity grid, can charge batteries and reap the financial rewards from “making hay while the sun shines”. Independence from the grid is still a fair way off in the future and in some countries illegal. Utilities are pushing back too. Many utilities advocate that everyone must share financial responsibility for the maintenance and upgrade of the centralized power even for homes which have self-production capacity.  In countries like Germany, this system is already in place with home owners who supply power back to the grid given generous discounts on bills or even money back refunds for excess power. Houny has a wide range of LiFePO4 portable power stations Most electricity is being generated in central power plants and this is still true of most countries today. These power plants are huge with some providing power for over a million homes; such power plants can be very costly.  Environmentally unfriendly, they burn coal, natural gas, oil or nuclear fuel to generate heat which runs a mechanical turbine and alternator which induces electricity. That electrical power then needs to be distributed across hundreds of miles to the end user, requiring expensive transmission and causing losses and inefficiency. In addition, power plants which use fossil fuels contribute to climate change and polluting by-products that are harmful and toxic. So, is it possible to scale down a power plant to the size of a home? Efficient small generators and power stations are here, as it turns out, most homes already have a miniaturized power plant in the form of petroleum based lead acid battery generator. With a Houny portable power station you can help minimize your ever increasing fuel bill at home by supplementing your electrical needs with saved power, also very handy for keeping you energized during power outages. Today, newer technologies such as the fuel cells found in LiFePO4 batteries are reaching high efficiency levels and safer more eco-friendly capabilities. This has allowed LiFePO4 batteries and portable power stations to become available to individual consumers and homeowners. Furthermore, these new technologies have far lower maintenance requirements and no sound pollution, making them more amenable to a residence and to neighbors. Finally, these set-ups give individuals the option of producing power on demand or storing power for when it is needed most. The benefits of LiFePO4 batteries and efficient LiFePO4 power stations go beyond being greener and saving energy bills. A month after hit Puerto Rico 80% of the island still had no electricity. This highlights the fragility of traditional power generation and transmission and why a Houny portable power station could be beneficial in your home. Houny has a wide range of LiFePO4 Battery Packs and Stop-Start Car batteries. The future can be different if we keep power sources close to us as consumers so that we can have some control in the power generating process. Stored power is less likely to disappear the next time there is a power outage from fallen trees or severe storms. LiFePO4 batteries and small power stations can form a back-up plan that can improve your energy systems. It can also provide you with a cheap and practical way of using your power tools when no electrical outlets are close at hand. Every small part can count and this could also be critical for the developing world, where many people still don’t have access to reliable power. With these technologies, society can almost forego the need to spend trillions on central power generation and transmission. This can help us to deliver power that is clean, efficient and practical to all homes. LiFePO4 technology is clean, quick and extremely easy to use with next to no maintenance, batteries and power stations are light weight and are becoming smaller and smaller but producing and retaining energy at much more efficient rates. There is the added bonus of protecting the environment as well, LiFePO4 batteries are made from materials that have little or no impact on the environment, in fact many batteries are already produced from recycled materials taken from old or used LiFePO4 batteries."
18,Why 925 Sterling Silver Jewelry is in Fashion?,shopping," Well if you are looking for jewelry that is timeless, classic, and versatile then your one-stop solution is the 925 Sterling Silver. They are precious silver metals and generally, people get in the dilemma of selecting between pure silver and 925 sterling silver. We are here to get your all doubts clear. What is 925 Sterling Silver? Sterling silver is an alloy made of pure silver metal and other elements. This exclusive metal is available in earthly metals and considered a precious metal. During the earlier days, silver metal was used to make ornaments and silver coins. Later the metalsmith faced some problems in making pure silver jewelry. Therefore, with research and development, the 925 Sterling Silver was discovered. The 925 Sterling Silver is quite affordable and easy to create with multiple design options. With the advent of technology, the 925 Sterling Silver became popular in jewelry niches. So, the alloy contains around 92.5 % of silver alloy and the rest of the metal options like copper. The alloy mixture gives certain durability and a sparkling shine over regular silver metals. Therefore, it can also be the best Valentine's Day Jewelry. Now we will discuss why Sterling Silver is so famous and here below are the reasons for it. Silver purely is a malleable metal when it mixes with the alloy of copper and tin. Therefore, at one end it provides more durability to the wearer. In this range, you can have various types of metals all together like necklaces, rings, and bracelets. Even the sterling silver is not 100 % pure but the lustrous appearance makes it feel expensive and valuable. Furthermore, if you use it in as much water or for daily purposes, the sparkle of the metal will not vanish easily. The pure silver metal is more expensive than sterling alloy that includes all the above costs of initial designs and the making charges of the artisans. Whereas, sterling silver is an affordable metal that reduces the price of the final product significantly. Therefore, it becomes an excellent choice for gifting purposes. Metals usually undergo tarnishing which is a chemical reaction that makes the metal appear dull and dark. This darkened layer comes with an exposure of metal in the air that contains sulfur gas. Therefore, it results in loss of shine. Pure silver is not that reactive metal and does not get tarnish when it comes to exposure to water and air. On the other side, sterling silver needs a bit of care and protection from air exposure as it might lead to dulling of the metal. Is giving Sterling Silver a good idea on Valentines' Day? Valentine's Day gifts for her are available in magnificent numbers in the market. If you are someone who is looking for cute, dainty, and affordable jewelry for your lady love then Sterling Silver is the best option. Indeed, on Valentines' Day, you can plan to give rings, bracelets, necklaces, etc. Here, we hope after reading the article you got an idea about sterling silver jewelry and how they are different from pure silver metal. We believe, trying on with sterling silver metal is best because they are affordable and give you the vibe of an expensive jewelry collection."

One such earring is the stud earring which also falls into the category of Dainty Jewelry. What are Stud Earrings? Stud earrings are the simplest yet classic earrings that work equally well if you are looking for daily use or any special occasion. These earrings have a single gemstone or diamond held tight with metal backing. Thus, it provides stability to the whole ring system. Wear a near ear face up to showcase the beauty and sparkle of the central gemstone. They consist of a head-holding central gemstone attaching to the latter part of the earring which goes through the ear piercing. The latter part of the earring connects with backing to hold the earring stable in one place. Further, there are two types of backing in use nowadays: either push back or screw back. Push backing slides back onto the other side of the ear and is fixed because of the friction. This backing is generally fast and easy in terms of wearing. The other backing is screw backing which has a screw attached to the latter part of it. It is generally the first choice for the earring with a heavyweight or large gemstone as friction alone won't be sufficient to hold the ring firmly. Choosing the perfect pair of diamond stud earring is as simple as you might think. You have to consider many factors such as the size of the diamond, the diamond setting, the backing, and the metal you choose all factor plays a vital role. Therefore, one must know the thing in the upper hand before actually buying the earring. 5 Reasons to Choose Stud Earrings over other Earrings There are tons and a variety of earrings available in the market which cater to the different age groups of women.

Choosing the best shape and cut for diamond stud earrings is not a very difficult task as many options are available. As many cuts are available, and two are more popular. The first one is a round cut because of its brightness, simplicity, and sparkle. And, that is why people prefer round cuts over any other cut.

When we talk about Jewelry for males and females there is a considerable difference between Jewelry for men and Jewelry for women. As time passes the differences are out. When it comes to earrings men generally don’t prefer a pair of hoops or chandeliers. Stud earrings are gender-neutral style and often mark appreciation. If you are looking for a pair of comfortable, simple, and stylish earrings. I don’t think there is a need for any further persuasion. You already know everything you need to know about stud earrings."
20,GREAT LIP COLOR DUO FOR DARKER SKIN TONES AND WOMEN OF COLOR,shopping," Hello world, I’m back with another blog post, and this time I have a lovely MAC Lip Color Duo for Darker Skin Tones that I wanted to share for women of color. As you know, I am a keen fan of pink lipsticks, they always make me feel so feminine and girly. Now, the lipstick that I use is from MAC and it is “Sultriness ”, it is a mauvy color that flatters my skin tone. I got it one day while browsing online and I usually like to test lipsticks out in person , but I decided to go by the color that emerged on my computer screen, and to my surprise, the color was a keeper. MAC has many shades of pink “ Sultriness ” happens to be my top lip color thus far. Great Lip Color Duo How I made the discovery Recently I took a journey to Winners (which is also owned by Marshals.) They carry designer items at lower and reasonable prices, I skimmed the beauty section and found some pigmented MAC lip glasses on sale. There was a pack of four lipglass shades, and I obtained them all on sale for only $16.00. What a bargain! Usually MAC mini lipglasses go for around $14.00 each individually. Finding the lip glass at this price was indeed a relief and I plan to visit Winners again in the future for more makeup bargains. Anyways, after trying out all four shades, I really like the only pink shade that comes with in the package, the shade is “All Things Magical” and ladies let me tell you, it is almost the same color as “Sultriness” lipstick shade, a definite keeper for me. Awesome Lip Color Pairing Pairing these two lip color shades of lipglass over the lipstick gives it a complete look and doesn’t look as chalky as it would if I wore the lipstick by itself. Above is a photo of me sporting the duo combo, I wanted to share this for those interested in a pink shade that really flatters darker shades, and I know that finding shades of pink lipstick can be challenging for women of color, but here I am, to your rescue! And I have made it easier for those to find the right shade of pink, at their fingertips. I am no longer on the hunt for any more shades on pink, and I am delighted with my recent finding, thank you so much for taking the time to read this blog post , and I hope that this info has enabled someone who is need of a great pink lipstick/lipglass duo. . I also wanted to mention the formulation for the mac lip glass, just in case you were wondering, little did I know that lip glass has a formula with jojoba oil, coconut oil, and apricot seed oil. This is awesome and I also believe that this is a more recent formulation that also has natural ingredients formulated to moisturize the lips. Other Alternatives If you have problems finding the shades I mentioned above and looking for comparable, I have a few suggestions. Recently, I received a sample of lipstick from my beauty subscription, and I loved it! It is from a small cosmetic company RealHer, I notice that this company carries many neutral shades and rosy shades that are dominant right now. The shade that I got was in the shade “Girl Power”, I am a massive fan of this lipstick, and I also must say that this lipstick makes me wear lipstick every day. Now , I would say that I am not a lipstick girl and sometimes feel goofy wearing it, maybe it is because it is difficult to find the right shade for my skin tone. But the realher lipstick I am wearing daily is truly my go-to lipstick, and if you are looking for a glossier effect, you can top it off with a clear lip gloss. My choice at the moment is by item beauty, Item beauty’s lip gloss is the lip quip, and I have the shade “come thru”. All of the shades that Item beauty carries are clear, but each have a distinct hue, I talk about this lip gloss here as it is dermatologist tested and has eliminated my lips from cracking/peeling. I also wanted to mention that this lip gloss contains natural ingredients packed with jojoba oil, almond oil and shea butter. lifter gloss swatches Drug Store Alternative If you are just looking for a soft pink lip gloss or lip balm , I also have another shade, You can find it at your local drugstore as it is by Maybelline. The lip gloss I am talking about is the lifter gloss lip gloss in the shade reef, It’s a shade that is not too loud and subtle if lipstick is not your thing. This lip gloss is comparative to the Fenty Beauty Diamond Bomb Lip Gloss , which I also truly adore, I also talk about this item in a previous blog post that you can find here. The lifter gloss lip gloss is an excellent lip gloss that you can find at a great low price, and that is the main distinction between the two. The Fenty beauty diamond bomb lip gloss can run you for around $30, while the lifter gloss is only $10. These two lip glosses are also wonderful to put over a lipstick like the Realher in girl power. Last but not least, we have the lip gloss from “basic beauty”, I received a sample again from my favored beauty subscription box, and I am also a fan of this gloss. Although it is not dermatologist-tested like the beauty lip chow is, I generally appreciate its consistency and how it feels on my lips. The shade that I have is “literally,” and to me, it is relative to the mac lip gloss that I use for this soft pink look in the photo in this blog post. mac powder kiss lipstick swatches Something Different On the contrary, if you are looking for a more daring look, I also have an excellent proposition for you, I discovered this shade while watching tv. I noticed a commercial with an African-American woman, she had this gorgeous bold shade of pink on and I remembered seeing a shade like this at my local MAC boutique. I decided to stop by to see if I was right, and I found a shade very similar, it is still a pink shade, but it has more of a fuchsia hue. The shade is Make it fashun” I want to mention it since we are on the topic of pink lips. I found the lip color at mac by the powder kiss lip color line, you will notice that this collection of liquid lipstick is a very creamy formulation, and it doesn’t mattify your lips like a lip stain would or other matte lipsticks. This is something to be mindful of because the lipstick can quickly transfer to other things it touches, also no need for  lip liner. You can find a photo of me displaying this shade in one of my Instagram photos if you would like to see what it looks like on a dark skin tone. Conclusion I am no longer on the hunt for any more shades of pink, and I am delighted with my recent finding. In this blog post, I went over a great duo/combo of mac lip gloss and lipstick that you can try, I also mentioned some other unique alternatives that you can try to perpetrate a soft pink look for your lips. From Maybelline’s Lifter Gloss to the RealHer lipstick in “Girl Power”, these are some recourses that you will genuinely love. You can also go bolder and try a fuchsia color in the shade “make it fashun” from the powder kiss liquid lip color, thank you so much for taking the time to read this blog post, and I hope that this info has aided someone who needs a tremendous pink lipstick/lipglass duo."

5,What is the importance of cell phone accessories,shopping," Every modern person has a smartphone with a wide range of functions and unique capabilities. Mobile phones are sometimes very expensive and are exposed to a number of negative external factors during use. That is why it is important to protect it and extend its lifespan. So, accessories not only preserve the gadget but also provide ease of use, as well as expand the range of possibilities. Usually, each individual model has its own additional products. Cell phone accessories decorate mobile phones, making them original, unique, and inimitable in detail. With the help of accessories, it will be easy to distinguish your gadget from many similar ones. Some phone accessories are designed for protection, such as screen guard, some for increased comfort and functionality, and some for entertainment. If you often have to carry your laptop from place to place, you should pay attention to a special bag called a laptop rucksack. It will protect your device from damage, scratches, rain or snow. In addition, you can put accessories and personal items in them. A protective case is the most important accessory you need to buy for any smartphone. Phone covers instead of a pleasant-to-touch expensive back panel can change the experience of your device, as well as protect the gadget if it falls on a hard surface. The most effective and at the same time quite effective cases are silicone or polycarbonate bumpers for the back panel, they often come with a smartphone. It is advisable to choose a bumper that would be slightly higher than the surface of the screen: then you can safely put the smartphone on the table with the display down. If the screen is curved, it is important to take care of the corner protection. The bumper may have additional functions, such as an eyelet for a lanyard or a pocket for a card. The smartphone screen, alas, can break not only when dropped. It is dangerous for him to be close to keys and other sharp objects. You can also accidentally hit the gadget on the corner of furniture or miss the moment when it becomes a toy for a curious child or dog. The display will additionally be protected from dangers by a protective film or glass. When choosing a protective accessory, pay attention to the smartphone model: cutting the film to size is not as easy as it seems! What's the difference between film and glass? The film is usually thin and consists of three layers, while the glass is much thicker and has additional coatings - anti-reflective and oleophobic. The film protects only from minor scratches, while the glass is able to absorb the impact of a fall, and a whole screen will be found under its broken surface. Thus, accessories are designed to protect equipment from dust, moisture, dirt, and mechanical stress. Buying a practical case is cheaper than a new phone.  In addition, accessories enable you to use your phones more efficiently and productively. So why not use phone accessories?"

10,Stackable Rings for Women: Similar vs Alternative Style,shopping," Wearing stackable rings i.e, two or more rings stacked together on a single finger for a stylish, accentuated effect is a fun and appealing trend in jewelry. This prominent trend is interesting in part because of its adaptability. You have complete control over which rings to stack, how to stack them, and where to wear them. You may even adjust your stack to match an article of clothing, an occasion, or even an ambiance, depending on the scale of your personal collection. If you have a gold sapphire ring, stacking it with a gold bar ring will look absolutely stunning. Those of you who have already experimented with the latest jewelry trends may be wondering how to stack your rings without going overboard. While it may take some experimentation and require some visual inspiration, it's a simple trend that can instantly boost your look. With that being said, there are several ways to accomplish this look of the moment. However, it is easy to be overwhelmed with so many styling options. And then to also think about, if they are working with the overall look or not. So to narrow it all down, there is a simple hack that you need to remember. Every time you go for stacking rings, follow these two basic rules. With these, you will be able to create exceptional and unusual looks with your ring collections. The two rules are you have to follow either a similar or alternative design for ring stacking. So, let's understand these two rules in more depth. Ring Stacking With a Similar Style. This one isn't that hard of a concept. It basically means stacking with only rings that look alike. However, just looking alike won't do, you need to dissect the design, the material, the setting, the quality, etc. The main goal here is to create a cohesive look that enhances any outfit. When things go together or perfectly fit together it always creates a satisfying and calming effect to both the wearer and the onlookers. With that let's find out how to select similar rings and wear them in a stackable fashion. Choose Different Gemstones, but Keep the Same Design If you love gemstones and stacking, then create a stacking look by selecting rings with different colored stones buy strikingly similar designs to keep up with the rule. The thing is if both the design and the gemstone are the same then you will only be wearing three same rings on top of each other, which will create a very bland and kinda bizarre look. Understand that similarity is good but identical is not when it comes to stacking rings. Choose a gold sapphire ring with diamonds sandwiched between two emerald rings with diamonds to create an exquisite look. Keep the Size, Metal, Fit, and Quality of the Ring the Same Always make sure that the rings that you will be stacking on top of each other fit perfectly. If there is any inconsistency in size, the loose-tight feel will make you uncomfortable but will also be an incongruous mess. Similarly, keep the size similar. If you are choosing a thin band for one ring, then select the same for others. Don't go with one wide and one thin band. As this will again dissipate the visual harmony. Finally, keep the metal and the quality the same. When the metals are similar and are of equal quality, it creates a gratifying serene background for the embellishments to pop up more. With similar quality gold bands, a gold sapphire ring paired with other gemstone rings will create a blend of blissful awe in your outfit. Ring Stacking With Alternative Style Now with this one, things get a little bit more interesting. Mixing and matching metals, colors, diamonds, gemstones, etc, gives a wide range of creative freedom to the wearer. People who are not a fan of uniformity can definitely choose the alternative stacking style. Clashing looks and mix-match elements create a different kind of satisfying effect than similar styles, but they are equally charming nonetheless. So, now let's find out how to select alternative rings and wear them in a stackable fashion. Bring Unique Texture and Style by Layering With Different Looks The whole point of not wearing similar rings is to create distinctive looks. And by mix-matching from your own ring collection, it guarantees a degree of uniqueness as another person won't have the same designed rings. So, play around with different shapes and styles. For example, you can use a thick banded ring and stack it with a dainty eternity ring or a twisted ring. You can also select completely different gemstones with different designs for the same finger. Pair your gold sapphire ring with a silver ruby ring to create an eccentric look unlike anything else. Use Different Metal and Different Styles for Different Fingers In this style, you can mix and match different kinds of metal that compliment or clash with each other. Go for rose gold with platinum or yellow with white gold. All of them will conjure up an enchanting aura to your finger. Also, make sure that you opt for a different style for different fingers. For example, if you are going for a thick gold band with a midi ring for your index finger, then go for a diamond eternity ring with a gold v ring for your ring finger. There is no way to tell if one of these styles is better than the other. It all depends on your attire, your mood, and your own style and preference. But at the end of the day, both of these are the basic foundation upon which the styling of stacking rings stands on. So, if you have got the foundation covered, styling will come easily to you. You can create endless looks by stacking rings as you grow your ring collection every year."
11,Architects Of Change: Ushering A New Era or Just Another Streetwear Brand?,shopping," Our fashion choices are a reflection of ourselves. It is an accumulation of choices we collectively make, a by-product of years of developing our taste- a way to express ourselves to the world around us. We spend money on a particular clothing style as it resonates with us. Naturally, we only buy things we see ourselves wearing. Through all the years that have gone by, we bore witness to the endless evolution of fashion- what you may love today may not be something you'll particularly have a taste for in the future. Let me go back to history - Chanel emerged when corsets became unbearable for women and became unsuitable for an active lifestyle. La Maison Dior came to light when the post-war society was craving feminine energy, and there was also an excess of material for the army left after the war. Saint Laurent and Prada rose to fame as an answer to the celebration of feminism and working women. The last birth of a fashion brand that has changed the industry landscape is Virgil Abloh’s Off White, highlighting the new urban and streetwear lifestyle. And that circles back in on our fashion choices becoming a reflection of ourselves-is the constant change in our style preferences a juxtaposition on how we introspect? Or is it just a testament to how our fashion decisions evolve with our increasing demand for self-expression? The brand that understands this premise is an emerging conceptual streetwear house Architects of Change-a high-end luxury streetwear that carries both art and message. I found it particularly interesting how the brand seamlessly fits into the fast-paced and constantly changing demand for self-expression, maintaining high-level urbanism while hitting the right amount of sophistication. Just by the looks of it, Architects of Change gives off the same level of artistry as luxury streetwear brands like Heron Preston, Stüssy, Off-White, and Palace. However, with Architects of Change, each piece is designed with a message-a question, really more than a declaration, compelling enough to pave the way to many open-ended answers. Perhaps you need to possess a higher level of education or literacy to decode hidden messages embedded in the artwork. Its complex nature makes the brand endearing and downright interesting. Architects of Change was conceived in London by Lydia Vladi. Unlike other fashion brands, They do not respond to the traditional fashion calendar. They do not carry seasonal collections. Instead, each of their sets uncovers the hottest topic en vogue. For instance, their new collection  Alien World Tour 2020 piqued my interest. It reflects on the unprecedented events that have occurred during  2020. Architects of Change treats privacy issues, fake news, crypto growth, the meaning of humanity, and is ringing a bell to wake up to love. Each piece has a story, and I recommend you to check out their amazing pieces on their YouTube channel or their website, architectsofchange.shop One of the most compelling things about Architects of Change is that instead of imposing an opinion directly, they use art to raise a question or reflect on an issue. However, instead of giving answers, it encourages the public to brainstorm, wonder and create the debate themselves. Think fake news- Yellow press or the government? What is built behind the pyramid and cryptocurrency inscriptions? Why did they use names of shaded trading like Monero, DEX, and War as background words? Wake Up to What or from What? One of their prints shows a couple in bed with a call to Wake Up. Another is a cut out of the Google search page asking the meaning of humanity with a slew of mysterious words in the background. They say 2020 is the year that changed us all and this is its legacy. They also built a print to praise those who got through the lockdown while saying that the most important thing was the new meaning of humanity and the new meaning of awakening. It's still debatable why they call the collection Aliens’ World Tour of 2020 while listing all the affected cities in the back of a tee? At the same time, their art prints ooze positivity, encourages engagement, and gives off a high-vibration feeling that integrates art and a message.  The extraordinary quality of its material is comparable with the biggest names in the industry, putting Architects of Change on a safe path to success and on being one of the fashion brands to watch. Architects of Change encourages dialogue and brings people closer through something as universal as fashion. Some of the thematics treated would mainly be understood by cultured, educated, and well-read consumers, making Architect of Change, the perfect brand for travelers, the movers, and shakers of the world. Overall, Architects of Change is more than self-expression-it is a call to action."

15,How To Match Jewelry With Your Make-Up,shopping," We use both make-up and jewelry to accent our outfits and express ourselves. They provide us with the ultimate finishing touches to our look, that we need to flaunt our creativity and personality. They help us highlight our best features and bring forth our unique individual styles. With so many similarities between them, it only makes sense for us to mix and match them. Specifically in a way that not only complements each other but also soars up the overall resplendence. Let's understand some basic requirements that are more or less needed to gain a harmonizing balance between makeup and jewelry. Understand Colors and Their Effects Both jewelry and makeup come in an abundance of colors. From dark hues, earthy tones to cool colors, there are tons available. A basic understanding of color wheel, which includes color contrasting, color blocking, color clashing etc., is required. It is needed to create a perfect look. Understanding of Highlighting Jewelry and make-up can be used in a way to highlight each other and not only the outfit. So understanding how highlighting works is absolutely essential. Let me give you an example of it. If you are wearing a pair of diamond chandelier earrings, then highlight its glimmer by adding glittery white eyeliner to your eyes. This way they will accentuate each other. Knowledge of Different Finishes As you may already know, both of these come in different finishes. They come in an array of finishes like matte, silk, rough textures, smooth, polished, etc. Become aware of all the finishes that jewelry and makeup usually come in. This way, the job becomes very simple to match them up and get a look that dribbles with perfection. For example, a matte gold ring will go well with a matte finish foundation. With this basic understanding of jewelry and makeup, let's find out some looks that flawlessly blend the two with a symphony of awesomeness. By playing around with jewelry and cosmetics, you can either let things blend perfectly or create a clashing effect. And trust us, both of these techniques will help you in achieving various unique looks. So, let's divulge into two looks that are clashing. And two looks that are matching. Oh! and one more, that will always make you a divine entity in any gathering. Matching Looks Two-Tone Eyeshadow With Two-Tone Jewelry By blending two different eyeshadows, you can create a mesmerizing effect on your upper eyelid. It will bring an edged look to your facial features. Now, if you combine it with a two-toned or colored jewelry item, it will be a match made in heaven. This will be far better if you can keep the colour the same for the eyeshadow and the jewelry. So, take two eyeshadows. One, a sparkly shade of gold and one of silver. Then blend them to create a two-tone effect. Now, infuse the magic by pairing it with a two tone diamond bracelet. Make sure that it has a mixture of yellow and white diamonds. Pale Blue or Nude Lipstick With Diamond Jewelry Nothing complements fine diamond jewelry more than subtle makeup. Pair a nude lip color or a pale blue eyeshadow with fine diamond jewelry pieces to bring in the both ""wow"" and ""subtle beauty"" factors. A white gold diamond tennis bracelet will play up the toned-down teal of your eyeshadow. On the other hand, nude lipstick will give a neutral background for your diamond necklace to create more illumination. Clashing Looks Textured Makeup and Minimalist Jewelry Create a ravishingly clashing look with makeup full of textures that brings in the ""funk,"" then dial it down with minimalist jewelry items. Consider wearing makeup like designed or patterned eyeshadows or stick makeup beads to your eyes or lips to give some texture then, pair it with minimalist fine jewelry. Say a simple diamond pendant necklace or diamond eternity bands. A Complete Clash of Colors Go crazy and start using colors that are completely opposite to each other. For example, combine red with green. Think it will look cartoonish? Trust us it won't. In fact, it will give you a high fashion voguish look that will make you stand out. Pair your most seductive red lipstick with emerald and diamond jewelry like diamond eternity bands embedded with luscious emeralds. Not a Clash! Not a Match! But a Dash of Perfection As promised earlier, we are bringing you this particular look that doesn't really clash or match. However, it is considered an absolutely glamorous look. It is the seraphic match of gold and black. Nothing! And we mean absolutely nothing looks as glorious as matching your smokey black eyeshadow or smooth black lipstick with solid gold jewelry. So for your next shindig match, a solid gold necklace with smokey dark eyeshadows to become a visual feast for everyone. The days when jewelry and makeup were regarded as two separate domains are long gone. Nowadays, the emphasis is more on a seamless blended appearance, with impeccably coordinated and properly combined cosmetics and jewelry to create a sense of continuity and coherence. You'll always seem polished, stylish, and put-together if you follow the above instructions. So, get yourself diamond eternity bands and wear them whenever you put on your nude lipstick."

These custom patches or custom embroidered name patches provide uniqueness and effective brand placement. You may have seen custom embroidered patches on the sides of uniforms like military garments or sports teams. The process of applying custom patches is simple. Let's go through the different ways of applying custom embroidered patches to your garments or hats in detail below. Many prefer patches with a 'heat seal' glue backing as it is a faster process. People who do not like to sew or do not know the process of sewing prefers heat seal glue backing as the knowledge of sewing is not required. Many choose to iron on custom embroidered patches and then sew them for better results. This method works well on firm fabric, but custom embroidered patches do not work on garments with high elasticity, and one should avoid applying custom patches to fabrics that can be damaged by the heat. You should first test the material and then try a heat-sealing process to custom embroidered patches with no minimum restrictions. Let's understand how to attach patches with this method. • Preheat your garment to 325-400 degrees based on the type of your garment. • Place custom embroidered patches on the preheated garment and then heat-press the patch with medium pressure for 15 to 20 seconds. You can try flipping the garment over and do the same on the reverse side. • Do not let the custom patch move around the fabric before the glue hardens. If you let the custom embroidered patches move around, then the bond will not be as secure as it should be. After completing the process, put the garment or hat aside to cool it down. Sewing is still a well-known technique in the 21st century. It is also the most reliable way of attaching custom embroidered name patches, custom patches, or custom embroidered patches to any fabric. You can sew patches using your hands, embroidery machine, or sewing machine. Sew patch by hand Several people sew a patch by using their hands. It requires a lot of practice and patience to do that.

Use sewing machine It is a little bit tricky when you attach a patch using a sewing machine. First, understand how to use a sewing machine and then apply a custom patch to a garment or hat.

Use embroidery machine Most embroidery machines work similarly. It is the most preferred technique to attach a patch to a garment or hat. These machines use special software to generate shapes, paths, and patterns. When you upload vectors via USB, embroidery machines process them and produce designs as per the uploaded vectors. The effortless technique to apply custom embroidered name patches or custom patches is to squeeze a layer of glue on the backside of custom embroidered patches and then place it firmly on the custom hat or garment. Hold it for 30 seconds or more, and that's it. Your job is done. But this easiness comes at a price. Gluing is a temporary solution as it may weaken your hat or garment's fabric and eventually rip them apart. It is not a permanent solution because it will not work on every material, especially slick ones. Do not rely on this technique a lot, as glue may melt after a couple of washes. It is considered a quick fix solution. It may become confusing to choose the right way to apply custom embroidered patches to your hats and garment if you are an amateur.

The word applique patches are used as synonyms for custom embroidered patches or woven patches. You can apply them by using an embroidery sewing machine. As per the Cambridge dictionary, 'applique' means a decorative work in which one piece of clothing is sewn or fixed with another. Therefore, the term also defines the technique of decorating fabric by sewing or embroidering directly over the garment. These can be used as a mere decorative element or as custom patches that help to hide stains, rips, scratches, stitches, and all sorts of other fabric damage. You can also apply a reverse applique patch. In that method, you sew a piece of fabric on the back-side of your garment, which is reverse to the original applique embroidery sewing. After sewing, you cut the front side of your garment to display the pattern or design of the fabric sewn beneath. This way, a 'reverse applique patch' is created. People commonly use it to mask holes with a funky style. Over the years, youngsters have adopted this style and have flaunted it with pride. You can also use this technique to apply custom embroidered patches to your hats and garments. Which method will you use to apply custom patches to your fabric and hats? Choose wisely!"
5,Why You Should Invest in Girls Designer Clothes,shopping," It's that time of year when I start fantasising about the warmer months ahead. Each individual has their own coping strategy, but I like researching Spring and Summer fashion trends for girls designer clothes and planning new outfits. This year, a few designer companies for girls designer clothes are on my radar, which emerged when I became more interested in ways we can minimise our environmental impact as a family, especially my 7-year-old daughter, who loves fashion and is quite impressionable at the moment. Today, I'd want to highlight some of the advantages of purchasing girls' designer clothes and how it may help us do our part to assist the environment. Nowadays, we tend to overlook the worth and comfort of well-tailored items and are more readily swayed by inexpensive clothing from shops that do not strive for quality and durability but rather cater to mass consumption. And it's simple to understand why: we all know that our children, especially girls, outgrow their clothes before they've had an opportunity to wear them! Fashion has grown considerably more accessible in recent years, yet rapid fashion has significant social and environmental consequences. Choosing girls' designer clothes when purchasing a few basics for your daughter to wear on a daily basis is a smart choice for many reasons. Fast fashion is inexpensive for a reason. Originally intended to keep prices low for budget consumers, the world of fast fashion has grown in popularity, and as its popularity grows, more corners are taken to save a pretty penny. Fast fashion for your kids is less attractive due to a combination of poor-quality materials, hurried designs, cheap and unethical manufacturing techniques, and environmental costs. Fast fashion is not necessarily a wise purchase. While adults are increasingly turning away from quick fashion, there seems to be a reluctance to have an open discussion about high-quality girls designer clothes. Of course, there are additional factors to consider when it comes to clothing for our daughters. People often lament how fast their girls outgrow their clothing or declare that their daughters are much too noisy to have anything too good. As a result, we conclude that throwaway fashion is acceptable for our girls, although not ideal for ourselves. But is rapid fashion truly the greatest option for our daughters? This article will reveal why you should buy girls designer clothes for your growing young lady. For the sake of the environment Our views about ""quick fashion"" and casual shopping have shifted dramatically in recent years. We're less interested in filling our closets with inexpensive clothes and stockpiling plastic bottles and more concerned about the environmental effect of our purchasing habits. We've realised that the items we purchase for our closets, cabinets, and refrigerators have eco-ethical dimensions. While the low prices of fast fashion may initially be appealing, resounding questions about where the garments come from and the labour conditions of those who make them, as well as the carbon footprint of the clothes that we buy, quickly reveals that the pennies saved are not always worth the cost to the environment. In fact, fashion is now generally acknowledged as the world's second-largest polluter, behind only oil. Luxury girls designer clothes last longer and are produced responsibly. Unlike cheap fashion, which is mass-produced and intended to be worn out fast, luxury girls designer clothes are manufactured in small quantities and last a long time. It's pretty basic math: the more you spend on your girls designer clothes, the fewer items you end up purchasing and the less effect you have on filling landfills. Girls designer clothes may be passed down through siblings and friends or resold on frugal websites. The additional pennies compensate for the peace of mind knowing you're making a wise environmental investment. For the sake of lifespan One of the most prevalent misconceptions about children's clothing is that ""children outgrow their clothes; therefore, there's no sense in paying too much money on them."" And there's some truth to it. Children, especially girls, are continuously developing, and much more than adults, a girl's size will vary dramatically over time. Kids are also much more active than adults, running, leaping, and rolling about whether they are dressed in fancy clothing or not. But is it the whole story, or is this a fake economy? Whether it's food stains from overeager mealtimes, grass stains from a boisterous game of rounders or another faint stain you'd prefer not to know what it was, kids' clothing is always in need of a thorough wash. However, washing wreaks havoc on low-cost garments. Budget fashion quickly comes apart after a few washes. Girls designer clothes, on the other hand, are of better quality and can withstand much washing. Luxury, well-made clothing endure longer and continues to look great, no matter how dirty your child gets. When you need something really unique, here is the place to go.            Whether your daughter is a little tomboy, a rowdy explorer, or a lover of fancy dress, there are moments when you require something a bit fancy. A wedding, a significant family gathering, or your child's birthday – a child's social calendar is jam-packed with events that need something unique. Investing in well-made, attractive luxury girls designer clothes ensures that you will never be caught off guard – whatever the occasion. Whether you choose a stunning designer gown or a lovely three-piece suit, investing in these special occasion necessities saves you a frantic rush to the shops. Designer clothing may seem to be the domain of celebrity kids and trust-fund infants, but this couldn't be farther from the reality. Girls designer clothes is a wise investment for parents who want to save money, time, and the environment! The Actual True Cost How come children's clothing are so inexpensive on the main street? How does this happen? Who pays the difference? Someone somewhere must pay in some manner, whether it's in the quality of their working circumstances, their health, or their freedom. And, regrettably, someone is paying for you. Garments made accessible by well-known brands are often manufactured in Asia for a fraction of the price they are sold for in stores. By purchasing your girls' designer clothes locally from a designer, you are not only helping to decrease greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation, but you are also ensuring that fair wages are given to those who perform the hard labour. On top of that, you'll get beautifully designed and unique clothing that your children will enjoy wearing every day."

The emerald cut provides an authentic and aesthetic attribute. The flat and sleek surface of the diamond provides  a glossy sparkle and shine.

Eventually, the shape got very huge popularity. The pressure is  decreased during the stone cutting process, which reduces  the risk of any chips being made in the gems. In 1920, emerald eternity band got prominence, because of their clean lines and symmetry, and in the twenties, the shape faced a roaring success. An emerald-cut diamond stone has approximately 25 pavilions, 25 crowns, and 8 girdles, making at least 57-58 facets. Due to the sleek size and angle, the emerald cut shows less depression than the other cuts. Today from all over the world, every woman admires the essence and clean look of the emerald-cut diamonds. In fact, till the 1920's the term ""emerald cut"" was also not coined properly.  The rise of art deco was the reason for the emerald cut diamond's towering popularity. The emerald-cut diamond says an effortless yet elegant aura about your personality. It says that you are famous for owning everything that you wear or do. Once Forbes magazine said that this is the best cut for women who have a discerning taste- those who skew classic with an edge. The layered and long facets help the wearer get a strong and bold fashion statement. An emerald-cut diamond highlights better clarity. The emerald-cut diamonds accentuate beauty and precision. In fact, big names like Beyonce, Amal Clooney, Eva Longoria have opted for emerald cut diamonds for their engagements or weddings. That takes us to the next part, what is the significance of emerald as a stone that people opt for it more often? History is the witness, that says Emerald as a stone is a symbol for abundant love and wealth. The striking beauty and glory of the stone bring the wearer hope, renewal, and growth. It soothes a stressed soul and offers a spiritual awakening. Greeks and Romans believe that this stone represents Goddess Venus, who is the conveyer of hope and love.

15,5 Things to Consider Before Choosing a Jewelry Store,shopping," Of late the number of jewelry stores in the market has shown an unprecedented surge. The evolution of online jewelry stores is said to be the major reason behind the exponential growth of jewelry store count. In 2018 alone, the market size for online jewelry was recorded at a whopping 8365 million USD, and industry experts predict the number is expected to continue in days to come. Whether you choose to buy jewelry online or from the traditional offline market, it is always necessary to choose the right jewelry store for the best possible result. Choosing a reliable store enhances the quality of your jewelry piece. In this write-up, we will discuss the five most essential aspects that you must consider before finalizing the jewelry store. On many occasions, we just overlook this extremely important aspect of jewelry buying. You need to understand that a larger pool of jewelry collections often ensures a quality purchase. You will get multiple options to choose from, and hence you can take your decision accordingly, evaluating and prioritizing all your necessities, without compromising anything. As a result, it is always advisable to choose an online jewelry store that offers a significantly larger pool of jewelry collections. Whether you opt for an online or offline purchase, you need to have a complete understanding of the respective store’s return policy. In case you are not satisfied with the product, you must have an option to return it and claim a complete refund or exchange it with a similar jewelry piece. Upon a little research, you will find multiple self-proclaimed industry leaders not offering a genuine return policy for their customers. So try to avoid such jewelry stores as such practices put a big question mark on their credibility. All will agree over the fact that jewelry in general is relatively expensive. But once you add their lifetime maintenance cost to their original cost, it will feel super expensive. So, by choosing a store that offers a lifetime warranty on each of its jewelry products, you can rightly save a lot of your hard-earned money. Besides, think for a while, if a brand is offering a lifetime warranty on its jewelry products, that indicates the confidence it has in its products. More often than not, the products are extremely reliable made up of quality materials. The feedback that a jewelry store gets from its existing sets of customers is a true reflection of your future experience in case you decide to go with that particular brand. So before taking your final call, start reading the reviews and ratings of the store from different review sites. It is worth noting that the review sites must be reliable enough to trust. If a particular brand is getting mostly negative feedback, it is wise to avoid it and look for a better alternative. You will find multiple jewelry brands that are charging an excessive amount of money for a particular jewelry product. In most cases, this extra money is used in various advertisements and promotional activities to influence more people. Therefore, before your purchase, never forget to compare the price of similar products on different platforms, and go with the store that provides the best value for money product without compromising the quality of the jewelry piece. Conclusion The increasing number of online jewelry stores are certainly helping the price of jewelry products to drop further and further, creating a perfectly competitive market. But on the flip side, the customers are even more confused while choosing a reliable jewelry store online. By following these above-mentioned practices, you can ensure a wonderful buying experience for sure."

18,Are you looking for Shapewear ?,shopping," Are you full of doubts when you have to choose clothes to go out? Not sure how to match the pieces in your wardrobe or are you afraid to risk a different combination? Shapewear doesn't require a lot of rules, but there are 4 tips that help you get on with fashion. Do you want to see it? Know your body The first thing is to be aware of your body, clearly know your strengths and what you want to disguise. Understand the occasion Each type of event calls for a different type of clothing. Of course, there are pieces that can be used for work and leisure, but there are also pieces that do not fit well in certain environments. Define your style No, you don't have to have just one style for life. But it is worth defining the style you will want to use on that occasion. And if you only feel comfortable in your shapewear leggings, that's great. You can find lots of them in the shapewear section, where you will find lots of other items for your workout but also to go out with your friends. Print your personality In fashion, personality is everything! There is no point in copying the look of a famous person if it has nothing to do with you. Buying very serious and composed pieces if your style is more stripped-down, for example, is throwing money away. In the end you won't want to use them. This does not mean that you cannot have some parts that escape your safe haven. It is worth testing it and if you enjoy it, you can gradually invest in other styles. Fashion is becoming more and more inclusive and Lover-Beauty has pieces for all body styles and personalities. Just find the one that suits you best. Forget idealized bodies, magazine covers, and love your body as it is. If you don't like something, go for it, or use fashion to your advantage to value other strengths."
19,Life's Little Pleasures-Denied,shopping," Welcome to the new economy. And scarcity. And poor quality control. And incompetent uncaring customer service. What am I talking about? Sugar Free popsicles. One of life’s little pleasures, now denied. Off and on, since the pandemic in 2020, sugar free Orange, Cherry, Raspberry popsicles have been missing from the shelves of all my local supermarkets, 7 of them in Burbank, California. For years, I ate sugar free popsicles throughout the evening when at home. Even after the pandemic stay at home/mask mandate “ended”, in March 2021, I have not been able to consistently find my daily evening treat in any stores.  It is now mid-July Why sugar free popsicles? Low sugar, low calories. Tasty. Inexpensive. I can eat 3-5 of these every night, as a heathy-ish reward, a treat, for surviving the day. For the past 3 weeks, my local supermarkets do not have any. None of the stores know why. They say they have them on order and there’s nothing they can do. They shrug their shoulders and don’t care. Meanwhile, I am living without one of life’s little nightly pleasures, my sugar free popsicles. Yes, I even contacted popsicle.com (Popsicle is owned by Unilever). I told them about the scarcity, the empty shelves, the missing sugar free popsicles. They never emailed me back. Welcome to the new economy. It’s not just sugar free pops. It’s many other products, across a wide swath of consumer goods. These days, I can’t even find a pair of replacement shoes, shoes I bought a few months ago. Wearing them every day, I guess I wore them out. And I guess Skechers doesn’t make them anymore. Same with my favorite popular t shirts.  The new ones I bought (without being able to try them on) were substandard quality and unwearable. And for 2 months a pair of the popular Wrangler cargo pants I wanted to buy was not available anywhere in the world. And, tech wise, my AOL email account inexplicably no longer works in my Microsoft email app. I have had that email account for more than 20 years, suddenly it doesn’t work anymore and I can’t access it via my Windows email app.  Microsoft tech support spent an hour with me online remotely trying to fix it. They failed. And, unless you have a premium AOL email account you can’t call AOL tech support or email them. They don’t care. Welcome to the new economy. The new scarcity. The new substandard products. The beginning of the US economy becoming like the economy of a developing country.  I don’t know about you but I am not used to this new economy. I do not want to get used to it. This is not how America is supposed to be. America is supposed to be a land of plenty, a land of quality, a land of caring about your customers, not a land of scarcity and substandard products and lousy customer service. Luckily, I am old and don’t have to live with this new economy and the decline in the availability of basic comforts and the declining quality of life for too long. Who am I to comment on economics? I am a former money market trader on Wall Street. It was my first career. I know a LOT about economics. And I would urge younger people, in fact ALL American consumers,  to demand products be in stock, to demand better quality products and better customer service, preferably live customer service. And to reject the new economy. American consumers deserve better. YOU deserve better. UPDATE:  The very same day I published this article my sugar free popsicles magically reappeared at my local Vons supermarket. Coincidence? I think not!  The moral of the story is that yes, it can make a difference voicing your legitimate concerns, your displeasure and peacefully protesting, as opposed to suffering in silence and continuing to be deprived."

And it has become the most popular cavitation machine in our company. Each handle of this instrument has two functions. One handle has the functions of 30K cavitation and RF skin rejuvenation. The frequency of the RF can reach up to 5MHZ. Therefore, RF can work on the same treated part while doing fat-blasting. In this way it can greatly reduce treatment time and achieve optimal effect. It also has two handles that work on face. One is a vacuum RF handle for lifting and skin rejuvenation. It’s rare to see in the market. The other one is a micro-current handle for face-lift and face-lift products infusion. You can have facial skin rejuvenation and lifting after the body treatment. We can say it’s more “complete”. For beauty salons, we not only have to provide good services, but also to offer an instant and obvious effect for the beauty equipment.

The most commonly used religious jewelry symbol would be a plain orthodox Christian cross. Before the Christianization, Christians, especially in Rome used to wear Crosses and Ichthys to overcome their difficult times. The idea of this cross was derived from the brutal Crucifixion of Jesus, which again and again reminds us about humanity. A Christian cross is nothing but a bearer of all the teachings that Lord Jesus gave us during his lifetime and even in the time of his death. The cross is believed to be bestowed with blessings and protection from the Almighty. The practice of blending the perfect jewelry with several outfits takes us back to our glorious ancient times. World History is proof that men have always been more particular when it comes to picking jewelry, especially solid gold cross pendants. The prehistoric culture of Vedic, Harappa-Mohenjo-Daro civilization signified solid cross gold pendants as a sign of status, wealth, and prestige. The solid gold cross pendants for men have originated from the 2nd Century when a Tertullian church father described the cross as a sign of Christian devotion. Again in the 3rd century, St. Clement of Alexandria- described it as a blessing of the Lord whereas in the 4th century St. Paulinus of Nola expressed this as a sacred symbol of both passion and protection.

The crosses are engraved with the word ""INRI"", which stands for ""Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum"", which means ""Jesus of Nazareth, the king of Jews."" Trefoil cross: The trefoil crosses have blunt and floral edges; it basically looks like a flower or a knob. Cross medallions: Cross-cut medallions are also a great option. The medal is designed with a cross-cut in the middle, which is a bit of an innovative way to express yourself. It's unfortunate that people are forgetting the value.

12,How to reduce deformation of aluminum alloy stamping parts,shopping," Stamping manufacturers are producing metal stamping parts of various materials, and sometimes there will be deformation problems. Among them, aluminum alloy stamping parts have a relatively large thermal expansion coefficient, which will increase this deformation. So how to reduce the deformation in the processing of aluminum alloy metal stamping parts? The following is a brief answer for you. The reasons for the deformation include the material of the part, the shape of the part, the production condition and the performance of the cutting fluid. It is manifested as the deformation caused by the internal stress of the blank during the stamping process with the mold, the deformation caused by the cutting force, the deformation caused by the cutting heat, and the deformation caused by the clamping force. . Reduce the internal stress of the blank. Natural or artificial aging and vibration treatment can partially eliminate the internal stress of the blank. Pre-processing is also an effective process. For larger blanks, due to the large margin, the deformation may increase after processing. , If the excess part of the blank is processed first, the margin of each part is reduced, and placed for a period of time in advance, it can not only release part of the internal stress, but also reduce the deformation during processing; Reasonable selection of tool geometric parameters to improve the cutting ability of the tool; the material and geometric parameters of the tool have an important influence on the cutting force and cutting heat. The correct selection of the tool is very important to reduce the deformation of the parts; Adjust the clamping method of aluminum alloy stamping parts; for thin-walled aluminum alloy stamping parts with relatively poor rigidity, if a three-jaw self-centering chuck or spring chuck is used to clamp from the radial direction, once the stamping part is loosened after processing, the stamping part must be Deformed. At this time, the method of pressing the axial end face with better rigidity should be used. To locate the inner hole of the part, make a self-made threaded through mandrel, sleeve it into the inner hole of the part, and press the end face with a cover plate on it, and then tighten it with a nut. The clamping deformation can be avoided when the outer circle is processed, thereby obtaining satisfactory processing accuracy. When processing thin-walled and thin-plate stamping parts, vacuum suction cups are used to obtain evenly distributed clamping force, and then processed with a smaller cutting amount, which can well prevent stamping part deformation."

16,Fashion in NFTs,shopping," It never really dawned on me that fashion has been present since the start of civilization. The Egyptians had their style that still comes alive once in a while. But I honestly think that it’s tough to break through the industry. It’s tough to have your fashion show because many of you are fighting for that one spot. Before you know it, you’ve burned through your budget without moving much inventory. However, I firmly believe that the digital age is a great equalizer,, especially for artists and creators. It’s easier to make your show on YouTube or share your hit record on Spotify. Although when I heard about digital fashion for the first time, I had mixed emotions. First, is it possible to have fashion without the cloth, the sewing machines, and the models? Second, who will wear the digital creations? I’ve been accustomed to fashion as models donning the latest collection as they walk along the runway. I’ve seen some friends make sketches of their latest design on paper but never transfer it to Photoshop. Given that I had a hard time marrying technology and fashion, I ended up reading more and was fascinated by what I discovered. In this budding creator economy nowadays, digital fashion makes a design collectible and desirable. Why digital fashion? If you’re a designer who is waiting for their big break, you must get in line to even get invited during a fashion week or get a feature in a magazine. Moreover, you don’t really know who your market is. You can create an elegant design, but who’s going to buy it? Therefore, may I suggest that you create designs for the gaming industry. Yes, you’ve read that right, gaming! It’s not something that you just play in your basement. In fact, it has become a multi-billion industry with esports tournaments happening throughout the years. Likewise, the player economy is blossoming with streamers, gamers, and creators who earn from what they love, Gaming. The best part about it is that the opportunities for creator monetization are endless. A new game may become popular in the coming months. If it has several characters, you can create designs for each of them and put them up for sale. You now have the power to distribute your work without a third-party retailer. Also, I’m sure that someone will appreciate your creative fashion and purchase what you offer. With that said, finding a marketplace to share your designs won’t be a problem. You can share it on gaming forums or gamer groups and get a buyer. If you appeal to their desire of making their characters the coolest-looking mods in a game, your clientele may even grow. We’re talking about the future of fashion here. It’s a trend that will never end because casual play and esports are here to stay. More importantly, you still get to become a fashion designer but without destroying the environment. I’m not kidding; the traditional fashion industry generates emissions that heavily contribute to climate change. Fast fashion is the biggest culprit here because they must produce clothing by the millions. So instead of being the next H&M or Zara, why not build your empire as a digital fashion icon? How does it work? DIGITALAX is the best example I’ve found of how digital fashion and gaming go hand in hand. They have a platform called ESPA that makes modding monetizable. Today, developers can make a living by sharing their fashion skins and wearables in-game. They can make it rare by offering their masterpiece as a non-fungible token. Of course, rarity drives up the price as always, and that’s why NFTs are raking in the money. But before continuing, let me explain what an NFT or a non-fungible token is. For that, we need to understand blockchains, the technology behind cryptocurrencies, and the technology that allows gaming fashion to emerge as a promising sector. By putting it as simply as possible, blockchains are a  decentralized digital distributed ledger that contains immutable blocks of data chained to one another. The main advantage of blockchain technology is that it’s impossible to hack, and everyone on the network can access the data. We’re not going to go too deep into the specifics of how cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology; however, with the myriad of benefits that blockchain technology provides, it’s no wonder that the sector is seeing success. DIGITALAX is bridging fashion and gaming with casual esports battles through ESPA. Here, $MONA is the unique currency of the ecosystem that provides income streams between designers, developers and players. Players purchase skins from the DIGITALAX marketplace, and then can take them in-game to wear in the esports battles, where the NFT authenticates the player against their leaderboard scores. There’s a collection listed on the DIGITALAX marketplace, collaborated on with Charli Cohen and young modder Kodomodachi, that generated over $131,649.54 in $MONA! The most expensive design was sold for $27,367. Players can take these designs into the esports tournaments, for the Among Us mods, and start earning $MONA through winning streaks. Don’t be scared! Players aren’t having to dish out these large sums to purchase the NFTs, most designs are listed for below $10. DIGITALAX uses “Degrees of Rarity” to distinguish between exclusive, semi-rare and common NFT skins with varying price points and auction sales, ensuring that the NFT collectible whales and young players are all accommodated for within the ecosystem, maintaining the necessary liquidity for sustainability for the designers, developers and players. The pitch to go digital After seeing what DIGITALAX is doing for Gen-Z fashion, I’m now an advocate that the next generation of the fashion industry will be online. If you’re a designer that is not seeing much success with the traditional way, it’s time you embrace digital fashion. Not only will you support our planet’s sustainability, but you also gain an appreciation for your designs. If you already have mods that you’d like to share, I implore that you do it via DIGITALAX. One day, you might even win for your design just like the winners of the Among Us competition held recently. I understand that all the terminologies and technicalities can be confusing. But once you get the hang of it, you’re unstoppable. Aside from being a luminary of digital fashion, you also become a legend in the gaming industry. Time will come when there’s a hall of fame for both worlds, and you get to be eligible for both of them. Once you make a name for yourself, gaming developers themselves may approach you to create mods for them. By then, consider yourself lucky because you generate income from your passion. Did I paint a bright picture for you? You can only reach that if you will start your digital fashion journey through NFTs now."

2,How to choose the right gift for the right person,shopping," We give gifts all year round, to those we love by celebrating birthdays, anniversaries, holidays. The New Year or Christmas holidays are a universal, recognized, and most massive occasion for gifts. Then, there are personal holidays such as birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, visits to the newborn baby. Graduation, graduation, and doctorate are also events that can be marked by gifts. Whatever the occasion, giving is a social ritual that requires careful thought and consideration. There are a number of rules to follow. The gift must be appropriate to the person, occasion and situation. Make a distinction between a business and a private gift. A very personal gift given to a business partner can lead to an embarrassing situation. Never send gifts to close people by mail or through an intermediary, but deliver them in person. If you are giving gifts to business partners, it is appropriate to send a gift by delivery according to etiquette. Always give a gift packed with flavor When you receive a gift, open it immediately and give thanks for it Have a measure - don’t give too expensive gifts because they always send the wrong message. Never react violently to gifts, whether you like them or not. A moderate reaction in both cases is a much better solution. If you give gifts to people you love, listen carefully when they tell you about something they like. So, ""between the lines"", you will read what would make them happy. Neutral are gifts of chocolate, flowers, drinks. When giving flowers, be sure to remove the cellophane. Another useful tip: always buy an odd number of flowers (1, 3, 5). Many do not know, but even-numbered flowers are worn more roughly. If you are giving a drink, ask about the taste of the person to whom it is being given. Quality wine and spirits are good choices if you are invited to lunch or dinner with a friend or relative. The book is given as a gift to people with whom we have a special relationship. A well-chosen book is worth more than various little things. When donating a book, be sure to write a dedication. If you are not sure if the person you are donating to the book has it, wrap it without dedication, and when you find out that the gift is ‘hit’ in the book, be sure to write nice words, date, and don't forget the signature. Giving is generally seen as a process initiated by an event. It requires certain financial costs but with certain expectations of outcomes. The process begins with a stimulus, that is, on a special occasion such as weddings, birthdays, anniversaries, etc. Societies define, even invent, the different occasions in which giving is expected. In the context of giving, it is still important to mention the difference between men and women when buying gifts. It is much more likely that men will rely on the advice of the seller when choosing a gift, while women seek more information when deciding on a gift. Women tend to take more time to choose gifts and compare alternatives. In contrast, men have no patience and usually use the help of a salesperson. Experienced gift traders know this well so they give women a long time to browse the store before offering their help. When it comes to men, an experienced salesperson will offer their help right at the entrance to the store. There is another difference between women and men when buying gifts. When it comes to gifts for Valentine’s Day, men are usually the ones who give gifts while women receive more gifts. While with Christmas gifts women are much more involved than men. This is probably because men generally don’t like shopping. The exception is Valentine's Day. How to choose the right gift for a person? The biggest mistake is actually buying a gift for someone else while choosing according to your own taste. The perfect gift can lift your spirits or improve your relationship. It can correct an injustice or simply remind a loved one that you care. Keep in mind that each of us has our own taste, and buying gifts according to your preferences may not make a person as happy as you want them to be. For example, if your sweetheart does not like to wear bracelets but is softened when she sees a cosmetic package, it is clear to you what you need to pay attention to. The full meaning of giving is mutual pleasure, and when it comes to the etiquette of giving, there are certain gifts that are always safe and that you will never go wrong with. These simple but safe gifts will be the ideal choice and trust us, you will not go wrong. Don’t give too expensive gifts, especially if the relationship isn’t close enough to justify something like that: it puts people in an awkward situation, and the relationship itself becomes a bit distorted and less spontaneous. The same is true in the opposite case when some worthless trifle is given away. The general recommendation is to give “symbolic” gifts that show your attention in a simple and direct way, and instead of so-called “useful” gifts, which should be left for occasions such as weddings or moving in, furnishing the house. When and to whom is it not worshiped? superiors (director, head of the department, head of the department, and so on) wealthy persons with whom we enjoy certain privileges; a phone call or thank you message is enough teachers, unless it is a joint gift of all parents or all children experts such as doctors, lawyers, who have not issued us an invoice (maybe a letter of thanks or a special gift for Christmas or a similar occasion) public servants (police, municipal, and state officials) who helped us or did us a favor: after all, neither is adequate, and it is forbidden. What is never worshiped? Vouchers, regardless of their value (although gift certificates are a very common cause, this is just one way for a store to make a profit) items directly related to physical defects or character defects that are well known or obvious to us (eg running shoes for a heart patient). items that are otherwise inappropriate (wine for someone who is not alcoholic before, erotic books for grandma…) flowers with a very strong scent for patients in the hospital, even though it was a childbirth garments if we do not know the number worn by the celebrant or we do not know their taste food products that spoil easily ""surprises"" in the form of animals, without knowing whether the one who gets them can accept those animals at all As a rule, money is never given away. A monetary contribution can be a reward, honorarium, tip, compensation, but not a gift. The one who donates money actually demonstrates that out of sheer indifference he regrets even the time and effort to choose and buy something. However, like any other, this rule has an exception. You will give the money to someone who needs that money in an accident, so you can help him. In the closest circle of the family, the money can be given as a gift to younger members, children or students, for good success in school, for a birthday, or to young men when going to the army, which will again be relevant. If it is a celebration of an event, you will put a greeting card with the money you hand in the envelope."

A tungsten ring will not need any special care over its lifetime – just a simple wipe with a soft cloth if it gets dirty.

Meets ASTM International and US CPSC safety standards and is JPMA certified) Made with solid wood (New Zealand pine wood) Beautiful to see It supports a good weight and is robust Convertible into a toddler bed, day bed, and full-size bed. (The full size bed conversion kit has to be purchased separately) Kid rails included (money saver) Easy to assemble with simple instructions 4 adjustable mattress levels or height levels. This means you need a mattress but you can set its height to any of four levels. So it is a good choice for short moms as it helps to easily position a sleeping baby with convenient height adjustment Sturdy mattress springs Things to keep in mind: Handrail leaves tooth marks easily, crib can be scratched with rough handling. The 3rd rail (for the child's bed) is only 1 / 3rd the entire length, not ½, so some parents might find it small Slight color variations possible due to the use of natural wood which is, by the way, a very safe material! Product image Babyletto Modo 3 in 1 Crib What I like about this: Non-toxic, eco-friendly and organic crib (safe for lead and phthalate with a non-toxic finish, certified by JPMA, meets ASTM International and US CPSC safety standards) Pure wood (this crib is made from New Zealand pine wood) A beautiful appearance ... Good choice for short moms Converts to a day bed and toddler bed A toddler bed conversion kit is included 4 mattress levels or adjustable height settings A sturdy mattress base made of metal wire springs Pretty easy to assemble Things to keep in mind: Like most baby furniture, this organic crib has to be handled with son. This is due to its soft wood and paint. Although most buyers have been very satisfied with the quality of this crib, in some rare cases, some customers noticed a slight smell of paint coming from the crib. In such a case, I suggest that you let the crib unload before using it. Fuming simply means keeping the crib open or opening the bedroom windows until the smell of the crib escapes. They are excellent odor absorbers and are 100% organic and safe. *Note Because the size of this crib is slightly smaller than the usual crib size, please make sure to purchase an appropriate size mattress for it. Normally the standard mattress size works well. 3/4-in-1 Crib for Delta Emery Children Delta Children Emery 4-in-1 Crib Product Image What I like about this: Non-Toxic Crib - No Harmful Chemicals (JPMA certified to meet or exceed all safety standards set by CPSC and ASTM) Wood construction Easy to assemble! Convertible into a day bed, toddler bed, and full-size bed Mattress height adjustment in 3 positions Strong Beautiful Things to keep in mind: Toddler bed and full-size bed rail need to be purchased separately. In the ""dark chocolate"" colored crib, slight color variations have been reported compared to the photos available online. No quality issues have been reported. Always remember to make sure that everything is intact and included in the package shortly after it arrives, so that you do not exceed the return period in case something is not right! The best non-toxic paint for cribs If the crib smells like toxic chemical paint and you have tried to run it out of gas and have also tried activated bamboo charcoal, but none have worked, then I would recommend repainting the crib with an eco-friendly and baby safe paint. The paint you choose should be odorless and should not contain formaldehyde, lead, or volatile organic compounds (VOCs). I highly recommend Baby Safe Crib Finishing the Crib - I am grateful to you for creating something so amazing and useful. Product image Safe crib for baby Let me warn you that painting a crib is not easy. Cribs are complicated. And there are many hard-to-reach corners and small spaces. Before starting to paint, you will have to sand the entire crib with a special sponge. This will allow the new paint to have a strong hold and will also remove a layer of the existing toxic paint. Once you have painted the entire crib and it is thoroughly dry, the toxic smell disappears completely in a few days. Non-toxic Mattresses - My Favorite Safe, Chemical-Free Mattress Babies spend 12 to 16 hours a day sleeping on a mattress and I can't begin to stress how important it is that the mattress is eco-friendly and 100% safe for your baby. The internet is full of horror stories when it comes to baby mattresses. Cases of SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome) have been linked to toxic mattresses, along with other serious illnesses. DIY - Make Your Existing Mattress Safe For Your Baby If you've already bought a mattress and can't afford a new one right away, here's an idea: Mattresses that contain foam can produce toxic odors, just like mattresses that have vinyl covers. The easiest way to protect your baby from these fumes is to cover the mattress with food-safe plastic. Once you do, cover the plastic with soft plastic cotton sheets to prevent suffocation. If you're ready to buy a non-toxic, organic crib mattress under $ 200, then take a look at the Lullaby Crib Mattress. I trust this brand and they don't charge you an arm or a leg, unlike dozens of non-toxic mattresses that cost well over $ 200. The safest baby cribs, such as solid wood cribs with non-toxic finish Safe baby cribs are made from natural, organic and eco-friendly materials like real wood. Furthermore, they are also free of poisonous chemicals that can be harmful to babies. Eco-friendly cribs are a wonderful bedding option that has been around for many years. Online, you'll find cribs of all shapes and sizes, ones with built in storage ... cleverly designed that can ... fit in small bedrooms and even ones that offer under crib storage. Non-toxic cribs VS non-toxic crib VS non-toxic bassinets? Actually a crib, hamper or co-sleeper also offers a great bedding solution for baby, but the downside is that a baby usually outgrows them in a few months, while a convertible crib can serve the same purpose for several years. Organic convertible cribs for babies With all the wonderful convertible cribs available on the market today, we can make a one-time investment for our child's bed and have a crib that serves as an infant bed for the initial months and then transforms into a cute toddler bed and a day bed for toddlers. In fact, numerous cribs come with the provision of being transformed into a full-size bed that can also be used for the child's adolescence. Today, the market has a very wide variety of cribs to offer. There are beautiful cribs that fit our nursery interior and enhance the look of our home with their elegant finish. A wide range of colors that most cribs support add to the charm and increase the temptation to buy a crib that matches our nursery decor right away. However, remember that while the appearance and cost of a crib may seem like important factors to consider when shopping for a new crib, in reality, it is the ""safety"" part of a crib that we really need to take care of. So what are some of the things we can look for to make sure we are going to a safe crib? The structure of the best cribs available on the market provides stability and strength. The materials are environmentally friendly and robust, the joints are securely assembled and the finish is absolutely smooth without the use of toxic chemical paints. I used to have these factors governing my decision making while looking to purchase a safe crib for babies. But I was surprised to find that crib safety has far greater concerns than those that appear on the surface. Crib toxicity is a serious hazard Basically, the biggest danger to a crib is toxicity. Yes, toxicity! Isn't it alarming to know that a piece of furniture that you intend to buy for the safety of your little one can be very poisonous and dangerous? It is not about food, but about furniture, real furniture that can be a source of toxins and ruin the health and development of a baby. Toxicity can be completely prevented only when the entire process of creating a manger is well monitored. Only a select number of eco-friendly crib brands really take the pain to ensure that the cribs they create are safe for babies. Most organic, toxin-free baby cribs are very expensive. But after detailed research, I have discovered some safe and reasonably priced alternatives. What's more, they are all designed according to US safety standards and are non-toxic. The final result All of the non-toxic baby crib options listed above are JPMA certified to meet and exceed all safety standards set by the CPSC and ASTM. However, in order to give you a clear and transparent picture, I have also listed all the possible disadvantages in each of the products so that you know exactly what you are opting for, before making the final purchase decision. With a clear list of all the positives and negatives, I sincerely hope my reviews help you choose a safe, organic, chemical-free, eco-friendly, and non-toxic crib for your little one. Once you've chosen the right crib, you may want to look at the best baby sleeping bags for your baby below."

11,Will sustainable gift hampers be the big food and drink hits this Lockdown Christmas?,shopping," Christmas gift hamper suppliers are expecting a surge in demand for ethically sourced, environmentally sound and sustainable products this year thanks to the last minute impact COVID 19 is having on all our Christmases.  Families might not, for example, be attending the kind of large traditional Christmas dinners, full of guests and indulgence, that lots of us have come to view as central to the Festive Season. If we will not be there in person, then sending food, ingredients and treats to the ones we love seems an obvious alternative. With environmental issues in the news and vegan diets on the increase, more and more of us are looking at ethical, cruelty-free, plant-based options too. This Christmas, more than any other, might well be the season of good intentions as well as goodwill when it comes to giving gifts. We are here to introduce you to some of our favourite products. What Christmas Hamper products are available? Planet Organic, the UK’s first organic supermarket, has included a range of vegan and organic products in its 2020 Christmas range. Its Ultimate Vegan Hamper (£85), for example, contains a smorgasbord of vegan ingredients, treats and essentials from Maple Syrup and Praline biscuit to pesto, chocolate-covered cashew nuts and oat milk drinks. The Planet Organic Vegan Chocolate Lover Hamper contains more treats from granola and energy bars through to chocolate truffles and macaroons. They have all been carefully selected so being on a vegan diet and cutting out animal-derived products does not mean missing out on tasty treats. Talking of tasty traits, Planet Organic Vegan Snack Attack Hamper is the product to reach for if you’re looking for a healthy pick-me-up or reward between meals. From chocolate and granola bars to chocolate covered nuts and popcorn, it contains everything you need to enjoy some ethically sound self-indulgence. Where can you buy Christmas gift hampers? Planet Organic is a one-stop-shop for health food, natural health and beauty products and sustainable living essentials. Its vast range is full of gluten-free, dairy-free, keto, raw food and vegan options, which makes it an ideal place for Christmas shopping this festive season. The range of products, available for next-day delivery, includes everything from natural candles and reusable containers to organic hampers and gift boxes for those on vegan, vegetarian and other sustainable diets. It also takes in health, wellbeing and beauty with a range of eco-friendly cruelty-free makeup, skincare treats, toiletries and even scents and perfumes. ‘Tis the season to be jolly Despite the fact most of us will look back on 2020 as an incredibly challenging year,  the experience has, perhaps, brought us together and perhaps made us relish home comforts more than in previous years. The idea of giving loved ones a food hamper definitely feels part of that move towards homeliness and family. Protecting the environment, staying cruelty-free and supporting those living a vegan lifestyle at the same time is certainly a reason to be cheerful."
12,Reversible Ventilator for Building Roof,shopping," ACME Fan Co. offers wide range of Heat and Smoke Removal Power Roof Ventilators. These PRVs are especially designed, built and proven by independent test to meet the need of venting hot gases and smoke in the event of fire in commercial and industrial buildings, such as factories, warehouses, parking garages, shopping malls and department stores. Type HS PRVs reliably extract large volumes of hot gases and smoke regardless of building configuration, location and weather conditions. They withstand high temperatures for long periods of time. A reliable ventilation system that can operate during a fire is both vital and essential. It prevents smoke logging, allows people to escape quickly, minimizes damages to property and contents and enables firemen to attack the fire without hindrance. These power roof ventilators have the added advantage of providing normal day to day ventilation and in many cases can also be fitted with duct work for use in multi storey buildings. The concept of venting smoke and heat was first outlined by Industrial Risk Insurers (IRI). Use of powered ventilation could eliminate the problems experienced with gravity vents. Specially designed roof mounted exhaust fans would mechanically vent heat and smoke under emergency fire conditions. In addition to the reliability and effectiveness of this powered ventilation concept, the use of HS PRVs to vent heat and smokes has these specific advantages: It is not dependent on air temperature differential or wind direction and velocity to create air movement. It does not rely on heat itself to activate the system. Smoke detectros and water-flow devices also may be utilized. It provides for normal ventilation needs of the building as well as for emergency use as a vital component of the fire protection system. There is ususally a substantial cost saving in the purchase and installation of the dual purpose system. Maintenance cost for building and equipment is frequently reduced. The system can be effectively used in multi storied and below grade building areas. Reliability of operations is assured because powered ventilators are in daily use and receive regular inspection and maintenance. The unique Type HS power roof ventilators provide a solution for emergency heat and smoke venting that is dependable under the most extreme circumstances. All critical components of HS PTV that exposed to the airstream are ferrous construction to withstand high temperature conditions. These heavy gauge materials prevent warping of fan parts and malfunction at high temperatures. This also insures years of trouble-free service in normal daily operation of the PRV. The wind shroud is made of galvanized steel; an exterior finish coat of epoxy can be specified. Painted parts are coated with epoxy to provide a protective coating rated excellent for hardness, impact resistance,  adhesion and chemical resistance. Belt and bearings are protected from the air stream by enclosing them in a ventilated tube. Design of HS fan incorporates a heat slinger / impeller. It isolates the fan bearings from damaging heat and draws cooler outside air through the motor compartment and over the belt and bearings. A spring loaded, fusible link activated device automatically opens dampers when temperature at the fan reaches 165 F. This enables the fan to function as a gravity ventilator prior to powered operation. A safety disconnect switch is mounted to the PRV housing www.ventilating.com www.fanblower.com www.highpressureblower.net www.industrialblowerfan.com www.industrialfanblower.net www.industrialfanblower.com www.pressureblower.net www.northernindustrialsupplycompany.com www.industrialpressureblower.com www.tenderall.com www.chicagoblowercanada.com www.cbblower.com www.buffaloblower.com www.buffalofan.com www.nis-co.com www.canadianblower.com www.olegsystems.com www.canadablower.com www.abbblower.com www.acmefan.net www.industrialblower.net www.fansandblowers.net www.americanblower.net www.barryfan.com www.cincinnatifan.net www.canadafans.com www.barryfan.net www.pennbarry.net www.pennfan.net www.tcffan.com. This feature protects maintenance personnel from an accidental fan start when the unit is being serviced. Type HC Power Roof Ventilators have been tested to operate: continuously at 650 F; 3 Hours at 800 F; 1.5 Hours at 1000 F; 1/2 Hour at 1,200 F."
13,Seirus Innovation HeatTouch Rechargeable Heated Gloves,shopping," Push a button, and you’re warm: as simple as that. We’ve designed our signature line of HeatTouch gloves around the idea that warmth on the mountain should be just as simple. Three heat settings are controlled through a single button, with multicolored indicators, on the back of the glove.  Putting you in control of your heat. The heat source is a Flexible Fusion™ heat panel, which allows the glove to deliver warmth across the entire back of your hand, even wrapping around your fingertips. All without wires. Powered by thin, rechargeable, inside-cuff batteries, you can enjoy hours of heat without the bulk. Each battery is made of two independent cells, allowing the glove to contour to your wrist, providing unprecedented comfort in a heated glove. Extra Education… like any technology, there are methods and practices that will help make the most of the features available. don’t worry, it is not as complicated as up down up down left right left right select select select or anything, but here are a few tips to make sure you are getting the most out of the battery and features of the glove. Then, for best performance, drain the batteries completely before your next full charge. If possible, charge the batteries to full every time you use them, however the first 2 charges are the most important. General Glove Education… Gloves are insulators. They keep hot things hot and cold things cold. The heating element acts as a booster to this heat insulation, but if you start with the insulator cold, then the heating element is mostly wasted just getting the glove to room temperature. The best way to combat this is to turn the gloves on for about a minute while the glove is still at room temperature (indoors) so you are starting warm. Do not let your hands or the gloves get cold. You are better off keeping the glove on low if it is very cold out and bumping up to higher levels when needed. If you wait until the gloves or your hands are already cold, the heating element will be drained faster just attempting to get the gloves out of cold before it even has a chance to get you to the needed warmth"

15,What is sustainable fashion?,shopping," Sustainable fashion term refers to clothes that are created from the beginning including designing, manufacturing, and distributing in environmentally friendly way. There is also ethical fashion which refers to clothes being made in ways that respect and value workers rights, and social welfare. Environmentalism and socially fair practices are connected what makes sustainable and ethical fashion tied together. Sustainable fashion is a process and a movement of changing fashion products, and the system towards ecological and social justice. It is addressing the whole system of fashion including social, ecological, cultural, and financial. Sustainable fashion is also called eco fashion. What we have to look for when supporting sustainable fashion? Natural and organic materials like hemp, linen, silk, wool, leather, and cellulose fibres are generally preferable over synthetics like polyester, nylon, and acrylic. Natural fibres are biodegradable and can be a clean compost back into the soil. On the other hand synthetics will not biodegrade but just sit on landfills and emit toxin chemicals and fumes. The most sustainable materials are linen, hemp, and organic cotton. TIP : Keep an eye out for organic certificates for plant based fibres like GOTS, and ethical indicators for wool  like ZQ-certified wool. When it comes to cellulose fabrics always prioritize lyocell or Tencel. Always a good idea is using pre-existing materials to create new pieces of clothing simply because it doesn’t require taking new resources from the soil. So re-use materials when possible instead of waste. TIP: Look out for fabrics made of recycled fibres like recycled nylon, recycled polyester, recycled cotton, clothes made of up-cycled materials, or clothes made from so-called dead stock fabric which are simply materials produced, never sold, never used and would otherwise be thrown away. Another issue in manufacturing clothes are dyes used in the process. You may be looking for natural fibres or synthetic ones, but always consider the environmental impact of the dyes. Many of them involve use of toxic chemicals. TIP: Look for eco-friendly dyes like the ones from digital printing that requires less water, natural plant based dyes, OEKO-TEX certifications, and BLUESIGN. OEKO-TEX means that clothes are tested for any harmful substances. BLUESIGN is a system providing safer and more sustainable environments for people to work in and others to live in. Fashion industry is wasting a lot of materials mainly from cutting out patterns, but there are sustainable brands that design patterns with no waste of anything. Other waste is water. Some brands minimize the amount of water and energy used in the manufacturing process. Companies reduce excessive plastic packaging when transporting from the manufacturer to warehouses, and finally to the customer by using recycled or biodegradable shipping materials. Manufacturing process with all the dyeing, sewing, and shipping is leaving behind high carbon footprint. To tackle this some brands are making clothing closer to where it will be sold, rather than shipping from overseas, some are installing solar panels and wind turbines to provide renewable power for their factories and offices. TIP: Support local companies that source material from the region. We all should try to be more sustainable consumers. Instead of buying cheap clothing that will be thrown away quickly try to buy second hand sometimes and always look after your clothes properly to prolong their lives. By buying higher quality clothing they will last you for longer what means less is on the landfills. TIP: Choose second hand clothes, prioritize high quality clothes that will last longer, wash them in cold water, and hang them to dry. Sustainable fashion should be every manufacturer prioritize as it helps the environment and us all."

17,Oclick grocery store Wants To Become The Amazon Fresh Of Bangladesh’s Capital,shopping," Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, is one among the densest cities within the world. Since land is at a premium, stores are often tiny and carry very limited inventory. Oclick’s goal is to offer customers the experience of shopping during a big-box store with an enormous selection. Backed by Y Combinator and 500 Startups, Oclick currently stocks over 4,000 products in its two warehouses, which it delivers in about an hour, and hopes to become the “Amazon Fresh of Dhaka.” The company, which is currently averaging about 150 deliveries each day , plans to feature a minimum of six more warehouses to hide all of Dhaka before potentially expanding into other Bangladeshi cities. Oclick was founded by Waseem Alim, Tejas Viswanath, and Zia Ashraf in 2013. After working in development for Wikinvest and SigFig, Alim began exploring the likelihood of launching a startup in his home country. He was galvanized by the collapse of a garment factory near Dhaka that killed quite 1,100 workers. “That jarred me and made me think, if capital is being invested during a way where people need to work inside a mousetrap, then i would like to ascertain what it takes to actually make a living in Bangladesh,” he says. Consumers in Dhaka often purchase small amounts of groceries, no matter their income level, because shops don’t have tons of stock. Oclick’s current business model centers around warehouses that are relatively small (about 5,000 to 7,000 square feet each), but still enable it to hold far more items than brick-and-mortar retailers. It uses a cloud-based inventory system that permits users to ascertain what items are available in real-time. Oclick’s At first, Oclick tried a model almost like hyperlocal grocery startups in India like Grofers and PepperTap, which meant learning items from local stores rather than carrying its own stock. the shortage of control over inventory, however, turned off customers. “If someone orders two liters of Coke and therefore the store only has one liter, there's no way for you to inform the customer that,” says Alim. “We found tons of consumers didn't come .” Oclick switched to its current model in March. Since many purchasers order ingredients for meals right before they begin cooking, Oclick also began providing on-demand delivery. “When we started this service back in November 2013, we were doing next-day delivery which just doesn’t cut it for people,” says Alim. “When you would like something, you would like it really fast, and therefore the culture within the subcontinent is to urge a really small inventory of cooking supplies, unlike within the U.S. where you purchase bulk items sort of a ton of loo paper. most of the people don’t have cars and you only go and buy four eggs, literally, not even a dozen eggs.” Unlike Instacart within the U.S., Odoesn’t charge a premium for convenience. Instead, it competes with brick-and-mortar stores by buying directly from wholesalers and offering lower prices. Grocery margins are too slim to support huge discounts, but most of Oclick’s prices are about 1 to 2 percent less than other stores and it plans to extend that to five percent because it scales up to woo customers. “Instacart charges you additional because they're competing with huge retail infrastructure like Wal-mart, but we expect we will improve the infrastructure and deliver at a lower cost ,” says Alim. Oclick’s hottest categories include pet food, since many animal owners usually need to travel out of their neighborhoods to specialty stores, and baby supplies ordered by busy new parents. In addition to traditional retailers, Oclick’s competitors include Direct Fresh and Meenabazaar. Direct Fresh, however, sells organic produce and other premium food, while Meenabazaar is travel by a grocery chain. Alim believes Chaldal will proportion more quickly than other online grocery sellers by keeping its warehouses small and strategically placed throughout Dhaka to succeed in as many consumers as possible. the corporate is currently ready to provide about 8 to 10 percent of Dhaka’s residents with one-hour deliveries, but hopes to hide the whole city by the top of this year. “Once we actually understand Dhaka, the opposite cities are going to be fairly easy,” says Alim. “The market here is already very big, so we don’t got to expand to other cities so as to urge bigger challenges. In Dhaka, groceries are probably a $4 to $5 billion market per annum , so if we offer cheaper prices, more variety, and better quality, there's no reason why we shouldn’t be one among the most important retailers within the city, if not the most important .”"

7,Picture made with Text: A gift perfects for all situation,shopping," I could remember giving my younger brother pizza, and he will joyfully take it any time. But a time came, and he was down, very sick, and I tried giving him the same thing, but his reactions were different. He had forgotten how good a pizza could taste. Gifts are good, and everyone will likely appreciate gifts when they are given to them. It makes people feel special and appreciated; sometimes, it might just be a token. It always leaves a good effect on the heart of the recipient. Although some may not be appropriate in some situations. But there is a gift that fits all circumstances, and it is the gift of using words to make a picture. Can you imagine giving your boss a gift like a hamburger, actually it is very okay; the hamburger is a good food, but it does not go with that setting. Some gift is meant to be used for formal purposes while some informal. So, a gift that may be seen as suitable for your siblings might not be for a colleague or a superior at work. You may frustrate the purpose of gifting if it is not done appropriately. And some gift is appropriate for male and may not be suitable for female. You could imagine buying a make-up kit for your brother on his birthday; it will not sit well with him because it is useless. If you are not careful, you might be aiming to make someone happy but do the contrary with your gift. And another thing is that some gifts are for adults and might not apply to the children. Gifts are very good, but they have distinct use, timing, and recipient. Some are for happy times while some sad times, there are some that you appreciate when you are healthy and would not even think of when you are unhealthy. A picture made with text will bridge the gap between and among every situation and condition. It breaks the barrier of race and preference. It is a unique gift that everyone will love regardless of gender or even the setting, whether formal or informal. A gift does not have to be edibles, and it does not have to be a ticket to a cinema, or getting ice cream. You always don’t have to go on a shopping spree before you impress anyone. You do not have to break the bank before the gift can be appreciated. A gift as simple as making images from a text can help you to become forever relevant in the heart of someone. Depending on how creative you are, using photos to text, you could affordably blend your gift to fit in every situation. Humans could hate everyone and anything on earth, but they would rarely hate themselves. And everyone likes to look at themselves in pictures, especially when it was beautifully taken. It would be advisable to use their best image, but there is an additional beauty that comes with the products. In the end, you get a picture made with words that is more beautiful than the photo you uploaded. With this gift, you could give anyone a chance to see how they can be creatively transformed. Before bringing this to an end, I will discuss some situations that we might consider gifts as not been appropriate, but Pictures with text will fit perfectly into; The demise of dear ones No one prays or hopes to lose loved ones, but time, situations, and age happen. Either they become old, or the unexpected happens. A friend that just lost one of his grandparents will never appreciate any gift. Whether expensive or not, at that moment, his mind could not appreciate any gift. He would not want to feel any happiness because his heart has been pierced from the loss. He might feel like it is an end to his world, especially if it a grandparent he loved and cherished. But if you are very smart, you can still give a gift that they would appreciate at this moment. A gift might not look appropriate, but he would appreciate a gift that will make him remembers the person he just lost. So, it would be wise to look for a beautiful picture of the person your friend just lost, then turn it to words on photo to text. You can use a word as YOU LIVE FOREVER IN OUR HEART. You will be surprised at how he would love it regardless of how he is feeling at the moment. And if you could find a way to make a friend appreciate the gift at a time like that, you would forever hold a good place in his heart. Because he sees you as being there during times, he needed support. You might not be available to cheer him, but this creative gift can do it for you. Illness If you could work 24 hours a day, an illness will make you hate working. Your favorite food becomes what you do not even want to eat. You would not also remember there is a newly bought designer shoe in your closet that you have not tried on. During illness, you do not think of the cinema or watching your favorite show. It will turn your daily activities upside down, and you only become weak and uncomfortable. This time the only thing you might appreciate is good health and anything that gives you strength. Things that could give strength might be people and their encouragement. And that is why images made from text can fit well into this situation. Some people give gift cards to encourage a sick person, but I prefer you always use photos made with words as a gift. Use a picture where the person was smiling beautifully and was looking very healthy and happy. It will help you to pass two messages; first, you will remind them how happy they look when they are healthy and, secondly, the words. Let it be a word that tells them how much they are being missed and that you want them to recover from the illness soon."

Spring Spring is characterized by warm weather, but you need to watch out for those unexpected showers. Dressing can be a bit challenging because you can never be quite sure about how the weather will turn out throughout the day. Since it follows winter, you can expect it to be a bit chilly initially.

Some staples you will probably turn to a lot, are comfortable boots, a sweater and/or blazer. You will probably need an umbrella to escape the unpredictable showers.

Putting together different textures, colours, and patterns can give you fantastic opportunities to switch up your outfits without spending tons at the boutique.

Boutique owners spend time in educating customers using different methods such as tutorials, use of influencers, among others. It allows for more intimacy both with the brand and products. •	Boutiques Build Connections Boutiques go beyond getting customers through the door, to building actual connections. It is not uncommon to find boutiques such as Dianic on all social media platforms. We build communities that bring together individuals who share common interests in clothing and apparel. It makes it so much easier to tailor communication to the target audiences. If for instance, a particular segment is interested in Bohemian fashion, it is easier to communicate directly with them through the tools available on the platforms. •	It Is All About the People Think about the times you walk into a large store and feel totally invisible. Now think about your experience at your favourite boutique. The latter probably knows your name, what your favourite drink is, what fashion you gravitate towards, among other personal tit bits. You, in the same vein, probably know the owner or your favourite salesperson. You know why? Simple, boutiques focus on so much more than simple financial transactions. They want to connect at a deeper level by showing the face behind the business. Customers do not go away feeling like they are transacting with some faceless entity. Larger stores still struggle with building that personal touch with their customers. •	Boutiques are Exciting to Shop in Visit a boutique like Dianic, and one thing you will notice is the amount of variety available for your picking. You can be sure you will get some very unique pieces that you will probably not find anywhere else. We do not focus on mass-produced clothing items, which are common with the larger stores. We also offer fantastic platforms for young, emerging designers. Most importantly, boutiques take time to truly understand their customers before stocking products. They catch on to trends faster, this season it may be bohemian, next season retro, and next, chic modern. You will never be bored when shopping at a boutique, whether you are doing it online or offline. Final Thoughts Fashion is indeed exciting, and at Dianic Boutique, we genuinely understand what our customers need. We stock the latest trends, but you will also find pieces, which you may not find anywhere else. Follow us or subscribe to our social media platforms for notifications on the latest clothing and apparel."
13,Appreciating your silent heroes with Photo to words,shopping," The benefit of a photo to words goes from the imaginable to the unimaginable. As small as a gift may appear, it has a way of strengthening our relationship more. So, who are your silent heroes, they are people that are so close to you? You can never live a day without their contributions to your life. And many times, you forget to appreciate these people or even give them a gift because of the relationship that exists between you. You may work yourself into thinking that your closeness is enough to reward them for their contributions. As a child your parent, they can be your business partners; as a spouse your partner, as an employee your boss, they can be friends, your siblings, your teacher, and your grandparents. A little act of appreciation will go a long way in helping you grow your relationship with them. You may decide to create a picture with words or even turn their picture into words. But the worst thing is not rewarding them in any way. Below is the list of people that might be your silent heroes. Parent They are the first heroes in your life, either a single parent or not. And appreciating them with the gift of a photo to text will be an excellent idea. Besides, parents are not so expectant of gifts from their children, especially if you are still growing. So, this will come as a big surprise to them. Look for a picture of your parent and create a picture with words out of it. The gift is coming from their child so that they will appreciate it a lot. You would not even believe how much they will cherish and love the gift. Siblings These are the closest to you apart from your parent, and honestly, buying gifts or appreciating your siblings might not be an idea that will ever cross your mind. But one thing you should know is that getting a gift for your siblings is a way of earning their respect and trust. You do not need to buy items of clothing and other accessories to surprise them because your parent is doing that already. You can make your gift for them to stand out, a gift that will always be with them. I remember buying Ice creams for my siblings, and the next day, they would ask me for more. Do you know why? The ice cream is no longer there with them, and they crave for more. But imagine giving them a gift of their picture with beautiful words written on it. They will cherish it because it is a gift, it is coming from you, and it is their picture. And this will make them happy, and you are pleased too. So, resulting in a win-win situation. Friends As you grow up, from high school to college and when you start working, a lot of friends will walk in your life, and some will take their leave. There is a saying that goes thus, “We part to meet, and we meet to part.” But some friends have been there for you since childhood up to Adulthood. Although there are times you have problems, you are happy and sad they are always there for you. Even though you do not want them some times, but they still stick around in your life. These set of people deserve a “Thank You” for sticking around in your life. When you give them a gift, it is a way of telling them you love having them around you. It can be their picture or even a picture; both of you took together; either way, make sure you create a picture with words and give it to them as a gift. You may present it as a surprise gift for them on their birthdays, graduation, or as a wedding gift. Just imagine putting a word like “I WOULD TRADE ANYTHING IN THE WORLD TO GO BACK TO THE DAY I MET YOU TO BECOME YOUR FRIEND ONCE AGAIN.” This statement will take them out of this world, matter how expensive a gift might be it will pale in comparison with this simple gift. Associates and Business Partners This idea may not be needed by everyone, but it is the right way of building a healthy relationship with your partners in business. It will help you gain considerable trust from them. Giving a gift to them will show how much concern you have for them. And you do not like them because of your partnership in business, but you have a direct interest in helping or working with them. You can present such a gift after sealing a business deal with them or celebrating years of being together. If you have a common business together that is already branded, you take a picture of your business logo and turn it into words. Or a picture you all had together and made text out of the picture. Your child This applies to parents, by turning your photo to words you can get fantastic gift ideas to give your children. You can use a picture of theirs while growing up or at some particular stage of life. And this will be a perfect gift for your child on their graduations, birthdays, weddings or they are leaving the house going to college for the first time. It is a way of telling your children that beyond words, you adore them, love them, and happy you have them. We can never exhaust the list of silent heroes present in our lives. We have them at schools as teachers, at home as grandparents, our lovers, and our mentors. The best thing we can do is to set some time out to reward them for what they have done in our lives. You may be asking the question “How to make a picture out of the text” But it is a straightforward process, and you only need to upload your pictures and the words you want to put on them. Choose if you wish to download in JPG or printed form, then your surprise gift is ready. Not all heroes wear capes, and some heroes are known while some remain unknown. You can replicate the love some people have given you a simple gift of Photo to words. And believe me, you can never go wrong doing so."
14,A Revolution for Change | Modern Art,shopping," Modern Art is a form of art that represents change, while boldly discards the rules and concepts of its predecessor art forms. Modern art had begun in the last part of the 19th century – it was harshly criticized back then, some even perceived it as ostentatious and obscene. But once the pioneers like Picasso and Monet paved the way, a revolution began. What is Modern Art Modern Art refers to the artworks that began in the late 19th century - the concept of modern art was to change the traditional way of art by approaching a more naturalistic method. Modern sculptures, modern statues, modern paintings, etc. were heavily inspired by African, European, and Mid-eastern culture. While traditional artists used objects in their art – the revolutionists of modern art used the abstract form of art to express their thought. Modern art defied all the rules of traditional art by rejecting realistic art for an impressionistic form of art. The new form of art deviated from the Western hold and went far and beyond to find inspiration. But till the day, modern art is disapproved by many art enthusiasts and so it still fights for its due credits. Varieties of Modern Art Modern Art includes many types of art form along with Neo-impressionism, Fauvism, Cubism, Surrealism, Expressionism, Pop Art, Minimalism, etc. Impressionism The subtle, thin strokes of brushes are used in this 19th-century movement called impressionism. The term ‘impressionism’ was coined after Claude Monet’s Impression. However, impressionism was criticized harshly when it was first formed, because of its unusual visual interpretation, and different perspective. But the movement became widely popular among artists since its beginning. The Impressionism art form was strongly inspired by African and Polynesian culture, this is why many artworks of this group look similar to these cultures. Neo-impressionism Neo-impressionism art is formed by combining realism and science – in this art form, the artist takes a realistic approach in his artwork by playing with light and shadow. The difference between impressionism and Neo-impressionism is that in the latter, the artist measures everything realistically – everything lies in a systematically, calculated way. Fauvism Fauvism movement started at the beginning of the 20th century in Paris. The powerful expression of the subject and the use of chaotic bold colors are the symbols of Fauvism art form. Like Impressionism, Fauvism was also frowned upon for its bold nature and raw expression. Cubism The representation of three-dimensional art, called Cubism flourished in the 20th century in Paris. Cube-shaped designs were used to create this type of art and later many spin-over art forms like Abstract art and Purism were inspired by Cubism. Modern Art Sculptures Modern art isn’t only confined within the canvas of paintings, but also reaches across to inspire sculptures and statues, too. But while modern art started as a revolution against the past and represented a vehement passion for change, the pioneer of modern sculpture Auguste Rodin, only wanted to find a new and unique way of sculpting. His works are inclined towards modern society, urbanism, and industrialism. Modern sculptures include an unusual portrayal of human and animals and often plays around with imagination and surrealism. The sculpture art form often creates bizarre and sardonic, sometimes parodic statues and monuments. The interesting thing about modern sculptures is that they are made for a specific place, at a specific angle to fully perceive its meaning. The concept of modern sculpture, like modern paintings, includes Impressionism, Neo-impressionism, Cubism, Surrealism, Abstract, etc. and modern statues hold a more natural, mystical, thought-provoking feel to them. Materials of Modern Sculpture Similar to Modern Art, Modern Sculpture also represents nature, and this is why the materials used to create modern statues and monuments also come from nature – such as stone, earth, logs, rocks, water, etc. Many natural elements are transformed into man-made materials such as rubber, glass, asphalt, concrete, etc. to use for modern sculpting. Minimal, bold, and futuristic – these are the motto of modern sculpture. By adding nature to it, the expression of the art form comes more fluently and easily, and it unnerves the spectator just as quickly by leaving a lot of time to think. Purchasing Modern Sculpture Modern sculptures and statues alike give us visual and sometimes philosophical pleasure whenever we run into them on streets, parks, museums, or shopping malls. So, the desire to purchase them ourselves is nothing odd, and many talented artists sell their brilliant works to individuals. If you are looking for some modern sculpture to enhance the beauty of your home, or your workplace, then you can look into the craft stores around you where you can find the ideal modern statue. Or, you can browse on the internet and you will find several online stores that sell modern sculptures from brilliant artists. You can then choose the right piece for yourself and evaluate the price. And if you find it worthy, then go for it; after making sure you are not getting robbed, of course. Generally, metal sculptures like bronze statues, iron statues, etc. are the most famous sculptures for their tendency of reliance, and lasting effect. Among others, stone statues are also great to pass the test of time. So, if you are buying one, be thoughtful as to what kind of sculpture you want, and if the piece you want synchronizes with the place where you want it to be. Also, keep in mind that modern art sculptures need to be taken care of. You cannot just buy one and toss it around the house – therefore, keep it in a place free from harm’s way and with a good, sturdy base. Keep your little ones away from your sculpture, and regularly wax and polish your figurine. Do not keep your sculpture in a dark, and dank place – as it can damage your piece, so, keep it in the open where there is sufficient air and just the perfect light. Art frees the soul – free your soul by indulging yourself in a little dab of modern art. And don’t hesitate to buy one modern sculpture if your budget agrees with you."
15,Cheap VS Expensive Mattresses: How to Get the Best Value for Money,shopping," Walk into any retail store, or browse online, and you may be surprised at the difference in price for a mattress, which can range anywhere from $300 to $3,000 or more. Unfortunately, this price disparity can add unnecessary stress and confusion to the shopping process. As a result, uninformed shoppers are at a greater risk of: Settling for a cheap, low quality mattress that offers little comfort and will not last long, or Being tricked into buying an overly pricey mattress, where the high cost if justified by features that are not really essential to a good night’s sleep Of course, neither scenario is ideal. But how do you strike the right balance between great value for money and lasting satisfaction? You need to know what factors influence the price of a mattress and decide which features are most important to you. This way, you’re more likely to make an informed choice and enjoy many years of blissful sleep. Here’s how to walk away a winner the next time you buy a mattress. By far, the best way to judge the quality of a mattress is to know what materials are inside, and how they benefit you – if at all. However, due to the wide range of mattress types and the different terms used to describe their construction and materials, it can feel a bit overwhelming trying to make sense of what you’re really buying. To help you make sense of the differences between a cheap and expensive mattress, here’s a breakdown of the materials used in each type of mattress, and how their quality can impact your sleep. An innerspring mattress is made up of an interconnected steel coil support system. And a pocket spring mattress is comprised of individual springs placed in little pockets of cloth. Both coil systems are covered by various layers of padding and upholstery to provide comfort and support.[1] To keep costs down, a cheaper spring mattress may have low quality padding and foam. This can result in pain and discomfort, as the mattress is more prone to sagging, and the padding may not be durable enough to provide relief to key pressure points in the body – namely the hips, joints, and shoulders. Furthermore, a cheaper spring mattress may have a lower coil count, which can result in greater discomfort and motion transfer. There are many key differences between cheap and expensive memory foam. First off, cheap memory foam has a shorter lifespan. Cheaper models might last as little as 5 years, while a pricier one could last 10 years or more. In fact, when you split the cost down to year-by-year, the pricier model could save you money in the long run – as it won’t need to be replaced as often. Secondly, cheap memory foam is softer and prone to sagging. While the softness is subjective, the sagging definitely is not. It will only leave you feeling sore and uncomfortable. Premium memory foam, on the other hand, is far denser and will maintain its shape for longer. Finally, premium memory foam is often more eco and allergen-friendly. This is because they are low-VOC and contain toxic-free chemicals, which helps to reduce their carbon footprint and let sensitive sleepers breathe easy Natural latex foam is made from a milky white liquid extracted from the Hevea-Brasillienis tree, also known as the rubber tree. The liquid latex is transformed into foam through a vulcanization process. There are a few variations to the process which enables the foam to be either: dense and firm, or soft and pillowy. Synthetic latex is a petroleum based product crafted from man-made ingredients like Styrene-Butadiene Rubber (SBR). Although cheaper, synthetic latex is less resilient and elastic than the real thing. Some find synthetic latex to be less springy and more ‘dull’ feeling. It can also produce a more abrasive odour that many find unappealing. Some companies offer ‘blended latex’ which combines both natural and synthetic latex into the one mattress. While these companies boast about combining the best of both worlds, the reality is, this type of latex mattress is still a cheaper and ultimately inferior alternative to the real thing. Regardless of which type of mattress you choose, it’s important to do your research. This way, when the time comes to shop online or visit a retail store, you’ll have all the info you need to make an informed choice. As a result, you’ll be more satisfied with your purchase and be rewarded with a consistently good night’s sleep."

20,5 Ways To Reduce Your Electricity Bill,shopping," Currently, many more people than usual are at home all day due to COVID-19 lockdown using devices such as computers, laptops and TVs.  Not only is the cost of electricity in the UK rising, but many people are also worried about their jobs. Here are our top 5 tips on how to reduce your electricity bill. Replacing your current light bulbs with energy-saving light bulbs can save you a considerable amount of money on your energy bill. In comparison to a standard bulb which loses 80% of their energy to heat, LED light bulbs only lose 20%. LED light bulbs can also last up to 10 times longer than your standard halogen bulbs, therefore saving you money in the long-run. Experts have also suggested that switching to LED lighting can save you over £240 a year in energy costs. It’s also worth noting that LED light bulbs do not contain any harmful chemicals so if you wish to do your part for the environment too, then LED light bulbs are a great step forward in reducing your carbon footprint. One of the simplest ways to save money on your energy bill is to switch off and unplug any appliances you are not using. Before you leave the house in the morning or head to bed at night, make sure you have turned off the power to all appliances that do not need to be on – including televisions, laptops, kettles, toasters etc. Even on standby or not in use, these appliances consume a considerable amount of energy. Also, avoid keeping your mobile phone connected to a charger overnight when you go to sleep. Not only will this save you huge amounts of your energy bill, but it will also reduce the likelihood of electrical dangers occurring. It may seem trivial, but switching off your lights when you leave a room can significantly reduce your energy bills. It doesn’t just need to be when you leave a room either. If you’re home during the day, the sunlight will brighten up your room without the need for any additional lighting. Take advantage of the natural lighting whenever you can and only turn on the lights in your home when it begins to get too dark to see. Before leaving the house or going to bed, make sure to turn off all lights in your house – including any front porch or back yard lighting. Instead of drying off your clothes in a dryer which uses up huge amounts of energy, consider opting for a more natural process by air-drying. If you have a washing line, hang your washing outside.  Or even just hang it up on a clothes horse indoors and it will dry free of charge. Solar panels may seem more hassle than they are worth, but in fact, they are a great long-term solution to saving money. Although the initial installation may seem costly, solar panels are a fantastic solution to protecting the environment and the money in your wallet. Sunlight is free, so running your home on sunlight energy can severely reduce your energy bills. If your electricity bill is still high, then try somewhere like uSwitch to find a better deal."

You pull the lever downwards or upwards to adjust your back or footrest. This mechanism is not as smooth and requires relatively more physical exertion. Powered Reclining Sofa A powered recliner allows you to shift the position of your seat using a power button. You just press the button with your fingers and the backrest and footrest start shifting like butter. The transition is quite smooth, however, a powered recliner needs an electric connection to function. Adjustable Recliner Sofa An adjustable recliner might seem like a regular futon sofa. It adds the functionality of manually adjusting the backrest hinged somewhere between the seat and back. You can tilt the back with levers however, most of the options do not come with footrests. These kinds of recliners are reasonably priced with minimum functionality. What is a dual reclining sofa?

You need to measure the available space as well as the required number of seats. After examining your available space, you need to be clear on the size of the recliner offered by the seller. Check: Small Apartment Sectional Sofa Work mechanism or ergonomics: As discussed before, we need to be sure about the working mechanism of the recliner. Whether it is powered, manual or adjustable. A recliner without comfort is pointless so be sure regarding the ergonomics of design as well. A round head cushion provides better neck support while watching TV. Round side armrests provide better cushioning. Spring suspension inner frame provides a durable surface to sit on. Check: Sleeper Sofa Under 300 Reclining position: Recliners come with varying recline ability. Some offer a stationary seat with moving back and footrest. Others come with the ability to even tilt the complete chair at 180 degrees to lie down just like a floating bed. A few adjustable recliners come with only movable backrest and no footrest available. Construction Material: The upper upholstered layer is mostly responsible for providing a comfortable and smooth surface. Leather is the most popular choice for recliners since it provides a clean and smooth surface that gives the notion of strong material. A piece of jute or polyester is a cheaper option but it would not be that comfortable due to less plush and cushioning available. Wood is probably the weakest material to be used in recliners due to its sturdiness and lee mobility. Most of the comfiest options come in metallic frames.

11,A History Of The Cufflink,shopping," Men have been wearing cufflinks for very many years, and depending on whom you believe, they date back as far as either the 15th, 16th, or 17th centuries. Originally, they were only worn by important people of wealth and high position. Certainly, Charles II had cufflinks made to celebrate special occasions such as weddings and state occasions. What we do know is that man have been wearing shirts, or items similar to shirts, since woven fabric was first invented around 5000 BC. Although styles changed, the basic shirt was a tunic open to the front with a collar and sleeves. It was worn next to the skin and was washable and protected the body from the heavy and rougher fabrics of jackets and coats, and at the same time protected the outer garments from contact with the body. In the Middle Ages it became fashionable to add ruffs, frills, and other decorations such as embroidery, to the parts of the shirt which were visible such as the collar, cuffs, and chest areas. The collars were tied together with coloured ribbons which were the forerunners of the tie, as were the cuffs. At court and other formal locations, the shirt ended in frills which hung down over the wrist, and this continued until the end of the 18th century. In the 19th century, men began to wear formal suits to go to work and a dinner jacket or tailcoat in the evening. The shirt began to have stiff starched collars and cuffs, and although button cuffs had been produced, the starched double cuffs were too stiff to take a button, which resulted in men in the upper and middle classes wearing cufflinks. Furthermore, with the coming of the industrial revolution, it became easy to manufacture cufflinks in mass production. However, cufflinks containing colourful gemstones were only worn by men who had a great deal of self-confidence, but that all changed towards the end of the century when Edward, Prince of Wales, later Edward VII, began wearing Faberge cufflinks containing gemstones and people copied him, although many of the cufflinks manufactured contained lesser stones that were not nearly as expensive. At around this time, cufflinks for men became fashion accessories and were an acceptable type of jewellery for men in the US and Britain. In the early 1900’s, cufflinks were worn more than ever, and contained real gemstones, semi-precious stones, and even coloured glass in cheap copies. Cufflinks made of enamel in a wide range of colours became popular and they were produced in every possible intricate geometric shape. The popularity of cufflinks spread into Europe as well and two towns in Germany became centres for their production. In Pforzheim, jewellery manufacturers produced cufflinks with real gold and silver which were for the more well-heeled, while in Idar-Oberstein they were mass-produced for those with smaller budgets. Pforzheim still produces expensive cufflinks today, some of historic design, and designer cufflinks at the upper end of the scale with modern patterns. After the end of the Second World War, materials became available again, and men started to wear and carry all sorts of different accessories as well as cufflinks, such as cigarette cases and lighters, key chains, tie pins, rings, wrist watches as opposed to pocket watches, money clips and more. In the 1970’s cufflinks fell out of favour to some extent, as the Woodstock generation reverted to button cuffs, but then in the 80’s it became fashionable to wear a suit and tie to work, and the cufflink returned to its’ rightful place once more. That has more or less continued until today, although the tie and tie pin are worn less. Cufflink designs vary quite considerably, with the type with pin and toggle being most common, but there are also the double panel types with a design on each end connected by a post, or more often a chain. Fabric cufflinks are still popular such as the silk knot with two Turk’s head or monkey’s fist knots. These were introduced by the French shirt-maker Charvet in Paris in 1904. Today they are not usually of silk, but a cheaper fabric over an elastic core. There are even metal cufflinks shaped to look like a silk knot, as they are so popular."

13,Choosing the best glasses for your face shape,shopping," Glasses have gained a pretty bad reputation over the years of giving the impression that you are nerdier, or that they are only for intelligent people. However, with designers coming out with trendy styles and modern designs, glasses are becoming more and more of a fashion statement, with people becoming increasingly more comfortable wearing them. If you’re an avid glasses wearer or a newbie to the spectacle world, choosing your style can be quite difficult. Whether you’re feeling adventurous and want to try a new frame or you simply have no clue which style would suit your face shape, read on to find your perfect fit. Heart shape – A heart shape is commonly known to have a slightly narrower jawline with a wider top part and luckily, many heart shapes have some great cheekbones. To balance this out and add more width to your chin, go for a rounder or more oval shaped frame, this will help to soften out any angular lines. Frames to keep away from would be anything that is too heavy on top of the frame or decorative, as this will only add more to the forehead and less to the bottom half of the face. Oval shape – Oval face shapes are one of the most desired, due to its natural symmetry, this shape is easy to style and allows you to play around with styles more. If you’re looking to maintain the natural balance of an oval shape, opt for something that is a similar size to the broadest part of your face, or, slightly larger. Play around with colours, thickness and shapes with your glasses… why? Because you can! Base-down triangle – This face shape is usually narrower through the forehead while moving down the face widening at the cheeks and jaw. If you’re looking to balance your shape out a bit more, the perfect fit for you is something with a cat-eye frame or something that has a slightly heavier frame on the top. This is a great shape to have a play and be bold, while nailing the look. Opt for bold block colours, be out there and have fun… you have the perfect shape for it. Round face shape – A rounder shape has little structured lines, creating a softer look. The width and length of the face should also be a very similar size. If you’re wanting to elongate your shape and make it appear slightly thinner, frames with an angular shape or more rectangular making them wider than the length can all help to make your face appear longer. Square face shape – A well-structured shape that is perfectly balanced. With a broad forehead and a strong jawline, the shape would have equal proportions all round. The cheekbones on this shape are often more in line with other facial features, as opposed to other shapes where the cheekbones are slightly higher. If you’re wanting to soften the angles of this face shape, opt for frames that are greater in their width than the length and paired with a thinner frame, this will help to achieve a narrower shape. However, avoid going too narrow with the frames so that it sits in line with your cheekbones. Rimless glasses are also a great choice and will help to soften the structure. Oblong face shape – An oblong shape is greater in length than it is in width and the cheekbones are situated a little higher on the face. Very similar to the oval, oblong shapes can suit any frame. Opt for something slightly larger, possibly even oversized. A wide rectangular or square and although nothing is off-limits with this shape, be careful when choosing a smaller style, as this can appear slightly out of place or off-balanced. Whatever your style may be; bold, classic, vintage or simple just be comfortable. Pop into your local opticians and get them to help you choose your own style. Who better than people who know face shapes and eyes more than their own!"
14,Classic wedding dress,shopping," It is known that most brides want to be as original on the day of the wedding, which is also valid for the wedding dress. But in order not to fall into eccentricity and to annihilate the solemnity of this unique day, nothing compares to the power of the classic style, but its adoption is not as easy as it seems. We will explain to you what some classic wedding dresses entail, but also how to match them. Even if it is a classic wedding dress, elements such as the shape of the cup, the length of the sleeves, the length of the dress, the shape of the neckline are variable, depending on the preferences of each bride and all options can be integrated into a classic look. The classic wedding dresses should be relatively simple, preferably in the form of a princess or a mermaid, with no accessories to stand out and no elements to shock. They should not have colour spots and are made especially of lace because this is the most representative material for such an event. Wedding dress and shoes What shoes to wear to a classic wedding dress? Contrary to appearance, choosing a classic wedding shoe is not so easy. Over time, wedding traditions have evolved with them and shoes. To be sure that you do not deviate from the style, I recommend you to opt for a pair of closed wedding shoes and sharpen the front. If it's hot, you still have the opportunity to cut the front and back shoes, but this is the only exception. A classic wedding dress cannot be worn with boots, stiletto shoes or sandals. These are too far removed from the initial style. Next to the dress, the chosen wedding shoes will surely be studied for a long time by a lot of curious looks, so that a relatively large investment in them should not be viewed reluctantly, especially since one season. in another, they tend to become more versatile and easy to match. Wedding dress and hairstyle You may not have thought so far, but it is necessary to match the dress with a classic hairstyle, which involves a refined, timeless and undeniably elegant bun. It can be made in a thousand and one shapes, but all that matters is to be a bun. You can even make yourself a braided wreath, but it must be made from your hair. Another element you need to take care of is choosing the veil, which should also be classic, of variable length, depending on your height and the shape of the dress, but it does not have to be very loaded. Preferably it should be a simple veil, caught under the elbow or a veil on the face."
15,How to Choose a Reliable Tailoring Shop in Bangkok,shopping," If you are planning to visit Thailand and also want to get your clothes tailored there, you need to be a little careful.  There are many tourists who end up with a poor quality stitched suit after paying a reasonable price. There are many tailoring shops in and around Bangkok, but not all of them are reliable. Here are a few things that you need to keep in your mind when considering a tailor for your bespoke suit. Bespoke means bespoke! A bespoke suit means it is hand sewn, and there is no machine job. The fact is that every tailor shop in Bangkok calls itself bespoke. But the truth could be different. Spend a few minutes in a tailor shop, and you will learn about their suit making process. There are tailor shops in Thailand that offers you handmade bespoke suits of top international standards at cost-saving prices. Care for the fabric A good suit often gets its value because of the fabric used in making it. Bangkok tailors can offer you good quality fabrics. The interlacing and the lining will also depend on the thread quality. If you don’t get a good material for your suit, it will never add to your style.  Whether you go for cotton or wool, it should be soft and breathable. Understand the workmanship The workmanship is also an important factor that determines the quality of a suit. There are many tailors in Bangkok that only take your measurements and pass the work to other tailors. You need to choose a tailor that does the actual sewing and has a team of expert tailor masters.  An actual tailor will work with more dedication and will be available for final tweaks as well. Turnaround time A hand sewn bespoke suit requires time. The suit making process involves several steps, including shaping, pressing, stitching, reshaping and so on. Many times, final product requires necessary fitting changes. You can always doubt a tailor that claims to stitch your bespoke suit in just two days instead of two weeks. Design sensibility If the tailor has no design sensibility, it cannot produce the garment that you have in your mind.  Unlike a tailor shop in Naples, a Bangkok tailor may not be able to accommodate your personal choices, such as high waist suppression or a natural shoulder. But they will just keep repeating that they can stitch bespoke suits. But it’s never hopeless, till then Ambassador & Smart Fashion (AMBFA) is available in Bangkok with their expert tailoring services.

1,"The Rise And Fall, And Rise Again, Of Cufflinks",shopping," Cufflinks date back as far as the early 1500’s when they were worn by royalty and other men of high standing. Each pair was made individually and to order and would be studded with rare gems and stones or contain intricate coloured patterns. They were meant to emphasise that the wearer was a man of importance, and they succeeded in doing exactly that. These were not for the common man – the hoi polloi. However, with the coming of the Industrial Revolution in the mid 1800’s all that changed. It now became easy to mass-produce cufflinks and they became available to the middle classes who flocked to buy them since they were now also affordable. Very few shirts were made with an attached button because of the fashion for starched cuffs. It was very difficult to get a button through the hole in a starched cuff, so cufflinks were all the rage. Cufflinks remained in fashion until the early 1900’s when the Duke of Windsor greatly influenced male fashion, and he was rather casual in the way that he dressed. Furthermore, in the early 1920’s, the starched shirt cuff had gone out of fashion with the arrival of the sports shirt, so cuff links were no longer needed. Cufflinks became associated with formal wear for dinners and theatre visits. Cufflinks today are certainly not so popular as they were in the late 1800’s, but nonetheless very many men still wear them. Perhaps not as many as wear the button cuff, but this can partly be put down to convenience and ease of use. A button cuff has the button already there, so there is no need to purchase cufflinks. It takes less time to button a cuff than it does to put cufflinks through, so it is easier to do. It also saves on the cost of cufflinks. Despite that, there are very many men today who do use cufflinks and they are largely men of importance – company directors, MP’s, senior accountants, and many more at the tops of their professions – because they want to project a look which says that they are outstanding, and at the same time most of them recognise that looking smart is important and also shows respect to the people with whom they work, or their customers when they visit them. These are people who would never dream of going to the office in jeans and a T-shirt, although times have become very relaxed about dress in some quarters and there are some people who do. The choice of cufflinks can also say an awful lot about the wearer. So for example, when going to a formal dinner party or perhaps a board meeting one would not wear cufflinks with a brash design on them (and there are plenty of those available, such as cufflinks in the shape of beer mugs, horseshoes, traffic lights, and all sorts of different designs) but rather wear cufflinks with a more restrained and distinguished look to them. When you want people to respect you, it is essential that you show them respect first. To get an idea of just how many different designs of cufflinks there are, simply go online and search for cufflinks. Google comes up with no less than 190,000,000 results. So clearly there is still great demand for cufflinks, despite the rather lax attitude about dress in some quarters. Men who just want to go to their place of work and get a pay cheque at the end of the month are happy to do so in causal clothes, which many employers allow today. However, those who want to get ahead and get to the top know that they have to look the part. Cufflinks are available in a huge range of styles and designs, and a very popular design incorporates something concerning your ethnicity – the country to which you belong. So you can get English cufflinks, Scottish ones, Welsh, Irish, Spanish cufflinks, US cufflinks, Canadian cufflinks, all containing something pertinent to the particular country. USA cufflinks, for example, are made showing the American Eagle, the Statue of Liberty, the Bald Eagle’s Head, and even the National Football League among others. English ones show the English Oak, Welsh ones the Welsh Dragon, Irish ones the Shamrock, and so on. So you can look the part while at the same time displaying your respect for your country of birth."
2,Why do crystal glass trophies make the perfect corporate gift?,shopping," Crystals are unarguably one of the most breakout stars in the whole decor business including as gift items. Be it vases, chandelier, small gifts, or even as trophies, every venue or household, is incomplete without a crystal touch. The look of this specific item is superbly classy and no other items can replace the charm of it. Apart from this, the growing popularity of crystals has awakened the beauty and power of crystal energy. Crystal has been at the forefront of wellness and fashion trends because of its pristine outlook and effortlessly gives an idea of your preference as well as sophistication. Crystals envelop an appeal of mysticism that leads to its popularity and certainly carries a certain profundity. However, often a crystal and glass get interchanged due to their similar outlook. Although they have certain similarities they are distinctly different on several forums. Therefore before investing, it is extremely important to do thorough research about the authenticity of the product because crystals are something that you can take pride lifelong. Due to its highly intricate and classic edge, crystals have been included in making trophies as well because it ignites a sense of appreciation and value to the receiver. As a result, in recent times, crystal glass trophies are in trend as corporate gifts and let the receiver become a proud owner of something that they can cherish forever. It's a symbol of class and therefore you should be very picky while buying one, keeping your budget in mind. Always choose a proper brand to make the splurge. When buying one crystal item, it is very difficult to spot a vivid difference between crystal and glass. The main aspect which is responsible for differentiating the category is the lead content of the glass. However, there are other striking factors like the thickness in cut, clarity, refraction, composition, weight, and sound that distinguishes the two. To make the correct purchase for any sort of crystal item, read the below-mentioned points that can help you to get an immediate idea about the difference between a crystal and a glass. Crystal clear transparency: There is a reason for the phrase Crystal clear clarity. Crystals are seamless, unlike glasses that seem cloudy in appearance. Glasses especially this made from soda-lime appear to be hazy. Due to their increased clarity, crystals are the first choice in jewellery, chandeliers, glassware, etc. The reason why crystal items are so highly-priced is because of their lucidity. The lower the lead content in crystal the expensive it gets. Durable: No matter the thickness of the crystal, all of them are durable. It can be crafted precisely into very thick, big, yet a beautiful piece. However, fine crystals are comparatively thinner when compared due to the lead content in the crystal which can help to sculpt the crystal into thinner items. Whereas normal glass needs to be fired and worked at high temperature for mouldings purposes and addition of lead to it offers more working time. Precise Cuts: Cut out a crystal is extremely superior and edgy. It is much more than that of glass and the touch and feel of the smoothness differ significantly. Crystals are very smooth to touch and can be cut in a million ways. On the other hand, glasses can be brittle. The only way to differentiate between the two while buying a crystal is to simply feel it. Refracts clearly: Crystals can refract and reflect distinct spectrums vividly. It is only crystals that can throw off mystical light. Fine crystals sparkle prominently in sunlight and the refraction quality of a crystal depends majorly on its lead content. There is also an optically clear crystal that goes ahead to create a rainbow effect because of its high refractive nature. These types of crystals are polished and made blemish-free to create such an intriguing effect."

The process of choosing the wedding dress is one in which you have more reasons than ever to be yourself and that the decisions must be totally yours. So, remember this before you go to bridal shop London and buy your wedding dress! Classic: you are a classic bride if you bet on the traditional, for what does not go out of style, simple but elegant and sophisticated. This type of bride will always choose a design with a boat neck or V-neckline accompanied by a veil and jewels such as pearls or diamonds. Romantic: they are delicate and simple. Romantic brides usually choose tulle or chiffon dresses with romantic embroideries with floral motifs. Boho: brides who marry on the beach or outdoors bet on a boho dress, to give a hippie style to your look, with light and vaporous fabrics, and accessories such as floral crowns. Vintage: you are a vintage bride if you love old styles and lace dresses. They look for the most spectacular fabric (even inherited) that gives that vintage look to their look. Modern: the modern bride wants to give an avant-garde touch to her look, she is bold and committed to asymmetrical cuts in her dress, even for short dresses or large openings. According to the shape of your body Triangle body: in this case, what you have to achieve with the dress is to balance by drawing attention to the top of the dress. To do this, decide on a model of line A that is not too tight so that the hips do not stand out.

Hourglass body: having a balanced figure, you can opt for any type of dress but, without a doubt, the ones that will best suit you will be the tube or mermaid cut. Inverted triangle body: the essential thing is to give volume to the hip and subtract it from the shoulders. According to the chest: if you want to hide some chest, bet on the V-necklines.

And for girls who want to mark the chest, it is best to be a very catchy dress and the less low cut the better. Short women will look great dressed in white! However, you should avoid dresses with very bulky skirts, they will make you look smaller because of the optical effect of the width-height ratio. Try to choose dresses without horizontal cuts and without excessive flight. If you have curves or are very thin, bet on the princess cut and fit the waist so that the hips are concealed. In the design body part, choose folds or drapes, perfect for concealing. If you are pregnant: if you are in the first months of pregnancy, it will not be visible, you will be able to use the same dress that you had thought attending to your body type. Only up to 4 months! From there, the body will change remarkably, so, bet on the empire cut and a fluid fabric, which will be the most comfortable."

6,Cufflinks – And How To Wear Them,shopping," When it comes to dressing for the occasion, one of the most under-rated pieces of sartorial elegance for men is the humble – or perhaps not so humble – cufflink. The origin of the cufflink can be traced back to the late 15th or early 16th century. At that time the only thing that kept the ends of the shirtsleeves together were pieces of string that were used to tie them. However, the French King Louis XIV came to the throne in 1643 and by this time the pieces of string were on the way out and had been replaced by glass beads joined together by a small chain. At around the same sort of time the English King Charles II was wearing cufflinks, although this was before he became king in 1660. He started to have cufflinks made for him for special occasions such as weddings and state banquets. As production techniques developed, more and more men of the upper classes began wearing cufflinks and had them made using extravagant pieces of jewellery in order to define their status in society. However, by the middle of the 19th century when the industrial revolution began, cufflinks became much easier to manufacture. At the same time more men of what had previously been the working class became elevated to middle class, and in order to show their new status began wearing cufflinks as well. Cufflinks were used for both formal occasions such as weddings and dinner parties, as well as for use with business wear. Fast forward to today, and many men who would have worn a suit to work thirty or forty years ago now dress far less formally. Some men actually go to work in an office in jeans and T-shirt and depending on the management of the business this may be seen as perfectly acceptable. Obviously though, there are still jobs where it is necessary to dress smartly, such as the position of desk attendant at a hotel or a waiter at a swish restaurant, and these men will wear a formal suit and tie together with a shirt with double cuffs and of course use cufflinks with which to fasten them together. Even though fewer men today wear cufflinks, there are still an enormous number of men who do use them, and you only have to search online to find thousands upon thousands of different designs. Furthermore, you can pretty much pay what you like as well, with prices for a pair ranging from ten or twenty pounds to several thousand. Many cufflinks have been handed down from father to son and may have been in the family for generations. The sort of cufflinks that you wear can make a statement about the sort of man that you are. For formal occasions, such as those which require a dinner jacket, it is always best to choose cufflinks that are refined and tasteful in design rather than some of the more brash patterns that are available. Simple, understated designs are the way to go for these occasions. Much the same applies to a business suit. Unless you are the boss, you don’t want to appear to outshine him at work as it probably won’t go down very well. Nonetheless, you can still experiment with patterns, colours, and materials. For instance, you can get knotted silk cufflinks in a wide range of colours and they cost as little as four or five pounds a pair, so you can afford to have them in several colours to match the particular shirt you choose to wear that day. You can also get cufflinks that describe your nationality. So for example, you can have a pair with a Scottish Thistle design or Celtic design cufflinks. You can have a pair of Celtic symbol cufflinks featuring the Welsh dragon, or an English design with the English Rose or the Three Lions on them. Cufflinks don’t have to be round or square, either. You can buy cufflinks in the shape of a racing car, a horse, a beer barrel, and many other different designs. The main thing is to ensure that the cufflinks that you choose for a special occasion are suitable, so don’t go for any of the comedy designs that are available."
7,Bridal shop in London,shopping," Finding an ideal wedding dress can be extremely stressful. After all, you've probably never tried wedding dresses before. In addition, for more women, it is probably the most expensive dress to care for or ever buy, so the pressure of choice is even higher. At the wedding, all eyes will be drawn to the bride spread. It is no wonder that choosing a wedding dress can be very difficult to manage. What the perfect wedding dress looks like? But what does a perfect wedding dress mean? For some brides, it can be a princess wedding dress, with a wide skirt and a very long train, while other brides will be oriented to a mermaid-style wedding dress, which will focus more on the figure than on the volume of the skirt, and last but not least, the brides that will choose a light wedding dress that will allow them to feel at home. The right dress for your silhouette The hourglass silhouette: this type of silhouette is characterized by well-defined shapes, with a small waist, and the bust and hips similarly proportioned. The hourglass type silhouettes are very sensual, and almost any type of dress fits well on this body type. The rectangular silhouette: this body has shoulders and hips of the same width but does not have a well-defined waist. In this category, we can include an androgynous silhouette. To add extra femininity, the bride must choose an extra-volume dress in the hips or bust area. Silhouette in the form of triangle or pear: women with such a silhouette have broader hips than shoulders, generous back, and thin waist. In the case of future brides with this type of figure, a balance must be created between the trunk and the lower part of the body. The inverted triangle silhouette: women with inverted triangle-shaped bodies have broader shoulders than hips. The matching dresses add volume to the underside of the body and distract attention from the width of the shoulders. Brides that have this silhouette can choose princess, A-line or prom dresses. Round or apple silhouette: the round silhouette is characterized by a generous bust, broad shoulders, and undefined waist. The limbs are usually thin and the hips are narrower than the shoulders, so the wedding dress should mask the trunk and highlight the breasts or legs. Choose a dress for your style Often, when looking for a perfect wedding dress, future wives forget to consider an important criterion on which their decision should be based: the wedding dress should match the style and personality of the one who wears it. So do not choose a princess wedding dress if you feel like you want a more extravagant model! For future ladies who want to look impeccable at the most important event of their life, Nivaldo comes with a wide range of wedding dresses, which impress with elegance, originality, style and great taste."

9,A Quick Intro to Oud and its Usage in Perfumes,shopping," There is perhaps no other ingredient that has dominated the world of fragrances in recent years like the famous oud. Known for its deep musky aroma with rich and smoky notes, it has been used to some extent by almost all major international perfume designer brands. While popularity has grown strong in recent years throughout Europe and the Western world in general, oud is an old classic in the Middle East, long used as a powerful component of fragrances and associated with power, luxury and prestige. What is oud? The oil is distilled from the resinous heartwood of the Asian aquilaria tree which is exceedingly rare. The distinctive smell that we all recognise is produced when the heartwood becomes diseased with a certain mould, leaving it dark, oily and incredibly dense – creating the perfect situation for this scent to materialise and mature into what is often known as ‘liquid gold’ across the globe. It’s worth noting here that although many top international brands such as Tom Ford use oud, many mainstream fragrances actually use a synthetic form of the scent, created to be affordable for the mass market with a lower quality. Why Oud? So what is it that makes the smell of oud so alluring? Despite its hefty price tag, this special ingredient has become one of the most important components of the perfume world today. Some believe that the scent of oud carries with it a depth unlike other ingredients, which is lower in the composition of fragrance notes and lasts far longer than others, such as lighter citrus or fruity notes. Others believe that it is simply the distinctive smell that makes it stand out, with an almost overpowering pungent quality that is hard to overlook. Or maybe it’s just the novelty of using an ingredient that is more expensive than gold? It’s not the first time that culture and fashion have spread from the east partly because of their contrast to Western contemporary fashion and ideas – with an ‘exotic’ feel making it appealing to European perfumers and consumers. Ultimately, it’s a unique smell that continues to stand apart from other typical discount perfumes that can be found with more common components like sandalwood or vanilla. Oud today? Wearing a bolder scent is becoming an increasingly popular move when it comes to perfumes. While this type of smell may appear too ‘aged’ or musky for most people – especially younger buyers looking for light day-to-day fragrances – the perception of harsher, more punchy smells is changing and today it symbolises individuality as much as anything else. For those who want to break away from lighter more predictable  scents, oud is the perfect choice that sits at the opposite side of the spectrum, with deeper and longer lasting notes that are perfect for making a statement. Depending on your budget, there are hundreds of options for the daring – or those who would merely like to experiment with something different. For example, Tom Ford’s popular Oud Wood has been a big hit for those who don’t want to venture too deeply into the world of oud, or even the slightly more punchy Tobacco Oud, which still has a lighter effect than some of the more traditional and high strength oud options. If you take a trip to the Middle East and some parts of Asia, you’ll even get the chance to make your own scent in certain destinations where perfumery has become an attraction in itself. Whether you are in Dubai and want to mix your own bespoke bottle, or Thailand and have the opportunity to pick up a fairly affordable priced bottle of oud-based perfume, you could pick up a unique oud fragrance while on your travels. It’s not likely that you’ll find oud as a discount perfume that matches other good value colognes and perfumes, but its popularity is still spreading and many retailers offer products at prices that are incredibly good value."
10,How to Make Your Perfume Last Longer,shopping," Perfume isn’t cheap. At least, the good stuff isn’t. And there’s a good reason for this. But without going into the details of how perfume is made and branded by various international designers, it’s enough to say that if you want to find a distinctive and high quality perfume, you’ll need to spend a considerable sum. For most, this is more than worth it for all the benefits a great fragrance can offer. However, for others, the cost is simply too much when weighed against other of life’s essentials. So for those who see that perfume is simply not a luxury that they can afford, we’re here to offer some tips on how you can make your perfume last longer – making it a more affordable purchase. With these essential tips, you’ll be able to make your favourite scent part of your life for longer, whether you have treated yourself to your all-time favourite eau de toilette or have received a lovely bottle of cologne for your birthday. Choose the right scent When it comes to selecting a fragrance, actually choosing the right smell goes beyond simply enjoying the fragrance of a certain bottle or matching it to your other cosmetics, such as your favourite bourjois lipstick. It also requires you to choose a perfume that can work harder for you. If you opt for a stronger fragrance concentration of oils in your perfume, typically found in eu de parfum rather than eu de toilette, the smell will last longer on your skin after it is applied. These products will also typically be a more original and natural composition of the perfume, designed to carry the various notes more powerfully and over a longer period of time. If the base note of the perfume is strong enough, it will last for a considerable amount of time, when other more temporary notes fade out. While you might love citrus, popular with hundreds of discount perfumes, this kind of note typically fades out quite quickly. So keep this in mind when choosing your next perfume. Learn to layer One great trick is to provide a layer of oil on your skin before you apply your perfume. This can be done with a simple body lotion and the effect is that the fragrance will bind more closely with the surface of your skin, making it last longer. Following this general rule, the best time to spray is after a shower or bath, when you have applied some unscented lotion, which will hydrate your clean and fresh skin, allowing it to hold fragrances more effectively. Some fragrance types also have matching body moisturisers or lotions that can be used to maximise the impact of layering. This will literally build up layers of the fragrance on your skin. To come back to your favourite bourjois lipstick or any other lipstick product you love, remember than there are deep olfactory ties between perfumes and lipstick, which, when applied together in combination, deliver a more complex and longer lasting overall aroma. You can also choose to layer your perfume throughout the day, such as spraying one perfume in the morning and refreshing it with another one at a different time of the day. The combination between the two can create an effective layering, but be careful that you are choosing scents that match each other. Avoid rubbing The best way to wear fragrance is on the skin at the pulse points. These are the wrist, behind the ears, elbows and on the neck. The reason for this is because the skin is prone to warming up more at these areas, helping the scent to project itself.  While doing this, simply dab your perfume in the right places, rather than rubbing, which could reduce the effectiveness of coverage. It’s far better to leave things to unfold naturally as the substance warms up on the skin."

15,Buying Goods From China For Selling In The UK,shopping," There is a lot of money to be made from online selling of goods, as long as you go about it the right way. When it comes to low costs and potential huge profit margins, manufacturers in China are very hard to beat. Only very recently, in the last six weeks, I was browsing through Amazon looking for something and I came across a VERY nice men’s watch in blue with a leather strap. I wasn’t looking for a watch, but when I saw the price, I ordered it straight away. It was £2.25 plus postage of 0.59p!! That was for one item. Now I had to wait a couple of weeks for it to be shipped from China, but who cares? As it happened, it didn’t arrive at all, so I contacted the suppliers. They were full of apologies and promptly sent another one, which did arrive. Now that was a total of £2.84 for ONE item – and at that price they were making a profit. Now imagine what they would offer if you bought in bulk – say 50 or 100 pieces. You could sell these watches online for £20 very easily, making huge profits in the process. So where do you go in order to begin to find products to buy from Chinese manufacturers? You need to do some research online, but one very big supplier is Alibaba through whom you can buy almost anything at all. They have over sixty thousand manufacturers supplying them and somewhere over 15 million products that you can buy. In fact, according to Wikipedia, they are the world’s fourth largest internet company by revenue. Furthermore, Alibaba has a worldwide reputation to keep up, so they try to only deal with reputable manufacturers who can be trusted. However, it can happen that the odd bad apple features on their site, but when you sign in and click on Orders at the top right you can order with Trade Assurance. Trade Assurance guarantees product quality and on time shipment. If the product quality or shipping time differs from what you and the supplier agree, Alibaba will provide you with assistance in getting a satisfactory outcome, including getting your money back if necessary. Another thing you can do when buying from an Alibaba supplier is to carry out a Whois check. This will tell you about the ownership of the company. You can also Google the name of the company with the word ""scam"" or ""fraud"" in quotes next to it. Another thing to do when you are looking at a specific product is to check out the transaction level. You will find this under the company’s name, and it will have a series of little diamond shapes next to it in orange. These give an indication of the transaction level points awarded to it by Alibaba where half a diamond is 0 – 5 points, a whole diamond is 5 – 10 points and so on all the way up to 5 whole diamonds which is in excess of 50,000 points. According to Alibaba, the Transaction Level is, ""based on an accumulated score awarded for total online transaction volume and amount"". Obviously, the greater the number of diamonds the better. Furthermore, when you go to the company’s page there is usually a section devoted to Transaction History which will show you how many transactions they have carried out in the year. If you are looking for a long-term supplier, you are better off looking for a manufacturer rather than just a trader. A manufacturer will be able to offer you better prices than a trader because a trader is really just a middleman who is adding his own profit to the transaction. When you have found what appears to be a good and trustworthy supplier offering huge discounts for bulk orders, whatever else you do, don’t place a bulk order. Order a sample first. You’ll have to pay for it of course, but it will enable you to see it and handle it and confirm whether it lives up to your expectations. Even then, you probably don’t want to go ordering 10,000 units or whatever because, much as you might like the product, it is vital to see how well it sells first."

19,The Many Different Ways Men Can Wear Cufflinks,shopping," Cufflinks are small pieces of adornment or artwork that men can wear for two purposes. One is the purely physical purpose of closing buttonless shirt cuffs, whether they are singe cuffs or double cuffs. The other purpose is that they are worn as an item of jewellery – a form of extra decoration. It was back in the 1500’s that men started to tie their shirt cuffs together using narrow ribbons or strings threaded through the cuff holes. However, it wasn’t until the early 1700’s that some men began to use buttons connected by a chain to fix their cuffs. These often contained a portrait of a famous person on them. In the mid 1800’s the cuffs of shirts became stiffer as starch began to be used, and it was more difficult to push buttons through them. Nobody knows who invented the cufflink, but it solved the problem of tying the two stiff cuffs together. As the Industrial Revolution arrived, so did the usage of cufflinks increase rapidly with men of all classes wearing them. The number of different designs expanded exponentially, and today you can find cufflinks in an almost endless range of patterns and colours and materials. If you can’t find a pair of cufflinks to suit you for a particular occasion, you can even have personalised cufflinks made today. Most men who wear cufflinks choose to wear something which matches their personality. They may also choose cufflinks which represent their country, their job, their hobbies, or perhaps celebrate the life of someone they admire, or indicate their birth month such as Taurus the bull for April to May, or Sagittarius the Archer for November to December. Those who take pride in their country of birth can wear cufflinks such as the British Lion, the Scottish Thistle, the Irish hamrock, or if they are from Wales, Celtic symbol cufflinks such as the Welsh Dragon. There are quite a lot of do’s and don’ts when it comes to cufflinks. For example, if you work for a boss who is smartly dressed in a suit and tie, and wears stylish cufflinks, don’t go over the top and wear stylish cufflinks yourself because it may appear to him that you are trying to take over or appear ""better"" than he is. A small point, but one worth noting. Wear cufflinks that are more restrained in style and colour. You should try to avoid wearing cufflinks that have colours that clash with your clothing. So, for instance, don’t wear blue cufflinks if you are wearing a green shirt, as the colours don’t go together. Of course, there is the opposite to that which is that if you REALLY want to make a statement and stand out you could wear a white or cream shirt and have bright red cufflinks. While you can wear a white shirt with, say, a dark blue or charcoal suit, it is better to wear a brown suit or even a shade of green with the lighter coloured shirts, but then bright red cufflinks would really not go with a green or red suit. You could wear red cufflinks with a blue suit and a white or blue shirt. However, take into consideration the fact that if you are attending an event such as a wedding, what you don’t want to do is to wear cufflinks that make you stand out from the groom. This is similar to the boss situation: it is the groom’s big day, so you mustn’t overshadow it. There are many other ways to wear cufflinks. For instance, if you support a certain political party and you are helping to canvass in an election, you would wear blue cufflinks if you are a Tory, red if Labour, and quite obviously green if the Green Party. What you would choose if a Lib Dem is a matter for you, as they do not seem to connect with any particular colour. As briefly mentioned beforehand, you can also have personalised cufflinks made for you. There are companies that will manufacture cufflinks to your own design in silver or in gold, in stainless steel, or other metals, and they can incorporate any design that you wish, so that opens up a whole lot of opportunities."
20,Vape Coils | eJuice Direct,shopping," VAPE COILS: LONGER LASTING, AND BEST RESULTS NOW! Vape Coils - An Essential Part of Vaping Are you new to Vaping and wondering how it’s done? Worry not! It’s a simple process. Vaping is a modern take on smoking. Which involves the use of mechanical devices known as e-cigarettes or vaporizers. The luxurious e-cigarettes operate with the help of a power source. Attached to a glass tank filled with the new Vape juice or e-liquid. When the vape juice heats up, the fluid vaporizes and gives a sensational feeling to its user. Inside the tank, there is an atomizer which contains a coil of thin wire wrapped around a wicking material. The Vape Coils are responsible for heating ejuice filled inside the glass tank. When these Coils heat up, it turns vape juice into vapor. Which then goes up the tank and is inhaled by the vaper! The Many Types of Vape Coils Yes, there are many types of Vape coils! With an increase in the use of vaping, vaping technology has evolved. Typically there are two kinds of these Coils; single coil and double coil. Single Coils involve just a single wire wrapped around the wick. Whereas dual Coils means two loops around two wicks. But there are many different types of Vape Coils made up by a variety of different wires. Essentially these Coils come in Kanthal (FeCrAl), NiChrome, Stainless Steel, Nickel, and Titanium. These can ensure temperature control and are specific to different e-cigarettes. It is up to the vapers to decide what fits their vaping experience. SELECT THE VAPE COIL WITH ACCURATE OHMS (RESISTANCE) The Coil is heated up to make the vapor production. The energy to heat them comes from the atomizer. And the atomizer head has an electrical resistance value measured in ohms. Why is there a need to select the right Ohms Vape coil? That is because the electrical resistance measured in ‘ohms’ will decide the size of the cloud! Atomizers come in high and low electrical resistance. With different ohm values mentioned on the side of the Coils. Lower ohm means the coil will heat up more. This will create more clouds but shorter battery life. And higher ohm will use lower power. Giving its users smaller clouds of vapors and using less amount of vape juice. Ohms being higher or lower is vapers’ personal choice for their best Vaping experience. Choose the Right Vape Coils for your e-cigarette Feeling confused with all this detail? It’s okay! It all depends on your choice of vaping experience. Just like you get to choose your vape juice flavor while vaping, you can select your vaping Coil. All you need to do is experiment a bit with a few Ohms up and down. And find out what you like. Sometimes vapers like more considerable clouds with more flavor to taste. Others may not want to use much vape juice while vaping and enjoy smaller vapor production. Thus loving the more cooling vape effect. So get your vaping coils today and start experimenting! Know What’s Best for Your Vape Coils While vaping there comes a time when you need to get your Coils replaced! This is when the life of them has ended. How do you know your coil needs changing? That’s simple! If your vape juice does not taste as before. Or if it gives a burnt taste while vaping it’s a sign to get a new fresh Coil! These are some signs you should keep in mind to keep your vaping experience best at all times. In some cases, your vape can leak if the coil is worn out. Or you will hear a gurgling sound when inhaling vape juice. If you experience any of this, know that it’s time to get a new smok vape coil! Change Your Vape Coils in Just a Few Simple Steps How to change these Coils? Don’t worry changing smok vaping coils is easy! With time and practice, you will start replacing your them in no time! Just follow these necessary steps: Step 1: Separate tank from the battery by merely unscrewing the tank. Step 2: Next, open the tank cap. Step 3: Once it is off you will need to do the same with the glass tank section from the battery. And then empty the tank by throwing away any remaining liquid. Step 4: Now you will see the coil in the center of the atomizer. By the help of a paper towel, hold the loop and gently unscrew the coil. Step 5: Then remove the old coil in the paper towel. After this, put in the new one in its place. Step 6: Finally, you're done with the job! The new coil is in its place. If you vape a lot, you will have to change Vape Coils around every week. But if you don’t, then your Coil can last longer for about two weeks. Know the Right Mod Settings for Your Vape Coils For vape flavor chasers its best to keep the temperatures of Vape Coil low. But for cloud chasers 80 or above will suit. Setting the mod temperature is the most comfortable way to improve the flavor you get from your vape juice. Specific flavorings vaporize at different temperatures. After all, various elements of vape juice come out at different settings. Thus vapor production for each vape juice is unique. Hence to hit the right ‘sweet spot’ you will need to experiment. And then customize your vaping experience by setting your mod settings. Fantastic Vape Coils for Bigger and Thicker Puff Moreover, the rate of airflow also matters when vaping. When you have a lot of air going through the Coils, the vapor production gets less dense. This produces a substantially more cooling vape effect but with less flavor. Adjusting airflow systems on atomizers will help you get the best vaping experience! Furthermore, most vapers prioritize and prefer the PG/VG ratio of their vape juices over time. PG gives your vape more flavor. VG produces massive clouds of vapor. The common VG to PG ratio you’ll see on ejuice direct is 70/30. Choosing the right drip tip will also influence your vaping experience. More extensive drip tips produce an airier vape and are suitable for cooler vape and cloud production. Some Simple Tips and Tricks for Your Vape Coils Most coils have a suggested wattage setting and range. Let's understand this with an example. At 0.4 ohms, every Q2 Coil makes use of dual vertical coils. These are all intently engineered to bring you the excellent SMOK caliber flavor for e-cigarettes that works best at a lower wattage. Keeping a few tips in mind and your Vape Coils can last longer and give you the best vaping experience! Prime the Vape Coil: Add several drops of vape juice, one at a time. Through the holes at the top of the Vape coil. So that the wicking material is drenched in vape juice, and the e-liquid is absorbed as much as possible before filling the glass tank full. Avoid Dry Hits: Never try to vape without checking your e-liquid tank before. If you vape with an empty glass tank, it will burn your Vape Coils. Keep that Mod Clean: When you change your Vape Coils try to rinse out the components of your tank every once in a while as residue can build on your Vape Coils and reduce the life of your vape coil. Rinse it with pure warm water. Our Vape Coils Stand Out in the Vaping Town You are now heavily loaded with Vape Coils information! Now it’s time to try out the best Vape Coils in Vaping town.

Decorative  and other crystal glassware is not made of pure crystal and contains lead that  makes easier for the craftsman to engrave designs. It also prevents easy  breakage. The higher index of refraction makes them deliver the bling of diamonds  without really making use of it. It is time to think beyond porcelain and  vitrified glass, choose crystalware to amaze your guests. Whether you create a  statement corner by displaying the crystal  glass trophies that you have been awarded or serve wine in beautiful  crystal wine glasses, create a classy party ambience with crystals. Crystal  Glassware- The Must-Have Party Basics There was a time when owning good  quality crystal items were difficult. Thanks to the incredible growth of  e-commerce that has made crystal glassware items available for global home  décor lovers. Even though crystal items are not very cheap but they are genuinely  worth an investment if brought from a reputed dealer. Various world-class  brands manufacture crystal items and the best part is most of these brand  offers to ship globally. While there are many diehard crystal lovers, there are  also a few who still gives a second thought before considering crystal glass gift sets as return  gifts. The following points highlight the role of crystal glassware in a house  party. Let’s have a look- Endless Design and Décor ideas: No matter you are hosting a corporate  party or a private celebration; you can deploy your creative genius with  quintessential crystal items. Starting with candle stands, crystal chandeliers  and vases, every corner of your house can become a statement using these  timeless classics. Especially you can showcase your knack for classy things by  using vintage wine decanters in your bar setting.

Flexible Pricing: It would not be a wise thing to say  that crystal items are very cheap. Yes, they can be if you are buying it from a  random manufacturer. Authentic crystal items manufactured by heritage brands  are masterpieces. There are a lot of things that are associated with each  piece. Right from creating the material to the design and finally the  packaging, original crystalware are special and can be quite expensive.

Weather old-school English wine decanters or Hi-end  Bohemian drinkware, all you need is an excuse to bring them home."
2,4 Key Considerations before Buying Authentic Crystal Glass Items,shopping," For an exotic table setting, it’s  essential to think above and beyond the realms of decorative dishware, cutlery  and fancy napkins. If you want to give a classic edge to your whole table set  up, add more and more glassware items. However, your choice will give the idea  of your personality, taste and sophistication and this is the reason why you  should be very picky while buying glassware. To be more precise, buying crystal  glassware will be considered as an investment, something that you as well as  your next generation can take pride in. They are not something usual, neither  very cheap and therefore, considering some important factors before buying  crystal glassware will always help you to make a good purchase. Decide on the type of glassware: Whether you need crystal glass bowls, or wine glasses or any other tableware, unless  you are clear about the purpose of buying it, you will not be able to choose  the right kind of items. For instance, if you often host dinner parties, it is  favourable for you to have more than one set of crystal bowls and other  dinnerware. Also, you can always deck up your bar set up by adding a variety of  wine glasses and decanters. This is important because the right wine glass can  accentuate the aroma and flavour of the wine. Always Seek for Better Quality of  Glassware: Once you buy crystal glassware, you  become a proud owner of something that stands as a symbol of class. Various  brands sell low-quality items that contain at least 50 per cent of silica and  no lead. Also, such items will never deliver the clarity a good quality crystal  glass will produce. On the other hand, genuine crystal glassware is  characterised by its brilliance and clarity.   Original crystal glassware items are considered to be luxurious, durable  and bright and transparent. Never compromise with the quality of glassware,  even if you cannot buy a whole range at a time. Avoid buying Hazardous Glassware: According to different studies, it has been  proved that a certain excess amount of lead can cause harm to your health.  Traditionally, crystal glassware contains 24  to 30 per cent of lead which is even considerable. Some brands use more amount  of lead oxide in their crystal glass products which is not worth buying. It is  believed that lead can be released to acidic beverages like wine, juice, scotch  and even vodka, thus turning hazardous for your health. Many modern crystal  glass item manufacturers are trying to come up with products with less amount  of lead. Such lead-free crystal items are also very expensive yet something  that you can cherish for a lifetime. ‘Hand-crafted Crystal Glassware: The value of any handmade product, no matter  its jewellery or a crystal jug is way more valuable than the machine-made. When  it is about crystal glass items, if you look back to the traditional way of  making it, you’ll acknowledge the makers who mastered the art of glassmaking.  Whether it is the meticulous mouth-blown technique, or the intricate engraving  technique to create unique details, handmade crystal items are considered to be  priced possession. Even when the global marketplace is  loaded with replica crystal products, there are still some heritage crystal  glass manufacturers that deal in rare and handmade crystal items. Whether you  own a handmade crystal vase or have a set of wine glasses, using them gives a  different level of experience.

4,"Women and Platform Shoes: Everything From Style, to Fit, and Comfort",shopping," When it comes to flaunting a tall stature, the first thing a lady thinks about is a heel. But not everyone can feel perfect in heels. That’s why someone built platform shoes. You can wear platform heels, platform shoes, even platform sandals and make a statement by being a little taller. Today we will go through everything a platform shoe can be on a girl's feet, from stylish footwear to comfortable sneakers. What Are Platform Shoes? Any shoe type including, but not limited to, heels, sandals, and trainers with a sole thicker than traditional. Generally, a sole on platform shoes can be one to four inches thicker with an even higher heel. But shoes without heels also exist, with a flat thick sole. It’s the thickness that defines if a shoe has a platform or not. Some shoes are known as hidden platforms because their upper part covers the platform making an illusion that there’s no platform. This makes it easy to add some height without exposing the obvious trick behind it. Though the standard height is often set between 1 to 4 inches or 3-10 cm, there are several platform heels known to be around and even more than 8 inches higher. It’s hard to say who invented the platform shoes since they date way back to the 16th century. Styling Platform Shoes Striking footwear such as a tall platform pump or high heels can make a statement in any kind of event. But it can be hard to know what to wear and when to wear. People are fashionable but styling your shoes in a subtler and sexier way requires some advice. Why do girls want to look tall? So that their legs can be as long as actual tall models. Since this is your aim, this is how you should style. Wear these platforms with a skirt or dresses that can show them off. Make sure people see your super long legs, which will be an effect from platform heels. Summer Platform Style A low platform sole of pool sliders can be the best fit for summers. You can sport them with sportswear or swimsuit since they can be ideal to flaunt a versatile and casual look. Winter Platforms From ankle boots to knee highs, you can get the platforms and blend it with chunky knits and jeans to look cooler than the winter itself. Not only it will give you that extra height but the raised platform will also save your dress from getting wet in winters. Platform Shoes: Comfort and Fit Platform shoes can be very high and people always question about comfort in them. The truth is that they can be more comfortable than any standard height. We keep flat platforms on the chunkier side and that’s why most of them carry a wide toe box making them very comfortable. Anyone with wide feet should not even think twice before buying. Standard heels can be very thin from the toes. With all the thickness in the front end of the shoes, platform heels help to distribute the whole weight widely. Apart from the heels, platform shoes are also known for fitness and comfort. It just depends on the weight and foot size. When you are going to shift from one footwear to another after a long term, we recommend you to wear lower platforms. High heeled platforms can be very hard as far as comfort is concerned since they put heavy pressure on the ball of the foot. But to avoid this discomfort, simply go for lower-heeled or flat platforms. It is important to practice walking in heels before actually trying them anywhere. Explore thousands of platform heels on XY London and style them with whatever you like."
5,"The Rise And Fall, And Rise Again, Of Cufflinks",shopping," It is probably fair to say that the use of  cufflinks fell quite considerably during the 1970’s, but today is making  something of a comeback. Cufflinks were first used in the 1600’s but didn’t  become fashionable and in everyday use until the end of the following century. Since the invention of woven fabric, some  5,000 years BC, men have been wearing items that are like shirts ever since.  Basically, a garment open at the front that sported sleeves and a collar. Before we had vests, it was worn next to the skin, and today still is by many  men who do not bother with a vest. It helped to protect the skin against the  rougher materials of which jackets and coats were made, as it covered the  wrists and neck as well. After the Middle Ages, the cuffs began to  include decorative items such as frills, ruffs, and embroidery. The cuffs  themselves were simply tied with a piece of pretty ribbon, and so was the  collar. However, things changed with the coming of the industrial revolution and  it became the fashion for men to wear a dark suit during the day, a dinner  jacket in the evening, and by the 1850’s the cufflink became popular. This was simply  two identical buttons (although they didn’t always have to be identical)  connected with a chain that held the them together and was used to secure the  cuffs. The cuffs themselves, along with the  collar, had become stiff and starched, and were actually too stiff to be held  with a simple button, so men in the middle and upper classes used cufflinks. What’s more, the industrial revolution meant that it was cheap to mass-produce  these items. The cufflinks themselves began to become  miniature pieces of artwork, and many of those worn by the upper classes  contained gemstones. However, these became more common when Edward VII, then  Prince of Wales, began wearing cufflinks made by Faberge in the late 19th  century. It was at this stage that cufflinks began to become a fashion  accessory as well as an essential, and this continued right up until the 1960’s  when life changed, some may say for the worse, with the coming of the era of the  cultural revolution with people who revolted against the norms about clothing,  sex, drugs, schooling, music, and more. ""Let it all hang out"" was a popular  phrase which simply meant ‘do whatever you want to do without regard for anyone  else’. Now we had the hippies who couldn’t even be  bothered to work. After all, why work if you can let other people do that, pay  taxes, and then the state looks after you and gives you money? ""Just do what  you wanna do, man, and don’t do what you don’t wanna do"". These people even rebelled against dressing  smartly. After all, pressing a suit is work – and we don’t want to work. Rather  obviously, this led to the decline of the cufflink. In the 1970’s shirt cuffs  were reduced to the single cuff, and the cufflink replaced with a simple  button. It saves the need for buying cufflinks, and it’s easier, and EASY was  what the 60’s and early 70’s was all about. However, as we moved into the 1980’s,  fashion changed again, and it once more became acceptable to dress smartly and  actually get a job. In fact, it got to the point where you had to dress smartly  - even if you were applying for a job as a manual worker – or you wouldn’t be  likely to get the job. Dressing smartly shows respect, and which employer wants  to employ someone who is not respectful? So the cufflink came back into fashion, and  it is still fashionable today among men of a certain calling. Cufflinks are even better today because you  can have personalised cufflinks with your own design on them. They are  not made of cheap metals, since you can have personalised gold cufflinks or personalised silver cufflinks if that is your preference. If you are  a business owner, you might choose to have cufflinks made with your company  logo, or if you are a football fan, the logo of your club. You could have them  with your child’s name on them, an image of your favourite flower, or anything  else that you wish, since there are companies who will design and make bespoke  cufflinks for you."

10,How To Choose A Suitable Swimsuit For Swimming?,shopping," It's so sunny and hot. What's the best thing to do? Swimming, of course! However, whether it is to go to the natatorium to practice swimming skills, or go to the swimming pool to relax, a suitable swimsuit is essential. How to select a suitable swimsuit? Different types of swimsuits can affect the comfort, speed and even the difficulty of learning. In order to swim smoothly, comfortably and faster, you need to follow these requirements. Avoid bikinis and swim dresses! Bikinis are great for taking beautiful pictures and posing. But there is a risk of losing your top if you are going to swim and swim carefully. Swim dresses increase drag and make learning more difficult. When swimming, one should be as parallel as possible to the horizontal plane so that one can move forward easily. However, the dress will spread out in the water to form resistance and affect the speed, so leave it to the beach. So how should we choose??? First of all, it is recommended to choose a triangle bottom or boyshorts bottom swimsuit, because they can reduce the sense of restraint, but also reduce some resistance. As for the kind of knee-length or pants, unless bought very professional, otherwise it is basically just ordinary pants, will not have any helpful effect on the swimming. Secondly, girls are advised to choose a swimsuit with a narrow belt and a crossed back. The advantage of the narrow belt is that it covers a small area, so it is more comfortable. There is no sense of restraint when the arm moves, and it can feel its speed in the water and every movement more directly. Remember to choose a cross-back swimsuit! They help spread some of the weight around the shoulders without causing a stranglehold. If there's a third strap that can handle the stress in addition to the crossed straps, so much the better. For example: Deep Plunge Sexy Hollow Out Sexy Monokini Deep V Cross Ruched Backless Monokini Avoid loose! In addition to choosing the right style, size is also important. The best size is for comfortable conditions, with the suit slightly sinking into the flesh behind you. This avoids the feeling of sagging and heaving, and will not affect the comfort and speed of swimming in the water. Avoid improper care! This is a beginner's guide to swimming that has nothing to do with the figure but will make you comfortable every 1,000 meters you swim. So get ready and jump into the water!!!"

A hot air balloon has the right away over a blimp, and a glider has the right away over a powered aircraft. And common sense would dictate that if you're flying a small single-engine aircraft such as a Cessna 172 Skyhawk you'd better get out of the way of an airliner, even if you might assume you have the right away. Now then, does a robotic aircraft or unmanned aerial system have the right away over a powered aircraft? Remember unmanned aerial system is exactly what it says, it is unmanned. There are Unmanned tethered balloons along the border used for surveillance, the US military is building unmanned blimps, in the future police departments will also have these available over their cities, and a blimp has the right away over a powered aircraft. But what happens when two powered aircraft are on a converging trajectory or collision course - one being a robotic aircraft and the other flown by a student pilot on his long cross country trying to get his pilot's license? The reality is that any aircraft, which may be a threat to a collision is something to avoid, so the student pilot will yield to any aircraft that is near it. If the aircraft are approaching each other head-on, something that is merely a fly in your window, or that size, could be a full size aircraft traveling towards you at the same speed or greater in reality. Even if you're only doing 145 knots in the Cessna 172 just cruising along, a UAV might be traveling at 225 knots directly at you, the closing speed would be the sum of those two speeds, and you won't be able to tell if it is an unmanned vehicle or not, because within 10 to 15 seconds that aircraft will be right in front of you. Therefore, you need to get out of the way, even if the tele-robotically operated (or fully autonomous, AI operated in the future) UAV doesn't see you in time. The question is should a UAV have an avoidance system which takes over from the tele-robotic pilot who's sitting in a room somewhere flying that aircraft as if it was a video game, and then once the threat is gone, the override will stop, and the unmanned aircraft hands back over controls to the tele-robotic pilot. The problem with this for some human pilots is they are putting their trust not in another human controlling that other aircraft, but a system that is built into that UAV, running on software. Perhaps you can see why the debate is all over the news, and the FAA has to deal with how to allow both unmanned and human piloted aircraft in the same airspace. Does this mean humans are already getting pushed aside by robots? Are we already giving our right-a-way to robots? Please consider all this."
14,How to purchase right Micro SD Card for the electronic gadgets?,shopping," Nowadays the electronic gadgets such as smart phones, dash cam, GAPS, drone, Camera and tablets are in increasing demand for storage space, the minimum capacity they need is 16GB or 32GB at least, many users are still feel the space is limited. However, even they use these devices with 64GB embedded storage, the electronic gadgets is filled up with too many apps, videos, pictures or games. As they store more personal data or multimedia content, and barely do any deletion due to their rising demands. Moreover, some electronic gadgets don’t have spaces for extra data, the inside storage is just for loading its system files. Therefore, when the storage space for electronic gadgets is shortage or nearly empty, among the various ways to enhance storage space, most people will choose to insert bulk micro SD cards
or the other external storage to add the extra space, after all, this is one of the easiest ways. Not all electronic gadgets s support micro SD cards, such as phone and IPA. However, many Android phones and tablets in the market support micro SD card as external storage, so does the Dash cam, Drone, GAPS and Raspberry pi and so on. These products are widely used in recent years. If you expect to know whether the electronic gadgets support Micro SD card or not, the easier way is to check if the device equips with the Micro SD slot. Also we can check the manual book of them, it will give you clear guide. Usually the device manufacturers will do direct advertisement on that, as external storage is one popular option, they will do whatever to follow up users’ taste. There is one thing to remind smart phone users, although many android phones support Micro SD Card, they no longer provide separate position for loading it, the Micro SD slot is placing with SIM card to save spaces. Now the urgent problem is how to choose a suitable micro SD card for our electronic products? At present, there are many kinds of micro SD cards in the market; they are in different prices, different capacities, different types and different brands. How can you truly choose one good Micro SD Card fit your own equipment or meet your personal needs? Let's firstly understand some parameters of Micro SD Cards as below. The format of Micro SD Card According to the data from SD Association, Micro SD Card is classified by the format of SD, SADHU and SAX. They are separately standing for Secure Digital, Secure Digital High Capacity and Secure Digital Extended Capacity; the difference among them is mainly capacity and speed. SD version is the earliest one, the capacity of this format starts from wholesale Micro SD Card 128MB to 2GB, and the speed is the lowest one. The upgrade version of SD is SADHU, the capacity gets rising from 2GB to 32GB, and it is also the common one in market. The last one is the SAX; all high capacity will follow this format from 32GB to 2TB, so far the max capacity available in market is 1TB, the cost of it is almost same as one smart phone. The speed standard of Micro SD Card We will firstly introduce two main speed standards of Micro SD Card defined by the SD Association; there are Class level and HUS level. Class refers to the minimum transmission speed of the card. For example, Class 4 stands for 4MB/s by write and Class 6 stands for 6MB/s by write. So the number indicates the writing speed, it will be easily identified. HUS means ""ultra-high speed (Ultra High Speed),"" and ""HUS speed level"" defines Micro SD cards by the lowest write speed, such as US-I speed level 1, which has the lowest 10MB/s by write. US-I speed level 3 (US-3) has the lowest 30MB/s by write. The following introduction is the reading speed for the different speed levels of the micro SD card. It is important to note that the marked speed of most micro SD cards is much faster than the minimum one, for example, the micro SD card identified by Class 10 can provide 95MB/s for reading, while US-rated cards can be as fast as 312MB/s by read. In addition, there is no corresponding relationship between the speed level and the HUS speed level. However, in terms of speed, the Class 2, Class 4, and Class 6 speed levels are just normal speeds, with Class 2 suitable for low-resolution video, while Class 4 and Class 6 are suitable for high-definition or 1080p full-HUD video. The Class 10 is faster than the previous ones and is suitable for 1080p full HUD recording or continuous shooting of high-definition still pictures. As for the HUS speed level, the highest HUS-I speed level 1 can meet the 1080p full HUD recording or continuous shooting of high-definition still pictures, and the US-3 can meet the 2K or 4K resolution video recording. App Performance Class At the end of year 2016, the SD Card Association also introduced one new standard called ""Application performance level (App Performance Class)"", it mainly to highlight the use of micro SD cards for mobile devices such as smart phones or tablets, and ensure that applications are run with optimal performance to meet the technical market needs of mobile devices. As a result, such micro SD can not only store pictures, movies, music, files, and other data, but also be able to run and store applications. The most basic application performance level is: App Performance Class1, or A1 for short. Micro SD cards marked with A1 symbols must meet or exceed the following performance under certain conditions: Random Read: 1500 (IO PS) Random Write: 500 (IO PS) Sustained Sequential Write: 10MB/S Micro SD cards marked with A2 symbols must meet or exceed the following performance under certain conditions: Random Read: 4000 (IO-PS) Random Write: 2000 (IO PS) Sustained Sequential Write: 10MB/S No matter the Micro SD Card is with A1 or A2, it is basically fast enough to open applications or process tasks in the device. Furthermore, micro SD cards have been supported as ""suitable storage (Adoptable Storage)"" since Android6.0 Marshmallow; it is being used as built-in storage. The Final decision of purchasing Micro SD Card Obviously, everyone wants the fastest, highest capacity, and lowest price micro SD card. In fact, there are many brands in the market, such as Sam sung, San Disk, Toshiba, Kingston and the other wholesale Micro SD Sources, and so on. As we have introduced the parameters of the micro SD card above, I believe it is no longer a problem for selecting cards on your own. For example, one micro SD card labeled Class10 or HUS-1, and providing a maximum 80MB/s speed can support basic 1080p video recording. Memory cards labeled SAX, HUS-II, or 100MB/s are suitable for 4K video recording. In fact, there are a lot of micro SD cards marked with A1 symbols in the market, the price is relatively expensive, e.g. the 32GB is around $9/PC, the cheapest 128GB GB is around $23/PC. You should give priority to such micro SD cards if you need A1 performance, it will ensure that the mobile performance going smooth. In addition, the purchase of micro SD cards must be related to brand reputation and user comments, as one good Micro SD supplier can guarantee the quality, speed and warrant; and the reviews of user will tell you the actual using experience."

1,Alcatel OneTouch Watch Smartwatch in 2019,shopping," Alcatel launches into the world of Smart Watches targeting the most economical segment with its first model, the Alcatel One Touch Watch. When it comes to judging the OneTouch Watch, it is essential to keep this objective of an affordable price in mind, which implies a renunciation of powerful features in order to adjust costs as much as possible. One of the striking details of the One Touch Watch is that it uses Alcatel's own operating system, which makes it something peculiar and requires the user to get used to its operation. In return it allows it to be compatible with both Android and iOS, and that the battery consumption is lower, improving its autonomy. Like some of the most recent models, it is committed to a circular design that approximates it to a 'classic' clock image. However, the sphere is not a full screen, but this, of 1'22 inches and 240x204 pixels (a somewhat limited resolution that causes a slight pixelation at times), is surrounded by a narrow band that marks the minutes in the style of an analog clock. The design is discreet, with a size not too large and a rather thin box, which allows to use it perfectly as a daily clock. The dial is very customization, both in the configuration of the data to be displayed and in what refers to the watch face (two analog and one digital available), for which the user can choose even his own images as background. The One-touch Watch allows you to have notifications and updates of the apps with which it is compatible (including the main social networks, WhatsApp, email and calls), but it does not allow you to elaborate an answer for them from the watch itself, nor read long messages or emails. It also does not allow downloading additional apps to those offered. The connection with the smartphone is made through Bluetooth, and sometimes shows some connectivity problem. Among its features, the One-touch Watch also includes a daily activity monitor mode, including a heart rate monitor on the back of the box. The corresponding app allows a count of steps, distances, minutes of activity, calories consumed and sleep. Some of these measures, in any case, are estimates based on the physical characteristics of the user. The battery has an autonomy of between two and five days, being the usual something intermediate (about three days) with a moderate use. Charging is done through a USB tab built into the watch's own wristband, and it is also very fast. When it comes to battery recharge, the One Touch Watch is really comfortable and effective."

Human skin color is actually a spectrum that spans from a color white as ivory, through yellowish skin, to chocolate or jet black skin. We can also talk about the shape of the human face, a factor often overlooked by many men and women when choosing a hairdo. Height and skin color may be important when choosing a hairdo, but by far, the most important factor is the shape of one's face. When choosing a hairdo consider the shape of your face before choosing it. The shape of the human face can be classified into three. Namely, oval face, long face, and lastly square face. Men with round faces, for example, may want to wear their hair thick at the top and thin at the sides in order to create a desirable chiseled face. Women with round faces may want to have layers with longer hair in order to add definition to their face. They may want to add a bob or let the hair flow past their shoulders. The point is not every hairstyle is appropriate for every facial shape. Types of Hairdo In order to choose the right hairdo for an occasion, one must familiarize oneself with the types of hairdos available. One good way to do this is to speak to an expert. Next time you go to a barber or your hair-stylist, take a few minutes to learn the various hairstyles that are available. You may think this comes naturally, but an interaction with a hairstylist would prove otherwise. Another great way to learn the different types of hairdos is subscribing to magazines on hairstyles or other beauty issues. Taking a few days to do this would do wonders for you in the days ahead. Match the Hairdo to the Outfit With several hairdos available, choosing the right one for an occasion can be a bit of a headache. In choosing a hairdo for an occasion, consider the outfit you will be putting on. Not every hairdo is appropriate for a particular outfit. Therefore, choosing the wrong hairdo can unmake you. For instance, lacy dresses are the most romantic and therefore require an equally romantic hairdo to match. For a lacy dress, choose a loose, wavy hairdo and add flowers to match, and then twist it a few times in the back. With a one shouldered dress, try a ballerina bun which would tie all your hair above your head because of the bold dramatic appearance of a one shouldered dresses. Having said this, it should be clear that in choosing a particular hairdo the outfit must be taken into consideration. When you do all the above, your confidence would increase, and choosing from the myriad of hairdos available would no longer be a headache."
4,5 Points to Consider When Choosing a Mattress from a Store,shopping," Your mattress can have a dramatic impact on the quality of your sleep and your overall health. If you keep tossing and turning at night or wake up feeling tired and sore, it’s time to visit mattress stores in Mississauga. A new mattress is a major purchase, so it certainly deserves some thought. Here are some factors to consider when buying a mattress in Mississauga. Do you need a King, a California King, a Queen, a Full, or a Twin? This really depends on the size of your bed, the size of your room, and even your lifestyle. It’s not necessary to buy a replacement that is the same size as your old mattress. Perhaps you no longer need a King now that the kids are older and they sleep in their own bedrooms. The mattress industry currently doesn’t follow a standard measure of firmness—which means that one manufacturer’s ‘extra firm’ might be another’s ‘medium.’ This is why it’s important to try before you buy. Fluffy pillow-top mattresses are trendy these days, but they are expensive and are not always necessary. Do note that a pillow top will likely go flat—especially if you’re on the heavy side—long before the mattress gives out. If you’re very lightweight, a thick pillow top mattress will serve no purpose because you’re not heavy enough to even compress the foam to touch the support system or underlying coils. You may be better off buying a standard mattress and simply adding a topper to get that luxurious feeling. Ask the retailer about these details before you buy. Take note of whether you need to pay for shipping should you want to exchange your mattress for something else. Clarify any money-back guarantees. Some of the best shops provide their customers a 101-night trial. They also provide 10-year warranties. This is a tricky subject. Some people make the mistake of overspending on their mattress, not realizing that they can find a mattress sale in Mississauga and pay much less for the same comfort. If you want the best deals, try to stay away from big box stores and go to specialist retailers instead. Don’t let branded and designer mattresses fool you—they cost more because a lot of money is spent marketing them, but they are not necessarily the best choices. Ready to shop for a mattress? Head to Evolve Comfort, one of the leading mattress stores in Mississauga. Explore our selection or have a custom mattress built for your unique requirements. We can deliver your order to your doorstep."

13,Online clothing store vs Traditional clothing stores,shopping," The internet is now part of our everyday life, evolved over the years from something promising to something necessary. This bubble and necessity of the Internet, in terms of clothing, has created a competitive edge, between traditional clothing stores  which do not have any electronic presence, with online clothing stores. Ten years ago shopkeepers considered not necessary to have a website that sell their clothes through this process. They were probably right then, because the public was not familiar with the technology so they could get into the process of buying something electronically from a nearby clothing store. They just visited the local clothing store and made their purchases. They just had an idea surfing the internet, for the merchandise of each store. In essence, websites were served to consumers as an informational catalog and they did not fully understand, that a website can do the same job as a traditional clothing stores. Simple they were informed from the internet about the merchandise of the store and instead of ordering it from the comfort of their home, they went to the store to buy it. Over the years, however, the internet has begun to gain ground and purchases of clothes through it have slowly become a basic option. Familiarizing consumers to new technologies, has helped to change this behavior in shopping mode. As we understand the internet has liberalized the market and we can say that it has created a security in the prices. The consumer is now fully informed about the clothe that  wants to buy and at a good price. This informal online war on clothing stores, is always for the benefit of the consumer because it gives him multiple options with just a click of a button. The stores will do everything so that consumers click on their website, winning it either with offers or other services for the benefit of the consumer, for example free shipping. Online clothing purchases are now very convenient and easy to access. All you have to do is visit a store's website and start shopping. You can do it from the comfort of your bedroom without having to dress to go to the store's representative. However, disbelief always exists and is perfectly reasonable. So even today, many are opposed buying clothes online for two main reasons. One, what is delivered is different from the image you are viewing on the store's website and two, you may get the wrong sizes. These problems can easily be solved by having good measurement and a good size conversion chart and by purchasing clothes from clothing stores with good reviews. Many argue that when shopping online, they lack the basic experience of human interaction. They forget to mention that the main goal of the owner is to make you do as many purchases as possible  This, of course, is not a bad thing, at this point we are aiming at the process of impartiality. This is absent from online shopping because it is only you and the computer so your opinion and your choice are not influenced by third parties. Under no circumstances will an online store replace the physical store. They all have their drawbacks and their extras, so the combination will bring the result you want."
14,"Fashion is freedom, is revolution.",shopping," Fashion is freedom of expression! Wear what you want and love and feel comfortable with yourself. Fashion evolves continuously and with so many choices anyone can find their own style. Fashion can give you strength and confidence with appropriate combinations of clothes. Especially women can exploit the fashion revolution to show off their body and their personality. There are many ways of dressing, such as stylish style, strong style, revolutionary and sexy, sporty, casual and cool and much more. Fashion is constantly changing and evolving and this also includes the winter months. In the winter months especially, fashion is more demanding and difficult. Layering requires proper combinations of clothes, for example choosing a jacket or coat can hide the rest of the outfit. Many women especially, in order to feel safe in terms of clothing in the cold months, fall into the stylistic flap to choose dark colors. The choice of dark clothes, of course, is not the wrong choice but the creation of some winter look is required and a vivid color to break the monotony in the whole outfit. In case you do not want to risk, then you can choose some accessories that are interdental and can be combined very well with a dark combination of clothes. Accessories such as watches, jewelry, belts can be used throughout the year without worrying about breaking the fashion rules. By adding your own accessories or even blending some styles and colors in the winter months can really make the stylistic difference to stand out! If you have a small budget when you buy clothes then do not have the notion that the more expensive clothes and accessories are, the better. It's a misconception, and fashion alone eliminates it, because it all depends on how you project it. A good example is women in France who always look elegant. They only buy some of the classic expensive clothes they really want and use them many times, using different accessories or combinations with other old clothes. Now with the power of the internet you can find the clothes you want easily with just one click and at the price that suits you. Fashion has been greatly empowered with the power of the internet. But beyond the ability to buy clothes, the internet has another very significant edge in fashion. What is it? Of course the ability to search stylistic ideas from websites and blogs and the exchange of ideas on the theme of fashion with the ultimate goal to help you create stylistic combinations! So there is no reason for anxiety, the fashion revolution does not require much money only creativity on your side. That's why you experiment with your clothes, creating your own style. Fashion is freedom is revolution."

17,How long will your laptop battery needs to replace?,shopping," First know that, eventually, every rechargeable battery will need to be replaced. How soon your battery will wear out depends mostly upon your usage, your care of the battery and the quality of the battery itself. It makes sense that extensive use of the battery will reduce it’s running life faster than an average amount of use and a better built battery will probably enjoy a longer life span than one built with lower quality materials. On average, a battery will begin to show a normal decrease in power after 18 to 24 months. With extensive use, a reduced run time might be noticeable before 18 months. There are 3 main indications that it might be time to replace your battery: Your laptop battery is simply not charging. First, remove and then reconnect your battery to make sure the battery has just not loosened from its proper connection. Second, start your laptop with another charger to see if the AC-adapter might be damaged. Adapters don’t usually wear out that quickly but it’s certainly worth giving it a try. If neither of the above solve the problem, the battery has worn out and needs to be replaced. Your laptop is not connecting with the battery. Try cleaning all the connectors on the battery and the laptop and if that doesn’t solve the problem, most likely, your battery is dead. The vast majority of which, including me, feel that there will be no detrimental effect to the battery by leaving your laptop plugged in 24/7. Some ""experts"" feel that this practice reduces the number of charge/discharge cycles that your laptop will be capable of. While this may be true, think of how many cycles are skipped whilst it's plugged in (rather than if you tried the disciplined 40%-80% regimen they espouse)? Leaving the laptop plugged in lets you enjoy the ""plugged in"" power profile (Windows) that you can set to optimize performance over battery life… Who knows, the extra performance may make you keep the laptop another year…Laptop batteries are made of 2–3 LiIon cells in series. When a cell dies, available charge will typically plummet from hours to minutes, as the internal average voltage will be 7.4v instead of 11.1v in case of 1 dead over 3. When this happens usually PC itself warn the user to replace the battery, either with a screen message or beeping a code before boot. It makes sense that extensive use of the battery will reduce it’s running life faster than an average amount of use and a better built battery will probably enjoy a longer life span than one built with lower quality materials."

No matter what techniques used, it is not inexpensive for small runs. This made the small runs extremely expensive due to high set up costs, and in the flag and banner market, small runs were usually either hand printed or embroidered. This technique was applied before custom printing fabric was introduced. Digital printing fabric has offered fabric printing a new notion wherein small runs can be economical. As a result of constant research of fabric manufacturers, there is now a different level for digital fabric painting.

Rollers are used to feed the fabric to the printer, which then sprinkles tiny drops of ink onto the fabric. Unlike the traditional screen printing, digital printing can be used to print different styles and patterns on a single fabric at a lesser cost. Another stunning printing technique used here is the sublimation printing. Sublimation printing is a computer-aided digital printing technique that helps in offering high definition and impressive prints.

3,The Process of Solid Color Cotton Fabric,shopping," Cotton is a shrubby plant that belongs to the Mallow family. Starting from designer women's wear collections to towels, bedsheets, and tents, the solid cotton fabric is widely used for its appearance, versatility, and natural comfort. Note, this wonderful fiber is mainly grown in the tropical and subtropical regions (especially during the hot summer days when there's plenty of bright sunshine and relatively low humidity). However, before this nature's wonder fiber can be converted to fabric, it needs to undergo a series of processes that are briefly discussed below. So, please keep reading and know the step-by-step processes of preparing solid color cotton fabric. Understand the Process of Solid Color Cotton Fabric - From Knitting to Dyeing Apart from knitting, another process (i.e. weaving) can be also used to convert the raw fibers to the fabric. Nevertheless, knitted fabrics are quite softer and even more flexible than the woven fabrics. In this process, solid colors are spread over the entire cloth material. Once the color is appropriately applied to the full-width fabric cloth, it is passed through multiple padded rollers in order to remove any excess liquid. How to Test the Quality of the Final Fabric? To test the quality of the solid cotton fabric, the below-mentioned four parameters should be meticulously assessed and analyzed. i) Durability: To assess the durability of the final fabric so that it can last for a few seasons, you should touch the fabric. Cotton fibers that are tightly and closely knitted together typically last longer and tend to become more durable. ii) Softness and Smoothness: These two parameters can be also assessed by touching the fabric material. Please make sure the fabric feels comfortable on the skin. If it tends to be rough, scratchy, and unsmooth, then it won't be comfortable to wear and use. iii) No Pills: Cotton fibers are quite prone to pilling. So, carefully assess the dyed fabric; ideally, there should not be any trace of pilling. iv) No Gaps or Size Differences: Since raw cotton fibers are knitted in order to make up the final fabric, it's recommended to closely inspect if the material has any unwanted gap or size difference between the individual threads. In case there are gaps and size differences on the solid color fabric, the quality seems to be poor and inferior."
4,Differences between yarn dyed fabric and plain dyed fabric,shopping," Do you ever wonder how your clothes get the many different colors? The materials undergo furnishing processes like dyeing to improve the cleanability, resistance to fading, and general look. Among the many best options applied for conveying color to cotton is yarn dyeing. Yarn-dyed fabric has more one color and when used before weaving or knitting the cloth, plaids, gingham checks, stripes among other distinct effects results. For example, to make denim, a blue dyed twist yarns get joined with white filling yarns. Differences Plain dyed fabric usually is colored after weaving the cloth. The post-dyeing method is standard for a dense material. A giant drum holding a mixture of dye-water is used to produce Greige goods. The fabrics are immersed in the solution and stays for 2-10 hours. The color adheres through the yarn through the woven, and edges fail to absorb enough compared to the exterior. The gorgeous and energetic colored fabrics never resist fading compared to dyed yarn fabrics. For the dyed yarn fabrics, the technique applied involves an essential package. The material is twisted on holed containers and positioned on upright supports round a tinting appliance. From the outside of the vessels, the dye solution is enforced one after the other under pressure. Many times the computers are used during the processes to match and formulate colors quickly and precisely. Color spreads to the exterior of the yarn, however, does not run through entirely. The results come due to vulnerability to color dying than solution-dyed yarns, though are vibrant and sharp. A fabric prepared from dyed yarn fibers is environmentally friendly, biological constituents as linen, cotton, and wool. The significant and challenging stage in plain dyeing is maintaining color consistency. The materials get dyed in great batches about 300+ yards in the equivalent formulated dye over and over again. The effectiveness of color in a set become influenced by water pH levels, temperature, and human mistakes. The vast quantities are problematic when a secondary piece is required to complete the duty. Plain dyed fabrics are woven from synthetic and ordinary yarns and very presentable with the many color options. Conclusion Plain dyed fabrics are better for uniform colors than dyed yarn fabrics which produce superior striped, and checkered cloths. However, it is essential to select a fabric that suits your need and preferences. You can opt for the method you can easily apply at home."
5,How to Design your Own Fabric,shopping," Have you thought of creating your own fabric design? There before, buying and designing a custom fabric was really a daunting task. The fabric printers came with huge minimums and so you were compelled to hold on tons of stock. Also, the price was very high. Therefore, whether you would want to have your name printed with fabric bolts or to soak up the tips for a design that can perfectly apply to other fields, this detailed guide will greatly help you on how to customize your own fabric. Here are the steps. There are various ways in which you can create your own artwork. There are those who prefer to paint or draw their designs before having them scanned, and others will photograph their work. Well, if you choose to utilize any of these methods, then I would recommend you to first upload your artwork on a photo editor. Sites, for example, PicMonkey will enable you to effect any necessary alterations on your design before you have it printed. Most of the people who engage in designing their own fabric want to have a pattern which can be repeated. A website such as Woven Monkey has varied repeat choices which one can choose from. One is likely to assume small imperfections on the artwork, for example, the borders or the unintended white lines, but you realize they are likely to be repeated if not removed. Therefore, it is good to ensure this is well checked by making use of a zoom tool from your software design. You will always encounter huge variations on the color appearance in your computer screen and their actual appearance after having been printed on a fabric. It is a prudent idea to request for a test swatch of that particular fabric as it will help you have an idea of how the colors and print will appear on your artwork before you embark on the final order. You may also find it necessary to purchase a color chart. The HEX code that is coded reference for colors RGB are nicely displayed on the charts and can be used on whichever design of your choice. This will, therefore, enable you to tell how the colors will appear before you get your own fabric. DPI refers to a measurement of the image resolution. Just put simply, because the higher the Dots per Inch, the more the image is sharp. When you kick start the artwork created in a design package, you will be required to have this set. To ensure the printing of any artwork, a DPI of 150 is automatically selected for any uploaded design on the Woven Monkey. Therefore, it would be recommendable to have DPI set at this amount before starting; otherwise, your design is likely to be printed to a different size than you wanted. In case you have designed an image which is more than 150 DPI, you can still make adjustments. The preview tool is the best way in which you can check your design before you commit an order. Most importantly, it’s a mock up of how your image is likely to appear on fabric, this enables you to confront any issue associated with a repeat. At this stage, you can also make use of a ruler to ensure the image is at the most recommended size. By use of preview, it helps to prevent mistakes from occurring especially on your final design. Conclusion Therefore, this should no longer be an issue for you. With Woven Monkey, once you have uploaded your design, you only need to click Go Create’ button and then go through the instructions for creating your fabric and you will be able to successfully design your own fabric."

9,How to Design Your Own Fabric by Digital Printing,shopping," OK so you've had some great ideas for custom t-shirts floating around in your head for a while and now you want to turn them into reality. Digital printing is one of the fastest ans cheapest way to go. Many companies have been using digital printing to custom large volume fabric for promotions or marketing. What are your first steps to take and how can you get your finished product on your back or on the market as quickly and expediently as possible? To make the customization easier there is some consideration that you have to take before you design your own fabric. Here are some; Possible Design Adjustments If you are lucky, your designs and the color schemes in them will coordinate beautifully on a finished fabric but more often then not you will have to make some type of adjustments. This all has to do with the types of ink that are used and just how your t-shirt is going to be printed out. Light Colors on Dark Fabric For instance, light colors on a dark fabric present their own particular problems that have to do with coverage. That is that a light color on a dark fabric is not going to be as vibrant as you might have in mind. That is unless you have your custom fabric silk-screened with a thick rubbery type of colorant. Silk Screening If you are determined to go with light colors over dark fabric, then you are to have to go with silk screening, which means higher expense and a minimum order requirement. Also, with silk screening the more colors that you use in your design scheme, the more it is going to cost you because each color requires a separate frame to be made and a separate pass with the ink. Steps on How To Design Your Fabric One of the first things for custom fabric printing that you need to do is to choose a fabric that you want to use for your design. You can choose to use either a light colored or a dark colored fabric for your little project. Be sure to use the right kind of transfer paper for your chosen fabric as well. And most important of all, make sure that you use a blank fabric for this one. No point in designing a shirt that already has prints on it. After you have selected a fabric that you want to use, the next step is to choose a photograph. You can choose one from the Internet or one that you might be keeping in your personal collection. You can also draw your own designs if you have the artistic talent in you to do so. Be sure to scan your selected photos on your computer so you can further edit them using a graphics program such as Photoshop. Once you have your program opened, you can put in additional touches to your photo if you wish. You also crop, realign, and rotate the image if you think it will add more depth to it. Afterward, you can choose to add a border to your design. This will make it look more organized and you can add some text to give it some more personal touches as well. Be sure to use text that is appropriate with the design that you are to use. If it is a picture or doodle of your face, you can write something to describe yourself. Remember that since it is your design, you can choose to go ham and write some pretty obnoxious stuff about yourself, but all in the spirit of good humor of course. After you are done editing your design, do not forget to save it to your flash drive as a JPEG file (USB) so you can present it to the printing shop afterward. Always try to go to a printing shop that offers affordable service. However, you should also make sure that their service is top notch as well so that you can get the most out of your money. As you can see, to design your own fabric really isn't that hard as long your imagination is active. There are literally no limits to the kinds of designs that you can come up with. The only one that can limit them is you."

11,"Here's Your ""Bruno Mars Live in Kuala Lumpur"" Starter Pack",shopping," The day is almost here folks; Bruno Mars is finally coming back to Kuala Lumpur to entertain his Malaysian fans. Taking place in the Axiata Arena on the 9th of May, the Bruno Mars 24K Magic World Tour Live in Kuala Lumpur will bring you all of Bruno's chart-topping hits like 24K Magic, Versace on the Floor, Finesse, and other fan favorites. Although the concert is taking place on the same day as the GE14 voting day, those staying in Klang Valley can still enjoy the Grammy-award winning artist burn the stage at night (those who need to balik kampung to vote, do your responsibility instead!). If you’re one of the lucky people who grabbed a ticket to Bruno Mars' sold-out show back in August, then read on to find out what to do, bring, and wear to the Bruno Mars concert 2018 in Malaysia. Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate Hydrate yourself before the Bruno Mars concert in Manila Source: Shutterstock The concert may be indoors, but it doesn’t hurt to keep yourself hydrated throughout the show, especially if you’re going to be dancing and singing along to Bruno Mars. If the organizer doesn’t allow you to bring your own water to the show, you can increase your water intake beforehand. Bottles from Nalgene Malaysia can help you drink more water. Source: @nalgene on Instagram Use a water bottle like the ones from Nalgene; they feature an intake tracker along the side of the bottle, so you can easily see how much water you've been drinking throughout the day. You can also add a bit of flavor to your water to make the process way easier. Add slices of lemon, cucumbers, or berries to add flavor as well as detoxify your body so you're in top condition and ready to go to the concert. Tiny, but mighty, sling bags Louis Vuitton sling bag that's perfect for the Bruno Mars concert Source: Jill’s Consignment Concert-goers don't normally bring totes or handbags when they go to enjoy a show. They opt for something light and practical while big enough to fit all their necessities like cash, ID, small toiletries, and the concert ticket. A sling bag from Louis Vuitton may have a higher price range but its durability, space, and style is worth all of your dimes. Take the Monogram Musette Tango for example; this Louis Vuitton bag is on the smaller side yet it can easily fit your wallet and your concert essentials. As a plus, you can wear the Louis Vuitton Monogram Musette Tango as a shoulder bag as well. Wear lightweight clothes Outfit ideas for the Bruno Mars concert in the Malaysia Source: POPSUGAR A Bruno Mars show is nothing like Coachella; you’re there to enjoy his showmanship and not to take OOTD’s. But, there's no harm in dressing up and feeling your best when you're grooving along with Bruno Mars. Wear a lightweight top that can be easily paired with a jacket whenever you feel chilly. Like this cute khaki, high-neck crop top from Zalora that you can pair it with high-waist, denim jeans and a dark-colored bomber jacket in either black or maroon to complement the khaki crop top. For the dudes, you can take some inspo from the man himself. Bruno's outfits are all about that b-boy swag with a mixture of high-fashion and retro attire. He finishes up his ensemble with a snapback and a pair of trendy sneakers like the Off-White Nike Prestos. ...And shoes you can dance in Suitable concert shoes from Vans Malaysia. Source: Shutterstock Whenever That's What I Like comes on, you're guaranteed to start swaying your hips and bopping your head. So, it makes sense to bring out your best dancing shoes to the Bruno Mars concert in Malaysia. YSince all the tickets sold for the Bruno Mars concert in Kuala Lumpur are seating tickets, you have more freedom in choosing your shoes. You can either wear a pair of cute heels or booties or a pair of shoes with extra cushioning like Adidas Stan Smith, Vans Old Skool, or Puma Suede Platforms. No matter which pair of shoes you opt for, make sure you can freely stand and dance around comfortably for 2 hours straight because Bruno sure as heck ain't stopping. Bring a portable charger Power bank from Xiaomi to bring to the Bruno Mars concert Of course, we want you to fully enjoy the concert experience and not record it on social media too much, but we understand the need to document and perhaps instill some FOMO in those who weren't lucky enough to get the tickets. Taking selfies, boomerangs, and videos will use up your battery and by the end of the 2-hour concert, your phone will be begging for some juice. If you want to document this special moment on Instagram or Snapchat, make sure to keep your phone charged. Bring a power bank that can pack in a lot of power to be able to charge you and your concert buddies' phones. The Xiaomi power bank is cheap yet can charge 2 phones at once with its 2 USB ports. Make sure to charge your portable charger beforehand. This starter pack is not only applicable for the Bruno Mars concert but also for all upcoming shows in Kuala Lumpur like Malaysia’s own Coachella, the Good Vibes Festival, taking place on July 21st and 22nd. If you have all these things prepared and ready, all that’s left to do is to bring yourself and your love for good music to the Bruno Mars concert in Malaysia."
12,Jones & Black E Liquid Review,shopping," Well let's just say that these guys are not cheap and even though I'm doing a review of there liquids I couldn't get any free, I had to pay for them! That said I decided to do the review, they didn't ask for it. Enough of my moaning and on to the actual full review. Purchasing Experience From Jones & Black I bought three liquids from there online website www.JonesBlackLiquid.co.uk. I have to say I like their website. It's not done like a traditional ecommerce and has an old English country manor feel to it. As soon as i accessed the website I experienced a certain nakedness as i wasn't wearing a suit and tie - just my plain old jeans shorts and an old t-shirt. It kinda creates that impression. The website is simple to use and it is very easy to navigate their user friendly navigation. They offer four sections to visit: Dining Room, Drawing Room, Refreshments and Chilled Larder. In each of the section there are three to four flavours. So not massive amounts to choose from - or get get lost in. I decided to opt for three liquids (70VG/30PG 3mg): Lunch from the Dining Room, Henry VIII from the Drawing Room and Alaska Freeze from the Chilled Larder. The price is steeper than most e liquids at $5 per 10ml which hurt my pocket and then the postage on-top. However I have been wanting to try out these guys juices for a while so I bit the bullet. The order arrived 3 days later, which is not bad as they shipped from the UK to the US. The Package Received From Jones & Black Once I opened the padded secure envelope I was greeted with what I thought I would. The signature gloss black bottles with the prestigious gold and black label. Gotta say by now I was excited and seriously hoping the juice would live up to the external hype. In the package we're the standard e liquid warning and a few marketing and a welcome letter. Which I thought was a nice touch. The letter was on cream thick paper with the Jones and Black logo stamped on it with a few paragraphs welcoming me as a new customer. Don't get that every day! My Review of Jones and Black Lunch E Liquid OK here it's crunch time, the part that really matters regardless of packaging. I dripped the Lunch juice into my Smok prince with a new coil, (yes I primed it). Jones & Black describe Lunch as: ""magenta-fleshed tropical Dragon Fruit blended with complimentary fruits created for the connoisseur vaper"". My Review Well let me tell you I was blown away. I have never vaped such a clean juice that manages to hold multiple pronounced flavors. Usually with liquids I have used one flavor tends to overshadow with the rest lurking in the background as an aftertaste. Not with Lunch by Jones & Black. This flavor smacks you in the face from the palate outwards. It was like being transported to a tropical rain forest even through i was sat in front of my computer at home. The flavors are precise and full, almost like you have just taken a bite out of some new tropical fruit. One thing I always look for with new e juice is the aftertaste. Does it have a perfume ending (which I hate) or a wax taste. Well i was pleasantly surprised, as the Lunch flavor lingered in my mouth still retaining the strong original flavor. When vaping it feels like it's cleaning my palate as well as engaging it with fruity flavors. The vapor Lunch juice produces is smooth, thick and sweet and smells like someone just walked in the room and squashed a tonne of fresh fruit. Does Jones & Black have The X Factor? YES, YES and YES! I have vaped literally hundreds of e liquid brands in my four years of vaping and some of them pretty awesome like Charlie's Chalk Dust, Dinner Lady (lemon tart), Heisenberg by Vampire Vape. But I could tell the difference between those juices and Lunch by Jones & Black. It's in a completely different ball park. It's a seriously fuller and deeper vape experience and you can really taste, smell and feel the difference. Million Dollar Question Now having tried Black & Jones would I continue to buy it? No is the answer. That might sound surprising based on the above review. But it's not really, I don't have the cash to spare to spend at least $5 per mil on e juice. I can see why the more affluent use this brand but I'd be broke in month based on the amount I vape. All in all it is good to experience what the rich and famous vape but then they have money to burn and can afford the high class brands and posh lifestyle. Review Conclusion Lunch by Jones & Black is simply awesome in every way from buying to vaping and the flavor really stands out alone on the pinnacle of what you can vape if you have money."

14,The Modern Day Suit,shopping," The suit as we know it today can be traced back to its creator Beau Brummel who became the arbiter of fashion more than one hundred and fifty years ago. The dandy style of that era was later epitomised by artists such as David Bowie, Mark Bolan and Bryan Ferry of Roxy Music and became known as glam rock style. Many styles have evolved over the years, such as double breasted, three button, broad to narrow lapel and back again. However the basic structured and shape of the modern day suit has changed little over the past one hundred years. We’ve been locked into repetitive style cycles of the original concept for many decades. Currently the two button single breasted with a more tailored silhouette is standard, with the younger generation opting for what is known as bum freezer. In this case the jacket is cut very short at the base of the torso, trousers low rise, similar to the old fashioned hipster with stove pipe trouser legs to complete the look. Suiting was first commercialised on Savile Row, the oldest and most famous of all tailoring precincts in the world. Tailors started doing business there around 1803. With Henry Poole credited for creating the very first dinner suit. It later became known as the Tuxedo, named after Tuxedo Park in New York State, an American Indian term meaning moving water. Kings, Princes wealthy industrialists, Hollywood movie stars and rock music stars carved a path to Savile Row spending millions of dollars on luxurious suits made from the finest Australian Marino Wool. In the early 60’s Tommy Nutter opened for business in the early 60’s financially backed by Cilla Black. He became famous for reinventing Savile Row. The first to have open window displays which caused some controversy, this practise was considered brash by old school tailor traditionalists who generally worked behind closed doors. Nutter dressed the Beatles for the famous Abbey Road album cover. Other clients include Mick Jagger, Bianca Jagger and Elton John. Soon after Spencer Tracey passed away his long-time partner and confidant Catherine Hepburn travelled to Savile Row to pay a visit to the tailor that made Tracey’s suits. She ordered a pair of tailor made denim jeans and unintentionally gave birth to the dress jean trend of the 70s. Based on this innovation Richard James another contemporary of Savile Row tailored suits made of selvage Denim woven in Japan. Renowned Italian woollen mill and suit maker Zegna have been buying the best super fine Marino wool from Australia since 1910. Apart from their ready-made off the peg apparel, they receive 60 to 80 special orders a year for suits that will set you back $34,000. Zegna are carrying on the Savile Row tradition using the finest quality cloth available. The demand for bespoke suiting has declined dramatically over the past three decades. The range of cuts and price point available in department stores is a major contributor to the decline in sales on Savile Row, with many tailoring firms having to downsize and tap into the mainstream ready-made market. Now one can purchase an off the peg Italian made suit in super fine Marino wool for under $2,000. The modern day suit survives, however fewer men tend to wear them, opting for a more casual style. Large accounting and law firms have taken the step away from tradition and for many suit and tie is no longer a standard dress requirement for the office. Is this a good thing? I think not; it demonstrates a lack of self-discipline and self -respect. Men are easily swayed by office peer group pressure and will generally follow the crowd. Those who choose to step out and dress up are the long term winners, so suit up and get positive comments."
15,Why Shopping for Clothes Online is better,shopping," There has been an ongoing war for years now between shopping online and shopping in brick-and-mortar stores. The main argument for online shopping has always been convenience and ease of access, and that main argument for shopping in person at stores has been a sense of security. Thanks to developments in technology and advancements in online security, online shopping, especially at our store, have never been more secure. A lot of people have kicked against shopping for clothes online for two main reasons. One, what gets delivered is different from the picture online and two, you might get the wrong sizes by mistake. These problems can be easily solved by having good measurements techniques and a good size conversion chart, and by buying products from wholesale clothing vendors with good reviews. Shopping for wholesale clothing online is better than shopping for wholesale boutique clothing for a number of reasons. These reasons include: Ease of Access and Convenience As long as the website is functional, shopping for clothes online is very convenient and easy to access. All you have to do is visit the webpage, and start your shopping spree. You can do this from the comfort of your bedroom without having to get dressed to go in public. Sweats are perfectly fine. You can also go on an online shopping spree for clothes while at work because your boss probably won’t give you a 2-hour break to go to the mall. But don’t let him know. Say Goodbye to Carrying Tons of Shopping Bags It’s only normal to purchase lots of clothing items such as wholesale T-shirts while on a shopping haul. We are all too familiar with the stress of carrying tons of shopping bags home or to your car. This doesn’t have to be the case anymore thanks to online stores. Your virtual shopping cart/basket will hold all your items and once you pay, the mailman or woman will take care of bringing it home for you. The Absence of Rude or Overbearing Salespersons Some people argue that when you shop online, you are deprived of the basic human interaction experience from the sales people and managers who will attend to you. They forget to mention that some of these salespeople might be rude and may also be breathing down your neck about one thing or another. This is absent in online clothes shopping, as it’s just you and computer/phone. An Online Store Never Closes This is one fact where online stores beat physical stores hands down. If you have insomnia or just want to stay up late, an online store is ever ready to cater to your shopping needs. Personal favorites: The magic of online shopping is, that the algorithm on each online page understands, what you like. After a while, it offers you automatically pieces that you might be looking for. It almost feels like personal shopping but for free. The internet shows you suggest you new arrivals of our favorite brands or alerts you when an item you’ve had your eyes on for a while is on sale. Yes, please!! An additional advantage of shopping for your clothes online is that whenever the delivery arrives, it feels like Christmas. Who doesn’t want that?"
16,Why we love fashion! (and why you should too),shopping," Clothing has been a way of expression for thousands of years. It tells us about a person for example where they might be from, which social status they have, what colors they like, what parts of their body they like, their taste and it can even reveal pieces of a person's personality. Especially women have been dressing with ""purpose"" since forever. Before humans started dressing to look good, clothing had a whole different purpose. Keeping us warm and protecting our skin from insects, rain, heat and much more. In the Victorian Era, big gowns made of silk and other decadent materials showed wealth and importance. The fashion wasn’t much rebellious and individual. Women expressed themselves with colors and accessories. The main purpose of fashion is this Era although was to shine more than the other women in your rank. There wasn't much wiggle room for skirt length, neckline, sleeve form and such things. Society had strict rules for the way one dresses. Nowadays, fashion is used much more as a personal expression and statement. Women use clothes for rebellion, to bring a body part in the foreground, and to tell a story of who they are. There are so many ways of dressing like chic and elegant, strong and powerful, rebellious and sexy, sporty, casual and cool and many more. What we love about this is, that every women can be whoever they want. Of course mostly, women wear clothes to reflect who they are and what they like, but sometimes, they like to escape from reality and dress as someone we can’t always be. It can give strength and confidence to dress as you feel. Here at Baciano, our mission is to cater to those women. We love using fashion to create different versions of a women. We understand how important it is to change little things once in a while and to create yourself new. We help making women shine. Our main goal is to create clothing that makes women shine but also makes them feel good. The magic word is COMFORT. Soft materials and fitting designs are a must. This leads us to another reason why we love clothing so much. Digging through all the different materials and finding the perfect one is so exciting. Seeing out designs in different fabrics to choose the right one is fascinating. Every fabric tells a whole other story and we get to choose which story it will be. Next to creating something for our customers to tell a story, we are also conceived to give them what they need. Warm clothes in the winter and light, airy clothes for summer. Nothing is more important for us than creating garments that can be worn for many years to any occasion. We are fascinated by the different purposes of clothes, and how they can change someone's energy and appearance. Especially in the world of wholesale, where many wholesaler copy or mass produce garments, we are proud of creating special pieces that reflect our customers wishes and personalities. After all those reasons for why we love clothing so much, here are some reason why you should love fashion as well. Be the person you want to be! Wear whatever you want to wear and how you feel most comfortable with yourself. There are so many options and styles. Everyone can find their own style. And the best Part Is that fashion, like you, evolves. It pulls you into different direction and makes you discover new yous."
17,Designed in the USA versus Outsourced,shopping," Not every fashion label has its own design team. Especially in wholesale many brands and companies buy pre-designed clothing from China or other foreign countries. It is the more cost-efficient way, but do we lose our integrity by doing that? At Baciano we design in Los Angeles and even if there are some contradictions to do so, it is worth it.  Here are the pros and cons of designing in the USA. Cons: Having an in-house design team can be more expensive than just picking out clothes from a catalog. Often an in-house design team is not only hired when it’s time to design the next collection but is working year-round on improvements, new design, and other things. This means a minimum of 3 extra salaries for your company. Designing your own clothes take up a lot of time. If you only have a little team that is also involved in other parts of the business, this could cost you time for other tasks. This usually applies more to small companies without a corporate structure. Most family businesses are run like that. Hiring an external designer might be more time efficient for you but can cost a lot of nerve. It can be difficult to pass on your vision. Every designer has their own vision and style as well and It can be almost impossible to bring both visions together to your liking. Both parties often end up stressed and unsatisfied. Compromises shouldn’t be an option when designing your next collection. Once the designs are done, receiving the final samples usually takes a while as well. When the first batch of samples comes in, almost 90% of the time there will have to be alterations done on almost all of the pieces. It can take up to 3 runs until the final samples are good to go. Pros: Your designs are unique. You can be sure that no one else has the pieces you are selling which drives the value of your brand up a lot. It’s a great feeling to accomplish things on your own without using work others did for you. You have full control over everything including materials, colors, cuts, and alternations. It is important for a clothing brand to create clothing that is tailored to their target audience. Buying mass product usually doesn’t do that. The USA still is one of the most powerful countries in the world. Being able to decorate your brand name with a USA label is a huge benefit. People trust the quality of your clothes more than if they come from Asia. It’s a great advertising opportunity. By designing in the USA, you support the American economy by creating jobs. This should be especially important to you if you are an American company that is driven by a wealthy economy. The clothing business is very dependent on exactly this. If the people are not doing good and don’t have money to spend, they won’t buy luxury goods like high-quality clothes. Working against exploiting workers in poor countries. Where you could argue that these people need jobs (and you are right), the way they are treated is against humanity. Not supporting this way of business might lead the way for the conditions to change. American standards and other countries standard vary in most cases. What means quality to us doesn't mean quality to them. Maintaining standards is an important part of a business."
18,Why it is important to have a sizing guide on your website,shopping," Everyone knows the disappointment of ordering clothes online and being so excited to finally receive them… and then they don’t fit. What happened? You always order a size medium so why doesn’t that top fit properly? Here is the answer: As surprising as it is, the sizes of clothing stores differ, depending on where they were produced and designed. A large is not always the large you are used to. Foreign clothing stores might also provide European or other countries sizes. That’s why it is important for online boutiques to feature a sizing guide on their page. Sizing guides usually give the exact range of inches for every size offered. With this information, shoppers can measure themselves at home if they are not sure about which size to choose. Not only for shoppers a size chart is beneficial. Making sure customers buy the correct size can prevent returns, unhappy customers, bad reviews, and can even increase sales because of customer satisfaction. Research has shown that retails experience an average of 28% in returns while 80% of these are due to sizing issues. A clear and detailed sizing chart plus a solid Terms of Service can also help back you up when a customer wants to return a product. Tips: Easy to understand size chart Most of the time, just small, medium and large is not enough. It is important for online shoppers to have some reference on how the garment fits on their body. Providing measurements like the length of inseam, sleeves and waist size will give a better idea of what to expect. Provide additional information that doesn’t lean on numbers and measurements Not everyone has a measuring tape at home or knows their measurements. That’s why it is important to also provide other guides to follow. Your customers have to be able to determine their size without knowing their measurements. Providing information about the cut of the item like wide or form fitting as well as fits true to size or not can help customers understand and determine which size to choose. The positioning of the size chart: Make sure your size chart is visible or easy to find right when a customer clicks on a style. It is all about the convenience. Having to search for information is discouraging and leads to an abandoned shopping cart or an unfinished sale. Reviews: Encourage your customers to leave reviews on your page, mentioning the fit and sizing of the product. It will give your new customers a reference. Having someone else share their experience can help not only to choose the right size but to gain trust in the brand and the online shop. Returns: Make returning an item convenient for your customer. Sometimes it needs a few tries to find the right size for a piece and making it difficult to find exactly that, destroys trust and comfort. These customers will most likely not return to your store. Keeping them confident that they will find what they are looking for makes your customers return and refer your offers to potential new customers. All in all, to avoid returns and keep customers happy, it is important to make finding the right size as easy as possible. The more work you put into providing information, the more you will get rewarded with sales."

1,Bamboo And Its Abundant Uses,shopping," Bamboo is one of the most useful plants on our planet and a member of the grass family. It grows in abundance, achieving maturity in only 4 to 7 years and reaching heights of 40 metres.  No fertilizers or pesticides are required to support and maintain growth. There is hardly a country in the world that has not embraced the use of Bamboo in some form.  For a member of the grass family it has amazing structural properties due to interlocking fibres, it can withstand considerable loads. The uses of this valuable plant include; The staple diet for the much loved Panda Bear, scaffolding, form work, textiles, furniture, flooring, fashion items such as watches, sunglasses and phone cases The cutest of all Bears, the Panda; 99% of its staple diet is Bamboo. In South Western Australia Bamboo plantations are being harvested and used to fuel small highly efficient power generators. Smouldering Bamboo generates enormous heat and at the same time carbon emission is classified at acceptable levels by local and international regulatory and environment authorities. Even the waist product ash is used effectively as natural fertilizer. Similar to a cash crop, after harvest it sends out new shoots and ready for another harvest in a few years. Production, maintenance and harvesting costs are very low in comparison to other forms of carbon fuel such as coal and there are virtually no adverse effects on the environment. In Thailand and Hong Kong the ancient form of Bamboo scaffolding is still used to this day. In one case reaching heights equivalent to eighty eight floors.  It is hard to imagine how the entire structure supports itself let alone carry the weight of hundreds of workers.  But it works, lightweight, easy to cut to size and lash together; it’s more flexible and far quicker to erect than its modern steel counterpart. ""It leaves us to wonder"" A couple of bright structural engineers assisted on a voluntary basis to develop methods of budget housing construction project in Brazil. They tested the structural properties of Bamboo and realised it was suitable to act as concrete form work. This reduced the amount of structural steel. Over the past five years Bamboo or so socks of appeared on the retail shelves in vast numbers, colours and styles. However, contrary to what is noted on the product information, the fabric is actually Rayon, which is a semi-synthetic fibre made by chemically reshaping cellulose. Cellulose extracted from Bamboo is suitable for processing into viscose rayon, which is typically used for lining suit jackets and women’s clothing, but sometimes the product information, is misleading. Never the less it is still far more eco- friendly than synthetic fibres such as polyester. Bamboo furniture is something we are all familiar with and flooring has grown in popularity over recent years. But the coolest emergence to the market is Bamboo watches and sunglasses. The interlocking structure of this natural material gives it great tensile strength and flexibility even when cut thinly. Its light weight and looks and feels really great. And they are low cost items so if you accidently sit on your glasses or lose the watch replacement costs won’t break the bank.  If you’re looking to differ and move away from the luxury end of expensive time pieces such as Rolex, which perform exactly the same task as an inexpensive bamboo watch. The choices are endless and they will become a central point of discussion. But it doesn’t end there. Many other durable exotic timbers are being used to make beautiful time pieces. You can add an entire collection say ten different styles for a maximum of $200 and by rotating you’ll delight in many years of functional use. And the really positive here is it’s supports sustainable industry."
2,Adding Flare to Your Translation Tool Kit,shopping," This is the inaugural Translation Tool review. And, ironically, the tool I am going to review is not strictly for translation. I am compelled to talk about MadCap Software’s Flare Single-Source Publishing application. Flare was created by the original designers of RoboHelp. I guess the smart people who came up with RoboHelp back in the 90’s got tired of seeing their brainchild being bought and sold like an old Honda Accord. They finally broke out on their own and put their best ideas into developing Flare. For the sake of full disclosure, I do not receive any enumeration for endorsing Flare or any of MadCap’s products. I must also disclose that I am not a hardcore user of any help/single-source authoring tool. However, I do manage production staff who must support these tools as part of our firm’s translation and localization services, and I must be able to guide our clients in the best choice of tools that will better enable translation and localization. Suffice it to say, that I am close enough to the grumbling and complaining when one tool versus another is used and the outcome isn’t as good as might be expected. This is a view from the trenches. Flare does an excellent job supporting 39 languages, which include most of the major languages for business. The list isn’t too different from what RoboHelp claims to support. Currently, neither of the tools support bi-directional languages such as Hebrew and Arabic without significant customization. Both RoboHelp and Flare utilize Unicode to enable multilingual character encoding, so basic issues with displaying text correctly are no longer a major problem with either product. I will say that MadCap is one of the only software companies that actually makes the effort to reach out to the translation and localization industry and listen to our experiences about dealing with multilingual authoring and publishing of Help systems and other document formats, and then proceeds to incorporate what they learn into the product. We have personally experienced how well MadCap responds to addressing new functionality and how quickly they move to extend support for new features and languages. Some of the features we appreciate most about Flare when it comes to translation are… Ease of filtering content for use with our current translation memory tools Ability to easily identify and manipulate ancillary files such as glossary and table of contents Customizable skins and navigation Integration with MadCap Lingo — MadCap’s translation memory application Integration with MadCap Capture (screen capturing utility) and Mimic (screen action recording) To be fair, many of these characteristics can also be found in RoboHelp, but the real issue in regard to choosing the right software also comes down to the fact that MadCap was the first to break from theMS Word-macro-based model (one of the reasons we dumped RoboHelp in the first place) and create a standalone authoring tool based on XML. The other driving force behind our preference is the high quality of the support we get from MadCap. Yes, we pay for this support, but it’s worth every penny, and we more than get our money’s worth. Our expectation is that MadCap, as a smaller company, will continue to focus on innovation, product quality and excellent support in order to build a small but devoted following. As a small company ourselves, we appreciate this approach."

5,How Does Beard Oil Work?,shopping," So, you have decided to grow a beard and join the league of men who make heads turn wherever they go. Do not take your beard for granted because it’s not going to be like Johnny Depp’s or Ben Affleck’s until you take good care of it. The most important thing you need to grow healthy and lustrous hair on your chin is beard oil. In this article, we will tell you how beard oil works. Beard oil is essentially used as a leave-in conditioner, and it is created by mixing essential oils such as coconut oil, almond oil, argan oil, jojoba oil and so on. The oil is similar to the natural oil produced by your skin, hence it is easily absorbed by the hair and skin. So, this reduces the load on sebaceous gland to produce enough oil to moisturize the beard. Works as an effective moisturizer: How does beard oil work? When beard oil is applied on the hair, it reaches the hair follicles and softens them from within. This prevents the hair from becoming brittle and unmanageable. The protective coat of essential oils not only moisturizes the skin but also gives it a healthy luster. The skin also feels hydrated and less itchy throughout the day. When you are ready to call it a day, make sure you apply a few drops of oil to the beard. This will heal the skin, moisturize the hair follicles and make your bread grow faster. Prevents fungal and bacterial infections The skin under the beard is usually sensitive and needs extra care. If your skin is prone to fungal and bacterial infections, you will need to use oil that can reduce inflammation and treat the infection. The skin has a tendency to become dull, dry and itchy. If your skin feels too dry, experts recommend that you apply beard oil two to three times a day. Just take a few drops on your palm and massage it throughout the beard using your fingers. If you have a long beard, you may keep a small comb to run through the hair and ensure that every hair strand is coated with oil. Has a therapeutic effect The beard oil also has a therapeutic effect as the essential oils used in it are derived from roots, peels, flowers, berries, or even wood. When you apply a few drops on your beard, it smells really good and gives you more confidence to make public appearances. Fights dry skin and beardruff Anyone who has kept a beard at any time in his life knows the mayhem beard dandruff or beardruff can create. Supplementing the extra hair growth on your chin and the skin with essential oil helps in fighting dry skin. It keeps the skin feeling smoother and softer. It also promotes cell regeneration and skin revitalization. Fights acne problems A beard works like a shield for your skin against external elements and impurities. However, simply having a beard does not guarantee acne-free skin. To prevent acne and have healthy skin, you need to have selective carrier oils in your beard oil blend. If you have an acne-prone skin, then we would recommend that you opt for jojoba oil, coconut oil, or olive oil as the carrier oil. For essential oil, you may use any of the following – lavender essential oil, rosemary essential oil, tea tree essential oil, cypress essential oil, bergamot essential oil, and oregano essential oil to name a few. Treats eczema Beard oil can also work from within to treat a skin condition called eczema. This is a chronic skin condition that is caused by skin inflammation. Beard oil containing essential oils such as rose essential oil, fennel, bergamot, eucalyptus, tea tree, chamomile, rose geranium, and lavender can help in treating eczema. Conclusion When you want a healthy and lustrous bread to add that special effect on your face, make sure you use the right beard oil. Knowing how does beard oil works will help you choose the right mix of oils to heal the skin problems if any, and properly moisturize the hair. Make sure you apply a generous amount of oil depending on the size of your beard. Apply oil after a shower and also before going to the bed to allow it to work overnight."
6,The Fashion Trend That You Are Going To Wear This New Season,shopping," See-through are the keywords to describe the biggest spring fashion trend this year!  Don’t be surprised if you start seeing PVC accessories and fashion pieces on the streets and in boutique windows. This season, we’re going to relive the PVC trend that revolutionized the 60s by the hand of the designer Andre Courreges who in 1965 launched a collection with a futuristic vision – the look for the new millennium. Thanks to Chanel, Balmain, and Valentino spring 2018 runways, PVC pieces are back and cooler than ever. You might feel like you’re wearing a raincoat even if it’s a sunny day, or you might not.  The secret to rocking this trend like a movie star is on the quality of the piece and the way you wear it. You must be really careful because you don't want to look like a wannabe Spice Girl. How do you wear PVC this season? If you're planning to wear a jacket or a pair of boots, keep in mind weather conditions. No, I’m not crazy! Remember PVC is plastic and if it’s 80 degrees outside you'll most likely sweat, and believe me, sweaty feet in plastic boots are never fashionable. Do not wear more than one PVC piece per look. Try wearing an accessory or a clothing piece like a cape. Less is more, mix your pieces with denim.  PVC and denim are a perfect combo just like wine and cheese. Play with colors, especially if you are wearing clear PVC pieces. Wear a contrast color piece underneath to make it fun and chic. When wearing a PVC purse, add some color inside using different sizes of cosmetics bags. My final tips for being stylish in PVC is… Shop according to your style, if you are more conservative but still want to rock the PVC trend, shop a clever piece like a Chanel purse, a black skirt, or a cool raincoat.

7,"In Case of Valentine’s Day, Read This & Get Flowers with Free Delivery!",shopping," Much like men’s reaction to the sports tournaments, women see Valentine’s Day as an important celebration and with February being here again, every man in a relationship is running amok, buying flowers and planning for Valentine’s Day to make sure that their significant others feel loved and appreciated. This can prove to be challenging for men who yet to begin planning for the day and/or men who has trouble expressing their feelings in a more tangible way.  So let’s make things simple and memorable at the same time, as Simply Blooms helps you to make sure that everything can be done beautifully and in time.  Step 1: Plan Activities That She Likes Try to remember and focus on the activities she may like. Has she always wanted to try ice-skating but never had the chance? Take her to Leisure Park Kallang. Is she an adorable musical nerd? Bring her to the Singapore Lyric Opera. Is she in love with fresh flowers? Go with her to the Flower Dome and/or buy her a bouquet of Valentine’s Day flowers with free delivery included. Essentially, a man planning for Valentine’s Day should show his significant other that she is thought of and noticed throughout the year by surprising her and letting her know that the man she loves has been listening to her needs, even when it seemed like he was distracted. . Note that it’s the thought that counts so recklessly spending money on the most expensive gift in Singapore may be counterproductive.  Step 2: Order Take-Out and Food Delivery If you waited too long to book a dinner place for Valentine’s Day, chances are many restaurants in Singapore would’ve already been fully booked. The alternative – ordering take-outs and/or get food delivery services – may seem less fancy, but it can be just as romantic. In addition to being able to stay in and get cozied up on the couch watching a romantic movie, ordering take-out can also show love and appreciation to your significant other in a delicate and more charming way. To begin, simply answer the questions below:  1) What is her favourite cuisine and/or restaurant? 2) What dessert does she like? 3) Is there a restaurant or dish that is special between you and your significant other? (e.g. – first dessert you shared, popcorn from the park you met, etc.)  Kicking thing up a notch, a person can make use of the flexibility that comes with ordering take-outs and/or using food delivery services to plan a special date. For example, a man can have the delivery man drop the food off at the beach where he proposed to his wife. He may also wish to set the place up like a restaurant – with fancy tablecloths, candles and if his budget allows, maybe even live music played by musicians.  The key, of course, is to design a personalised meal plan and show her that this day is planned specifically for her. Step 3: Create a Romantic Playlist Music sets the mood of the room so do remember to find out what music to play. For the songs to be played over dinner, do take step to make sure that the music is soft enough so that you can talk. Note that music can have other uses too. Does she like tap dancing? Better download some catchy tunes to add to your playlist. Does she like slow dancing? Soft, classical songs are the way to go. Additionally, one can do some research on his significant other’s favourite band or artist to create a playlist that she will love.  Step 4: Get Online Valentine’s Day Flowers with Free Delivery Even the most practical woman can appreciate the beauty of fresh Valentine’s Day flowers. In fact, studies have shown that women are psychologically influenced by fresh flowers, and men are regarded as sexier when they are in the presence of real, fresh flowers. Since fresh flowers require time to grow to full bloom and will wilt over time, it is crucial that the timing is perfect. The good news is, there are a number of online boutiques in Singapore that sell Valentine’s Day flowers and offer free delivery services to ensure that their Valentine’s Day flowers arrive at the best condition. Moreover, while physical stores may run out of Valentine’s Day flowers due to last-minute purchases, some online vendors like Simply Blooms may have stocks left as their flowers are made on demand, that is, the flowers are only cut from the fields when they are ordered. The delivery man will immediately take these flowers to the florists and once the flowers are wrapped, it will be sent to the address given. It is also worth noting that Valentine’s Day flowers may be regarded as a clique so one should always go for Valentine’s Day flowers with a modern spin on it.  For example, Simply Blooms’ Magical Mystery series bundles the most beautiful flowers in an elegant box to surprise its recipients when the box is opened. It is, in its essence, a message of love safely tucked in an elegant box. Of course, there are also other ways to modernise this classical gift, such as pairing fresh Valentine’s Day flowers with matching plushies and creating unique combination of Valentine’s Day flowers to make a bouquet.  And voila, Valentine’s Day preparation is done. Good luck and happy Valentine’s Day.  Simply Blooms is an online floral store with its main office located in Singapore. They specialise in designing sophisticated bouquets that touches the heart and soul of its recipients. They utilise all types of flowers from Red Kenyan Roses to Baby’s Breath and pay attention to even the finest detail such as the type of fabric in their flower stands and the type of paper used to wrap their bouquets."

9,Genuine Designer Handbags VS Fakes,shopping," Designer handbags have been all the rage for at least five decades. Women want one in every color, material and style. Most of the top brands can be quite spendy, so many turn to the counterfeit market to save money.. In this article I am going to explain, why no one should ever buy a fake copy of any designer! There is too little information about this, and I often wonder why the designers themselves, don't campaign against it more? First of all, it is illegal to buy or sell counterfeit handbags. It is against International Trademark Laws, because these counterfeiters making these bags, are using the trademarked names, logos and designs that belong to each company. ""But they charge so much money, so why should we pay that much just for a name, when we can get the same thing for less than half the price?"" is the question I hear most often. Let's use an example to start with and put you in their shoes. What if you wrote a book and published it, but then someone came along and put their name on it and collected all the profits from a book that you wrote? Would that be right? Of course not! Not only are these counterfeiters illegally stealing brand names and designs, they are working in illegal sweatshops, that are not inspected by any government agencies. Therefore, they do not have to meet any safety standards or guidelines! Here I will break it down for you in five sections. #1. PRACTICES ~ The counterfeiters that make fake handbags, operate in illegal sweatshops, not approved by any government agencies. They use child slave labor! These children are often 7 to 13 years old! Many are kidnapped from their families, tied to sewing machines, beaten and starved. There is record when some try to escape? Their little legs are broken! These children are horribly abused, so why would anyone want to support such a thing? #2. MATERIALS ~ Most of the materials they use on these fake handbags, are cheap unapproved materials that no safety standard department, would ever allow! They use poisonous lead based dyes, metal alloys and plastics. Does anyone want to expose their families to hazardous materials? Lord forbid your child puts the handle of your fake bag in their mouth! Even throwing them in the trash, can pollute the environment! #3. MONEY GOES TO? ~ The money spent on these fake handbags, goes to serious criminals such as drug lords, mafias and even terrorist organizations. Much of the money made, goes to support underground guerrilla warfare, heroin trafficking, slavery and the list of horrible crimes goes on. It was said that some of the funding to bomb the World Trade Center in New York, was partially funded from counterfeiters! #4. QUALITY DIFFERENCES ~ Many believe there is no difference between a genuine Gucci, LV, Coach, etc, from a fake replica of the same bag. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The difference in quality is huge! Every material is inspected by safety standard agencies. No illegal poisonous materials are used, and most are of the finest quality. No child slave labor is used and employees are paid a generous wage. All of your famous designers meet the highest standards and then some. I personally have a collection of designer handbags, and when compared to cheap brands I've used in the past? ( never wore a fake! ) There is no comparison! How many times have you had your zipper get stuck standing in line at the store, or had your strap fall off of your shoulder? Or the snap doesn't work and the bag is completely useless after just one year. How much money are you really saving having to buy a new bag every 6 months??? Make no mistake, there is a huge difference between quality designers and cheap fake imitations! Does the world really have to have a designer name on their arm so bad, they would support this criminal counterfeiting market?? Whenever there is a demand, there will always be a supply. So it's really not the counterfeiters that are the problem, it's the people buying them, the consumer, that keep them in business! The consumer, is the root of the problem! Is that something we really want to support? All so one can save money?? There are also plenty of sales at places like Macy's, Nordstrom, designer outlets, etc. One of our clients just showed us a new MK she bought at the outlet that originally retailed for $358.00 for just $93.00 on sale! So if used isn't 'your bag', lol! There are plenty of awesome sales out there on new bags everywhere. You really don't need to support criminals! No need for it at all. I hope this article has enlightened you about how none of us should ever support the criminal counterfeiting handbag business. It is up to the CONSUMER to put an end to these criminals and STOP supporting their market! Please share this information with your friends and family. An educated consumer is a must in today's market. Too many still don't know where these fakes come from and it's time to spread the word! Thank you for your time and interest."
10,Why Alpaca?,shopping," Alpaca fleece was in times past reserved for the royal and wealthy class.  Today it is highly sought after for its many superior qualities over other fibers like wool and synthetics.  It is hypoallergenic,  lightweight – very light, stronger, warmer – very warm, softer and more durable than even merino wool and cashmere.  It is so luxuriously soft and silky that it is sometimes compared with cashmere.  It's luster is like silk, exuding beauty that adds to its coveted qualities.  It is also known for water repellant and stretch characteristics (without distortion) as well as being wrinkle resistant and resistant to odors.  Alpaca is so durable that with proper care it can last eloquently for generations.  Garments dating back more than 2000 years in Peru have been found to be still in good condition. Alpacas are some of the most eco-friendly animals there are.  Compared with other grazing animals, their acreage and water requirements are lower.  They adapt well to living in harsh environments.  Instead of hooves their feet are soft pads so they leave the terrain undamaged.  Since alpaca fleece is lanolin and oil free, there is no need for harsh chemicals to be used in processing the fibers.  For high quality products made from natural renewable sources, alpaca has proven to be for thousands of years a perfect choice in fibers.  It is 100% natural and environmentally safe. Alpaca fleece is the natural fiber shorn every twelve to eighteen months from alpacas.  Although this process itself is not normally enjoyable for them, it is harmless to them and they are visibly more comfortable after they are shorn. Colors of the natural alpaca fleece range in shades from black to white, silver to rose grey to champagne and light fawn to mahogany.  Alpacas are bred specifically for color but for those desired colors beyond the natural shades, the fleece can readily be dyed to any color you choose. To compare alpaca with sheep's wool – Alpaca is approximately 3 times warmer than wool Soft and smooth, not prickly Lightweight, 1/3 the weight of sheep's wool Hypoallergenic.  It contains no lanolin as does sheep's wool.  Lanolin is the factor that causes allergic reactions for those who are sensitive to wool, resulting in irritation or itching. To compare alpaca with synthetic fabrics – Alpaca is breathable, superior to synthetics Stays warm, even when wet Won't pill or mat Windproof naturally Flame resistant Won't melt Minimal static electricity Stain resistant Resistant to acquired odors 10.Doesn't hold debris 11.Natural luster 12.Natural fiber and biodegradable Alpaca fleece is naturally more stain resistant than other fibers.  Because of its water resistant factor, if there is a spill, it can simply be blotted off with a clean cloth.  Also static electricity attracts dirt.  So because alpaca fleece naturally reduces static electricity, soil and dirt are not attracted to it.  And while odors do not stain, they can be undesirable.  The fleece reduces odors as well. With all the benefits of alpaca, it is no wonder that it is becoming a premium fiber highly sought after for clothing as well as blankets and throws."

12,Every Woman's Desire: Transforming And Empowering Through Style,shopping," A woman wants to feel beautiful, confident, at the beginning and end of every day. She wants to hold her head up high and love the reflection she sees in the mirror without spending thousands of dollars on plastic surgery to achieve it. This informative guide will serve as a path for you to achieve it. What is Style? What we call ""style"" is really everyone who make a series of very personal choices every day.  The litany of questions everyone asks herself goes something like this. What do I want to wear today? What do I want to look like? How does this outfit make me feel? What message does this outfit convey to people who work with me or meet me for the first time? Does this look good on me? Do I like this color? What accessories should I wear to round out my outfit? What goes with these pants/this shirt/my blue suit/my favorite black purse/the strappy sandals…? Are these clothes appropriate for the weather/my meetings today/my interview/working in the yard/meeting my son’s teacher at school…? The world of personal style comprises all these questions and more. It touches the heart of everyone’s internal dialog, as they get dressed daily.  It gets to the heart of self-image, self-worth, self-esteem, self-empowerment, and the individual’s sense of style. Personal style is intertwined with our personalities, our sense of individuality, sometimes our sense of conformity or rebellion, and most definitely our sense of role and status in the world. Style is ultimately important because it impacts our everyday experience. It’s what we look like when we put on clothes each morning and look in the mirror. It’s how we feel about ourselves, and it strongly influences how we feel about others. It creates first … and lasting … impressions, for good or bad. Personal style is wearing ""my own brand."" It’s one of the ultimate forms of self-expression.  Further, fashion is not just limited to consolidate the concept of wearing the latest and hottest brands etc. Fashion stands for a culture in which your personality and identity are communicated and shown to the world. You may be asking ""how do I create by own brand? Well, you must know who you are to create your own brand. So, who are you? Remember personal style is intertwined with our personalities, our sense of individuality, sometimes our sense of conformity or rebellion, and most definitely our sense of role and status in the world. First, start by buying clothes based on YOU and not just because it ""fits"" and just because the clothes are on ""sale"".  Yes, I know, most of us are on a budget and yes; some stores do not cater to all size women. But purchase items with a purpose in mind and based your personality. So, for an example, is it for a special event; that job interview; or a long-awaited vacation? What about your personality?  Are you a sassy? Or perhaps you are more reserved but a little whimsical; you may be shabby chic.  Again, purchase clothes based on YOU, period. Also, when purchasing clothing ask yourself, if I purchase this item, will it pair well with other items in my closet? If so, with what?   How many items can I pair this item with other clothes in my closet?  What about accessories?  Does this item fit my lifestyle, does it identify with my personal and professional image?  Does it portray what I want to present to the world? Do you get the picture? By asking yourself these questions, you can determine if the article of clothing will fit your purpose, fit your personality, your lifestyle, and the image you want to portray to the world; which will ultimately emit confidence and make you stand out from the crowd. You may be asking, Ok, so what about the clothes I already have in my closet?  Although most people may have lots of clothes, a huge portion of them are outdated, don’t fit properly, need to be taken to the dry cleaners, or are items that just don’t go with anything else in our closets.  The same process applies; started thinking about your style and the message you want to give with your clothes. Take some time and come up with new combinations that work and to come up with new ones whenever I go out of style.  By doing this you will find yourself getting rid of some clothing that just does not fit your purpose, personality and image.  Keep in mind, that is exactly what we want; to get rid of clothing that does not serve your purpose.  The goal is to create a stunning wardrobe and have less stress and frustration, so you can have your wardrobe organized in a way that streamlines your day to day life. Another way to look stylish, add drama and flare to your existing clothes is to wear accessories.Women's accessories, like clothes, get to the heart of self-image, self-worth, self-esteem, self-empowerment, and the individual’s sense of style. Accessories can help you can reflect your personality and preferences without being outlandish. Women's garments can be accessorized with jewelry, a scarf, a hat, a shawl, a purse, a belt, gloves, hair accessories and women's shoes. All these items combined can make your outfits look charming, polished and complete. Accessories can be great for defining your good points and minimizing the less favorable ones. They also can help you look more fashionable even without wearing fad or trendy clothing. Accessories can be great for defining your good points and minimizing the less favorable ones.

16,Leather and Suede:  What's the Difference,shopping," Leather and suede are both made from animals and processed in ways that make them easy to wear.  But, they look and feel so different, which is down to the process that turns them into their respective forms.  Leather is processed animal skin, tanned to preserve it and soften it for use in a wide variety of clothing, accessories and even furniture.  Suede is similar to leather, though it is made from the inner surface of the skin, processed slightly differently to produce a much softer texture, often very nice to the touch. The use of leather in clothing can be traced back to as much as 50,000 years ago when early humans migrated from the warmer regions of Africa and The Middle East, to the colder parts of the Earth like Europe and Asia.  Although animal skins were already being used at this time to keep humans warm, they often found that the skins would stiffen fairly quickly, particularly in extreme weather conditions.  Thus began the process now known as tanning - boiling the skins in tree bark, salting them and rubbing the skins with animal fat to keep them soft.  This early technique, like humans, has evolved and now most countries around the world have their own method of tanning. Suede came about as a by-product of leather.  When leather would become damaged, it would become unwearable.  However, it was soon discovered that by turning them inside out and processing the inside of the skin, it would create a product similar to leather, though much softer.  This was the very beginning of suede. Oil tanning became popular when European explorers migrated to North America from the 14th century onwards.  The indigenous Americans had already discovered their own method for tanning hides, using oil.  This allowed them to make much more from their animal skins such as clothing and housing (tepees).  These Native Americans would also use feathers, bones, beads and quills to decorate their leather garments - making it a much more versatile fabric than the Europeans were used to.  They were known for having exceptional skills in the art of tanning and were able to produce white leather - an incredibly difficult color to achieve at that time. Since then, leather and suede have become two of the most commonplace fabrics in modern society.  Leather jackets were made famous in the 1950's by stars like James Dean and in the 1980's by designers such as Versace, Armani, Gucci and Hermes worked with leather a lot, creating a world-wide fashion craze.  In more recent times, the awareness of animal-friendly fabrics has given way to vegan-leather and suede, a substitute for the original in which no animals are harmed.  Vegan leather can be made from the bark of cork oak trees, kelp from the sea or even pineapple leaves.  There is much debate around whether this is actually any more eco-friendly than the animal hide alternative.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that not harming animals purely for the making of fabrics is a good thing! http://www.HoboPursesAndMore.com"
17,How Leather Accessories Are Made,shopping," Although there are many different types of accessories available in the market, nothing beats the glamorous looks of leather accessories. Leather has been in fashion since ages. You can always impress your colleagues, friends or your girlfriend if you have leather accessories for the occasion in your wardrobe. Wearing them will instantly make you look rich and empowered. Leather belts, boots, jackets etc. increases the style quotient of the user immediately. They make that classic statement piece that will remain immortal in your wardrobe. As they are used since ages, I decided why not to do a bit of research on how they were made before. In ancient period people used to hunt wild animals for food, clothing and to make different daily needed equipment from their hides. They then started making leathers from their skin to protect themselves from the elements. ""Tanning of the leather"" was invented by certain ancient geeks, with the help of some tree barks and leaves to preserve it from decomposing. The another process was discovered by accident, which was smoking and which later became formaldehyde tanning, as this substance is found in the vapors produced by burning of green leaves and branches. It was also discovered that the rotting process could be unhurried by drying, carried out to exposure to the sun or by dehydrating action of the salt. And many other more efficient tanning processes were discovered and refined gradually which made the use of leather possible in those ancient worlds and continued to do so for century after century till the present day. Buy men leather clothing online. The leather making process has become more advanced nowadays. It starts with the raw hides arriving in the tannery preserved in salt. Later a thorough examination is done to see whether the skins are adequately kept or not. The processing begins with the removal of salt. Skins are then loaded in the wooden vessel and rinsed in running water for approximately 24 hrs. This is done to bring back the skin to its original condition. Then lime and acid treatments are done to remove the hair from the skin. Almost 24 hours later, the skins are again washed and sent further for next stage. Fleshing is done on the skin, where the hides are passed between two rollers which remove the excessive fats and flesh from the skin. Later splitting process is carried out where the skins are inserted through a machine equipped with two cylinders in between which a sharp running blade is kept constantly sharp.  The skins are horizontally split to a predetermined thickness evenly throughout the surface.  The top layer also called Top Grain is then ready for tanning. One can always buy leather accessories online for women. As said before, tanning is the most important process in the leather making. There are various tanning process available nowadays, from which few are done on the hides. Then the leather hides are run through a machine which presses the water out of the hides to predetermined degree of moisture, making it ready for splitting again. Later the same process of splitting is carried out once again which is then followed by shaving and trimming, where the extra unnecessary parts of the leather are trimmed and it is shaved to uniform thickness by various machines. Dyeing is carried out later to color the leather with the help of large wooden tanks which are filled with water, resins, fats and various color dyes. The colored leather is then ready to be dried. The colored leather is then ready to be transformed into various beautiful accessories which were, which are and which will always be an important part of the fashion industry. Leather products are widely available around the world, they are the trend setters. One can buy leather products online in India as well as across the stores."

19,Military Retirement Gifts Buying Guide,shopping," Military retirement gifts have been around for centuries. Even thousands of years ago members of the Roman Army were gifted something special upon retirement. These days, retiring military servicemen and servicewomen can be just about as difficult to buy for as any other person, but this time you are dealing with someone who most probably is very set in their ways and very firmly know their likes and dislikes, especially the things they dislike! That results in a pretty tough challenge when it comes to buying them something fulfilling for their retirement that will truly make them happy. Some people about to retire from the military, either the Navy, Army or Air Force, feel that they have had enough of the military life and want to dissociate themselves from it. The majority, however, will retain their link to the military for the rest of their lives and retain their sense of pride in their Service. Leaving the military after serving for some time can be tough; the most difficult thing I remember was losing that feeling of being relied upon by people; of being someone ‘important’ and ‘needed’. These good feelings were replaced by a sense of loss (almost the same feeling as losing a member of the family) and I recall the most difficult thoughts were when I was walking down the street and nobody was looking at me, nobody recognising who I was or what I had done, what I had experienced in my military life. It was like I had become a ‘nobody’. After a period of re-adjustment, those feelings gradually subsided and a new-found sense of acceptance prevailed. My bond and association with the military, however, has remained and will do so until the day I die. After some 20+ years since leaving the military, I still have the retirement gifts that various people gave to me. They are on permanent display in my home and give me feelings of belonging. That’s pretty typical of most people who retire from the military and I find great joy in visiting the homes of other veterans and seeing their trophies, mementos and keepsakes from their time in the Service. So what to buy them as the perfect Military Retirement Gift for anyone from the Navy, Army or Air Force? Luckily there are now many websites selling gifts that are entirely suitable for serving and retired veterans so you are not going to be caught short. One recent addition to the range available has been the introduction of duvet cover and pillow case bedsets, printed in high-definition of various Services, Branches, Units, Regiments and Battalions. Each bed set incorporates the insignia, flag or emblem of each unit and are proving to be extremely popular. They serve as the perfect way for the retiree to maintain their link with the military. Some of them will have spent many a night in uncomfortable places, fatigued from the events of the day, probably sleeping in the same uniform they have been wearing for the past week.  What better then, than snuggling under the comfort of your military memento of your former service. One company have even started a service whereby they can print just one item in the design of your choice, so if the retiree of the person you are buying for served in a particular Branch, Service or Unit, you simply contact them and they will gladly work with you to come up with a suitable design for the retiree if they don’t already have one in stock. Whatever you choose for them, it will surely be much appreciated; that sense of loss on leaving one family can be healed by feelings that people outside the military, friends, family and acquaintances, still care about them and are grateful for the service that they did for their Country."

5,"What are Freshwater Pearls, Lampworked glass and Cat's eye glass?",shopping," Difference between natural and cultured pearls Natural pearls are formed in the wild, inside the oysters in wide oceans, when an irritant like a grain of sand enters the mollusk. The oyster secretes a protective layer called nacre around the irritant. The oyster continues to form layers over layers of nacre over its lifetime, which ultimately becomes a pearl. This process occurs over a period of several years. For example, an 8-9mm pearl might take as long as 5-6 years to form that size and depth. For this reason, natural pearls are rare and very expensive. Cultured pearls, on the other hand, are grown inside mussels that are cultured in a pearl farm, where the farmer regularly introduces the irritants so he can regulate the depth and luster of resulting pearls and make the process more rapid. Difference between saltwater and freshwater cultured pearls Saltwater cultured pearls are grown in oysters that live in the ocean, usually in protected lagoons, like the South Sea pearls and Tahitian pearls. Freshwater cultured pearls are formed in freshwater mussels that live in freshwater bodies like lakes and ponds. Advancement in culturing techniques over the last ten years have made freshwater pearls very close in quality to the saltwater pearls and much less expensive. Lampworking is a centuries old technique and was used to make paperweights, figurines, beads and ornaments. This technique involves melting glass using a lamp or a torch and then forming a shape by blowing and shaping with tools and hand movements. The specialty of lampworked glass pendants is the combination of colors within the glass and unique, often unusual shapes formed. Cat’s eye effect is a fiber optic effect where a visible streak of light runs parallel to the long axis, similar to an elongated cat’s eye. Cat’s eye stone is commonly referred to variants of minerals with the special optic effect. Cat’s eye glass has the same effect of light refractions, where a band of light runs across the center of the pendant, like a cat’s eye."

7,"Vegan Leather and Suede, Better for Animals?",shopping," Wearing leather has become a hot topic in recent years, with the rise of animal-rights groups pointing out how skinning an animal for the skin is a cruel and unnecessary way to be fashion forward. This has paved the way for vegan-friendly fabrics, such as leather which is made from kelp or bark. Where people stand on wearing leather often depends on their stance on towards eating meat – vegans and vegetarians are much more likely to support the wearing of faux leather. However, more and more carnivores are taking this stance too. Many people argue that wearing animal hides isn’t cruel as the animals are being slaughtered for their meat anyway. However this isn’t entirely accurate as most farmers sell their animal hides for a much higher profit than the meat. Looking at it this way, one could argue that by buying animal hides you are just supporting the meat industry. Farmers are out to make money, just like everyone else and by selling cow hide (the animal from which we get most of our leather) they stand to make a lot of profit. Recently, there has been more of a call for more exotic types of leather – people want new and different things and cow hide leather has become very common. In South Africa, ostrich farmers are selling their skins for hides and the meat is only sold as an afterthought. This means that the bird was killed for the primary purpose of producing leather, meaning if it wasn’t for the high demand of ostrich-leather these ostriches would not have been killed. A worrying fact about non-vegan leather is that the softest, and often considered the most luxurious and expensive of the leathers is that which comes from young animals. Even more disturbing than this is that sometimes these animals are cut from the womb prematurely, just to be used for their hides. This is worrying because there is a status connected with purchasing expensive leather items – people are often more concerned with how they are perceived by their peers than concerned about the welfare of animals who sometimes don’t even get to take their first breath before being killed for their skin. Leather is also having an impact on the environment. The process of tanning is incredibly toxic, and means that carcinogenic products can be pumped into the water systems and into the atmosphere. Although tanning factories in the United States and Europe are forbidden from producing leather this way, a lot of them are still using this method. This rule doesn’t apply to Asia, in particular China – where most of the world’s leather goods are manufactured. This is creating a huge problem for the environment, but people are reluctant to switch due to the speed at which this process takes. These are all good points to consider when thinking about purchasing vegan leather or suede. The impact on the environment is just one of the disturbing facts about leather. This is without even taking into consideration the amount of harm millions of animals go through daily just so humans can wear nice clothes."

14,A Short Guide to Choosing the Right Handbag,shopping," The humble handbag is one of the most commonly used fashion accessories in the world. After all, you are likely to carry one most days. The perfect handbag is one that accentuates your figure and style. It adds the finishing touch to your outfit. Therefore, it is absolutely vital that you select  the right one for you. Here are a few tips that you can use to find the right one. The Length A handbag will accentuate the section of the body where its bottom rests. In other words, a bag that sits at the hips will highlight that particular part of your body. This kind of handbag will be suitable for those who have smaller hips. It will flatter your shape and give it a more feminine appearance. For those with larger hips, you should select a bag that sits at the waist line. This accentuates the taper of the waist and creates a slimming effect. However, handbags which sit at the waist level are suitable for most body shapes. Therefore, they are a valuable addition to your collection. The Size This is quite an easy point to remember. Follow your own height when considering the size of the handbag. If you are a tall woman, avoid going for small handbags. They will not have the desired visual impact. Conversely, a short woman must never choose an over sized bag for the same reason. The Usage A handbag is not just a fashion accessory. It is also a utilitarian item which serves an essential purpose. Therefore, you must always consider how you will be using the handbag. A handbag for special occasions is not one that you can carry around every day. For example, if you need to carry a laptop, a small handbag is the wrong choice no matter how stylish it is. Therefore, think about why you want a handbag and start searching accordingly. This way, you will know how big it should be and what features it should offer.

The Style If you are buying a handbag to support your regular outfits, consider your general style.

17,What's the Best Soundbar for Me?,shopping," Setting up a Soundbar is very straightforward, but as with any hi-tech audio setup there is a lot to consider if you want to get the most out of your investment. Sure, you can just sling it in and hope for the best, but let’s face it, having shelled out some money you want your new system to ROCK! All top soundbars have slightly different setup requirements so do make sure to read the manual that comes with yours when you buy it. A soundbar is a specially designed loudspeaker enclosure that creates a stereo effect from a single cabinet. They are much wider than they are tall. This is partly due to acoustical reasons and to get the convenience of being able to mount the speaker unit right above or below a display, usually flat panel TVs. Due to space constraints many HD TVs often have smaller speakers, leading to poor audio quality and intelligibility. Even though soundbars are meant to be a single speaker solution, they are often packaged with a subwoofer. While some soundbars are capable of producing low end bass, many are not. Be sure to see whether or not a subwoofer is included with the budget soundbars system you buy. If there is no subwoofer, make sure that the model you are buying has the capability to play back bass in addition to mid and high range audio. You can enjoy the soundbar speakers all alone or with family and friends without any unfamiliar faces sitting around you making noises. There is no tangled wire hassle or wires hanging against the wall, so it looks good and keeps clean. You can mount it up to a wall or place it right below/above your TV. Flat screen televisions and advances with LCD and high def have given us breathtaking picture quality. Unfortunately a flat screen TV just can't generate the sort of sounds to really match the screen. Soundbars, sometimes called sound projectors, can really take your home audio to the next level. You won't believe how much great sound comes from one piece of audio equipment. Before you buy yours, though, make sure that you read some high end soundbars reviews online and keep the tips mentioned in this article in mind. Getting the best deals means doing your homework and knowing exactly what you're after, before you buy."
18,Are You Shopping for Bed Linen -- Here Are a Few Tips,shopping," Bed linen is that essential part of the bed nobody sees until it's time to crawl under the covers and go to sleep at night and it includes sheets and pillow cases and anything else that goes under the covers.  It's basically a covering over the pillows and mattress in order to protect them and keep them clean.  They are typically washable, so when it's time to launder them, it's simple and easy. What is foremost important to you as you shop for bed linen?  If you want something that coordinates with your bedroom, you can easily find a large variety of every imaginable color, solid colors as well as prints.  If you're main interest is the material you will find  polyester, bamboo, linen, cotton, silk and Egyptian cotton.  Different weaves like a stripe or plaid bring still more variety and there are some that have a special enhanced weave that results in a more durable fabric. Egyptian cotton originally was harvested in Egypt but is now grown other places as well.  Egyptian cotton uses longer threads and that's what sets it apart from other cotton fabrics.  Longer threads results in higher quality and stronger durability. When you're shopping for bed linen, you will notice there are different thread counts.  The thread count is the number of threads woven both lengthwise and width wise in a one inch square.  Thread counts generally range from 200 to 1800.  You may think that the higher the thread count, the better the product.  Maybe yes, maybe no. There is something more to keep in mind.  A thinner and finer yarn size will give you a higher thread count.  This results in a softer, more comfortable product and a tighter weave but may not necessarily be as durable.  Yet another factor to consider is how many threads are twisted together to make a single strand of thread.  Two ply translates into two strands, three ply would be three.  So a three ply, 300 thread count would be a thicker and likely a more durable fabric than a higher one ply count.  A higher one ply count would be a thinner and softer fabric by comparison. So the quality of your bed linen fabric depends on a couple factors-- The quality of the fiber The length of the yarn The thread count The ply The finish How it is constructed And really this can be overwhelming if you're looking for a high quality, low cost product. You will be able to see from the manufacture's listing the fabric features to help you determine more easily what best fits your specific wants and needs.   If you have children, your main concern could be a wrinkle resistant or stain resistant bed linen.  This is normally a general characteristic of a polyester or microfiber fabric. If you are leaning toward longer life and a more durable product, then your Egyptian cotton with multiple ply yarn may be your best solution.  Maybe you just want pretty and aren't concerned with either.  There you have a multitude of choices.  You are the one who decides what characteristic best fits your needs.  I hope this sheds a little light on your shopping experience.  It at least gives you a little insight to help you intelligently understand the fabric differences.  So enjoy shopping!"

UK sale season usually has a lot of lengths and widths available, so do not hesitate to try as many as you need to get your perfect coat. Another thing in question is the fabric for your garment. Of course men’s wool overcoats are considered the best choice as they show class and keep you really warm.

17,Do you enjoy relaxed jeans?,shopping," If you get tired of narrow jeans and khakis are not your style for relaxed afternoons, you might consider men's  relaxed jeans. These are the jeans that a pattern reminiscent of the standard model that was popular around the mid-nineties. The waist is the exact place and legs are slightly extended, that jeans model resembles that most of us will see as a ""normal model.""

18,Nearly Six Decades and Still Going Strong,shopping," There are few things more distinctive than a pair of Dr. Martens. From just a glance they can be identified. Going all the way back to their humble beginnings, it’s a look that hasn’t changed much in almost sixty years. In fact, you can still buy the original model 1460 to this very day. Other than Converse’s Chuck Taylor model sneaker, Dr. Martens are perhaps the most iconic footwear the world has ever known. The telltale shape of the uppers enshrined with bright yellow stitching around the sole didn’t happen initially. Healing after breaking his foot in 1945, Dr. Klaus Martens created the first air- cushioned sole to relieve his own pain when walking. He later showed them to a friend and the two soon went into business manufacturing the shoes. While Dr. Martens popularity really took off among punk rockers and skin heads, the first pairs were designed and sold primarily to older women. The air-cushioned soles soon caught the attention of one of England’s oldest shoemakers. It was at that time they purchased a license to use the air sole technology. Adding their own unique touches like the rounded toe and yellow stitching, what we now call Dr. Martens were born in 1960. They quickly became the shoe of choice for the working man in England until fate once again altered the future of Dr. Martens. Pete Townshend of the Who is credited with propelling Dr. Martens into popular culture by wearing the iconic boots while performing. As the Who’s popularity soared, so did Dr. Martens as they represented the working man and youth rebellion of the sixties. Soon the boots made a migration to the U.S. where they also became a symbol of rebellion and unrest. When the Grunge scene emerged on the west coast, what else would they be wearing other than Dr. Martins? While the look of the eight-holed 1460 model will always be associated with Dr. Martens, something strange happened along the way. People took it upon themselves to customize their Dr. Martens. The normally drab boots were now being seen in bright colors or covered in whatever form of artistic expression their owners had chosen. Dr. Martens took note and realized there was a whole other market for their boots. Forty years after they shot to fame, the popularity of Dr. Martens began to decline. Production was cut significantly and it looked like the one time shoe of choice for the disgruntled youth would be no more. Again with help from the music world and civil unrest around the globe, in the early 2000’s Dr. Martens enjoyed another wave of popularity. Factories were reopened and Dr. Martens seized on the opportunity to diversify their product to ensure they would remain at the forefront of popular culture long into the future. If you see someone wearing a pair of 1460’s, you can bet they have at least five more pairs in various stages of evolution. They are literally indestructible and actually get better with age. With a little cleaning and maybe a new set of laces from time to time, a pair of Dr. Martens can easily last for years. While their popularity will undoubtedly continue to rise and fall with the times, their place in western culture is eternal."
19,Facts and Fun About Shoes,shopping," Heels were worn by men for centuries. Rather than a marker of gender, they were an indicator of high social status. Besides the social update, heels were needed to keep men safe on their horses. To keep from falling they put their heel into the stirrups. King Edward II, Shoes, and Barleycorn In the early 14th century King Edward II of Britain declared shoe size would be based on the length of barleycorn. Three barleycorns would equal one inch, he proclaimed. And so the first standard shoe size was written. Question 1: How many pairs of shoes do you think the average U.S. woman has? (Keep reading to find out!) $660,000 Dorothy’s size-five red slippers from The Wizard of Oz were the most expensive shoes to ever sell. The original pair were auctioned off in 2000. The Invention of the Right- and Left-footed Shoe Philadelphia was the birthplace of the right- and left-footed shoe. Until 1850 shoes were straight and didn’t account for the fact that feet curved in opposite directions. Queen Victoria’s Lady’s Boots In 1840, the lady’s boot was created for Queen Victoria.  This boot has been popular for 177 years.  Question 2: Where do you think the wedge shoe came from? When Were Shoes Invented? Livescience says archaeologists found shoes dated back to the Middle Paleolithic period. 40,000 years ago.  These were usually made of leather, shaped like moccasins or sandals, and were worn inconsistently.  It wasn’t until the Upper Paleolithic period that shoes became common. Question 3: Can you understand your life by dreaming about shoes? Shoes in Europe In the European Baroque period women and men’s shoes were similar. Differences were seen in social classes. People of low class wore heavy, black leather shoes, and those of high class wore the same style, but crafted from wood. ATI says that during the 1800’s men’s heel height finally settled on 1 inch. Around this time, women’s and men’s shoes became different in ""style, color, heel, and toe shape"". The Great Depression People wore sturdy, practical, black and brown shoes. When the economy improved men mostly wore Oxfords and women wore platform shoes, says ATI. Footwear After WWII Men’s shoe styles changed very little during this time, while women’s shoes moved closer to our idea of high heels. Arched, high quality, and designed to convince others to buy beauty. 20th Century Shoes In recent times, as more women went to work, heels became the norm for the office. While work heels are typical colors of black, brown, and beige, fashion has introduced wild designs and colors. There are shoes that look like a horse’s hooves, have nine-inch heels, are propped up like ballerina slippers, and sparkle. Like purses, shoes have changed to reflect personalities. ANSWERS: #1: The average U.S. woman has 19 pairs of shoes, one study says. #2: Italy. After running out of steel because of the trade close, Italian designer Salvatore Ferragamo did an experiment with new materials. From his experiment in the 1940’s, wedge shoes were born. #3: Yes! From well-adjusted to overconfident to the desire for love, dreaming about shoes can tell you a lot about where you are in your life."
20,Six Wardrobe Staples Every Woman Should Own,shopping," Many of us have stood in our closets agonizing over what to wear at some point in our lives. Some of us experience that feeling on a regular basis, even though our closet may be packed with trendy pieces. It may be this focus on trendy items only that makes us have this feeling since these pieces can quickly feel outdated. By investing in these six timeless wardrobe staples, we promise you will always have something to wear.  1. Basic Black Pumps  This shoe made the list because of its extreme versatility. They can be worn with dresses, skirts, and jeans. They look equally great day or night, at both casual and formal events. Be sure to get a high-quality leather pair, in a heel height you can manage. If the heels are too high and uncomfortable, you will be less likely to wear them.  2. Black Evening Dress  There’s a reason why the little black dress has always been a wardrobe staple: it can flatter every figure and can be worn to almost any event. Choose a dress in a flattering fit that you like, but avoid anything too trendy style-wise. The best thing about the LBD is that it can be accessorized in a way to make it work for almost any evening occasion.

Invest in a good pair in a fit that fits well, and you will have a piece of clothing you can wear with just about anything else.

This closet staple is also versatile, as it can go from the office to a night on the town with a simple change of top and accessories.  4. Blazer  Whether you work in an office or not, every woman still needs a blazer. A well-fitting blazer in a neutral color can pull many outfits together and add polish to more casual items like jeans. The fit is very important when buying a blazer. If you can’t find one that fits, buy one that is a little too big and have it tailored.  5. Silk Blouse  Almost nothing feels better against your skin than pure silk. Few blouses are as flattering and versatile either, as they look great tucked into jeans or worn with a sophisticated skirt. Choose one in a color that you love, or pick several in many different colors. You can’t go wrong with the timeless silk blouse.

According to its press releases, it has been setting the standard in quality air mattresses for over twenty-five years now. It claims to continue redefining these standards through the innovations that it enforces in its new mattress designs. This is such a tall claim for a company that has a little over two decades of experience under its belt. A look at the company’s product line and at the user reviews will determine whether or not mattress developed by Comfortaire is really true to what it is purported to offer. Innovations A mattress produced by Comfortaire features air chambers that work as support systems in place of a spring unit. The newer designs have taken a step further on this innovation by using urethane alloy air cores combined with a box top design. This pushes air to the top of the mattress so that it offers enhanced support by gently following the contours of the body. Another interesting feature of the Comfortaire products is the patented Omalon support pads that complement the support functions of the air chambers. The low-profile chamber in the mattress allows air to travel all the way to the edge of the bed. No matter which part of the bed you lie on, you’re supposed to experience the same level of support on the mattress. Other Features According to various consumer reviews and the company’s website, a Comfortaire mattresses offers certain features that may not be found in similar products. One remarkable quality that its new product line has is its ability to address the issue of trapped heat, one of the toughest challenges that mattresses face. The new air chamber design allows heat and moisture to pass through the surface so it doesn’t stay inside and damage the mattress. While doing so, the air chambers are still capable of retaining internal pressure for a long time. The mattress brand also has a unique formulation that helps eliminate and reduce bacterial contamination as well as the buildup of fungus and mildew on the mattress. Consumer Reviews The Comfortaire mattress has garnered numerous consumer reviews. Many who have tried the product have provided positive feedback on it. Most consumers agree that the mattress offers great comfort mainly attributed to its adjustability. Another good point about the product is that it is easy to assemble. Even a California king size mattress is easy to maneuver around the house. Another consumer writes that the mattress offers restful sleep because of the back support that it provides. Customer service also got another positive point as many consumers found the company’s support options helpful enough. There are no reported issues with regards to sagging in the middle of the bed or problems with the edges. Complaints about some products range from the noisy pump that doesn’t come with number setting on the controls to poor construction quality and the zipper being not heavy duty. The price does offer great value for the budget conscious, though. Affordable prices, innovative air chamber technology offering optimum support and extreme comfort are just three of the selling points of the Comfortaire mattress. On a scale of one to five, this product gets a four."
2,Why power banks are becoming the most important phone accessory,shopping," As our world becomes more and more connected, power banks are becoming a necessity. Phone usage increases year on year, and smartphones are becoming more and more advanced. As the demand for greater processing power grows – so that users can multitask, take photographs at camera quality and use all the apps they want - so too does power consumption. Power banks allow users to carry their power source wherever they go, in a convenient and easy-to-use product, and services like Personalised Power Bank allow you to design your own power banks with an easy personalising service. All of the companies that dominate conversation about new technology in the media – Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Tinder and more – are focusing their efforts on smartphone users, as this is increasingly where customers access their content – on apps or through mobile internet browsers. Most of these companies rely on ad revenue from these websites, and ad revenue is increasingly coming from phone users. As these companies continue to encourage people to use their apps and services, consumers will continue to use their phones to access them. For example, apps like Instagram and Snapchat are mobile-only – you can view Instagram content on a PC but you can’t upload anything. To be part of the conversation, you have to be online, and on a smartphone. According to Exchange Wire, over 91% of UK millennials own smart phones. On average, people check their smartphones 45 times a day, according to multinational software and professional services company SDL – and all that usage will drain batteries quickly. The most popular apps will be checked most frequently, and leaving them running in the background, as most multitasking smartphones allow users to do, will drain a phone’s battery even faster. Most phone manufacturers don’t allow a customer to replace their phone’s built in battery or storage, but most people aren’t able to carry around a charging plug and have access to power supplies whenever they need it. Increasingly, we’re seeing a dilemma wherein customers need more power than a single charging cycle on their smartphones can provide. The solution to the power problem with smartphones is simple: portable power banks, carrying charge for smartphones and other portable electronic devices. Considering Apple’s latest decision to remove the headphone jack from their latest iPhones, instead introducing AirPods that need to be charged, having an external power source will become even more important for anyone that uses Bluetooth technology. Power banks come in many shapes and sizes, from standard entry level models that are ideal for the everyday consumer to power banks with huge capacities for heavy power users. Users that want the newest phone will appreciate the latest in digital print technology, offering picture-perfect reproduction of photographs, text and logos on capable and powerful power banks. Personalised Power Bank can offer completely custom and bespoke power banks. There’s a power bank for every kind of user: their Cuboid Metal Power Bank is perfect for any casual user who just needs a boost during the day, while the Flat Power Bank is probably the best power bank for an iPhone user due to the ergonomically similar shapes. A high capacity power bank like the Power bank Plus is ideal for power users who need to charge iPads or larger smartphones more than once a day. Personalised phone cases are already a large part of the smartphone accessories market, but as the demand for more power continues, personalised power banks will probably become more popular. Younger users are likely to prefer a device that is aesthetically pleasing, and can be personalised. As power banks become more of a household item, people will look to find a more interesting version that can be given as a gift. Printed power banks are perfect for gifts for family and friends, and are completely unisex as a gift, being suitable for both men and women. The option to completely personalise a power bank with the recipient’s name is ideal for personal gifts, but also a unique opportunity for businesses as a piece of promotional merchandise to demonstrate their appreciation to customers and business partners."

4,Fast is the Clothing of the Future,shopping," With social media in our everyday lives and smartphones in our hands, the fashion industry's business model is changing to a see now-buy now assembly line, entrepreneur.com says. Consumers are clamoring for immediate purchasing of runway clothing. Only 10 years ago, this access to the fashion industry was unheard of. Either consumers had to buy tickets to fashion shows, read about it in the morning's paper, or watch it online as Harper's Bazaar states. Not anymore! The Catwalk and Phones Smartphones dominate the front row of every catwalk, bringing consumers to fashion shows, virtually. From their homes, they receive images through Snapchat and Instagram of the behind-the-scenes creation of cutting-edge designs. They watch as innovation is revealed through live streams, according to entrepreneur.com. By the time these revolutionary designs hit the stores no one wants them! Immediate Availability To keep up with consumer's insatiable hunger many large companies are making their clothes available the same day as the fashion show. A day after at the latest. Harper's Bazaar says some designers already moving to this model are Michael Kors and Proenza Schouler. Their core pieces were available after New York Fashion Week of 2016. And yet, others are rallying against this fast-fashion shift. François-Henri Pinault, representative of Kering, the parent company of ""Gucci, Bottega Veneta, Saint Laurent and Balenciaga"", and Ralph Toledano, the captain of France's fashion, announced in WWD that they will use the current system. But in our world of instant gratification, there's no time for slow. Fast is the only fashion that stays in style. This speed-of-thought business model may be able to be picked up by larger companies, but for smaller companies doing two separate presentations will be a struggle, says Harper's Bazaar. Indeed, it may be impossible. Technology and Retail Many companies, such as Macy's, Nordstrom, and Target have already rolled out a visual search. This software helps shoppers find items using ""color, shape, size, and proportions"", according to entrepreneur.com. The consumer only needs to take a picture of the item and the app will find a similar product. With increased click-through rates and a return of investment for companies, visual search technology is unlikely to go out of style. 3D Body Scanners Another breakthrough technology is virtual fitting rooms and 3D body scanners. These advancements will reduce a lot of returns. Much to the relief of retail stores, 3D body scanners allow users to virtually try on clothing, using avatars. No longer will they have to ask, ""Will this fit?"" They'll know before pressing ""buy"" on their phones. Machine Learning Isn't it amazing how technology can predict what you want, even before you know you want it? This ability is through machine learning. It's used to provide suggestions and notify consumers of upcoming products based on what they have searched for before. Using this technology is like hooking your brain up to your phone and subconsciously window-shopping. In the future, what do you think the fashion industry will look like?"
5,Women's Fashion Trends for Summer 2017,shopping," Summer is almost here, and many of us are ready to update our wardrobes for the warmer weather. No one wants to be caught wearing outdated fashion. Follow our tips for what will be hot in women’s fashion for summer 2017 so that you can stay on trend. Given the heavily charged political atmosphere around the world, it is no surprise that t-shirts emblazoned with slogans will be popular this year. These don’t have to be your typical, cheap graphic tee, as even major fashion houses like Dior are getting into the t-shirt game this year. You aren’t limited to controversial political slogans, either. You can also choose tees sporting fashion logos, such as those that have been seen on the catwalk from Gucci and Moschino. 2. Ruffles Ruffles have already been spotted in many spring 2017 collections, and they are slated to be just as hot this summer. From long, flowing flounces to tinier frills that accent a collar or placket, expect to see this trend everywhere. Don’t feel like you have to be super-girly to try out this trend, though. Designers like Alexander McQueen are fashioning ruffles out of leather and in more punk-like styles to appeal to a wider audience. Gone are the days of monochromatic dressing, at least for the upcoming season. This summer, you will see much more color, and it will be mixed in new and surprising ways. Think mint and mulberry, hot pink and purple, and bright orange with maroon. It seems that almost any combination is fair game these days, and the looks come together shockingly well. So, don’t be afraid to put together your favorite colors this summer, even if they don’t traditionally match. 4. Athleisure While athletic clothing as everyday wear is not necessarily a new trend, it shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. In fact, this trend seems to be heating up for the summer 2017 season. Activewear is getting a bit of an update in the form of luxury embellishments this year, though. You will see items like tracksuits adorned with crystal accents, or athletic tops with stylish laser cutouts. Expect to see the clashing color trend expanded to include activewear, as well. Unfortunately, this year’s athleisure lines appear to be re-introducing bike shorts for everyday wear, too. Don’t say we didn’t warn you. Stripes of every sort are set to be big this summer. You can choose from pinstripes to thick stripes in every color combination and variation: horizontal, vertical, and diagonal. Sticking with the mix and match trend, expect to see stripes paired with contrasting, clashing stripes, or with other non-matching patterns and colors. With the wide variety of stripe available to choose from, you can choose to be as subtle or daring as you please. Above all, the rules for summer 2017 fashion appears to be that there are no rules. Choose what you like, and don’t be afraid to experiment. This year, it’s all about what makes you feel good when you wear it. "

7,Purses Through Time,shopping," Purses Through Time Purses could be found in the Ice Age. Back in the Ice Age, they were used to carry weapons, coins, tools, and food, according to medium.com. Humans haven’t changed much in 18,000 years. To this day purses are used to store the same things! Informationng.com writes that in different countries men used small pouches for similar activities. Ancient Egyptians carried small pouches around their waists, and medieval Europeans used handbags to carry seeds and other small purchases from the market to their homes. Now, let’s jump forward a couple thousand years to the 14th century. You’ll find a history both fascinating and bizarre. 14th – 18th century During the 14th century, handbags were given to brides on their wedding day. Ornate, these differed from the drawstring bags used to carry coins, and the ""hunting purses"" Knights used. Wealthy women carried purses as an accessory for special occasions, and other women hid girdle pouches under their clothing, says informationng.com. 16th and 17th-century purses boasted some rather odd staples. Roses and herbs. Women carried these around to hide their body odor, says medium.com. During the 18th century, many satchels were made from leather, and were black or brown. 19th century Handbags during the 1900’s were used by men to carry luggage. The bag was plain and only used for practical purposes. As time went on, new and more complicated designs were made for women. These had many pockets and fasteners. Informationng.com mentions one outrageous fashion trend in the 1920’s. During this time lighter clothing with differing hemlines came into style. Whether or not a purse matched a woman’s outfit was unimportant because of her constant companion, a doll dressed just like her, was all the style! During the 1960’s and 70’s bills and coins were used for payments. Purses came with metallic fasteners and many compartments, which helped women find their money easier. Leather really took off at this time because of its durability and pleasant look, says medium.com. After Europe introduced the first bank card in 1987 the look of purses began to morph into what we know now. Present-day Purses In the early 20th century, clothes became lighter, and bags became less about practicality and more about aesthetics. They became a means to express individuality and it was important they matched women’s outfits. 21st-century purses come with credit card holders, vanity mirrors, and phone holders. Most women own at least two purses; one for daily needs and a smaller coin purse for fun nights out, according to medium.com. Far from the black and brown purses of the past, handbags come in a variety of bright colors, designs, and fabrics. As the world shifts to a digital landscape, purses are now coming with RFID protection to secure information on chip-enabled cards, notes medium.com. And innovation just keeps innovating. Bigthink discusses the ways wearable technology has transformed purses. There are now bags available that can change colors using smartphones and ""app-enabled"" technology. These same purses charge cell phones so busy women can stay connected! What will come next?"
8,How to wear hair extensions,shopping," Hair extensions are something I never thought I would need, ever. That is until I decided to go from long dark brown hair to platinum blonde. After colouring my hair, it felt completely dead and the only thing I could do to resolve the issue was to cut it off. ""Your hair will grow back and you can always get extensions"" my hairdresser told me. After 10 minutes of convincing, I agreed to let her cut my hair past my shoulders. I am completely in love with this new style however, with a few weddings coming up, I am missing my long hair. I have never needed to wear hair extensions before and had no idea what I needed to be looking for. After extensive research and 3 hairdressers later, I finally found the perfect hair extensions for me and finally figured out how to wear them. There a few things I wish I knew first! Types of hair extensions: The first decision I was facing was what type of hair extensions I want to wear. There are a number of extension types which include, clip-ins, beaded, tape and glued. Not really knowing the difference I was forced to research the best types for my hair. Clip-in – These are great because you have the option to do them at home and can take them out after your night out. You may need to watch some YouTube tutorials to get them in and how to get them to sit nicely. Taped – Tape in extensions last around 6 weeks if cared for properly. They are pretty good if you regret your hair cut decision. You can attempt to do it at home but I would recommend getting a hairdresser to do it for you. Glued – Gluing can be a little messy but is relatively fast and lasts around 6-8 weeks. It will need to be done by a professional and can become a little costly. Beaded – This is another great solution to the hair extension crisis. This gets attached near the roots and grows with your hair. The beads get clipped in by a professional and sealed in place. Weaved – Getting your hair weaved is a nice solution to getting your hair extensions put it. Your hairdresser will weave it in like a braid to your hair. It can hurt a little according to online articles but lasts a long time. You will need to have it redone once the weave grows to far down with your hair. Having it done depends on how fast your hair grows. Blending your extensions: Most importantly, make sure you blend your hair extensions. It may be as simple as getting the extensions cut to the length you want and making sure it is styled to your hair. Sometimes you may find that you will need to dye the extensions too. For this, make sure you order real Remy human hair extensions so that way they can be coloured. My Dollywood extensions were a little more yellow than my now hair colour so I had to bleach them and add a toner. Most of the extensions will need to be cut to size as they generally come in at around 20-22inches. My hair is too short to pull this length off but it would look great if your hair is already longer. Overall I like the option to have long and short hair when I want it. I thought cutting my hair would be the end of the world but I’m actually loving the convenience of styling my hair how I want it. I was torn between clip-ins extensions and weaving. I decided to go with Clip ins, as they work best for me but I know plenty of people who swear by the other methods. Just try something that suits you and your lifestyle best and what you have time to care for.  Enjoy your long healthy hair again!"
9,How to safely buy an used phones - tutorial,shopping," Smartphones are not cheap. Depending on the model you desire, you might have to spend hundreds of dollars (even thousands, if you are particularly picky). With such high prices, it is no wonder that sometimes we find ourselves searching for a more cost-efficient way of obtaining one. One of them (pretty much the only one if you do not want to mug people) is to buy an used mobile device – you’ll always save a couple (dozen/tens/hundred) bucks, right? Of course, but remember that homo homini lupus est, so there is a chance you will get, wittingly or not, ripped off when you buy one. Even an honest seller might not inform us about the phone’s complete state simply out of ignorance. Therefore, for your convenience and happiness of my boss, I have written this here small guide on how to safely buy an used phone. Where to buy one? Well, on the Internets, of course! There is a number of online auction houses or social networks that have people trying to part with their phones to earn a buck. You an try eBay or Craigslist, but from what I have heard, Swappa is one of the most decent places to buy used items at. On Swappa, there is an option to report dishonest sellers and getting your money back through PayPal – something that not every buy/sell website offers. How to buy one? Prudently. Never pay for the phone up front. It is best to set a date and meet with the buyer in person, preferably in a public space with monitoring, like a restaurant. BEFORE paying her/him anything, we have to carefully check the device. Remember, any inconsistencies between the phone’s online description and its factual state is a good reason to thank the seller for his/her time and move along. 2.1 Compare the device’s state to the one described. Are there any cuts or cracks? Fillings or apertures left after a botched repair service? Does the seller possess the phone’s certification of purchase? Does the set include charger, headphones etc? It might be a good idea to simply power up the device and use it to make a call, to see if it properly connects with the network. 2.2 It is important to check the phone’s IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number. It can be found behind the smartphone’s battery, on the back of its cover or simply on the device’s box – you can also find it out by tapping *#06# into the device. When you have it, you can enter it to IMEI24.com and check the device’s production date and, more importantly, warranty for free. 2.3 If you REALLY want to be sure about the state of the device you are about to buy, you can have it evaluated in any of its producer’s authorized serves. It will cost around 50 dollars and will give you all the information about the phone’s software and hardware. If the seller does not want to agree on doing that, it is probably a signal that something is wrong with the device, so be wary. That is all, folks! I hope that this humble guide will help you in buying your used phones safely. Later!"
10,8 Genius Style Tips For Casual Party Dressing,shopping," Casual parties are informal parties but the dressing code needs to be suitable, realistic, and exiting. Casual parties include bachelorette bashes, bridal showers, barbecue get-togethers, re-unions, and birthday parties. It is crucial that the attire you pick keeps you comfortable throughout the event. The style you employ must reflect the timing of the party. Sophisticates, elegant, and fun casual summer dresses are suitable during daytime parties while dramatic, glamorous, and sexy silhouettes do great at night parties. Try shorts: Shorts were initially designed for iconic people who love to have fun. The different styles and length options are meant to fit into different personality styles. You can maintain a casual look in a lightweight and soft material that offers a small space at the thighs. Tight shorts with flashy embellishments should be avoided. They should also be long enough as short shorts look trashy. If you are attending the party during daytime at the beach, look for gladiator sandals. You may consider ballet flats or lace-up oxford shoes for an afternoon bash. These shoes are quite comfortable. During the night, think around boots, pumps, wedges, or ankle-strapped heels for a more feminine look. Sparkle at night: Glitz at night do justice and can take you a long way. A sequined long casual dress is best tones with a cashmere sweater. If you have a glittery top, find perfect jeans to match it. For low keys, consider soft hues. Befriend Denim: Denims are comfy and versatile. They will offer you myriad accessory options. In a casual party, nobody will question your style when you choose denim jeans. If you want that perfect chic look, put on a cropped blazer, pumps, or boots. This will have everyone turning their heads on your fierce look. To top the style up, get a bright clutch and match to the party. The commonest combination is usually the jacket-jeans style. Tailored jackets beef up day-to-day jeans. Toy can have a sexy camisole inside the denims. Long sleeve tee: T-shirts are versatile. You will find them in the gym, under dressing, in bed because their usefulness is life-long. Long sleeved tees are good to go with jeans. Dress Supremacy: At any party, you will never be offside with a dress. For any length, design, or hue, casual dresses for women are always stylish. You need a design that’s accessory-friendly, sexy, and graceful. Choose good pairing pieces like denim jacket, hat, necklace, scarf, and clutch. Almost any shoe style complements a casual dress. All black attire: This style is classic especially when it involves black pants and top. Such a slimming silhouette passes for dressy. For a luxurious look, assimilate different fabrics e.g. woolen pants and satin blouse. Flattery top: Tops are the first things that capture the attention of onlookers. If you want to create a statement, choose a slinky. Examples of sexy tops are strappy tanks and embellished blouses. A flattery top makes a plain trouser, skirt or jeans glamorous. De-fancied frock: Women must always have in their closets that favorite gown for almost any occasion. A little black dress is a good example of such an outfit. The good thing with black dress is that you can wear it repeatedly without anybody noticing as long as you use different accessories every time you have it. For instance, you can throw a casual jacket and put on heels on one occasion and then on a later date use flat shoes and sweater."

14,iPad Cases,shopping," When it comes to protecting your tablets and smartphones, there are several types of cases out there. We have silicone, jelly, plastic, leather, cloth, and even stickers/skins. Today, we would like to focus on leather cases for your iPad. What are the advantages and disadvantages of a leather iPad case? Which are the best for your iPad? Read on to find out. Advantages of leather The following are the benefits of having a genuine leather case: Luxurious look and feel – Though it may boil down to personal preference, one cannot deny that the soft, smooth feel of a leather case is a go-to and cannot be surpassed by any other material. Easy to clean – A leather case does not catch dust or linen easily as compared to other types of cases. Most of the time, you can just wipe the dust off. No need for a cleaning cloth. Minimal maintenance – Genuine leather cases are hard to scratch, and retain their soft, smooth, shiny look over several years. They are hard to tear, too. Durability/Flexibility – Leather is a very flexible material, and is very durable. The material’s flexibility also makes a leather case very easy to install without hurting your device. Disadvantages of leather Having a leather case does not come without a trade-off, some of them are the following: Leather cases are prone to cuts and scrapes when in contact with sharp objects. If unused, leather cases can attract molds and will lead to degradation. Once this happens, it may be very difficult to restore the case. Quality leather cases are expensive. Leather is not eco-friendly. Prerequisites to be in this list Though there are not many options to choose from when it comes to genuine leather cases, as most of them are only synthetic, we must mention our prerequisites for a case to be included in this list. The following may not only apply to a leather case, but to all cases in general. In other words, aside from the case’s fit and durability, these are the ""must-haves"" to make a good iPad case. We think an iPad case must be a smart case. A smart case is one that automatically puts your iPad to sleep when you close the cover, and automatically wakes your iPad up once you open the case. These smart cases are equipped with magnets in locations that match the location of the hall effect sensors (to detect the magnet) in your iPad. It simply is just hassle-free to not have to press the power button before you close the case, then have to press the home/power button when opening the case. Having a smart case eliminates all this hassle. A good iPad case should also act as an iPad stand, and offer several different angles, if possible. This makes it easier to watch movies, show presentations, and the like. Furthermore, the case must be able to retain the position of your iPad without any difficulty. I recently had an iPad case that could not do so. My case kept the iPad upright for a while, but would slide after a few minutes. Quite painfully annoying, to be honest. As this article is all about leather cases, all leather cases in this list must be of genuine leather and not synthetic leather. Without any further ado, let’s get on with it."

Here it’s important to know the type of stain you are dealing with, because each requires a different pretreatment method: •	Treat enzymatic stains with liquid detergent and Tide’s unique Zap Cap, the detergent bottle cap with special stain-removing bristles. •	Presoak grease stains with liquid detergent in warm water. •	Rinse garments affected by body-soil stains under cold water. •	Presoak and wash bleachable stains with powder detergent. •	Presoak clay or dirt stains in cold water with liquid detergent.

It makes it a lot easier taking them on and off and plus you don't have to worry about taking your boots off and on when putting the hunting bibs on. You can put the bibs on just before getting in the boat so you don't have to wear them in the vehicle and getting over heated and then getting chilled out in the boat from sweating in the car. Last but not least, picking out the right camouflage hunting bibs and having it be scent control. You don't want to buy a pair of woodland camouflage and be hunting in marsh land, you will stick out and that may scare the animals away. It is important to remain scent free when hunting, so your chances of getting your monster buck or tom are higher and other animals won't give you away. Your hunting bib needs to give you a good overall fit and to make sure that you have plenty of room for your underneath clothing. You don't want to be uncomfortable while out hunting cause you pick a pair of bibs that were to small or were your normally pant size. Also make sure to try on your hunting bibs in the store before buying them, that way it will give you a better idea if you need to go up a size or down a size."

20,What beard suits you? Should you trim or groom it!,shopping," Gone are the days when it was only burly lumberjacks that were seen sporting manly, beards. In recent times, beards have become a must-have trend among most men, and as we move into 2017, it doesn’t look like that trend’s going anywhere soon. However, growing a stylish beard requires quite a bit of dedication and upkeep, and it some cases, a huge amount of Personal Care products. Growing a beard also requires a bit of thought put into it, like, what are the latest styles and would they suit everyone? How often do you need to trim, or do you plan on grooming it? Firstly, not ever style will suit you, so when choosing a particular style, considered the shape of your face. The ideal beard should make your face appear oval shaped (considered by many to be the most proportionate face shape). Hence, if you’ve got a round or square face, a face that is equally wide as it is long, then use a beard trimmer to keep the sides down while growing the length of your beard to make your face appear longer. If your face is longer or more rectangular than it is broad, you want to keep the length short while growing out the sides to make your face appear symmetrical. In addition, avoid hard lines that end at your chin. This is a massive style no, no! Let your beard grow naturally to within an inch or two near your Adam’s apple, then trim it down to reassemble a more natural fade with your trimmer settings. Whichever style you decide to go with, always groom your beard, it’s the best way to avoid looking like a bum. Grooming your beard will take less time than shaving, but depending on your style, it can also take a bit of practice. Do try to resist over-trimming the first few days, until you know exactly how your beard is growing (check for sparse spots). New facial hair can feel like little pins poking your skin, but the irritation will subside after a week. To relieve the itching, trying brushing your beard hairs and use a beard oil to soften the hair (your girlfriend will thank you for it!). Not only do beard oils and balms, soften and add shine to beard hair, but they also take care of your skin, leaving it moisturized. Keep in mind, your beard hair is just that, HAIR! It needs to be washed and kept clean or dirt will get trapped in the growth. Trying using a mild shampoo and conditioner on your beard, or invest a snazzy beard cleansing shampoo. Either way, keep that beard neat and clean for maximum style points."

2,Choosing the right projector to suit your needs,shopping," Picking out good quality products is a taste that is acquired over a period of time... Always test the waters before you get into something. The same stands true while choosing the right projector. The reason for hiring a projector could be many. It could be a •	Corporate event •	Social gathering •	Sports event •	Training •	Launches •	Watching movies •	classrooms But identifying the right projector to suit your needs is of utmost importance. Depending on the requirement you need to choose the best suited projector. This brings up the question basically what is a projector? A projector is an instrument that accepts the signal and converts into light and that image is projected on a flat surface. Projectors are categorized into different kinds based on the light it outputs. The brighter the projector is, the high is the ANSI lumen rating. How to choose a right projector? •	If the room is bright, then brighter you need the projector as well. •	If the screen size is huge, then the brightness level of the projector also should be more. •	Presentations need brighter projectors •	Movies and videos need lower brightness as they will be displayed in darker surroundings Types of Projectors We can broadly classify the projectors into three kinds based on the size- the portable, standard and the theatre models. Based on the room size the projector model needs to be identified. Portable projectors are the ones as the name suggests ideal for travelling purposes as they might weigh as low as 3 lbs. They are ideal for classrooms and meeting rooms. Standard projectors are ideal for office purposes and ideal for audience size of 50 people. Theatre model projector as the name suggests ideal for movies and when larger audience is targeted. LCD, LED and DLP Technology Based on the technology used in the projectors they can be classified into two types, transmissive or reflective. LCD model projector allows the light passed through the LCD panels without bouncing them back, hence it follows the transmissive technology. LCD projectors are more established than the film projectors and are less expensive, however high maintenance can be expected as the dust particles interfere with the image quality. The DLP model projector on the other hand has mirrors bouncing back the light, hence the technology used here is reflective. The biggest advantage of DLP projector is the low maintenance as dust particles cannot settle down on the chip. LED model projector is named after the light source and not on the type of technology used behind the projector model. The best advantage of the LED model projector is its longevity. The LED lamps and the projector offer a life up to 10000-20000 hours against the standard 1000 to 5000hrs. Event Size Another important aspect that needs to be covered before identifying the right projector is the size of the event, whether it is larger audience that we are targeting or smaller group. Budget Unlike all the other factors, budget is one of the most deciding factors that can help you zero down your choice based on the other requirements. Setting up a budget can simplify the matter of choosing the right projector by cutting down on the ones outside your budget and showing the options that are only meant for you. Service While selecting the right projector is a big deal, what follows next is also something that needs to be anticipated as setting up the projector is not a child’s play. For this a well established projector rental company has to be identified where the team of experts will help you in easy installation of the projectors especially when it is a larger event at hand."
3,"Preparation, is it Worth the Price",shopping," The Headline read""Man found frozen in his car. A victim of last weeks'  blizzard and subzero temperatures."" Many people would say, ""It is too expensive to buy that stuff I can’t afford it."" You are driving in a white out a snowstorm, you hit a picture perfect piece of black ice. and the next thing you know you are in the ditch a snow drift almost covering your car.

Surviving disasters requires making provisions ahead of time, a great deal of thought should be used trying to visualize the scenarios that could come up. What would we need in a particular situation food, shelter, water, heat? The time for decisions is not when disaster strikes but in the weeks or months or even years before. Are you or a loved one taking maintenance medication daily. Would you be prepared for that? The human body is 60-70 percent water that is 120 pounds of water on a 200-pound man.  To keep from dehydrating a person should drink 2 gallons per day. The time for learning how to purify water is now before emergencies occur. Boiling is the standard method. Do you have a pot or the means to make a fire to boil the water? There are other ways if no fire is available: Chlorine tablets 1-2 tablets are needed for 1 gal of water, be sure to give them time to do the job of killing the bacteria, or parasites. If no tablets are available then go to your wife's laundry room and find that jug of Chlorine bleach 8-10 drops of bleach in a gallon of clear water, twice that much if it is cloudy or murky.  Then let it set for 30 minutes, give it time to work. There will be a noticeable smell of chlorine if not you might want to give it another few drops and 15 more minutes just to be extra safe. Survival kits can be acquired in many forms, food storage items, meals, fruits, powdered milk for the home or garage,  one for your vehicle, especially in winter weather conditions. Extra blankets or sleeping bags to curl up in to stay warm and dry, maybe a few candles to burn to help warm the air. One very important thing that is often overlooked in emergency preparation is physical conditioning. A strong healthy body is one of the best tools for surviving in any situation. The ability to gather wood for a fire or branches for a shelter or bed. Knowing how to utilize the tools provided in a kit or backpack is crucial to making it out alive. How much is that assurance worth? Is it worth the price of a life to not be ready for disaster when it comes?"
4,Tips for Buying an Amazing Messenger Bag,shopping," In the past, people used to prefer traditional rucksack and other types of bags. However, technology has really advanced and today, the best option to go for is the men’s leather shoulder bag. Unlike the traditional double strapped bags, this has a single strapped bag that comfortably hangs on your shoulder. Once you hang it across the chest, you will comfortably carry your textbooks, exercise books and a laptop without hassle. Men’s shoulder bags have adequate space to accommodate various commodities. They are also durable and therefore, highly reliable for both students and any other person who may have a taste for them. Do you want to buy an amazing bag? Here are a few tips to help you out. Know the intended purpose: It is usually needless to purchase a men’s shoulder bag when you are uncertain on how you are going to use it. If you do not know the exact purpose for which the bag is to be used, you will definitely end up using it inappropriately and therefore, it will have a less service time. You may want to use it for carrying your textbooks and notebooks. Moreover, you may want to comfortably carry your laptop home and therefore, this is the perfect bag to go for. For this case, you will have to make sure that it is made from leather and that it has adequate number of pockets. Choose a bag with an appropriate strap: If you are familiar with them, it means you know that shoulder bags for men have one strap that is worn across the chest while the bag hangs on the side. For some bags, the strap is adjustable while in others, it is not. You have to give preference for the former alternative since you can modify the strap’s length in accordance to your height. In this case, short people prefer shorter strap lengths. Think about the electronic gadgets: If you are planning to carry any electronic gadget such as a laptop and its accessories, then you have to make sure you go for the right size and durability of the bag. The space should be enough to allow you carry your tablet home or to school without any inconveniences. All the top quality discount men’s messenger bags will allow adequate space for your accessories. You do not have to carry your power cable in the hand as you go to school simply because the space in your shoulder bag is inadequate. Analyze the pockets and compartments: Once you have identified what the bag is being bought for, you can select the bag with the right number of compartments. Some people select bags that have less compartments and therefore, they are inconvenienced and have to leave some stuff behind. For instance, in the case of stationary, make sure there is some space for the textbook, some for notebooks and the rest for your pens and pencils. Never pay for a bag without having the compartments counted for you. You can simply ask the seller to tell you the number."
5,What is The Triangular Recycling Symbol Found at the Bottom of Plastic Products?,shopping," If you check the bottom of almost any plastic bottle or container product you will see a small number marking there inside a three-arrow triangle symbol. This number identifies what type of resin plastic material that product is made of. In 1988, the Society of the Plastics Industry (SPI) established a classification system to help consumers and recyclers in the sorting, processing and disposing of plastic materials. Each recycling number, also called SPI Code tells us the chemical make up of the product. We should not mix different types of foam together as each one needs to be recycled separately, in different machines. That is the reason why we should pay attention to that little triangular sign (the PSI Code), as it is guidance to us and to recyclers All recycling numbers inside the arrow symbol go from 1 to 7. Foam#1 is mostly bottles, water, soda and oil bottles. Those materials after recycled are used to make tote bags, carpets, fiberfill material in winter clothes and more. Foam#2 is laundry and dish detergents, soap bottles, milk and shampoo bottles, as well as grocery bags and toys. Recycled foam#2 is used to make plastic crates, plastic lumber, fences and more. Foam#3 is commonly found in plumbing pipes, shower curtains, medical tubes and seat covers. Once recycled it is used to make flooring, mobile home skirting and other industrial items. Foam#4 includes grocery and sandwich bags, wrapping films, squeezable bottles. Once recycled it is used for making garbage cans, lumber, furniture and other house items. Foam#5 is mostly Tupperware, yogurt containers, ketchup bottles, syrup bottles and prescription bottles, and plastic cap of soda bottles. After being recycled, these items are used for making ice scrapers, rakes, battery cables and other durable items. Foam#7 is any other recyclable material that is a combination of 1-6, less commonly used. For ex: baby bottles, compact discs and medical storage containers. All polystyrene based products are classified as resin plastic, also known as foam#6. It is also known by its trademark name Styrofoam, and includes a large variety of products. Here is what foam#6 includes: Foam cups and food service products Under this category we can find drinking cups, food trays and food containers. This is the material of choice for food take-out and fast food due to its lightweight, its great insulation properties being able to maintain temperatures and being an inexpensive material. Foam packing peanuts These peanuts keep shipped items from shifting or breaking. Most curbside programs will not recycle nor accept foam peanuts, but they can be reused. Foam packaging This type of Styrofoam is used for shipping electronics, furniture and any fragile material. The packaging foam offers protection and insulation. Its lightweight helps reduce shipping costs and its excellent cushioning properties result in less breakage. Foam medical coolers The EPS medical coolers are used to keep vaccines and medicines at critical temperatures when they are shipped to hospitals, clinics, medical facilities and doctor’s offices. Wine and food Coolers EPS foam#6 is also used to transport wine and food, such as fish and meat. The wine coolers for instance can carry several bottles at the same time, while offering temperature insulation as well as protecting the bottles. Foam#6 can be recycled over and over again. It can be melted, shredded or condensed. Recycling the foam will reduce its volume by more than 90% its original size. For example, imagine 40,000lbs of Styrofoam material fitting into a 48’ trailer after been recycled. But why should we recycle? Foam has real value once it has been recycled. The compacted, condensed, densified or melted foam can be further sold to other companies willing to pay well for it. They will mix the recycled foam with other materials making it a new product. For ex, it can be mixed with concrete making building blocks that are strong enough, yet cheaper than regular building blocks. They can also make a great insulation material for building and construction. It is also used for making architectural moldings, picture frames, pony packs for holding plants and more. Recycling foam is now easier than ever, with new and efficient recycling equipment. There is no need to throw away the foam in landfills, taking up so much space. By recycling Styrofoam we keep the Earth green and help the environment. We reduce the need to collect oil from the earth and we conserve the energy."

You don't want to be in all white camouflage when you are hunting in a wooden area or hunting in marsh land or you don't want to be wearing wooden camouflage when hunting in a marsh, you will stand out and you might end up not seeing or getting anything. Second, making sure you aren't over dressing or under dressing for the weather. Having a lightweight coat or jacket is perfect for early spring turkey or early bow season when the weather still has a chill but not cold enough for a heavy coat or jacket. When the weather is super cold wearing a nice heavy insulated coat or jacket helps keep you warmer and hopefully you won't have to leave the blind for being cold. Third, having a good water resistant hunting coat or jacket is very important. You don't want to be caught in a down pour and being soaked through within minutes and having to call your hunt over from being wet and cold. Also a good water resistant coat or jacket will help keep your cell phone or wallet dry if it decides to rain all of a sudden while you are on the hunt or in the fishing boat. Fourth, finding a hunting coat or jacket that is wind resistant. You don't want to be sitting in your blind and feeling the chilly breeze going up your back. Now that would have you freezing within minutes of getting into your blind and you wouldn't want to stay out hunting for very long. And your chances of getting that big buck or tom would go out the door. Having a good coat or jacket that is wind resistant is an important tool for your hunt or even on your fishing trip, to keep you on the lake longer to catch that monster fish. Fifth and last important feature when buying a hunting coat or jacket is to make sure it's breathable. Rather the hunting coat or jacket is lightweight or heavy, having a breathable coat or jacket is important. Especially when walking out to the stand in the mornings on those chilly days when you are all layered up. A nice breathable hunting coat or jacket will help you from over sweating and having to sit in your stand all sweaty and getting cold from over sweating. Even on those hot days, having a breathable hunting coat or jacket will help keep you from sweating your butt off in the blind. If you stick with these five important features when buying a hunting coat or jacket, you will for sure be able to enjoy your hunt or fishing trip even more and not have to worry about the weather. Even if it decides to change it's mind when you are already out in the blind or boat. In most cases, you will find all of the features talked about in this article all in one hunting coat or jacket."

16,Womens Wedding Rings: 15 Key Points You Must Know Before Purchasing,shopping," Womens Wedding Rings: 15 Key Points You Must Know Before Purchasing Finding the essential information you need to know in order to wisely purchase a women’s wedding ring, particularly a gold women’s wedding ring, is not easy. To start, what makes womens wedding rings actually a woman’s ring? Should the ring be white, or yellow gold, and either 14 karat or 18 karat? Plus, what about where the gold comes from? No one would want to wear a gold wedding band made from gold that funded conflict, or polluted a village’s river or entire watersheds with mercury. Here, you’ll learn the real story. This article is perhaps the most comprehensive information on choosing a gold womens wedding ring you’ll find online. We’ll cover issues you probably have not even considered, including insider information on ethics and values that many jewelers would never reveal. When you’re done reading, you’ll know the issues that will empower you to choose a women’s wedding bands that matches your real needs. We’ll start with the most basic question first: gender. Here’s what you need to know: just about every decision in choosing a womens wedding bands is subjective. The simple answer is, if a woman chooses to wear a wedding ring, then it is a womens wedding ring. It is not about money or even what precious metal you choose. It’s not about expense; it’s about meaning, today as it always has been. Six thousand years ago, the first wedding rings exchanged by couples in Egypt, were made of braided hemp. Egyptologists report than when things got bad along the Nile, such as frogs falling from the sky or nasty spousal arguments, married couples would cut their rings, smoke them and mellow out. These days, couples have other options for dealing with stress, and wedding rings are now made from a variety of metals and styles, not just braided hemp leaves. Primarily, creating a collection of mens wedding rings and wedding rings for women are based upon two issues: width and style. wedding bands for women are generally going to be narrower than a man’s ring. As women generally have smaller hands, it follows that they would have narrower widths. Generally, womens wedding rings range between 2mm and 6mm. This is not an absolute rule of course, but rather what I’ve noticed selling women’s rings for the past twenty plus years. Apart from hand size and comfort, perhaps the most important consideration in context to the width of a womens wedding band is the engagement ring. If you’re going to wear a wedding ring and engagement ring at the same time, it is important to consider, from the beginning, how they will look together. Are they going to be wide? Will the wedding ring easily spin around next to the engagement ring? Generally speaking, with most bridal ring sets, the two rings combined are preferably under a width of 8mm. Wedding rings are both intensely personal and public. Inwardly, they represent a ceremonial vow to oneself and one’s partner. Yet for many, couples unique wedding rings are also covenants within a broader community of family and friends. All wedding rings even in their shape have innate symbolism. The circle itself represents wholeness, unity and relationship within the community who are all, ""part of the circle."" There are an infinite number of womens wedding rings styles, but we can break these into two broad classifications: classic and designer. For some women, the choice for a wedding ring is simple: a classic band. There’s a good chance that your parent wore this timeless style that are always loved for their timeless simplicity. Yet, even in the traditional women’s wedding ring style range, there are many possible options. The surface of your wedding ring can be flat topped or dome topped. Widths can vary. The edges on the top surface of the ring can be rounded or squared off. Also, you can consider variations of the classic womens wedding band style by adding grooves along the edges that add a bit of designer element. No matter what classic womens wedding ring style you choose, it will be a powerful yet understated symbol of your commitment to you and your partner. Moving beyond the traditional or classic wedding band category toward the designer classification opens infinite possibilities. The surface of a womens wedding band is actually a canvas upon which a jeweler can create a design. The actual style of the wedding ring you choose can symbolize a particular quality or talismanic symbol. As for what the design is, your imagination is the only limit. But, to help get you started, we have some suggestions for you. Perhaps you and your beloved stare into the night sky and wonder, what is beyond the beyond and where am I? You are entranced by the mystery of the stars and sky. The wedding ring inspired by Van Gogh’s starry night, might be the perfect choice. Another idea: a womens wedding ring can also represent the nature of the partnership while simultaneously expressing cultural connections. With the Celtic arches wedding ring, the lines represent two paths that are woven together. The individual strands of the knots, in unity, arch up from earth to the heavens and then back down again in an endless wave of creativity, delight and (hopefully) harmony. Another option: you and your love enjoy a good frolic…along the seaside. Then, dive into this ocean of love symbolized by the wind and waves design.  You can also think about what images or designs you want and create a custom wedding ring The choice comes down to what is most important to you among a number of different factors, from style to width. There are no fixed or hard rules. For example, one of our most popular designs is the Medieval Ring, shown above, which is 11.5mm wide, inspired by curling motifs carved in stone in central Europe. Some couples do not have matching wedding bands while others do. Again, what actually matters most is what feels best to both of you. But if you do want to match, another way of doing so is with the color of the gold you choose. We’ll start with the basics: 14 or 18 Karat or Caret? The word caret originated with the ancient Greeks and is actually related to carob seeds, which are comparatively uniform in weight. ""Caret"" is a weight of measurement used for precious stones, while ""karat"" is a variation of the term caret and refers to the percentage of gold. Twenty-four ""K"" gold is pure (.999%) gold. A 14K ring is .585% gold and an 18K ring .75% gold. The balance is alloy, which we will discuss in point 10 below. Understanding these issues are important when considering womens wedding rings. Here’s a bit of inside information as to why. Most jewelers will always recommend 18K womens wedding rings because the 18K gold ring is more profitable for them. You’ll see, after reading this section, why sometimes a 14K womens wedding bands is our recommended choice, particularly in the case for white gold wedding rings. Here’s the real deal. Whether you should choose 18K or 14K depends upon personal preference, budget, the color of the gold and somewhat of your lifestyle. The advantage of an 18K yellow gold wedding rings for women is that it is more gold in color. In other words, an 18K yellow gold has an illustrious warmth and radiant beauty because it is 75% gold than a 14K ring. If you’re drawn to the color of gold, then it makes sense to have a ring with more gold content. Also, the higher karat gold in womens wedding rings has more cache, which matters to some people. Technically, ""fine"" jewelry is not 14K gold, but 18K gold and higher. A 14K gold wedding ring has less gold in it than an 18K gold wedding rings, that is true, but that actually turns out to be an advantage if you wanted a rose or white gold wedding rings. More alloy means less gold color and more room for a more intense rose or white color. Two other advantages of 14K gold wedding rings for women over 18K gold wedding rings: more alloy content means that the gold wedding ring will be more durable and less expensive. In other words, an 18K gold ring is softer than a 14K gold wedding ring because alloys are what makes the metal harder. In context to rose gold wedding rings, the choice between a 14K and 18K womens rings is a matter of preference. The main alloy is copper. A 14K gold ring will have more of a copper tone, while an 18K rose gold wedding band will have more of a ""goldish"" copper tone. Here’s another insider tip: with white gold wedding rings, the best choice is a 14K wedding ring.  It is less expensive and has more white color than 18K white gold wedding rings. There are issues with white gold wedding bands, however, that need to be considered in more detail. How white does your white gold wedding ring need to be is something of great concern to jewelers. A yellowness index as measured by a color spectrophotometer was developed by Gretag Munsel to answer just this question, shown above. The whitest metals are naturally white metals, such as platinum. As the chart shows, white gold has a relatively broad range of white, from a snowy white to a beige. White metal womens wedding rings are extremely popular, perhaps in part because they are a less expensive white metal than platinum. Before the recent popularity of palladium wedding rings, white gold was really the only white metal alternative. To make white gold wedding rings look like platinum wedding rings, jewelers came up with rhodium plating. That way, they can sell you a more costly 18K white gold wedding ring by making it look like platinum. Rhodium is a natural white metal in the platinum family and even today plating remains popular among jewelers but it is also controversial, as you’ll see in the opinions in this this article I posted several years back. The problem, undoubtedly a bonus in most jewelers’ eyes, with plating, is that it will wear off after only a few short years. So, you’ll have to go back to your jeweler. You probably do not want to fix your wedding ring periodically like a car or a lawnmower. We believe a wedding ring should be hassle free. But the question is; will your white gold wedding ring be ""white enough""? In fifteen years of selling white gold wedding bands online and in our store, both in 14K and 18K, we have never had a ring returned because it was not ""white enough"". Therefore, we always recommend white gold wedding rings with made of 14K gold over 18K. If you are highly considering white gold, however, take a look at this article which compares white metal used in wedding rings. Many jewelers will not even raise this subject, but we feel it is important to consider how a ring is made. There are two options: rings are either mass produced through machinery, or studio made by artisans, and we will cover both briefly. If you go into a big box or chain jewelry store, it is likely that you’ll see highly mass produced women’s wedding rings that are machine made. Most jewelry, not including ours, today is made through CADCAM processes through which a ring is drawn up on a computer screen, emailed to a modeling machine and reproduced through mass casting processes. The secondary method, common particularly with plain wedding bands, is die striking. One piece of steel strikes metal into a form with 50 tones of pressure to create wedding rings. Except for the material, these soullessly efficient manufacturing processes are not a lot different from how someone might create plastic cups, car parts or cheap pots and pans. Obviously, you can see my bias. But, alas! All is well, because you have a choice. There is a special alchemy that takes place between an artist, the gold and the pure blue flame. The love of craft is infused into the ring itself, which becomes a kind of…remarkable offering. Your ring can be made by someone who has dedicated their lifetime to achieve a level of mastery in their trade. For example, this Arroyo Luminoso wedding ring was created by Michelangelo Stanchi, a jeweler from a multigenerational line of jewelers from Italy, carves his rings from wax. From the wax, a mold is then created to cast his rings. From there, the stones are handset and the ring is polished to sheer perfection. Besides wax carving, some jewelers, such as those at my company, work primarily with sheet metal and wire as design elements to hand make wedding rings. We are part of a long line of a Southwestern jewelry tradition that has literally been passed down from the Spanish Conquistadors who settled in our area over five hundred years ago. Our beautiful two tone wedding rings hand made with fused sheets of yellow and white gold are extremely difficult to create. Metal is shaped, formed and soldered together seamlessly by jewelers who have spent decades mastering their craft. I also want to mention that handmade wedding rings need not be too expensive. This gold over silver flores design is a lovely womens wedding ring for $425. But where does the gold in these rings come from? This question brings us to our final, and in many regards, one of the most important considerations. With dirty gold and blood diamonds in the news over the past decade, jewelers have rushed to become more ethical in their practices. One of the main changes we are seeing is the use 100% recycled gold. Without question, using 100% recycled gold to make wedding rings is better than utilizing gold from massive industrial mining operations. Yet, creating wedding rings out of recycled gold does not reduce child slave labor, the ruining of ecosystems, or the heavy use of mercury associated with gold mining. Instead, it merely avoids these issues. There is, however, a solution: Fairtrade gold womens wedding rings. (If you want a more detailed explanation as to why Fairtrade gold is better than recycled gold, read my companion article, 15 Reasons Why You Should Buy Fair Trade Gold Jewelry Over Recycled Jewelry.) What you need to know now is that there are two types of gold mining: large-scale mines, which are about the politics of greed and small-scale mines, which are about the politics of bread. Small-scale artisan miners produce about 15% of the total world’s gold supply. Yet these miners are 90% of the worlds gold mining labor and their lives are characterized by exploitation and poverty. They mine to survive. You can support an international movement to improve the lives of these miners when you have your wedding ring made with Fairtrade gold. It is the best chance these miners have to work their way into a much better life through safe and responsible mining processes. Best of all, the entire system, from miners to jewelers, is independently audited through Fairtrade gold certification, a set of benchmarks created by Fairtrade International.  So, if you really want the symbolic meaning of your ring to match the sourcing of your wedding ring, then there is only one choice: have your wedding ring handmade with Fairtrade gold."
17,Wedding Rings For Men: 27 Key Facts You Must Know Before Purchasing,shopping," Wedding Rings For Men: 27 Key Facts You Must Know Before Purchasing You’ll probably agree, that if you’re looking for wedding rings for men, and you don’t know all that much about jewelry, it may be hard to find the information you need all in one place. Consider the issue of all the various styles. A man’s wedding ring may be the only piece of jewelry he wears. Should it be a classic and simple wedding bands for men that his father and grandfather wore, or something with a more modern design or even venturing into something with some panache? Style, metal choices, width, durability, and the cost of the ring are all important factors. Also, these days, with conflict metals, ethics should also be a basic consideration. The good news is if you’re looking for information on wedding rings for men, this is very likely the most comprehensive article you’ll be able to find. (I like to be thorough, very thorough.) You’ll get the basics and the real story, and the information you can use right now in order to make an informed purchase. Best of all, you’ll learn key facts about wedding rings for men that few other jewelers would reveal. We’ll start with the most basic question first: What Makes A Mens Wedding Ring A Mans Wedding Ring? The simple answer to this question is, if you are a man and you like the ring, then it is a mans wedding ring. The consideration men often have is, is the ring too feminine or not masculine enough? This is totally a personal preference. For example, while some men might consider this two tone wedding rings too feminine, we’ve sold this design to men over and over again.  Yet, jewelers do break out collections of wedding rings, designating some as mens rings and some as women’s rings. In the case of gender, the sort is usually based upon two criteria: width and style. The Width of Wedding Rings For Men Mens wedding bands are most often wider than wedding rings for women. Since men generally have larger hands, proportionally men want larger rings. Mens wedding rings also tend to be heavier, wider and sometimes even chunkier.  In context to width, a mens wedding band generally ranges from 5mm to 8mm wide. Typically, men do not choose under 5mm for their wedding rings with perhaps the exception of classic comfort fit wedding bands. Men do not go much over 8mm width even if they have large hands. This perimeter is not iron clad of course, but rather based upon what I’ve noticed selling rings to men over the past twenty plus years. However, there are additional outlier considerations. Mens Engagement Rings? With gender equality, both men and women are proposing to men and why not? Engagement is an important cultural tradition and an essential bridge to the lifelong commitment.  Mens engagement rings are a beautiful reminder of a man’s commitment that he can show and celebrate with his greater community. One survey revealed that 71% of men would be open to wearing an engagement ring. But, if you are going to be wearing a wedding and engagement ring together, like in bridal ring sets, then consider the width, and how it will feel to wear the two rings at the same time. The Bottom Line: The Width of Wedding Rings for Men The most importing thing to consider in context to width is what you are most comfortable with. But, the width of the ring impacts the style, design or motifs of the ring because the wider the surface of the ring, the more room there is for actual design, which brings us to our second criteria for mens wedding rings. MENS WEDDING RINGS STYLES What Are The Various Styles of Mens Wedding Rings? Wedding rings are deeply personal in what they represent. They are an outward sign of deep commitment to oneself, one partner and one’s community. Also, all wedding rings have innate symbolism. Their circular shape represents wholeness, community and unity. Style is a way in which a man can express something unique about his own individuality and partnership simultaneously. The number of different styles for mens rings is almost infinite, but we will simplify it here by breaking it down into two broad categories: classic and designer. The Classic Mens Wedding Ring For some, the wedding ring decision is easy: a classic wedding band. Chances are that your parents and grandparents wore one of the more traditional and simple wedding bands.The vast majority of men choose to go with this time-tested style because of its simplicity, elegance and ageless traditional appearance. But even within this perimeter, there are many, many variations. The top of a ring can be domed, or rounded off, as shown here. Or edges can be flat and straight, like here. Also, the inside of rings can be made comfort fit, which means that the interior of the ring is rounded off or curved, instead of flat. Basically, the convex metal and wider edges make the ring more comfortable to wear. Designer Mens Wedding Rings Every mans wedding band holds intention as a physical representation of ceremonial commitments. And it can also, in its very design, be an object of great craftsmanship and inspiration. As for what that design may be, your imagination is the only limit, but here are just a few examples. But…What Wedding Ring Does Your Partner Want? There are no rules of matching or not matching you and your partners’ wedding bands. You don’t have to match, but many couples do prefer to. What’s fun is that you don’t have to match exactly, but you can choose to match through metal choice, style, gemstones, motif or any other various ways. Many wedding rings are part of larger collections with varied widths, from narrow to wide, such as is the case of the many styles of our river ring collection or the Wind and Waves collection. Even if you do not find an exact match, many jewelers can do variations through a custom design process, which we are particularly fond of, experienced with and have lots of fun with. METAL CHOICES FOR WEDDING RINGS FOR MEN What’s The Best Metal For A Mens Wedding Ring? Are you someone who prefers the cool tones of platinum wedding rings or the warm radiance of 18K yellow gold wedding rings? Metal and style are intimately connected to the aesthetics of your ring. The choice of what metal you opt for in your wedding ring is actually a topic of considerable complexity. 14 or 18 Karat or Caret Wedding Rings? The word, karat, derives from the word, caret. Caret first came to use in Greek-Roman society as a unit of weight related carob seeds, which are surprisingly similar. 14K Yellow Gold Wedding Rings vs. 18K Yellow Gold Wedding Rings An 18K gold mens wedding ring is .75% pure gold, while a 14K gold mens wedding ring is .585% percent pure gold. Metal alloy makes up the balance. Here’s what you need to know. Whether a 14K or 18K yellow gold mens wedding band is best for you depends upon personal preferences. Advantages of 18K Gold Wedding Bands For Men The most important quality of an 18K gold wedding ring is its high gold content. If you compare an 18K gold ring with a 14K gold ring, you’ll see that the 18K has more radiant beauty simply because it is 75% pure gold vs. .585% in a 14K ring. Higher carat gold also has more cache. Fine jewelry refers to 18K gold, not 14k. Some jewelry brands only produce in 18K as a signet of their brand value and prestige. OUR VIEW: In the case of 14K vs. 18K, unless you do abrasive activity with your hands, we recommend choosing an 18K mens wedding band. If you love the natural color of gold, the radiant warmth of 18K yellow is also an excellent choice because it has a very exquisite color and feeling tone. The additional price is worth it for a lifetime investment. WHITE METAL MENS RINGS White Metal Colors In Mens Wedding Rings These days, most couples prefer the cool contemporary tone of white metal wedding rings. But how white does this white have to be?   Currently, whiteness is scaled against a ""yellowness index"" (YID) created by Gretag Munsel, as determined by a color spectrophotometer. Yellow is expressed by a greater number, which ranges from a pure white to a white that borders with beige. Machine-Made Mens Wedding Bands Most of the mens rings made today are generated on CADCAM files, and then emailed to modeling machines which then replicates for mass production. Another method for creating commercial mens rings is dye striking. Two pieces of steel, one male and one female, brought together by using as much as fifty tons of pressure, to essentially ""strike"" a piece of metal into the desired form. Both these mass production methods create beautiful but (in our opinion) soulless rings. Final Thoughts About  Mens Wedding Rings The tradition of wearing wedding rings is six thousand years old; back when rings were made from braided reeds of grass, or help was exchanged, to represent the ever-lasting love of the couple. The finger on the left hand isn’t randomly chosen; the left handed ring finger, according to the ancient Egyptians, houses the Vena amoris, the ""vein of love"" which connects directly to the heart. There are so many different considerations when purchasing wedding rings, but there is no right or wrong decision. Like the ancient Egyptians and all the fulfilled married couples since then, it is all about connection with the heart.   Choosing a wedding ring is just an expression of that first step of a heartfelt commitment that will confidently last the rest of your lives. What’s most important is what feels right for the both of you."

2,This Is How You Spot Fake Cuban Cigars,shopping," Everyone knows that Cuban cigars are the most coveted cigars, renown worldwide for their smoothness and rich flavors. Indeed, Cuban cigars are so prized that many illegitimate dealers have been known to sell fake Cubans to unsuspecting cigar smokers. How do you tell if what you have is a fake or the real thing? First, make certain that you purchase your cigars from a legitimate dealer. Buying from your local tobacconist or a reputable mail order business can protect you from forking your money over for a box of fake cigars. If you have an opportunity to purchase a box of purported Cuban cigars, but have your doubts, take the time to examine the box before purchasing it. Here are a few tips to help you spot the fakes from the real thing. The most important thing to examine is the box. Authentic Cuban cigars will contain a green and white warranty seal on the left front side of the box. The seal will contain an insignia that has a picture of a shield and a hat. On the upper right hand corner of the box, you should find a white sticker that is placed diagonally with the word 'Habanos' printed on it. The overall appearance of the box should be neat and clean. If the box appears damaged, smudged, frayed, or marked, avoid it. If the color of the box is dull, don't buy it. Even if the cigars are the real things, their quality may have suffered in transport. If you are in the market for Cohiba, Trinidad, or Q'dorsay brand cigars, know that all authentic Cohiba's will contain the green and white warranty seal on the right hand side of the box. On the bottom of the box of cigars, you should find a heat stamp with the words 'Habanos.' The heat stamp should be impressed onto the bottom of the box. Fake Cuban cigar boxes often find other ways to imprint this label, such as using rubber stamps or paper labels. You should also find a factory code stamp at the bottom that is stamped in green, blue or black ink. This stamp will tell you when and where the cigars were rolled. If you can open the box, take the time to smell the tobacco. Cuban cigars will have a deep, rich aroma, unmistakable to dedicated cigar aficionados. If the smell is off, or very weak, chances are you do not have a box of authentic Cuban cigars in your hands. The cigars should be facing the same way, and the top row may appear slightly flattened. The caps on all the cigars should appear identical, and the foot of each cigar should be cut clean. The bands on all the cigars should also be identical, and should be arranged so that they face the same direction. If allowed, test the cigars out by pressing down on them. Feel along the entire length of each cigar, checking for soft or hard spots. The cigars should feel firm yet pliable."

4,What are the benefits of buying fishing equipment online?,shopping," With the recent boom in ""online only"" retail businesses we as consumers are now spoilt for choice, we can go online 24/7 and order things from all over the world and get them shipped directly to our doorstep and all we require is a bit of time to search a vendor and a credit card, however there are many other benefits to buying online that others miss. One such benefit is being able to view product reviews before you purchase, many traditional bricks and mortar stores would never allow such a thing to take place because it could mean lost revenue and due to the limited space within a store it would mean they could only feature the highest rated items otherwise they would risk sales, the internet has bridged this gap by offering so many products that a physical store simply can’t compete with, as a result they can allow customers a better platform to voice their opinions. Another benefit is simply ""always on"" technology that allows you to purchase any time day or night, previously this would be unthinkable because shops had dedicated opening hours and most of the time it meant that if you wanted to purchase a product you had to wait till the weekend so you could visit the shop during normal opening hours, the internet has paved the way for retailers to be open longer hours in a response to consumer demand. Perhaps the biggest benefit that has been seen in the online retailing space is the ability to buy fishing equipment from a wide range of brands, traditionally when you visited a fishing supply store you only had a limited amount of selection to choose from, this meant that you had to be within a certain price bracket or just select from maybe 3 or 4 brand names, obviously most stores in order to maximise profitability would normally only sell higher end products or well known brand names, internet retailing offers you a massive selection of brand names and price points to choose from so you can be certain to find something. Another hidden benefit of buying online is of course just how easy it is to compare prices between retailers, fishing equipment is a fairly popular marketplace online and as a result you will find many price comparison engines will allow you to search for this equipment and compare prices online, back before the internet became popular this would mean spending countless hours going in between shops trying to find the best prices, now you can do it in a few minutes with a click of a mouse which means you can potentially splash out a little extra for your next fishing trip without having to break the bank."

Below you will discover more information that will help you purchase the best pair of nursing shoes. Small Shoe Shops While many consumers will head to a major department store or mall to purchase a pair of shoes, this can genuinely be a mistake. Most often than not, these stores are always jammed packed and getting a representative to serve you will be difficult. This will only encourage you to purchase the first pair of shoes that comes your way. Small shoe shops are less frequented, so they will offer you superior service. These individuals normally know shoes better than others, because they have most likely been in the business for a long time. The employees will also be more informed on shoe brands and know exactly how to serve you. Going for a Spin Never walk out of a shoe department or store with a new pair of shoes, without trying them on first. Put them on and walk around the store, just to see how comfortable they are and how well they fit. Many consumers will just purchase a pair of shoes, because they do not want the hassle of trying them on, this is a huge mistake. No Assumptions Just because you have been wearing size 8 your entire life will not mean that any size 8 shoe will fit your feet. Each brand will vary in size, even if it is only a 1/8 of an inch. This small variance can cause the shoe to be too tight or lose. Try the shoe and never assume that they fit, because you do not want to have to return them to the store later on down the road. Magical Features There have been many shoe manufacturers that swear their shoes are embedded with magical features. Do you remember the brand that promised to help women lose weight? Well, that did not turn out very well, but it did end in a massive lawsuit that ruled on the consumer’s side. Conclusion Take your time, when shopping for a new pair of shoes.

16,6 Things You Need to Know Prior to Purchasing an Inkjet Roll Label Printer,shopping," Who would you recommend purchasing an Inkjet Roll Label Printer from?  Offering labels online as a manufacturer of Inkjet Roll Labels, I am often asked this question by potential customers.  As much as I would like to give a direct response like, ""Brand XYZ is by far the best roll inkjet printer any company could purchase"", I would be providing the customer no beneficial information.  For purposes of this discussion, CMYK or full-color printing is the focus. Any will print black only but there may be less costly machines (i.e. thermal transfer, monochrome laser, etc.) to operate and perform printing in black or single colors at lower resolutions. In order to choose the best Inkjet Roll Label printer, you should start by asking yourself (or printing staff) the following questions: •	Practically all printers print a crisp, sharp image, but what about durability of print? •	How many labels a day do you intend to print? •	What label size(s) will you need printed? •	Do the labels need lamination? •	Do you need a label re-winder? •	What is my budget for a printer? Print sharpness and durability? Basically you need to ask yourself what the end use of the labels you will be printing need to be.  How crisp an image comes out is determined by the DPI (Dots Per Inch) of the graphic image and the DPI print capability of the printer.  Most print at least 1200 x 1600 DPI. Most print a pretty robust image color-wise.  The label face material will determine gloss or matte.  Printers have dye or pigment based inks. Nowadays both give good color and print well on inkjet coated materials. Photo quality printers use the highest quality inks for durability, fade and water resistance.  Print quality on other printers today is very close, if not equal to, photo quality printers sharpness but do not generally have the same durability. Photo inks are generally more expensive and, if not truly needed for your application, would be overkill for many of the end uses for labels. How many labels a day do you intend to print? No one likes to wait, and that is probably one of the reasons that you want to purchase an On Demand printer.  If you are doing smaller runs of 50 to 100 labels at a time, printer cost over speed may be the more important factor for you.   But if you are looking to do more like 500-1000 and up, on a regular basis, and have 10 different sku’s per run, then speed of printing could be a major issue. Inkjet Roll Printer speeds vary significantly from printer to printer.   Many printers have adjustable speed settings usually rated in IPS (Inch Per Second).  You will see speeds from about 1 IPS for Max Color mode up to 12 IPS (presently the fastest speed available for ""desktop"" printers).  If you have a product line holding for labels, speed is what you need. What are the sizes of the labels that need to be printed? I mention that you need to know the sizes of the labels you will be printing for two reasons.  The bigger (wider) the label, the slower your print speed will be on certain printers, no matter if you are using full color or just black.  Newer memjet technology uses a wide head technology so label print speed is unaffected by label width. The second reason is that all inkjet roll printers have a minimum and, of course, maximum print width requirement.  Some printers require a minimum label width as large as 2"" in order to print.  Most print label printers max out at about 8.5"".  Wider formats are available but generally these are for larger normal labels and signage.  If you know you will be using smaller labels, make sure you know the exact width size so you don’t purchase a machine that you later find out will not work for your sizes.  Smaller sizes can be printed but generally would need to be customized running multiples across and use a black bar pre-printed by the label manufacturer on liner/backer for sensor to ""pick-up"" where it needs to print. Most accurate print register to label is done using ""gap"" sensing. Printer literally reads the gap or black bar (on back of liner) and ""sees"" the next label, telling it to print or not. Roll fed label printers generally come with both sensing capabilities as well as a continuous mode (cutter needed most likely). Do the labels need to be laminated? The end use of your labels also needs to be considered.  If you will be placing the labels on products that will get wet, be handled with wet hands or if they need to be exterior grade, you will need an inline or offline laminating stage.  Not only will laminating a label ensure that the ink will stay put, and keep the ink from fading as quickly, it will also allow you to purchase a less expensive label material.  Purchasing a White Uncoated face stock is less expensive than a High Gloss or BOPP material but would add some durability. Of course paper labels, even laminated, are not as durable as film labels like BOPP or polyesters. The extra initial cost of a laminating unit may pay off in the long run. Do you need a label re-winder? I f you are printing large quantities at a time, you may find it beneficial to have a label re-winder so that you end up with all your labels on a roll instead of a floor full of a ribbon of labels.    Re-winders can be purchased and used inline with the printer to roll the labels up as they are being printed. If you are using a label applicator, labels finished in roll-form is a must. What is my budget for a printer? Finally and most importantly, you will need to consider the overall cost of the printer.  Roll inkjet printers range from around $1000 to over $50,000 depending on options.  Choose one with the options that lower your finishing cost on an overall basis. By asking yourself all the questions above, you should be able to narrow your search down to a reasonable range."

18,What is a mod and what are the differences between mechanical and voltage/wattage variable mods?,shopping," People who are accustomed to electronic cigarettes visit our on-line store regularly to find something new, something better, something that can be customized and bring a new breakthrough to their experience of smoking with electronic cigarettes. These users constitute the market niche that e-cigarette mods are geared for. What is a MOD? A ""mod"" is a modular device comprised of two or more parts which screw  together to house the battery or some other component. This modular design allows users to replace only specific parts of the device instead of buying a whole new e-cigarette in case of malfunction or extreme wear. This entails a longer life span for the modular e-cigarette, the ability to modify its aesthetic appearance and substantial money savings to smokers. There are typically two types of mods:  regulated devices which are also known as variable voltage/variable  wattage (VV/VW) and mechanical. Mechanical mods Mechanical mods are nothing but e-cigarettes devoid of any regulators, chips or any type of electronic switches. As the name implies, they work only through purely mechanical means which are managed by the energy provided by a pre-installed battery. Mechanical mods are generally precision-engineered and manufactured from scratch with durable materials such as stainless steel, copper, bronze, or even a combination of these metals in some cases. The use of these materials combined with proper maintenance and care lends these devices improved durability, which can actually last a whole lifetime. This also means that they're bigger and heavier than other types of e-cigarette, although this may actually be an appealing quality for users who prize a more ""analog"" feel on their e-cigarettes. Indeed, mechanical mods carry an extra load of luxury and prestige compared to other e-cig types, and are generally the most expensive category. In the e-cig industry, mechanical mods occupy an equivalent category to that of ultra-expensive and exotic tube amplifiers for audiophiles in the audio world. The finest of the finest products. When combined with the perfect atomizer they produce large amounts of ravishing vapor. Mechanical mods are often designed to resemble anything but cigarettes. Unsurprisingly, these products have been in great demand. Voltage/wattage variable mods The V/W variable mods are technically advanced electronic cigarettes. The main highlights of these e-cigarettes are their enhanced ability to control the vapor's flavor, the e-juice burn and the built-in protection systems. Some of these mods are pre-installed, or can be fitted, with an atomizer meter which helps to automatically adjust the voltage/watt system for improved performance. This versatile type of electronic cigarette offers the best performance on the market, and is suitable to both new and very experienced e-cigarette smokers. Inherently appealing to the geekier user profile, these electronic  cigarettes come with many features and technologies such as built-in  firmware and an LCD screen that lets you see the battery charge, for  example. The LCD screen displays a few statistics like the  number of times that the smoker vaporized, the voltage level or the  watts used. Many of these electronic cigarettes also have the possibility to connect to a computer via USB, upon which users can browse  every detail of the usage statistical history. In fact, it is not uncommon for V/W variable mods to  actually resemble USB sticks."

1,7 Things to Know Before Going for Hair Extension Courses,shopping," If you are in a way of attending the Hair Extension trainings or course, then there are some vital facts that should be known before starting with them. Knowing these can help to let you see a significant change in your Hair Extension for sure. How is the training center? Before deciding where to go for learning hair extensions, you should primarily short list some good classes offering it. After shortlisting the training centers, be sure to choose the one who has good expertise and experience in this, and earning money is not the only motto of them. And, also be sure to see whether the training center is approved one or not. How long the training will take place? Before pursuing the classes from such institutes you should be aware of the actual duration these classes will take. There are some classes who takes only few days to complete the hair extension training, while the other takes weeks. So, know it and schedule your time accordingly. How is the Trainer? Before attending classes, know whether your trainer is a qualified one or not. It is the trainer only who is responsible for your successful completion of the training. How many students per class? There are a few organizations that may provide the private courses, where only a single person is trained at a time. You are going to be the only one in class who will be will taught about the extensions by the coach. But, in case you believe you are not going to lose your focus even in the existence of other people, then you can prefer attending the course in combined classes. But, you must ensure that you just do that before the start of your Hair Extension Courses. What tools will be used? Hair extension is one of such courses that can’t be learnt and completed without the practical knowledge. So, if you are going through the practical training during the classes, then you should be well familiar with the tools that are going to be involved during the training. Some of the most widely used tools for hair extensions are mannequin heads, clips, etc. Is there any exam to pass? There are many institutes where giving theoretical or practical examination is essential to get certified in the hair extension course. It’ll act as a proof that you had successfully taken this course and is certified. Thus, you have to prepare for such examinations, and also for the successful completion of training. Will there be any live projects? Know whether the training center is providing you the facility to work on some good live projects or not. Because practical knowledge is very important to get perfect to something."
2,Shopping for a Cordless Handheld Vacuum,shopping," Usually, the first thing people take into consideration when choosing a cordless handheld vacuum is the way it looks. Before paying for a hand vacuum, customers spend some time experimenting with the models displayed at the store, picking each one up to make sure the handle is in the right place and the product as a whole is ergonomic. What the customers are even more interested in is the mouth part of the vacuum and whether it has a brush to collect dirt. They also like it if the unit is shaped to fit the corners so that it can clean those difficult spots. The shape and design of a product is a plus, of course. However, there are far more important features you need to look for if you want a good handheld vacuum that will let you down when you need its service. The most important piece of data you want to know about your prospective vacuum cleaner and what the manufacturers are least willing to tell you is the suction power. Conventional corded vacuums that take energy from an electric socket are rated based on their kW power, that is the amount of electric energy they consume every second. Buying battery powered vacuums is a different story. They could also have a kW rating but for some reason, there seems to be a consensus in the appliances industry that cordless appliances should not get a kW rating. That is why we are left with cubic feet per second or cfm when it comes to cordless handheld vacuums. As anyone with some physics knowledge would have guessed, cfm tells  the volume of air sucked every second by the unit and this is really an objective and useful gauge of a cordless vacuum cleaner's performance. If a handheld vacuum has ridiculously low cfm rating, its smooth and ergonomic design is going to do little good. Interestingly, for some cordless products in the market, no data is available on the suction. With no objective information about the performance of a vacuum, purchasing it is a risky choice. That is why you should search for the cfm data on each cordless handheld vacuum and then compare them to get the one the right one."
3,Do Not Be a Prom Dress Disaster,shopping," If you are a woman, you would understand when I say ""The Dress have the Power to make or break"". Every significant event in a woman's life is marked by the dress that went along with it. Woman around the world have closets full of these dresses they just cannot part with. The Prom! Probably one of the occasions in a woman's life where the dress must be perfect. It's an event that's enough to send many a teenage girl into alternating bouts of excited raptures and blind panic, with the latter owing to the pressure of doing everything - from picking the most divine of party dresses, to settling on one of a myriad of prom hairstyles - right. In fact, for some, deciding on a prom dress is a lot more stressful than making it to graduation! Well, if you're already starting to panic about prom night this early, fear not. Take heed of the following nifty tips, and you might just find your stress levels alleviated considerably: Be early. Start shopping early, do not wait until the last moment, you know something will happen sooner or later, so have some ideas ready before the occasion presents itself. The prom is no different. By the time prom season rolls around, girls find themselves panic buying and drowning in a sea of red elegant sequin prom dresses. It's always best to avoid the rush. Start looking around for a prom dress at least 4 months before the event, take your sweet time, and don't settle for the first half-decent frock you can find. Be inspired. With so many styles available and even more trends that come and go, deciding on a prom dress can be harder than picking a college; hence, why you should look for inspiration wherever you can find it. Of course, celebrity-inspired designer dresses are the most logical choice, so keep an eye out for red carpet events in magazine spreads, fashion websites, and the entertainment channels on TV. Who knows? You might find yourself donning a glamour dress in the style of Kate Middleton, or a Carrie Bradshaw-ish Sex and the City style number come prom night. Be open-minded. Just because you don't like how a dress looks on the mannequin or a hanger, doesn't mean it's not the dress for you. When shopping for prom dresses, it's always best to keep an open mind. Try on the dresses that you like and a few of the ones that you don't. You might be pleasantly surprised to find that a seemingly forlorn-looking frock on a hanger looks absolutely divine on you. Be realistic. Be aware that not everybody is built like Halle Berry, so do take stock of your figure before you choose cute cheap short prom dresses under 150. You have to accept that you can't dress in the style of Vanessa Williams if you're about 3 feet tall, nor will you look good in a chiffon dress with flower embellishment if you have bigger thighs and arms. You might be partial to cocktail dresses, but you may look better in full-length pageant dresses (or vice versa), so don't be stubborn. Take your size and shape into consideration, if you do, you can't go wrong. Be different. Ignore the trends. Come Prom night, many girls just copy their summer dresses. Well, unless you're hell bent on being another pea from the pod, you obviously want to don a prom dress that you can be proud of calling your own and yours alone. With that in mind, why not go beyond the conventional prom dress and opt for something more adventurous, like a checkered black and white party dress, for instance? Better yet, why not hire a seamstress who can make a one-of-a-kind gown for you? Your dress will have you written in every seam, every section and every color. If that is not enough, you know it will fit you perfectly. Article Source:http://www.gbridal.com/special-occasion-dresses/prom-dresses.html"

6,Please Do Not Buy Another Uncreative Mother's Day Gift!,shopping," Many moms won't admit to this, but they are typically quite a bit disappointed with the Mother's Day gifts they receive. Don't get me wrong, most mothers will be quite happy to receive their presents, and they will be incredibly grateful for them, but they can see how little thought goes into them. Most moms are given gifts like delicious chocolates, sweets, or flowers. If they are blessed they may receive a card, a basket, or various fine jewelry. I have this hypothesis that the older we get, the more we shell out on our Mother's Day gifts, but the less time and effort goes into the present! But your mother doesn't want you to squander cash on her gift! Surely, she'll be considerably happier receiving a present, compared to receiving absolutely nothing whatsoever, but your mother will be a lot more thrilled by a gift that takes some of your time, instead of your cash. Try asking your mom what was her best loved Mother's Day present of all time. I'll wager it's a little something you made when you were a child. Maybe an outrageous looking card, or a piece of art, but it will be some type of craft that you made. Don't be surprised if she cherished it, and still has it in her closet or drawers someplace! Well, why not come up with something for a Mother's Day present this year? You don't need to be a kid to produce Mother's Day crafts. And you do not actually have to be that creative or crafty either. There are many items you can make that will look great, but won't be challenging to make. There are tons of different Mother's Day crafts, but possibly among the simplest items to make would be your own Mother's Day card. If you're good at sketching, or handy with graphical software on the home computer, why not make your own card? Your mother will certainly love you for it! Are you good at scrapbooking? If so, then how about doing some scrapbooking, and creating your mother her own custom made scrap book for Mother's Day? There are lots of things you might scrapbook on, from events in the past year, a summary of your mom's life up to this point in time, or a scrapbook of the entire family. I guarantee this will go down a treat! Yet another thing you could do is make arrangements. For next Mother's Day, I am making some truly cute looking candy bouquets. They set you back practically nothing to build, look terrific, and do not actually take that long either. Plus I know what sweets my mom really likes, so I know she'll enjoy pulling off bits to eat! The important thing is to just think of some craft that you're handy at and give it a go. Trust me when I say that your mother will appreciate Mother's Day crafts you have made, MUCH more than yet another insipid Mother's Day present!"
7,Express your self with fashion,shopping," The word ""fashion"" comes from the Latin ""modus"" which means ""way measure"" and, apart from the sense that refers to the way of dressing, one of the definitions given by the dictionary Le Petit Robert ""collective tastes, ways of living, feeling that appear fashionable at a given time in a given society"" France is the place where high fashion was born; as in Paris, one of the largest cities in the world, it has acquired, rightly, the title of fashion capital and is perhaps the most important. Although people have been interested in clothing and fashion for thousands of years, the industry has begun to take shape to années1850. Before 1850, about 70% of the clothes were sewn by hand, even those wearing them. Since their inception until now, the clothes have gradually changed their goals arriving today to exclusive concept of being fashionable. Most often, the fashion is directed to people who need a strong personality to highlight the elegance. In a world where appearance is very important, you have to adapt and keep his personality, without departing from what we really are. This is the biggest fashion influence that someone would be proud to own. Later, at the end of the twentieth century, clothing and purchase become collective passion even children learn the name of Gautier, Dior and Chanel. They also know the most important fashion houses like Lanvin, Dior, Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel, Louis Vuitton Malletier, etc. Fashion, style of dress, in all its aspects, is a non-verbal mode of expressing our feelings, our world view, as to make known indirectly our social position, our financial strength and our preferences. The mode means beauty, good taste, and means of communication, integration and group membership. Be fashionable suppose the help of several elements and factors that have the role to identify both advantages and disadvantages. Among the advantages, we would rather stress a consequence someone who is fashion shows that he has enough money to be interested in the latest trends and to buy clothes that allow him to leave the ranks, to win in front of others. Indeed, there is a strong link between financial power, the opportunity to purchase the desired clothing and personal happiness, comfort and opportunities of a person who is much attached to fashion. These are the French ones that give attention to accessories signed by famous fashion designers, and of course, they happen in this stage when they have a good financial level, but also when they have more time to worry about that kind of things. On the other hand, a person who is fashionable is an active person, attractive, informed, who knows the various circles and makes contact with many people. It must always keep pace with the latest trends. In this context, we understand fashion as a contributing factor and that helps a person to fit into a group or a team and identify with, without making a rule. However, we consider that the arguments against fashion are more numerous. First, in order to be fashionable we must have money to buy clothes and anything derived from it. Not all of the necessary financial resources to afford such an investment that prove sometimes a luxury. From this point of view, purchase products that are fashionable, do not automatically mean that they are the most appropriate for each type of physique, personality, occasion. If we talk about style, we think it is important to see how women differentiate between the different ways of dressing, depending on the situation. A plus for them is that they make a clear difference between the office clothes, street and used. At the office, they are quite discreet, they prefer luxury suits, sophisticated accessories, but without exaggeration. Regarding the outfits evening or those used, they prefer instead to invest in brands. Therefore, avoid buying an item just because it is fashionable, without considering other aspects: we are okay. On the other hand, there are people who want to keep pace with fashion to make up a few and obvious defects in respect of studies, the chosen career, social involvement. In this context, fashion plays a negative role, it deceives us, and it’s almost a vice, the same disease for people who see it as a way to escape the vicissitudes of life. Sometimes we feel inferior to others and this because of the stars that appear to be perfect and also because the models promoted by television and magazines are false. We would like to emphasize that the expression be fashionable has several meanings: it's not just clothing and ready to wear, shoes and accessories of all kinds that beautify our appearance, but also trends, manners, existing currents at some point in the context of a society, which are adopted by a lot of people just to be modern and attractive.

9,That 70's Revival,shopping," The comforting thing about fashion is that it often repeats itself. As much as we enjoy the innovation of forward thinking designers, it is always a pleasure to see the return of certain beloved fashion trends.  (However, some should be left in the past.  Stay away 1980s shoulder pads.)  For 2015, fashion lovers can expect to see a revival of the 70’s within women’s fashion. Prints and more prints With a 1970s inspired look, colorful and fun prints are one of the most important elements.  For those of you normally hiding behind a monochromatic palette, this is your opportunity to branch out.    Pair a daring print with an Earth tone.   Still nervous about wearing a bold design? Wear a fun scarf or accessory to add a little pop. Own your flare When people think back to this decade, there is one memorable trend that stands out – the flare.   Now, don’t worry.  Many of today’s flares are not equivocal to the ones found in humiliating, vintage pictures or your old Halloween hippy costume.  The subdued flare or boot cut pant can be worn at home or to the office. They are quite flattering and work well with a feminine, fitted blouse. A high-tapered waist creates a pretty silhouette, which can be more forgiving than the ever popular ‘skinny’. Pump it up! Platforms are back.   To be honest, they never truly left.  With each season, there typically seems to be some version of this elevated shoe.  In the 1970s, these heels were ideal for the popular floor-length maxi and peasant dresses.  During the winter months, you may have opted for an updated, platform boot.  Welcome the warmer weather with stylish platform sandals.  For many, the chunky heel is a much-welcomed relief from the stiletto! All that fringe Of course, suede has been making its way down the runway.   What makes it so fun? The fringe.   It’s a wonderful finishing touch to any jacket or handbag.   Designer dresses and skirts used fringe for its peek-a-boo effect.   It’s daring without being too revealing.  When purchasing a suede or leather item, it is important to take the cleaning costs into consideration.  Regular, quality maintenance is the answer in protecting your investment. Keep it Short… Or long, long LONG Welcome back micro minis.   When it comes to this skirt length (or rather lack of length), it is important to keep a few things in mind.  Is this workplace acceptable?  Can you move about without revealing too much?  When in doubt, you can opt for the mini’s cousin, the skort.  These fun, little shorts resemble micro mini skirts but allow for a bit more modesty.   If you are looking for a more professional look, you may wish to stay with last year’s maxi dresses.  They are still very ‘in’ so feel free to pick up a few more.  Maxi dresses that reach the ground are perfect – just don’t forget your favorite pair of heels. It’s OK to indulge What many loved…and still love about the 1970s is the silhouettes.  They are generally less defined and more forgiving than the form fitting garments of decades past.   Peasant dresses and blouses allow for greater comfort especially in the warmer months.  While they are elegant enough for a night out, these light and breezy pieces are also ideal for a walk in the park or a summer day picnic. As with any decade’s fashion, the trends are not meant for everyone.  Designers do their best to create stylish garments that should work with most body shapes and lifestyles.   However, fashion is simply not just about what is available.  You have to feel comfortable and confident.  To avoid wearing a ‘costume’, pair one or two trendy pieces with a more classic look.   Keep in touch with the 70s minimalist approach.  Pack away your Spanx, tone down your makeup routine and think looser silhouettes.  Sunnier days are ahead."
10,"Considering ""Cut"" in Sapphire Engagement Rings",shopping," Sapphire engagement rings are becoming more and more popular in today’s world of wedding jewellery. Stunningly beautiful, sapphire engagement rings are also different and unconventional, yet still incredibly classy in their appeal. One of the main factors to consider when choosing from the many sapphire engagement rings is the ‘cut’ of the gem, as it is this that will determine the brilliance of the stone itself. In the content of this article, the importance of cut is elaborated upon and the information given will help you make the best choice when it comes to sapphire engagement rings. The Cut The use of the term cut has several meanings when it comes to gemstones. It could describe the faceting style of a gem or indeed the finished shape of that gem, or it could refer to the gem’s proportion. The rough dimensions and the overall symmetry determine the proportion of a gem, whereas the number of facets and the size of the stone determine the finish. Cut is so important if the stone’s best qualities are to be emphasised. Sapphire engagement rings exude maximum radiance when the cut is made to perfection, but as natural sapphires are quite rare, the stone is often accepted without the precision of cut that you would see in a fine diamond, for example. Principles of Cutting When cutters work on sapphire engagement rings, these are the principles they follow: The colour of the gem must be accentuated, and as the shade of a sapphire changes depending on the angle the gem is viewed, the jeweller must confer with the client to determine the favoured shade and craft the stone with that colour being the most obvious through the stone’s crown. A cutter’s job is also to maximise the stone’s brilliance and the amount of light returned to the viewer’s eye. This influences the general hue of the stone. Cutting any stone involves removing some of the material, but a cutter will want to keep this to a minimum in order to maximise the stone’s final weight. The type of cut desired could affect this, as could the way the cut forms during the process. Inclusions are to be minimised when the cutter is working on the cut of the stone. The cutter also aims to fulfil consumer demand for different styles and shapes. Conflicts of Cutting Occasionally these guiding principles can conflict one another and for example, colour may end up being compromised by a lack of clarity in an attempt to maintain carat weight. Another conflict of interest could occur when a sapphire is not orientated for maximum colour because the potential weight loss would be too great. It really comes down to personal preference and what you desire in your final piece of jewellery. Experts will be able to advise and weigh up the trade-offs for you to help you meet the priorities you have for the design of your ring."
11,Best Mobile Phones for 2015,shopping," With the marketplace for mobile phones expanding exponentially each year, it's hard to select out a few that stand apart as special. I have actually selected out 4 from different countries. It appears many of them will be unveiled at the Mobile World Congress, this year scheduled for March 2-5, 2015 in Barcelona, Spain. Right here are several of the sharpest phones. Samsung Galaxy S6 - This Korean phone has actually created a great deal of speculation regarding the functions, both online and in the stores. Samsung has actually launched a number of various other versions recently however this one appears to be the flagship variation for 2015. There are in fact to be 2 versions - one with a metal cover and the another in plastic, super-thin with the common Samsung broad screen. You can pre-order it online or in the stores for only $800 US! Huawei Ascend D8 - The Chinese have actually produced this pretty phone with a 5.5"" display and high resolution panel, 4GB of RAM and 64GB internal storage space. The arranged launch in May and will sell for $800 US. Microsoft Lumia 1030 - This American phone has the very same 5.5"" display but with a fantastic high resolution electronic camera and 4 speakers to record and play surround sound. Sony Xperia Z4 - We couldn't complete this assessment without mentioning the Japanese who utilize their phones so regularly. Right here is exactly what Daniel P. (no last name given) published in phoneArena.com ""'Sony will pull out all stops' and intro a monster with 5.4"" QHD panel, to an info one insider sent us that says Sony will keep using 1080p display resolution, but up the chipset to Snapdragon 810.

It appears from the reviews just described that one of the most preferred phones today will have superb video cameras as well as the ability to take excellent pictures with increased storage space ability. The various other functions are yet to be revealed. Please return to this column later on this year for an update."
12,Smart Shopper Guide - Which Clothing Material Should You Buy,shopping," Do you love to shop, but dread finding the right outfit that will keep you warm during those harsh winter days and cool during summer months? Then you are not alone. In fact, many people find it hard to buy the proper clothes that would keep them warm or comfortable. Below are some of the common clothing materials that are used to make shirts and dresses and hopefully would help you the next time you shop. Fleece Fleece is commonly used to give insulation and used for jackets, sweaters, blankets, mittens and sweat shirts. Natural fleece are usually gathered from sheep and tend to be expensive. A cheaper option are synthetic fibers which are made of wood cellulose. Polyester fleece are extremely durable, moisture resistant and dries up quickly. It is the preferred fabric for people who lives in extreme weather as it keeps them warm. Cotton Cotton is the most widely used material for clothes. The fiber is harvested from the cotton plants of the Malvaceae family and are widely found in Mexico, Africa and India. Cottons are absorbent and great for corduroys, socks, t-shirts and underwear. Cotton is also perfect for those who have allergy or sensitivity concerns as it is a natural hypoallergenic fiber. Cotton materials are also naturally resistant to dust and very breathable making it ideal for people who have skin problems such as eczema. If you are looking for a wash and wear type, then cotton is the preferred choice of fabric. Polyester Polyester is a synthetic or manmade fiber that is cheaper, durable and has the ability to retain its shape which are highly desirable characteristics in the clothing industry. This material is commonly used for outer wear garments such as jackets, parka and sweater as it traps the air inside keeping the wearer warm during cold weather. For people who are always on the go, polyester can be machine washed, dry clean and do not require ironing as it is wrinkle resistant. Wool Wool is all-natural, organic fiber that are gathered from animal hair. Depending on what type of animal the yarn comes from, one would come across a variety of these type such as angora, alpaca, camel vicuna and cashmere. Wool are great as it is breathable, natural insulators and mold resistant. Wool clothing can be knitted, felted or crochet and care has to be given as the fabric has the tendency to shrink. These are just some of the clothing material commonly available in the market today.Hopefully, this would help you make an informed decision later and make you an informed and a smart shopper."
13,iPhone 6 Versus iPhone 6 Plus,shopping," We're always excited when the new iPhone hits the shelves, and this year, we had not one, but two new phones to check out. On one hand, it's been even more fun than usual; but on the other, deciding which phone to go with hasn't been easy for every one! So let's simplify matters, and give you the run down on what makes the iPhone 6 different from the iPhone 6 Plus. The screen Most people know that the iPhone 6 Plus boasts a much bigger screen than its little sister. While the Plus screen measures in at 5.5 inches, the regular 6 comes with 4.7 inches. What fewer people know though, is that there's also a difference in resolution. The Plus screen is fully HD, and provides 401PPI. In contrast, the iPhone 6 gives you 1334 x 750 pixels, which, when you do the maths, is equivalent to 326PPI. The higher the PPI, the higher the overall resolution. But, the truth is, unless you look at your phone through a microscope or keep your nose really close to the screen at all times, you won't notice the difference. Battery life The bigger the phone, the bigger the battery. So the 6, with its 1,810 mAh battery gives your eleven hours' worth of charge, whether you're watching videos or simply browsing. The Plus, on the other hand, is fitted with a 2,915 mAh battery, which can power video for 14 hours or browsing for 12. Of course, if you’re always in need for a fully-charged phone, there’s always a mobile powerbank to save the day. Design and weight As you'd expect, the Plus is slightly heavier. It's 7.1 millimetres thick and weighs in at 172 grams, while the 6 is 6.8 millimetres thick and weighs in at 129 grams. As far as look goes, they offer the same range of aesthetic choices, both being available in gold, light silver and dark silver, and both being of curved aluminium in design. Don’t like any of those options? Sprout has you (and your phone) covered. What's the same: performance, software and storage options When it comes to performance, software and storage options, both phones are identical. They're fitted with Apple's new amazing A8 processor and run on the fabulous iOS 8, which is a big improvement on its predecessor. Storage options include 16GB, 64GB and 128GB on both phones, but you will pay slightly more for the iPhone 6 Plus. http://www.sproutinc.com.au/News/iphone-6-versus-iphone-6-plus"
14,Health benefits of electric cigarettes,shopping," Now that electronic cigarette has earned a distinction with regard to its healthy results, people are rapidly embarking upon saying goodbye to traditional smoking while switching to healthy smoking with a fresh experience. Following are some of the amazing benefits of these cigarettes that show why electronic cigarettes must be sought after instead of traditional cigarettes. Electronic cigarette has already been introduced as a tool for smoking cessation. This electrical device aims at simulating the act of traditional smoking producing an inhaled vapor which bears the physical experience, appearance and often the same flavor of traditional cigarette. As far as its structure is concerned it is usually made up of three parts: cartridge, atomizer and battery. Cartridge is a sponge like material that helps vapor come through the solution-container; then this vapor reaches the smoker's mouth. Atomizer serves to vaporize the solutions whereas the battery contains a sensor for electronic airflow. This device does not need fire to work; instead, it uses electrically charged heat to vaporize flavor which in turn is made up of mainly propylene glycol or glycerin-based liquid solution. It is to be noted that it is free of dozens of chemicals that are highly injurious to health and often found in real cigarettes. Even the amount of nicotine present in electronic cigarette is so small that even physicians agree to its being health-friendly. Flavors mostly add taste of natural fruits and vegetables. Electronic cigarettes are rich in flavor-variation including mainly chocolate, caramel, apple, orange, water-melon, coffee, vanilla and cola. A single electronic cigarette normally provides you with a handsome amount of vapors numbering about 150-200. It means a single electronic cigarette is equal to a pack of traditional cigarettes. Hence it is more economical as compared to real cigarettes that out not only put burden on your wallet but also affect your health negatively. E-smoking is perfectly legal in all public places such as restaurants, airports, libraries and clinics locations where a smoking ban is mostly in force. Although some US states are embarking upon including electronic cigarettes in smoking bans yet the unparallel characteristics of e-smoking put a bar to such endeavors. The e-cigarettes really do not emit nasty ash, tar and odor which are essential excretions of traditional cigarettes. It is therefore you can enjoy them anywhere irrespective of the ban which is usually imposed in {public places"
15,A Nation of Virtual Shopkeepers,shopping," Google offers free tools for its users; one of the most popular is the igoogle page.

There is not much complexity involved with the service providing quick access to variety of igoogle gadgets and unlimited information from all over the web. With so many benefits out there, it becomes hard to not like the service. But, did all users find it enthralling? Not really, since the service from Google did not last for long and perished in 2013. Following the apocalypse, many loyal users of the service are finding it hard to organize their stuffs on their computer’s home page. There have been several service providers that came up with a replacement, but not all can be stated to be as effective as the premiere facility. Many have struggled to find the most prominent start page gadget organizer with little or no resemblance to the smoothness that could be gained from igoogle search."
16,Fashion in the 1970s - 1970s Vintage Clothing,shopping," When thinking of 1970’s fashion, most people will hark back to videos of Swedish superstars Abba in silk bell bottom catsuits, blue eye shadow and hot pants. In reality though, as clichéd as it may seem, these really are the styles that emanate from the decade and the ‘glam rock’ trend is one that completely sums and characterises the seventies perfectly. Disco was becoming huge and, similarly to the mod and rockers scene in the sixties, created a lifestyle along with a look. Men wore tight, low cut shirts with a chain of some sort paired with a suit that consisted of flared trousers and oversized collars. Pop stars such as Elton John ran away with the craze of larger, quirky glasses that injected even more unconventional oddity into the already out there trends of glam rock. However, it is the women’s trends that have carried through and generate a real call for vintage fundamentals in today’s times. The likes of the mini skirt, which originated in the sixties but really hit its highest peak of popularity in the seventies, hot pants, platform shoes and leotards are all still very much a part of the market and very rarely aren’t featured in fashion showcases season upon season. Although vintage is automatically linked with earlier decades, the seventies are a major player in the industry, especially for those who want a quirky piece that still runs hand in hand with the current season’s staples. The patterned shirts of the past are making a comeback and once again there is a mandate for some for the man who wishes to add a little twist to his outfit, and doesn’t want to succumb to the feminine styles employed by many men today. Jumpsuits galore, minus the bright coloured satin, can be found adorning the racks of vintage stores and create a womanly shape especially when pulled in at the waist. Predictably, miniskirts and hot pants, a must of today’s modern woman can be found in abundance for those women are brave enough to flash their pins in this country’s climate. The seventies was an era where controversy in the fashion world wasn’t a part of the climate, and fashion was there to be played with, to be fun and not taken too seriously. There wasn’t a plethora of different style changes like the sixties, it wasn’t trying to prove a point, it just was what it was. In the vintage world of today, the principle crazes will still sell and go on to prove that not every era is caked in fads. Although the silk, ridiculous glasses and dodgy dance moves are totally optional."
17,How To Wear Pashmina,shopping," A Multitude of Ways to Wear the Ultra-Versatile Pashmina If you’re choosing which Pashmina shawl to wear, would you go for a 36"" x 80"" light blue and black gradient shawl or a red embroidered Pashmina shawl? Over the years, this Nepal-born product has emerged as a favorite accessory among women from all parts of the world. But what exactly is it about Pashmina which makes it a standout among all the other materials used in making shawls? Pashmina is the name of a breed of goat that grows in the Himalayan mountains. Being at such a high altitude, they need to have that natural protection against warmth, and that is exactly what their inner coat does. The goat’s inner coat is gathered as wool, and the fibers are hand-woven into intricately-designed, beautiful, luxurious Pashmina shawls. Aside from the different colors and patterns of Pashmina shawls that you can choose from, there is also a variety of materials available. If you want the full-fledged experience of wearing a Pashmina shawl, you can choose a 100% Pashmina shawl. If it indicates in the label that the shawl is 70% Pashmina, it means that the rest of the material is made from silk fiber. It also pays to choose a Pashmina shawl that is hand-woven so that you will get that luxurious feel that this accessory is known for. Different Ways to Wear a Pashmina Yet another reason why a lot of women consider a Pashmina shawl as a must-have is the fact that there are dozens of ways that it can be worn. Take a look at the different ways that you can wear beautiful Pashmina shawls: •	In a casual knot around your neck. Be it a warm or cold month, you can wear a Pashmina shawl in a careless knot around your neck.

For a more unique look, tie the Pashmina shawl in a series of knots around your neck that resemble a chain.

18,Your Hunt for the Perfect Hunting Knife has Ended.,shopping," Your Hunt for the Perfect Hunting Knife has Ended My favorite childhood memories are no doubt those of hunting and fishing with my dad. Every summer we’d pack up the old Ford Cortina bakkie with our gear, and make the long haul to the Orange River in the Northern Cape for camping, fishing and family fun – just mom, dad, and I. We’d set up camp, get a good night’s sleep in our oversized tent, and head out every morning, bright and early in search of our daily conquest. Mom would usually stay back at the camp sunning and whatnot, as dad and I would head down to the river; canoe, poles, tackle and hunting knives in tow. I’ll never forget catching my first fish. It was a relatively small Barbel, palm-sized at best, but I was excited beyond belief. I was 8, at the time. I felt the nibble on the line and rather unskillfully reeled in what might as well have been a Great White. Once the fish was on deck, dad pulled out his favorite knife, a cammo hunting knife, and helped me cut the line. We tossed my shimmering beauty into the bucket and continued to fish for a couple more hours. Dad caught a few more Barbels and a Small Mouth Bass, but aside from my initial catch, I was fishless. After we’d had enough father/son, fun in the sun, we headed back to camp. I was brimming with excitement, and couldn’t wait to show mom my whopping monster of a fish (in my child-mind, it was nothing less than Nessie). Mom played along and acted as if it were the biggest fish she’d ever seen, never mind dad’s Bass, which was at least five times the size. Mom and dad then began building a campfire. I helped, by gathering as many dried twigs and branches as I could find. While the fire was igniting, dad taught me how to gut a fish; an exercise mom had no interest in, as she found it totally gross. Again, dad pulled out his cammo hunting knife, scaled, and then splayed open my trophy. I remember how effortlessly he’d done this, like cutting butter. I assisted in digging out the guts, which was super fun. Once the fish was clean and rinsed, mom tossed it in a skillet and cooked it over the open fire. It was the best meal I’d eaten in my entire 8 year life."
19,The Nvidia Shield Tablet,shopping," Nvidia Shield Tablet Nvidia's original shield handheld device was aimed specifically at gamers. While it served a purpose, it wasn't appealing to the masses. Things have changed with the release of Nvidia's Shield tablet. This $299 device features an 8 inch screen and the company's widely lauded Tegra K1 processor. It is no longer merely a screen for hardcore gamers. The Shield functions as a media tablet and also as a gaming device. The Shield's Computing Power The brand new Tegra K1 mobile processor is the heart of the Shield tablet. It has 102 Kepler cores, DirectX 12, Open GL and it can support the Unreal Engine 4. This means that it is on par with the capabilities of many gaming PCs. Similar computing architecture is used in the Nvidia desktop GPUs. Nvidia claims that the Shield carries the world's fastest mobile processor as the Kepler cores are paired with a 2.2 GHz quad core Cortex A15 processor. The Nvidia Shield boasts 2 GB of RAM, 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz support, 802.11a/b/g/n WiFi, GPS radio and Bluetooth 4.0 LE. All of this adds up to an incredibly fast and efficient computing experience that eclipses nearly every other Android tablet on the market. When you move between menus and programs, you'll do so with ease and fluidity. The Shield's user experience design is top notch. Apps load up in seconds and even complex games are ready in a jiffy. Battery Life The Shield's 5,300 mAh battery lasts for 9 hours even if the user is constantly operating the device. Those who use it periodically will be able to avoid recharging the device for a day and a half or longer. This isn't the best battery life among tablets but it is certainly in the top tier. How It Looks In terms of aesthetics, the Shield is monochrome with dark and light blacks that are quite glossy. It's not the most colorful tablet but it has a unique style. Its upper speaker bar is divided in half by a 5 megapixel camera. There are elongated black speakers at the bottom, edges and top of the Shield. The Nvidia Shield measures 8.8 inches in length, 5 inches in width and .35 inches in thickness. It has an 8 inch 1,920 by 1,200 display and weighs merely 13.7 ounces. The screen is quite bright and images are very sharp. There are all sorts of ports, buttons and assorted controls around the unit's perimeter, with the volume controls, a power button, a microSD slot and a stylus on the right side. The stylus has been dubbed Direct Stylus 2.0 and it works with impressive accuracy. Users can purchase a magnetic cover that folds with ease and wakes the Shield with a simple flip. The Shield's Gaming Controller There's an optional Shield wireless controller for those who want to use the device for gaming purposes. It is highly recommended in order to control games played on the Shield with precision. The controller runs an extra $60. It operates with WiFi and has very little latency. The Shield also connects to any Bluetooth gamepad, so there's more than one controller option for gamers who pick up the Nvidia Shield."
20,Titanfall for PC,shopping," Titanfall for PC A lot of games are heavily hyped by their manufacturers in order to build pre-lease buzz. Titanfall was just such a game and was touted as the crown jewel of gaming for 2014. In this review, the good, the bad, and the ugly will be discussed and evaluated. Titanfall Review: The Good The standout positive feature of Titanfall is the graphics. They are state of the art and then some. It is fair to say that the PC version of the game boasts some of the most beautiful, lifelike, and intense graphics ever seen on a PC game. This is notable in every detail but is especially spectacular in the rendering of shadows, smoke, facial detail, water effects, and fire. Gamers will have to play the title on relatively powerful computers to get these graphical goodies, but even gamers who own computers barely meeting the minimal requirements will notice some of the beauty. The gameplay in and of itself is also quite impressive. The running along walls, the variety of weaponry, and the ability to enter and control the very cool mechs are all pluses. It would have been nice, however, to at least have some kind of tutorial mode or practice arena to give new players a sense of how to play before being ""baptized by fire"" in the online arena. Titanfall Review: The Bad Bugs and connection problems have, somewhat sadly, become expected for new PC releases. Review sites are often littered with complaints over ""no server found"" messages or hacking issues. While this may be par for course these days, it still rankles many gamers. Also a big turnoff is the fact that Titanfall for the PC requires Origin to play. Titanfall Review: The Ugly The matchmaking system is easily the biggest flaw of the game. Many message boards filled with frustrated gamers emphasizes this point. In order for a good online battle, teams need to be evenly matched. Unfortunately the Titanfall system is ridiculously random, and beginning level players may end up on a team of newbies fighting against an enemy team composed entirely of top level gamers. For a game that only offers a 6v6 online battle, the matchmaking system should have been a top priority. For whatever reason, the system is unforgivably broken, and that's a shame. Rating: 6.5 This could have been much better with only minor changes. Perhaps ""Titanfall 2"" will address the problems."

1,The new razer blade pro,shopping," The Razer Blade Pro is a gorgeous laptop, with optimal ergonomics for both work and play. The graphics are crisp and clear, with a 17.3 inch screen leaving no detail left to the imagination. The feel of the keyboard is top notch, and even rivals that of a Mac. But the real gem of this machine is the Switchblade User Interface. The mouse touchpad part of the Switchblade User Interface is a multi-touch LCD track-panel, and is capable of two different modes. The first mode is for information display, and is shown in full color. The second mode serves as a multi-touch trackpad, and can be overly sensitive at times. The LCD screen is about four inches in size and has more than adequate resolution for that small a screen. It can also be customized with the user’s choice of wallpaper or background photo. The second part of the Switchblade User Interface is a group of 10 keys that are completely customizable in command and icon. Commands and icons can also be grouped into sets that can be alternated by a few swipes of the finger. This allows for a tremendous amount of personalization for the user. And this is a big plus for users who frequently play different games. The Razer Blade Pro has several positive attributes, as stated above. However, it seems that for every great feature, there is also a small failure. Even though the laptop is relatively thinner than most, at 7/8 of an inch, it’s also heavier than most, weighing in at a whopping 6.54 pounds. This is still light compared to other gaming laptops, but there are plenty of lighter laptops out there that are adequate for gaming. The thin design also contributes to quick overheating, which can send the machine to bluescreen. And while the graphics are of the highest quality, the wireless reception can be lacking, sometimes requiring an online gamer to physically plug in an Ethernet cable to prevent lag. The power cord is also made to be slim and compact, which is a big plus considering reported battery life is only two to three hours of use. While there are many pros and cons of the Razer Blade Pro laptop, as there are with any expensive computer, there is certainly enormous potential for this machine to fulfill a user’s every need. If the user is willing to make a couple sacrifices for the sake of performance, the Razer Blade Pro will perform like a champ."

11,How diamonds are formed,shopping," Diamonds have been one of the most sought after and valuable of gemstone for many years. Back when naturally mined diamonds were the only option, they were considered a great luxury and were sold for thousands of dollars. As of today, natural diamonds have some very real competition in lab created diamonds. But how exactly are diamonds created? Let’s start with natural diamonds. These are formed and found about 100 miles beneath the surface of the earth. At this depth is where carbon rich rocks are provided with adequate heat and pressure to be melted. The high temperatures are generated by the earth’s mantle, a layer made of molten rock that is compressed by the pressure of miles and miles of earth on top of it. This layer continues to churn and when the conditions are just perfect, molten rock may move upwards and cool over time. These parts of cooled molten rock may contain diamonds. Needless to say, this is a process that takes hundreds and maybe thousands of years to complete. It is common knowledge that lab diamonds don’t take nearly as much time as it takes for a natural one to form. Scientists have discovered ways to recreate the high pressures and temperatures that are needed to replicate the conditions needed for creating natural diamonds. The process of creating diamonds in a laboratory requires a mixture of carbon and graphite and a small amount of seed diamonds. This mixture is then place within a machine core that is pressurized up to 800,000 pounds per square inch at a temperature of over 1000 degrees. Once a diamond is formed, some manufacturers add a protective coating to enhance the stone’s light reflecting abilities. This protective layer is capable of hardening the diamond even further.  As it is evident, the process of creating a lab diamond is pretty much the same as that of a natural diamond – save for a few additions from different manufacturers to provide added value to their products. In some cases, these additions are unique to the specific manufacturers. This ability to control the conditions makes it easier, much more economic and far less time consuming. So far, we have discussed diamonds that can be found on earth. However, carbon, being a highly common element in the universe, diamonds may also be created in extraterrestrial environments. For instance, meteorites may contain diamonds. Meteorites are pieces of metal, rock and other elements that have entered the earth from outer space. When a meteor of considerable size enters the earth’s atmosphere, a large amount of heat is generated due to friction. In addition, the impact that is caused when they strike the earth will also create massive amounts of heat and pressure. Once again, when the conditions are just right, the crater that results from the meteor strike may contain small diamonds. In addition, diamonds may already be present on meteors and survive the impact. Of course, meteorite diamonds are even rarer than naturally created mined diamonds. It is evident that lab grown diamonds are the most viable choice for the creation of diamonds. Aside from jewelry, diamonds are used in various industrial applications. Lab grown diamonds are the preferred choice for industrial purposes but jewelry designers are also seeing a world of possibility in pieces that are designed with these comparatively affordable, conflict free diamonds that are readily available."

13,7 reasons to choose lab grown diamonds,shopping," Simulated diamonds or lab diamonds have grown in popularity over the past few years and are now, a popular alternative to natural diamonds. Due to the rarity and highly improbable conditions needed to create a natural diamond, they are naturally more sought after. But man made diamonds also have their own set of advantages that may convince you to invest in one, What a lot of people don’t realize is that natural and lab diamonds are incredibly difficult to tell apart. Since they both carry the exact same molecular structure, even highly qualified gemologists are not able to tell the difference without extensive testing. Unlike natural diamonds, chance and randomness rarely plays a part in the synthesis of lab diamonds. Due to the highly controlled production conditions, scientists are able to create diamonds that are clearer and bigger, with greater regularity. This is a given due to the fact that the production process of a man made diamond does not take millions of years like their natural counterparts. You can expect a price reduction up to 25% of a natural diamond and considering the quality of the stones, they will always make a fantastic bargain. If you do a bit of research on diamond mining, you will notice that these operations are massive in scale and often tend to leave the surrounding environment in tatters. As for artificial diamonds, they are made with a modest amount of resources and created inside laboratories with minimal or no damage to the environment. The majority of natural diamonds are mined in war ravaged parts of Africa. These diamonds often leave a trail of violence, abuse and in some cases, even civil wars. Even the diamonds from conflict free zones are extracted from the earth employing underprivileged labor and human rights violations. Lab diamonds are a subject to such controversy and are created by qualified and trained professionals and leave absolutely no doubts about their origins. White diamonds are the most difficult to grow inside a laboratory and therefore, are much more expensive than the colored versions. Lab grown blue and yellow diamonds are only about 10% of the price it would cost for their mined versions. Once again, the fact that lab grown diamonds are created in controlled conditions ensures a higher probability for clearer and larger stones. While flawless natural stones are extremely rare many manufacturers of lab diamonds have managed to refine their techniques enough to ensure flawless or near-flawless quality. In addition, some manufacturers add a special coating to prevent damage to the stone as well as to increase its ability to reflect light. Aside from flawless clarity, you can also expect for greater resistance to damage as well as a brighter sparkle. While some of you may not be convinced to consider giving your fiancé-to-be a lab grown diamond, others might find them an economical solution that can be enjoyed with a clearer conscience. There are plenty of reliable online stores that offer beautifully hand crafted lab grown diamond jewelry as well as exquisite and flawless loose stones to use on your own designs."
14,Simulated Diamonds –A Girl’s New Best Friend?,shopping," Marilyn Monroe once sang that ‘diamonds are a girl’s best friend’. Things have changed since then and nowadays, lab diamonds have been getting a great deal of attention within the past few years. In fact, one might assume that they are on the way to replace natural diamonds. As of now, they have become a popular option for engagement rings as well as various other pieces of jewelry. There are plenty of instances where some people actually choose lab diamonds instead of their naturally formed counterparts. In reality, there are many reasons to pick man made diamonds to adorn your jewelry. It takes millions of years of heat and pressure to force carbon atoms together to create the ideal crystal-like structure of a diamond. Thanks to modern technology, diamonds can now be produced within laboratories and are almost interchangeable with naturally formed diamonds. Lab diamonds that are used for creating jewelry are created using either CVD or HPHT methods. While the HPHT method involves specific types of presses to create the pressure and temperature to form a diamond, CVC (Chemical Vapor Deposition) employs a hydrocarbon gas mixture in order to grow them. In other words, all diamonds are the same no matter how they are produced. In fact, diamonds are simple chains of carbon and their atomic structure is remarkably simple. This is why they are so easy to replicate. For those who don’t find the science behind these amazing creations amazing, there is always the fact that lab diamonds are able to fool even professional grade gem dealers. Of course, these too are actual diamonds and the only difference between these and their natural counterparts is the method of formation. Needless to say, lab produced diamonds are lower in price when compared to natural diamonds. On average, you can expect a price decrease of up to twenty five percent on a lab diamond. Let’s not forget the fact that scientists are able to manipulate the production with so much accuracy that the majority of man made diamonds often obtain the highest grading on clarity. Something that a lot of people say about lab diamonds is the fact that they offer plenty of sparkle with no moral dilemmas. In case you were not aware, the mining of natural diamonds is not always a comfortable or safe employment choice. In reality, diamond mining has been the cause of massive environmental damage, extreme costs and in some cases, even political unrest. If you are concerned about making sure that your jewelry choices are conflict-free, diamonds are definitely the right choice. Lab grown diamonds are easy enough to find nowadays. In reality, there are plenty of jewelry designers who use these regularly (and in some cases, exclusively) on various types of jewelry. In an age where veganism and environmentalism are accepted as high-brow lifestyle choices, there is nothing better to adorn oneself than with conflict-free lab grown diamonds. So let’s rephrase Ms. Monroe’s song shall we? As of today’ ‘simulated diamonds definitely are a girl’s BFF’."
15,Controversial Hair Fashion - The Bob,shopping," In American culture, the most controversial hair fashion began in the the 1920s. At the center of this historical great debate in hair fashion is the hairstyle famously known as ""the bob"". This haircut was first introduced during the Great War and would go on to define and revolutionise women's haircut forever. The Beginnings In 1915, there was a castle named ""Castle Bob"". It was named after a celebrated famous ballroom dancer called Irene Bob. At the time, she styled her hair with a blunt cut that was level with the bottom of her ears around her head for convenience. Little did she expect that she would forever be associated with a revolution in 20th-century hair fashion with the rise of the famous hairstyle ""the bob"". This was the first trigger that eventually led to the short hair trend. The Change ""The bob"" was worn either with bangs or with the hair brushed off the forehead. It was a very simple look but a very different one from the traditional long feminine looks created by Gibson and Marcel. It was commonly known that when a woman had her hair cut short, she grew bolder and began to become more rebellious in what she wear and do. The free-spirited youth at that time readily accept the new look as something fresh and bold which coincides with the major change in societal norms and values during the 1920s. On May 1, 1920, F.Scott Fitzgerald’s short story ""Bernice Bobs Her Hair"" was published in the Saturday Evening Post. It was about the heroics of a young woman who submit to the barber’s shears and transform into a smooth-talking vamp. Many young women at that time regarded her as a role model and wanted to be like her. Fashion & media By 1921, the fashion and media industry began to take notice of this new hairstyle. They began to embrace ""the bob"" with fashion designer ""Coco"" Chanel and actresses Clara Bow and Louise Brooks leading the way as example. Soon, young women everywhere took the plunge and began bobbing their hair. Trends and fears Women of all ages began to soon find themselves having to face the decision on whether to follow the trend and bob their hair or remain with long hair. Many women were afraid that the long hair would quickly become popular again after they bobbed their hair. Many professional hair publications also predicted an immediate return to long hair. Women takeover It is hard to imagine but at that time, cutting-of-hair was still a male-dominated occupation. Long-lines of women were standing patiently outside barbershops waiting for their turn to be bobbed. At first, professional hairdressers refused to accept ""the bob"". However, after losing many clients and profits to barbers, many hairdressers were slowly being forced into accepting ""the bob"". With the participation of the hairdressers, more sophisticated versions of ""the bob"" were introduced with waved or shingled styles. Controversy There are many controversies surrounding ""the bob"". In New Jersey, a teacher was ordered by her Board of Education to let her hair grow. Preachers warned that ""a bobbed woman is a disgraced woman."" There are even men who divorced their wives over bobbed hair. One large department store also fired all employees wearing bobbed hair. Rise of Beauty Industry As difficult as it is to imagine, the bobbed hair fashion started or at least boosted the start of the beauty industry. From 5,000 to 21,000 hairdressing shops in 5 years, the beauty industry boomed. Bobbing also has led to the adoption of other aids to personal adornment, resulting in flourishing beauty shops everywhere."
16,Skull Airsoft Mask Can Protect Your Face At Games,shopping," Among the most popular recreational activities are airsoft games. Participants are often in the contest of eliminating their enemies with spherical guns that typically carry non-metallic pellets. These guns would formally be considered as one of the most important equipment on these games. An Army of Two Airsoft Masks Paintball BB Gun Mask is used to guard the player. Typically, these are coverings that aim to protect the face of the gamer from being hit head-on. Although the pellets are typically harmless, it can still be quite a huge element in inflicting pain or wounds to the face of an opponent. Every player should be in possession of this equipment to participate. Organizations out there encourage preventive equipment as a primary requirement. Injuries have been ordinary in the past, but with the new gun versions, velocity could turn them into deadly weapons. A BB gun mask is designed like goggles to allow the player to have a clear shot of the game. Notably, the BB guns cannot result in severe damage as long as a shot is taken from a safe distance of around ten feet away. Despite the harmlessness of this equipment, high speeds of pellets from close distances could bring about severe injuries and the face would often be the first part to be victimized.

17,Bradley Associates Madrid Local and International News: 5 Online Shopping Safety Tips,shopping," A survey conducted involving people’s reasons for finishing shopping online showed that 73% of respondents mentioned saving time as the main rationale. Online shopping can be very conveniently done with a smartphone or tablet which has made the method increasingly fast as an alternative way. One study projects e-commerce incomes grow more than twice from 2012 to 2018. Identity theft being the most common consumer for 13 consecutive years according to Federal Trade Commission, people have good reason to be wary about giving their credit card numbers, addresses, and other personal data online. With online shopping, buyers encounter risks varying from a slow-running PC to getting a computer virus to greater dangers, such as identity theft. Nevertheless, there are several measures you can take to reduce the risk. It is very vital to carefully read all the fine print connected with any purchase you make online. Take note of such things as shipping guidelines, terms and conditions as well as return policies. Several transactions are intended to renew every month, thus, charging your account every month and delivering the product on a repeated cycle. Some others, especially software and game downloads, require extra items connected to your purchase that you must actively choose not to avail of. T. O’Malley, who works in Savannah, Georgia as a computer repair professional with almost a decade of experience in that field, says he often sees buyers with PC issues due to neglecting close scrutiny of the fine print. ""Very often, people fail to read before buying,"" he says. ""They do not realize they end up allowing sellers to install toolbars and extra search engines that slow down your PC."" A McAfee publication explains how important it is to ascertain that a seller online has an encryption. A way to know a website is safe is to look for a closed lock symbol, a key symbol, or a Web address that starts with https:// rather than http://. ""Never purchase from spammers,"" McAfee advises in its publication. ""The large companies are relatively safe,"" O’Malley said. ""Amazon, for example, is not a place you can get a virus from; it is safe."" He also mentioned ""coupon printers"" that provides consumers print-out coupons using their home PC. ""They are generally only adware, and when people get infected, they do not know how to remove it,"" he says. ""Flash update viruses are likewise prevalent."" He also says that ""Majority of people cannot spot a bogus seller."" To make sure you are downloading from a source that is safe, ""go directly to Adobe for download updates,"" he said. McAfee also advises buyers to use a credit card, not a debit card or wire transfer. When you purchase using a credit card, you are legally protected against fraud, minimizing your losses. If you report a lost or stolen credit card, the law states you are not accountable for purchases you never make, and your penalty for every card stolen is just $50, which is waived by card providers. On the other hand, a debit card deal takes the money directly from your account, and recovering it in case of a fraudulent deal can be harder to do. Your accountability in terms of a debit card relies on how quickly you report the event. Likewise, wire transfers provide less protection, since the cash goes directly from your account into that of the merchant. Scrutinize carefully every receipt issued by a seller. It is good practice to keep all receipts for online deals together in a particular place so that you have a running archive of your purchases. You can use them to validate these receipts by checking your monthly credit card statement to make sure everything is as it should be. Upon arrival of the goods, inspect the contents of your packages as soon as possible. This will allow you to inform the seller quickly in case of any problem with the item or items. Internet shopping practically allows almost anyone anywhere to purchase anything from the comforts of your home. However, if you are not careful enough, you could end up being hurt in your pocket. PC viral infection can cost about $150 or so to remove while a stolen identity or money in your bank can end up costing you much more than that."
18,Eonon D5150 BMW Car DVD Review,shopping," I recently purchased a D5150 BMW Car DVD Player from Eonon from the group buy. An amazing deal considering all the features it has. Installation This car GPS was pretty straight forward for the most part. I have taken out my console and dash many times to run ipod cables and OEM AUX in, so I was pretty familiar with the procedure. The Only difficulty I found was tucking all the wires back behind the unit since there is a ton of them, but with trial and error, it all worked out in the end. I decided to take the gamble of not buying the HVAC relocation bracket and its not really necessary to my taste. It sits fine with a slight gap below but not very noticeable . Accessories I chose to add a usb in port and aux in port to play music off of/ charge my phone, so I got and Simple aux integration kit (Just an rca cable with an aux port on the other end) and a usb in port (plugs into the back of the unit) off of amazon and ran them behind my hvac, through the shifter area, and under my cupholders to the small coin tray under the console armrest and drilled a hole for them to sit in. I didnt want a backup camera because I can just turn behind me and look for traffic when backing, and I really did not want to run cables from my boot lid to the console. Features I love all of them. I tested out the NFC, USB, Aux, and bluetooth and all were great. Love the fact that you can play music through bluetooth wirelessly from your phone. Call quality is good for a remote mic, wanted to mount mine in the sunroof panel but the wire wasn't long enough to run through the headliner. I currently have the mic in the top corner of my windshield on the drivers side, picks up my voice well. It also seems as if there is some sort of a built in amp in the headunit because I can play music at higher volumes and have less distortion from my HK speakers The new revised UI is also really cool, looks more professional and less ""cheap headunit-esque"" if that makes any sense. GPS Here is where I had some issues, none were Eonon's fault. I just had incorrect file structure but I fixed it and I am running iGo 8 flawlessly. I mounted the GPS antenna on top of my dash on the passengers side and it gets greatest reception. It picked up my location in a heartbeat and route guidance and ETA is pretty accurate. Loaded all files onto an 8GB Kingston Micro SD card and I like it alot. Got the map pack for all 50 states (who knows, I may be doing a cross country road trip this summer) Originally had trouble setting the file path to locate the GPS software, but I just didn't scroll down CUSTOMER SERVICE Beyond exceptional. I had a multitude of questions before and after I bought the unit, and Carlos from Eonon always responded in a timely manor. He was very helpful, and sent me the updated software for the unit to prevent the infamous launch.exe error. So generally speaking this Car DVD GPS quite worth the money."
19,Tips To Get An Electric Shaver That's Truly Worth Your Hard Earned Dollars,shopping," The saying ""You'll obtain what you spend for"" is a well-known cliche.

20,A Big and Tall Man’s Guide to Clothing,shopping," Men who are big and tall, more so than the average man, often find it difficult to purchase clothes that fit properly and look good on them. Yet, it is not impossible to achieve a stylish look for them, a look that complements their body’s size and shape. Let us consider some ideas that should allow big and tall men to look good, feel confident, and to make their very own style statement. Bold patterns and prints on bright colors usually serve to attract attention to the body’s curves and rolls, thus making big and tall men seem larger than they are. Therefore, you should try and stick to the plainer, darker, muted, and more sophisticated colors, such as black, grey, navy, brown, and beige. Common fashion sense dictates that shirts, sweaters, and jackets with horizontal stripes make people look broader than they really are, while vertical stripes make them seem taller and slimmer. Therefore, it makes sense for big and tall men to opt for vertical stripes, as they can provide a stylish look that serves to make them seem slimmer. However, the same effect cannot be gained through wide vertical stripes, so you should choose clothes with stripes that are not too broad. Whenever possible, layer your clothes, as that can help disguise the more obvious of the body’s bulges and curves. However, the weather doesn’t always allow layering, so you should ensure that your wardrobe is stocked with big and tall apparel in the latest styles and fashion trends. You do not want to have to remove your outerwear when it’s too hot, and feel awkward or embarrassed by outdated fashion. Since it is difficult to find suitable big and tall clothes, it becomes essential that the ones you do purchase are neither too tight, nor too short, but are a perfect fit for your body. Ill-fitting clothes will not help you come across as either professional, or stylish, or even comfortable. You might even leave people with an impression that you’re careless, disorganized, untidy, or even unclean. Shorts, trousers, and sweatpants are simply too casual and unprofessional for most occasions. If you wish to look good and well dressed, opt to purchase big and tall denim jeans or cotton pants - and again, make sure that they fit both your girth and length properly. Jeans and pants can help you project a stylish look, and they’re never out of vogue. A big and tall structure does not mean that you have to make compromises with your attire. You just need to find the right brand for you, keep certain considerations in mind, and you can easily look as stylish and appropriate as you wish to be, regardless of the occasion."

1,Best Laptop Brand - Which Computer To Buy,shopping," A lot of companies have already been producing laptops of distinct styles every year. With all these notebooks, mushrooming, customers are wondering, what exactly are the best notebooks? There are a lot of what to consider before buying the best ultrabooks. The user, the processor, the memory, the business name, and especially, the pricing are some to consider. What to Think about If You Are Looking to find the best Laptop Brand When looking for the best laptops brand, it is very significant to look at the specialized details and specifications. After all you are not only purchasing the name, but the technology itself. So, for those who are a little confused on which to buy, this may assist them in their decision making. Size as well as weight There are two types of laptops. The net novels are miniature laptops and are smaller compared to regular notebook. Internet books are considerably smaller in proportion as well as lighter in fat. They have straightforward attributes and support simple programs. Most do not hold optical drives so playing a DVD has gone out of the question. You will need to buy an exterior drive. Standard notebooks are heavier compared to internet publications but are in a position to support more applications. These can be a little bulky. Battery Lifetime and Guarantee The battery life is one of the most essential things. A laptop is no-good if it can only run on battery power for half-hour. It overcomes its very function of the unit, which is portability. Constantly look for the regular battery life of a notebook. A method with at least 2 hrs of battery lifetime is a good choice. You too can purchase an additional battery for longer life. Most makers include one-year warranty for parts and fixing when you buy a best ultrabooks and you can only prolong it reviving after the contract expires. There are several other manufacturing companies, nevertheless, which do maybe not so make sure to inquire. Don't presume, Constantly ask, if in uncertainty. It's better to ask inquiries and buy what is most suitable for you, than to fake you understand and end up squandering a great amount of cash. The next item in your listing is RAM (temporary memory). Most laptops have Windows XP which wants at least 256 mb ram to operate happily. I encourage you to upgrade to 512 ram for optimal results. The more RAM you have, the better your notebook will act. It is sometimes said that increasing your RAM is the greatest and cheapest way of enhancing functionality of any computer (i.e. without altering the motherboard/cpu). One more thing to look at is the graphics memory. You can preferentially select dedicated movie memory or shared design. Dedicated memory means that your graphics card has a unique memory and does not need to ''beg'' for memory from the system memory (RAM). A rule of the thumb - committed memory = speedy operation. Gamers and DTP guys must insist on dedicated memory. Good image processors are ATI Mobility Radeon or Nvidia GeForce. The more video memory you have, the better it is. Try to get a notebook computer with at least 32 mb video memory. Most laptops use common design these days which is a price cutting measure (an instance of common structure is Intel's intense images). If you are not likely to perform serious 3D games or run heavy duty graphic programmes, common design will likely be just fine. But make certain that you have sufficient system RAM (study 512) because the video memory will steal portion of your RAM. It's extremely significant that consumers value the trade name and also the goods it provides. This unique facet often describes whether the aim of filling clients is fulfilled or not learn more."
2,Role of Jewelry in Fashion,shopping," The Role of jewelry in fashion is so important in modern world for both those who deal with the beauty products and those who buy them for their personal use. Jewelries are beauty items that have been worn since time immemorial by both the poor and the affluent. What matters is only the class which differentiates the type of jewelry in use by parties involved. These adornments are used in various places of the human body. They are used by both genders though each gender may perhaps have its own preference. Some of the decorative items used by different individuals are for instance necklaces, rings, bracelets, brooches, earrings, and hair clips, among others. A single item among these, a combination of several or all items may be used to adorn a wearer at any item. Jewelry and fashion are two distinct items but the Role of jewelry in fashion in modern society is very important. It will be hard to tell which has revolutionized the other but the role is clearly distinctive. The two are used hand in hand and fused to come up with elegant and sophisticated designs. The stiff competition between manufacturers worldwide to produce elegant designs has made the jewelry world to keep on evolving. The ready market available has also been a fueling factor of the rapid development and the numerous changes witnessed. There is also stiff competition among the users of these adoration items especially on the women side. There are different types of these adoration items that come in different fashions. Apart from being used on bodies these beauty items are being attached on the items that people wear on day to day basis such as clothes, hats, belts, bags, walking sticks, among others. This addition helps to add beauty to ordinary items that are worn making them look attractive. This in turn also adds value to them making them profitable in terms of sales. The jewelry in use may vary from one culture to another. This applies to designs and styles used to come up with such ornaments. The Role of jewelry in fashion is important in such a way that it determines what people prefer at any one time. This will be largely affected by what people see as trend in fashion. These ornamental when worn may be for a specific reason apart for adornment. They can be used to show the status of an individual in the society. This may be determined by the material properties the jewelry is made from. Other features such as design and patterns can also be used. All in all the modern ornaments can be worn in any part of the body from head to toe. They can be worn by anyone men, women, and children. Some of the ornamental items may differ greatly between the sexes especially due to the different cultures we have. Others might be similar or bear very close similarity. Women are more conscious about adornments than men. And thus most of the market is dedicated to them."
3,Amy ’s Secret For Saving Money For Her Family,shopping," Every day is a busy day for Amy. She's a one-woman army taking care of her three children, 2 boys and a daughter. But, she keeps it ""under control - I think I've mastered it a little bit - you know."" One of the things Amy is always trying to do - is save money. She has a budget and she needs to keep her family within that budget - so she can stay at home with her kids. She says, ""one of the biggest areas of concern was, where can I save money on our ordinary daily expenses so I can stay at home and we can be a one-income family.  My biggest concern has always been that we keep up with our monthly expenses."" In addition, Amy thinks about her and her husband’s retirement years.  As Amy explains, ""seems like after we paid our normal monthly expenses as well as those unplanned expenses which seem to happen every month, there just isn’t enough for savings.""  Also, there will be college expenses in the very near future for their children, and, if truth be known, Amy would love to be able to move into a home with a little more square footage. One income family, or two, we all would like to be able to save money. Of course Amy tries to save by always being on the lookout for coupons.  But we all know that coupon clipping can be very time consuming, and requires continuous management skills and planning.  And, clipping coupons alone, is not a very good plan for retirement, college expenses, a larger home, etc.  And as Amy explains, ""a lot of our frequent purchases like toiletries, cleaning supplies, laundry detergents and things like that we generally just purchase and seldom do we have the correct coupon when we need it.""  And, let’s not forget, there are seldom ""real savings"" coupons available for larger purchased items. Now, Amy was quoted earlier as saying she had ""mastered [saving money] a bit.""  In addition to clipping coupons, Amy’s family takes advantage of a money savings program where she gets paid a commission for just about every product she purchases from the same retailers she has always purchased from.  Amy explains, ""I have always been a Walmart girl.  I shop at Walmart for all our cleaning products, our bathroom products, you know just about all our frequently used household products.  But now when I buy these products from Walmart, Walmart sends me a commission check.  If I go to Walmart 5 times during the month, I will get paid 5 commissions.  And it’s not just Walmart, when I shop at Kmart, Sears, Target, or Home Depot for example, I get a commission check.  I even get paid when I shop at Dollar General Store.  In fact there are over 300 participating retailers that will send me a commission just for buying their products.""  And, as Amy explains, ""I still get my commission even when I use one of my clipped coupons."" So in addition to Amy saving money with coupons, she is now getting paid just for purchasing the same products she always purchased from the same retailers she has always purchased from. But what about larger item purchases like furniture or automobiles.  Well says Amy, ""we just had to replace our old living room set.  We went to our local furniture store and found the exact set we wanted.  We then used our money savings program to buy that exact living room set at factory direct prices. We saved over 60% off retail.  And we can now do the same for automobiles, jewelry, and other larger item purchases.  We still apply discipline in our purchases, we have to, but it’s nice knowing that when we do have to make a purchase, whether it’s big or small, we’re not paying retail anymore."""
4,Saving Big Money on Baby Necessities,shopping," There is no doubt that the first few years of a child’s life can be very expensive for a parent. Every dollar is definitely worth it, but many families may feel overwhelmed by the extra expense that a new baby can bring. Luckily, there are many ways to save on baby essentials by using coupons. Companies that sell baby products issue tons of coupons, and by using these widely, a new mom or dad can purchase everything that a baby needs at a steep discount. Disposable diapers can be a huge expense, if bought at retail price. The majority of children are in diapers for 2-3 years, luckily these coupons are plentiful. The key to using them is to wait until diapers go on sale, and then combine the coupons with the sale price. One of the best places to buy diapers at a cheap price is at drugstore, such as CVS or Walgreens, where they often offer in-store rewards on certain purchases (these vary each week). Drug stores also offer coupons, such as $4 off a $20 purchase, which can be used in conjunction with sales and manufacturer coupons. When you find a hot deal on diapers, stock up. There are usually several sales a year where jumbo packs of Pampers and Huggies can be purchased for as little as $2.75-$4.00 a pack. That is a huge savings over the regular retail price of $11-$12 per pack. Wipes go along with diapers, and most families use many of them, especially if they have more than one child. Like diapers, there are many coupons available. The coupon values usually range between $0.50 to $1.00. Many stores offer single packs of wipes (56-72 count) on sale for as little as $0.99 several times a year. If you live in an area where stores double coupons, you can stock up on free wipes. But even $0.49 for a package of wipes is a great deal. A good rule of thumb is to calculate the price per wipe; anything under $0.02 is an excellent price. If breastfeeding is not an option, you will also need to formula to feed their baby. First time parents may be shocked at how expensive formula is! One strategy to save money is to sign up for the different programs that formula companies offer. They will then send you formula checks, usually worth anywhere from $5 to $7 off a purchase. The best part is, these checks can be combined with manufacturer coupons. Formula coupons are not as abundant as diaper or wipes coupons, but they are available in the Sunday newspaper several times a year, and they are usually high value coupons (around $5). Most formula is good for at least a year on the shelf, unopened (but always check the expiration date before buying), so it is really worth stocking up on baby’s favorite brand when it is on sale, and there are coupons and formula checks available. Using this strategy, a can of formula that has a regular retail price of around $25 can be purchased for as little $9-$10. Everyone knows that a baby is expensive, but with just a little bit of time and effort it is easy to drastically cut the monthly expense of items such as diapers, wipes, and formula.  If you really want to stock up, try using a coupon clipping service, many times this can be the most cost effective way of stockpiling coupons."

This therefore means that it is only those who use versions of Bluetooth before 4.0 who must check for compatibility. In normal circumstances, sellers will provide headset specifications for Bluetooth. But if they don't, you can always inquire from them. In case you have a cell phone that supports MP3, you need to look Bluetooth microphones that have A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile) as this offers better sounding music.

It has also been the subject of immoral use and message modification. Therefore, it is important to take all the security measures to ensure that no one listens to your conversation without your knowledge.

10,Doing up the Bedroom Interiors,shopping," As the name suggests, a ‘bedroom’ is a place meant for sleeping. It is a haven for relaxation, a restful and soothing place and our very own personal little space within our home, where we can be our true selves without any inhibitions. It is a room where we can simply relax and spend some quiet time alone. Unlike olden times, when bedrooms were actually used only for sleeping, today, we use them for a variety of other things like resting, studying, watching television, listening to music, chit chatting, eating our meals, etc., apart from sleeping. A bedroom essentially is made up on a bed and some other furniture. It is usually designed depending on who the room belongs to, as every bedroom is very special and unique to its occupants. While designing an ideal bedroom a thorough knowledge of its user’s tastes, preferences, needs, lifestyles, thoughts, ideas and background is very important. Like every other room, a bedroom also has a focal point as this determines the placement of furniture. The focal point in a bedroom can be the bed, for obvious reasons, a television set, a beautiful view, a french window or anything else its user finds charming. Usually the bed is the focal point of any room as it is generally the biggest piece of furniture there and need maximum space. The kind of bed placed in a room is directly related to the number of its occupants. For example, if a room belongs to an individual, a single bed would suffice, whereas, if it’s being shared, a double bed - regular, queen size or king size would be needed. After placing the bed, other furniture like the cupboards, dressing table, chairs, tables etc. can be arranged. The rest of the furniture being placed in a bedroom depends on the requirement of the room’s user. For instance, if the room belongs to a school or college going student, a study table should definitely be a part of the room, whereas, if it belongs to an elderly person or couple, comfortable chairs or rocking chairs, are a good option. Storage needs also determine the kind and size of a room’s furniture. Once the furniture has been arranged, the left over space can be accordingly planned for optimal utilization. The color also plays an extremely important role in doing up the interiors of a bedroom as they define its underlying beauty. The color of the walls should always be the perfect background for the furniture and upholstery of the room. While it has obviously been a matter of personal choice, colors can be selected keeping in mind the age, gender and general liking on the person. For example, if the room is about a little girl, pink is a good option, whereas, if it’s about a little boy, blue is generally a common choice. In case of teenage children, bright colors like red, yellow, orange, green, purple etc. are most famous, whereas, for adults, generally soft and gentle colors like ivory, beige, off white etc. are popularly used. Curtains are one of the most amazing things one can use to transform the look of any room. They are like the room’s ‘makeover specialist’ and can make a room go from dull, boring, simple and ordinary to attractive, classy, stylish and modern. They are available in unlimited colors, designs and fabrics in the market to suit every buyer’s requirements and tastes. However, the kind of curtains we put up in a bedroom entirely depends on the mood we want to create. While curtains in simple patterns are a good choice for an elderly persons bedroom, cartoon character curtains are a must have in a kid's room. Also light and flowing fabrics are very good for summers as they create an airy sort of feel, whereas, dark and heavy ones are ideal for winters as they keep a place warm and cozy. Utmost care should be taken while selecting the bedroom lighting. It should have a special treatment and should be neither too bright, as it would take away the soothing effect of the room, nor too dull, as it would make the room appear dark and dingy. The tone of the light should be warm, cozy and comfortable. Apart from regular ceiling and wall lights, conceal lights and designer lights, which are available in various shapes and sizes, are also a good option to add that extra oomph. These are stunningly attractive and thus efficiently enhance the beauty of our room. A bedside lamp or a study lamp or even a night lamp can also be placed in a room depending on its users need. Once time consuming and major works like painting of the walls, fixing of the lights, placing of the furniture and putting up of the curtains has been done, the accessorizing of the room can follow. A beautiful painting, a designer wall clock, a few personal photos or even electronics like a television set, a music system, a desktop computer etc. can be placed in the room to make it more attractive and comfortable. A bedroom is a place where we spend maximum time and thus, it should always smell fresh and fragrant. A pleasant scent makes us feel happy and elevates our spirits; at the same time it also makes a place feel more relaxing and welcoming. To make our bedroom smell beautifully scented we can use a number of products available in the market, like artificial and natural air fresheners. Since the former is made up of harmful chemicals, it is not a very good option. However, the latter, which generally involves usage of fragrant essential oils, is a much healthier choice. Various natural home fragrance products, based on the art of aromatherapy, like reed diffusers, oil burners or aroma lamps, scented candles, potpourri etc. are an excellent option when it comes to spreading a wonderful and relaxing aroma in our bedroom. These products look very beautiful and can be considered as a superb addition to any home décor. They are packed with the goodness of aromatic essential oils which are very beneficial to us. Apart from creating a pleasantly fragrant and appealing atmosphere, they also enhance the aesthetic appeal of our homes and are, thus, a brilliant article of interior decoration.

If you want to be able to tuck the stroller into a small space (such as your trunk), you may want to specifically find a stroller that will fold.  If you don't care, then you can get a regular stroller that will be bigger, and will probably be more comfortable and have more space to hold things. If you have twins, or have another child already (or plan on having another one), you might want to consider a double stroller.  This way you can easily transport them both around, and won't need two strollers. On top of all of that, you may want to think about how much space you want on the stroller.  Some people like having storage space to put bags, or a drink, etc.  On the other hand, if you want something as small as possible, you may not care about having any extra space. Once you have all of that figured out, you can start looking into the fun stuff, like the color of the stroller.  You wouldn't believe how many different color strollers there are out there.  The same thing goes with brands of strollers.  There are a ton of different stroller brands out there, and each of them have quite a few different choices.

One of the newest metals on the market for wedding bands today is tungsten carbide. The color of tungsten carbide in jewelry is typically a gunmetal gray, or black, but it can also be plated in other metals such as silver or gold. Tungsten wedding rings are exceptionally strong and significantly harder than gold, silver, steel, and even titanium. This keeps them from scratching, bending, or showing wear and tear. If you want a wedding ring that will last many years along with your marriage, tungsten rings may be the best choice for you. Tungsten wedding bands can be plain or made more interesting with various inlays, bevels, or engraving. Carbon fiber can be inlaid in many colors such as blue, white, or black in a shiny or satin finish. Even a wood center can be set in to show off the uniqueness of a tungsten wedding band. Celtic knot engravings are very popular in tungsten rings, as well as other etchings such as words, waves, crosses, or even tribal designs. One definite advantage of some of the newly popular men's jewelry metals, like tungsten, is the price. Where gold or platinum might be extremely expensive, tungsten is reasonably priced and affordable for almost everyone. Even when adding gemstones such as black diamonds or sapphires, tungsten rings are usually priced much more affordably than many other jewelry metals, including titanium. Because tungsten is so durable, it is not pliable enough to be sized. This means that, when purchasing wedding bands in many of the harder precious metals, it is necessary to have the correct size up front. But planning ahead, and checking on the exchange policy for the store or website when shopping for wedding and engagement rings, typically results in a great fit and style match. Today, the options for fashionable and trendy men's wedding rings are almost endless. Armed with a little bit of knowledge and a lot of creativity, you can find an updated wedding band that is as unique and interesting as you."
16,A Growing Trend Resurrected from the Past- Linen Pants for Men,shopping," One trend that has come and gone has been the use of linen in clothing.

Businessmen find the colors neutral and professional, and those who work in the field with the heat find the lighter shades to assist the natural cooling properties in keeping the body temperature at a comfortable level. Another astonishing attribute that makes linen clothing highly sought after is its ability to absorb up to 20% of sweat without feeling damp. Its airy nature then disperses the moisture rapidly through evaporation, keeping its wearer dry even on the most humid days. Being a luxury fabric, linen is surprisingly sturdy as well. It has a tendency of being considerably stronger when it is wet than when it is dry, which sets it apart from less robust materials such as cotton and silk. What might be seen as a drawback instead becomes a boon with linen. Due to its nature of resisting abrasion and being strong, it does not stretch and initial shrinkage is minimal. This makes linen pants more worthwhile, as the fit will be perfect and maintain its shape for the life of the material. Since it resists stains and dirt, linen is easy and affordable to care for. It has no tendency to pill with lint, can withstand high temperatures of a tumble dryer, and excels with professional dry cleaning. With so many strengths and negligible weaknesses, linen pants for men are necessary for a well-rounded and stylish wardrobe.

This means that you should look for a new air conditioner between October and March. However, you can often find good sales on if portable air conditioners as early as July or August. As the sales of air conditioners slow down towards the end of the summer, you can often see sales and discounts springing up. This can be a great way to save some serious cash on a new portable air conditioner. The downside of buying an air conditioner in the off-season or when the heavy discounts are introduced is that your selection will be more limited than if you were buying during the peak of the season. For many people, it might make sense to purchase a new air conditioner when the new models become available in the spring and when there is a large inventory available in local stores. In recent years, many warehouse stores–like BJ's and Costco–have begun to sell portable air conditioners in the spring. The downside of buying from one of these stores is that you have limited choice in brands. But the upside is that you can save a significant amount of money by purchasing your air conditioner at a warehouse store. As an example, in the past couple of summers you have been able to find great deals on popular brands (like Amana and Delonghi) at Costco. Costco had these brands in the most popular sizes–12,000 BTUs and 14,000 BTUs–for steep discounts.

Wherever you decide to purchase your air conditioner from, make sure that you check out the units carefully on the manufacturer's website. There you will get information about which features come standard with your new portable air conditioner, as well as information about each unit’s cooling capability. Because portable air conditioners have become so popular in recent years, there is a steady supply of them that come on the market through the summer. These units are cost-effective and easy to install and, therefore, we have seen a huge demand in the portable air conditioner unit. Another benefit is that these units are invisible from the outside of your home.

3,All About Natural Diamonds,shopping," Diamonds are revered all over the world by collectors, museums, enthusiasts and everyday people. Why are they so popular? What makes them so special and also so rare? Many people ask these questions when it comes time to purchase a traditional engagement ring or piece of diamond jewelry. The fact is that diamonds are highly coveted for many reasons outside of their natural beauty. Let's take a look and understand in intimate detail just why diamonds are considered the ultimate precious gem. To begin with they are the hardest natural material found on earth. They score a perfect ""10"" on the Mohs hardness scale and are extremely durable and resistant to chipping, scratching, and breaking. They also have an ""adamantine"" luster that is found only in diamonds, making them extremely light reflective and brilliant. From the scientific viewpoint, diamonds are pure carbon in its crystallized form. Their natural color differences come from the trace minerals that were trapped within the atomic structure of the diamond during its formation. Natural white diamonds are prized for their ""colorless"" characteristic. These gems are the most commonly found. However, diamonds are found in all colors of the rainbow with red being the rarest color of them all. These fancy colored diamonds are found only in specific mines and are usually not naturally large. Various industries utilize the inherent qualities in a diamond to help cut and grind other materials. For example, diamond tips are regularly used for drill bits and diamond powder is a well-known abrasive material. This helps in cutting materials widely used like glass, steel, acrylic, etc. The diamonds mined today were first formed millions of years ago under extreme temperatures and pressures in the earth's crust.They are mined at or near the earth's surface and are estimated to be 1-3 billion years old! With today's technology, it is possible to recreate what the earth has done naturally, however there are ways in which to know whether a diamond has been formed in a laboratory or over earth's billion year process. Gem quality diamonds are analyzed and graded by laboratories that help to set value and pricing in the commercial market. Some of these major global laboratories include: Gemological Institute of America (GIA), American Gemological Society (AGS), and European Gemological Laboratory (EGL). These laboratories use more or less the same terms to describe a diamond's four main characteristics including: diamond color, diamond clarity, diamond cut, and diamond carat weight. The pricing of a diamond is largely determined by carat weight. It is certainly the first thing that any diamond cutter looks for when deciding how to cut a particular rough diamond into a specified shape. One carat is one-fifth of a gram or 200 milligrams and the higher the carat weight the more expensive the stone. Clarity measures internal inclusions or external blemishes. Because diamonds are naturally formed, it is very rare to find diamonds that are naturally flawless. As mentioned above, color in white diamonds refers to the amount of nitrogen found in a diamond. The more nitrogen, the more yellow a diamond will appear. Finally the cutting, polishing and shaping of a diamond is the only human assisted characteristic of a diamond, but ironically is the one characteristic that gives a diamond its ultimate brilliance and beauty. A well cut, polished and shaped diamond fetches far more than one that is heavier in terms of carats. Diamonds take billions of years to form and a lot of effort to mine, sort, cut, polish, and set into beautiful jewelry. It takes a tremendous amount of work and effort to get these rare and beautiful gems set into jewelry, so no wonder they are so highly admired! Now that you know a little more about diamonds hopefully you have a new appreciation for nature's perfect little gem!"

5,Tips on Shopping for Appliances,shopping," If you're looking for quality appliances in Mississauga area, then you know how difficult it can be to find what you're looking for. Although there are many places you could buy appliances in the area from, some of them leave a lot to be desired. Here are some tips to help make the entire shopping experience easier. Customer review - Talk to the people you know who have purchased an appliance recently, especially if they bought the same kind of appliance you are now trying to buy. They can give you some ideas about where to start looking. Check product survey - Spend some time on the phone and the web before you even leave the house. A recent survey conducted by Consumer Reports found that about 30 percent of those who bought appliances looked up advice on the websites of retailers before they bought. Out of those who did their research first, 75 percent of them found that spending time on a retailer's website first was helpful. Almost 80 percent of those who called the retailer to ask questions first felt like it was definitely worth their time to do so. Check the details of the appliance - Check to see which way the doors open before you buy any appliance. Most appliances can open on either the right or the left, and in the case of refrigerators, some even open from both sides. One of the most annoying things you will find when an appliance arrives is that it opens from the wrong side. Think about how your home and your space are laid out before you buy the appliance. Measure the appliance - Do your measurements accurately and carefully, including measuring the appliance itself. Most appliances do list their size, but you should perform your own measurements to ensure that they will fit properly. Some measurements given by manufacturers may not take into account the thickness of the door. And don't forget to measure how far the door opens so that you know if you will even be able to open it in the space you have allotted for the appliance. Arm yourself with ads for various appliances while you shop - It won't take long for you to get confused about which retailers are offering certain prices on various models. By arming yourself with ads from various retailers, you will not only be able to keep track of the prices they are offering, but also possibly use those ads in your price negotiations if needed. Ask the retailers - When you visit the retailers, ask if they offer extras like free delivery and hookup. These extras will help immensely and could even tip the scales in favor of one retailer over another. Special offers - Sometimes you can save money by purchasing more than one appliance or combining special offers from both the manufacturer of the appliance and the retailer who sells it. Certain times of the year - Try to make your appliance purchases at certain times of the year. They often go on sale right before and after the winter holidays. Also the fall is often a great time to find sales as manufacturers close out the current model."
6,"Commutator paper, what is that?",shopping," Commutator paper is an important part of any motor that requires the use of carbon brushes. It is used to create a proper seal around the brushes while also pre-shaping the brushes and also cleaning the surfaces of the commutator. Having a proper seal with the right paper is important because if you don't, the carbon brushes inside the motor will have increased friction, which will cause them to wear down much more quickly than they normally would. This can also cause excessive damage to the commutator itself, which will result in a breakdown of the motor, expensive maintenance, and a lot of unnecessary downtime for the motor. Sealing the carbon brushes in properly also makes it possible to use rated current almost right away. How Commutator Paper Works When you're creating a seal for carbon brushes, you should start by selecting commutator paper that is the appropriate width for the motor you are working on. It should be just wide enough to be in contact with all of the carbon brushes that are riding on that commutator. When installing the paper, always make sure that the abrasive side is out. Masking tape will make it possible to attach the paper to the commutator. Just be sure that you go all the way around the commutator. Next you should use your hand to rotate the commutator in the direction it goes until about 75 percent of the radius is covered by the brushes. Selecting the Right Kind of Commutator Paper Some people may use emery cloth as a cheap way to get around having to purchase paper, but it simply isn't a good idea. One of the brands that is most trusted by engineers is Garnet. This particular type of paper has been around for a long time and is trusted by many engineers all over the world. In addition to the brand name, you also have to be concerned about what grit the paper is before you purchase it. The grit you need depends almost entirely on the use of it. For example, one of the most common types of paper used is 80 grit paper, which helps with the main shaping of the brushes. On the other hand, once those brushes are shaped, you will need a different kind of paper. The other common type of commutator paper is 220 grit, which is often used after the 80 grit to help create a fine finish. Seating the Carbon Brushes It is also important when you work on the seal for those carbon brushes that you make sure they are seated correctly. Buying the right kind of commutator paper is the first step. Then you should also make sure that all of the carbon brushes are seated appropriately. When it is time to change them, be sure to change all of the brushes at the same time. If your motor is running correctly, they should wear evenly anyway. The carbon brushes you select should have a precut radius so that you know they will fit correctly. Whenever you change the brushes, remember to vacuum up the extra carbon dust so that it does not fall down into the motor and cause problems and extra wear and tear on the motor. It certainly never pays to take shortcuts, especially when you are dealing with questions about motors. The commutators and the carbon brushes that sit inside of them form one of the most important components of the motor. You simply can't afford to have cheap parts."

Doing your own wedding hair There are two key elements to doing your own wedding hair: having confidence in your decisions and practising constantly to get your style right. Professional hairdressers can charge huge amounts for wedding hairstyles for a reason: they know what they’re doing and usually have several years’ experience to back it up. So if you want your hair to be perfect on your wedding day, it’s advisable to spend several days repeatedly putting together your hairstyle of choice before the morning arrives. This is particularly important if you’re putting your hair up. In order to avoid stress on the big day, try to keep things simple. Opt for a simple plait pinned up or a loose up do rather than a tiered hairstyle with extensions. Invest in a few important hair products but don’t go overboard. Hair spray, for instance, will be essential to keep your style in place and you might need some mousse or wax to keep tendrils in place too. Most importantly, you’ll need a friend or two to help you. Doing your hair on your own is tricky at the best of times. With friends around, you’ll not only have extra pairs of helping hands but also moral support if things go wrong. Your make up on your wedding day If you’ll be applying your own make up on your wedding day, practice and planning is just as important. First, think about the look you’re going for. If you’re wearing a traditional, floor-length white dress, perhaps you’d prefer a classic look in natural and rosy hues. Alternatively, if your dress is more contemporary in style, you can afford to be a bit more creative with your make up. Once you’ve decided on a colour palette and style you like, look at your existing range of make-up and see what’s missing. Perhaps you don’t have the exact shade of nail polish you want, or you need a new foundation. Visit a department store make up counter and tell them what you’re looking for. Often, beauty experts at these counters will give you a complete makeover for a fee, which is offset against any purchases you make. Then, when you have the materials you need, practice repeatedly until you’re confident that you can pull off the look stress-free on your wedding day. If you’re still nervous or have an unsteady hand, make sure a friend or family member is on hand to help. And leave plenty of time too so you won’t feel rushed if you make a mistake and have to start all over again."
8,From Wellies To Glowsticks: Top Festival Gear For This Summer,shopping," If you’re going to a music festival this summer, now is the time to start thinking about what you’re going to pack. Packing for a festival requires care and precision - so you have everything you need for a fun and safe weekend, without overloading yourself with too many items. Not sure where to start? With a mix of common sense and good research, you’ll be able to pack all the essentials you’ll require for a comfortable festival experience – plus a few extras. Your essential festival kit The most important thing to pack in your essential festival kit is a place to sleep. If you’re taking a tent, make sure you know how to set it up before getting to the festival as it will save you time. You’ll also need a sleeping bag and an air mat. Many festival-goers consider air mats to be non-essential, but having one will ensure that you have a better night’s sleep, as well as protecting you from damp or muddy ground. Next, spend time considering your clothing. If you’re going to a festival in the UK, the likelihood is that the forecast will be uncertain so make sure you pack for rain and sun. For girls, shorts or a short skirt are handy – they’ll keep you cool in warm weather and if temperatures drop, they can easily be paired with a pair of tights or leggings. Boys should opt for shorts or cropped trousers. Generally, jeans are best avoided as they can get damp and heavy if the ground is muddy. And for footwear, waterproof wellington boots are essential though it’s advisable to pack a pair of sandals too in case of a hot spell. You also need to think about food and drink. A large bottle or canister for water is vital – without water, you’ll be vulnerable to fainting which can be very dangerous in large festival crowds. There’s often good food available at festivals, but queues can be long and stalls might not always be open when you’re at your most hungry. So pack a range of foods that won’t spoil easily over the weekend: think fruit, crisps, dried meat, muesli bars and chocolate. Instant noodles are also worth packing as there will usually be somewhere you can get boiling water on the festival site. And finally, consider your personal hygiene. You’re unlikely to have a chance to shower, so leave expensive hair products at home. Instead, pack some dry shampoo or talcum powder to treat oily hair, or use a scarf to disguise any dirt. Sunscreen is also essential, especially if the weather forecast is good. Festivals can be very grimy affairs too, so you’ll be grateful for antibacterial gel and baby wipes. And don’t forget about your ears – it’s damaging to be around loud music for such sustained periods of time so have earplugs on hand at all time. As well as protecting your ear drums, they’ll also help you sleep in your tent when your neighbours are still partying. Accessories to get the party started Of course, packing for a festival isn’t just about ensuring your comfort – it’s also about making sure you have everything you need for a memorable event. Flags, fancy dress and face paint are popular with revellers and can help you stand out so your friends won’t lose you in the crowds. If you’re expecting a lot of late night revelry, accessories that glow are endless fun. Glow sticks, bracelets and even glow necklaces look great in the dark, while UV earrings are more subtly entertaining."

17,How To Choose The Right Men’s Jumpers,shopping," Whether it’s a novelty Christmas jumper or a practical knitted tank top, jumpers are a staple of winter menswear. But given their ubiquity, it’s surprising how many men are still unsure of how to pick the right jumper, whether it’s for a particular occasion or for every day wear. If it’s time to revamp your winter wardrobe and you’re not sure how to start buying new jumpers, here are a few handy tips to make sure you get it right. The First Steps To Buying New Knitwear An easy starting point when buying a new jumper is considering where you’re most likely to wear it. If you mostly wear jumpers to work for instance, it’s worth looking for ones with a small v-neck, over which the collar of your shirt and knot of your tie can easily sit. Office jumpers are best bought in neutral colours, like black or navy. In addition, look for fabrics that are thin but warm like Merino wool, so you can easily wear a suit jacket over your outfit when necessary. Alternatively, if you’re looking for jumpers to wear at home or when you’re out with friends, you can be a little more flexible. Chunky cable-knit jumpers are great for throwing on over jeans and a t-shirt for an extra layer of warmth. Look for jumpers in inviting colours, like red, green or blue. Cardigans are a great casual alternative to jumpers too, and are particularly flattering on tall and lean men. Cardigans are also ideal for dressing down at home, but can be easily dressed up when worn with a shirt on a night out. Being Creative One of the key developments in men’s fashion over the 21st century has been the rise of colourful, patterned jumpers. Over the last two years, for example, Fair Isle knit jumpers have become particularly popular and these look great worn with jeans, trousers or even over fitted shorts if there’s a chilly wind in summer. In 2013, a number of different trends are competing for attention on men’s wool jumpers. In keeping with the general military trend in men’s fashion, grey-greens and khaki hues are dominating jumpers this year. Bestseller 50 Shades of Grey seems to have made a literal impact on catwalks too, judging by the muted rainbow of grey knitwear on offer. For something with a little more warmth, choose a jumper in plum or Bordeaux, one of this season’s most popular colours. And don’t forget, patterned jumpers don’t need to be hidden away once the festive period is over. Big patterns, stripes and checks are a prominent feature on men’s jumpers in 2013. The boldness of these jumpers mean they really hold their own, so pair with simple jeans or trousers for maximum effect."
18,How to Wear Women’s Leather This Year,shopping," Women’s leather is making a big impression in 2013. From leather dresses to small leather inserts, there are a variety of ways to wear this timeless fabric. So whether you’re a leather-lover or you’d prefer only to make a brief nod to the trend, there’s plenty to choose from. What’s new in leather clothing Leather shoes and bags are a mainstay of women’s fashion. But the Autumn/Winter 2012 catwalks indicate that this year, women will be wearing plenty of leather on their bodies too - and in revolutionary ways. Leather skirts, for instance, are making waves in designer boutiques and on the high street. Leather skirts come in a range of shapes, from pencil skirts to maxi-length ones. Choose a leather pencil skirt for a versatile clothing item you can wear to the office or out on the town. At work pair with a white collared shirt with minimal jewellery, or wear with a lace-detailed top on a night out. Leather dresses too are re-emerging, though this is more of a niche look than leather skirts. If leather dresses appeal to you, look for them in mini-length and with a straight line. Wear with ankle boots rather than knee length ones so you don’t overdo the leather look and pair with a softer fabric on top – for instance, a faux-fur scarf or wrap. Elsewhere, leather trousers have gained favour too, especially with designer houses Gucci and Roberto Cavalli. Fitted leather trousers can look fantastic, when accessorised correctly. Try wearing black leather trousers with black riding boots, a thin white jumper and a twill coat for a look that balances feminine elegance with the dominating lines of leather. Adding a touch of leather to your wardrobe If you love leather but don’t like the idea of wearing leather clothes all day, rest assured that there are plenty of alternatives. Try adding small leather details to your wardrobe – for instance, leather gloves in the winter or a leather belt over a cotton dress. Or look for leather details on clothing, like leather panels on a shirt, or stitch a leather pocket on to the back of a pair of jeans for a trendy DIY touch. For a classic leather look, you can’t go wrong with a jacket or coat. Women’s leather jackets might have less pop culture significance than their male counterparts, but they look just as good and they’re equally as versatile. Wear a leather jacket over jeans for effortless casual outerwear or pair over an evening dress to bring a raunchy touch to formalwear."
19,Denim Trends For 2013,shopping," Denim’s history stretches back over two centuries – and in 2013, it’s as popular as it’s ever been. Thanks to its durability, its warmth and its versatility, denim has become a major feature in wardrobes the world over. This year, denim is taking on classic styles and giving them a significant contemporary makeover. Read on to find out more about how to wear denim in 2013. Denim jackets Denim jackets are making a big comeback this year. After enjoying a period of popularity in the 1990s, they have generally been out of favour in the 21st century - until now. Their basic style hasn’t changed much: women can still expect denim jackets to be simple, button-down affairs with two breast pockets and cuffs to the wrist. It sounds ordinary, but denim jackets can easily be made extraordinary by how you wear them. A favourite style with celebrities is a denim jacket worn over a knee-length floral dress with sandals. This is a great look for a summer festival – just remember to swap the sandals for wellingtons. Alternatively, try wearing one with high-waisted trousers and a ruffle-detailed shirt, or over a maxi dress for chic outerwear. If the classic style still doesn’t appeal, search for variations. Cowboy-style jackets, for instance, typically have fewer pockets and buttons but more colourful details. Think kaleidoscopic, Western-style embroidery along the shoulders and a fringe at the waist. These details mean that cowboy denim jackets don’t need many accessories. Instead, pair with a plain black dress, wedged heels and a clutch bag to add a frontier-style frisson to your eveningwear. How to wear jeans this year The most enduring way to wear denim is, unsurprisingly, in the form of jeans. Jeans fashion doesn’t tend to change as rapidly as other clothes, but there are some interesting trends to watch out for in 2013. Brightly coloured denim, for example, will be back in full force come summer. Until then, look out for dark metallic-painted jeans, as well as variations in plum and wine hues. If skinny jeans are beginning to tire you out, get on board with this season’s big trend in women’s jeans: cropped denim. These jeans are generally just as fitted as skinny jeans but end a few inches above the ankle. Cropped jeans are particularly feminine, and look great with floral blouses or fitted tops. Pair with high heels or wedges to elongate your silhouette, as this style does have a tendency to make women look shorter. And if you’ve got a pair of old jeans festering at the back of your wardrobe, now’s the time to take them out as ripped denim is re-emerging as a major fashion statement."
20,Leather: a Key Trend for Men in 2013,shopping," If there’s one fabric that never seems to go out of style, it’s leather. From classic biker jackets and leather satchels to more daring leather trousers, leather always rears its stylish head on the catwalk and on the street.

If you want to get in on the trend, there are plenty of different ways to make leather work for you. The simplest and most time-honoured way to wear this enduring fabric is in the form of a leather jacket. The iconic status of the leather jacket has been reinforced in countless films, from James Dean’s classic cut in 1955’s Rebel Without a Cause to the many red ones sported by Brad Pitt in 1999’s Fight Club. Today’s styles haven’t veered too far from the mould. Biker jackets are still typically solid black, with an asymmetrical zip and pockets on either side. Some variations may offer extra details, like patterned stitching at the shoulders or cuffs. But in general, leather jackets look just as stylish worn over jeans and a white t-shirt in 2013 as they did in 1955. If you’re after a modern twist on this classic style, seek out a brown leather jacket with a ribbed fabric waist and three-quarter sleeves. This style particularly suits slim men who might otherwise be swamped by the square proportions of a traditional style. A tailored jacket with leather elbow patches is another great way to sneak leather into a contemporary formal outfit. Alternatively, for outerwear that’s less biker gang and more fighter pilot, look for a style with a sheepskin collar and cuffs. Sheepskin is another key trend for 2013, and combining it with leather is the ideal way to fuse two fashion must-haves this year. More ways to wear leather Naturally, men’s leather jackets aren’t the only way to wear this vintage fabric. Leather shirts, for instance, are a quick and easy way to join the trend, and look great worn with jeans and smart shoes to a bar or restaurant. And if you’re feeling brave, it’s never been a better time to wear leather trousers. If you decide to take the plunge, it’s advisable to go all in: leather trousers look their best when they’re matched with a leather jacket. Wear with a simple Merino wool jumper for a sophisticated look, or a graphic t-shirt for an outfit that stands out from the crowd."

1,How to Wear a Jumper Dress,shopping," Winter can be a tricky season to dress for, for many women. That’s because it’s tough putting together an outfit that looks great but keeps you warm too. And while warm trousers and a smart jumper might work well at the office, it’s not exactly an exciting combination for evening wear. So it’s perhaps not surprising that winter-enduring women around the world have embraced the jumper dress, one of 2012-13’s most exciting trends. Also known as a sweater dress, the jumper dress pulls off the rare feat of being both cosy and fashionable. Not sure if it’s right for you? Read on to find out how you can look great in a jumper dress, while keeping your body wrapped up against the cold. Picking the right jumper dress Jumper dresses can be made from a range of different fabrics, from Merino wool to Jersey to a variety of woollen blends. Typically, they sport long or three-quarter length sleeves and fall down to the knee or mid-calf, depending on your height. Unlike many types of dresses, jumper dresses are unapologetically winter-friendly. And since they’re already made from thick material, they don’t usually require an extra outer layer to stay warm, though a faux-fur gilet will do the trick on exceptionally chilly days. If you’re looking for a jumper dress to wear to work, stick to sober colours like grey, brown or black so as not to appear too casual. For weekend-wear, look for ones with a chunky cable-knit pattern or ruched detail. And if you’d like a jumper dress to wear on a relaxing evening out, search for one with a metallic trim or with a striking pattern knitted into it. Accessorising your jumper dress Jumper dresses are occasionally dismissed as dull by some fashionistas. However, this view ignores the versatility of this winter fashion item. If you’ve never owned one before, look for a black, knee-length long-sleeved jumper dress and experiment with a variety of accessories. Clip a wide leather belt over your middle to accentuate your waistline at the office, for instance, and replace with a brightly coloured scarf on your way to meet friends for after-work drinks. The blank canvas presented by a typical jumper dress means it looks great with chunky jewellery, especially statement necklaces and bracelets. On a cold winter’s day, nothing will look or feel better than a jumper dress worn with knee-length boots and a shaggy circle scarf. And to make sure your figure isn’t lost in winter-wear, wear with cotton tights instead of woollen ones. With the right accessories, jumper dresses could be your new favourite clothing item throughout autumn and winter, not to mention the odd chilly spring day."
2,Hybrid Hard Drives Are Best Deal Right Now,shopping," You may not have heard about the new hybrid hard drives yet but they are quickly taking over the internal hard drive market place. Hybrid hard drives are basically a new take on combining a small SSD and traditional hard drive to give a big performance boost without the higher cost of the new Solid State Drives. When you combine a fast 7200 rpm Sata hard drive with a 32 gig SSD for the front end cache of often used files you get a great performance increase and large size hard drive. Both Seagate and Samsung began producing these hybrid drives in 2007 but they really didn’t start selling well until the recent price drops. The software in the hard drive takes care of doing all the heavy lifting in regard to what resides where to get the best performance. And with 512 gig SSD units running well over $450, you can get a 750 gig hybrid drive with a 32 gig SSD for around $120. While the performance of the hybrid drive is not the same as a pure SSD drive, the boost is considerable and you can definitely feel the difference. These drives come in both 2.5 inch and 3.5 inch formats (laptops and desktops). The two leading manufacturers of hard drives, Seagate and Western Digital, both have hybrid hard drive models available. Seagate seems to have an advantage at this point in both price and performance. But both manufacturers are bringing out new models often so the best deal might jump back and forth. The best performance hybrid hard drives all have 32 gig SSDs and Sata 7200 rpm drives of 500 gigs or more. The larger the SSD size and the faster the rpm of the traditional hard drive dictates the real world performance. Are they as fast as a pure SSD? It really depends on your computer and daily computing habits. In my tests on both a newer Macbook Pro and Sony Windows laptop the boot times were much quicker and many daily activities were noticeably faster. Especially with iTunes and other intensive applications on both units. Both the Mac and the Sony originally had 5400 rpm drives so the boost came from SSD and 7200 rpm traditional hard drive. Both units had much smaller hard drives too so the extra space was a good benefit too. These units were both about 2 years old and the new hybrid hard drive really made it like having a new computer. Both already had an Intel I3 chipset so they should be good to go for at least another 2-3 years. Right now I would say that this is the best bang for the buck in upgrades for older laptops and desktops. You could go to a straight 128 gig SSD for about the same price and get a better boost but 128 gigs really doesn’t cut it anymore when basic OS and applications take up almost 85 gigs. And given that many users have up to 50 gigs of music alone, 128 gigs is not going to be enough space for many users. Seagate does have software that allows you to easily clone your current hard drive and it takes about an hour or better to clone most 300 gig hard drives. All in all it took about an hour and a half for me to upgrade each laptop. You could also do a clean install and get rid of the cobwebs which would certainly help in the overall performance. But it works well either way, just a matter of personal choice."
3,How To Give A Great Look To Your Old Shoes,shopping," It is important to give a lasting first impression. And trust me when I say this, you do not want to give a bad impression, especially when showing up for an interview or an important meeting with customer. Little things like un-tucked shirt or an unpolished shoe can go a long way into deciding your fate. Here, we aim to provide some tips regarding how to make your shoes appear clean and tidy. If you follow the advice given here, then you will never face embarrassment because of your shoes. You will need to think about what you need when you want to clean your shoes. Make sure you have the proper inventory. Important things include shoe polish, conditioner and a piece of cloth. Use a clean piece of cloth in the process. After collecting all the important items, start the shoe cleaning process by wiping your shoes with a wet piece of cloth. Cleaners can be used as an auxiliary for better results, but make sure that the cleaner does not damage the surface of the shoes. Afterwards, use a dry towel or piece of cloth to soak up the moisture from the surface of the shoe and allow to it dry out completely. After cleaning the shoes with a moist cloth and drying it up, you should apply some conditioner on it. This will increase the life of your shoes. Choosing the right conditioner is important. You should do proper research and ask for the advice of the salesperson present in the stores. Do not deviate from what is specified in the instructions for use. Leave your shoes for a while after applying conditioner. You are all set to apply the polish on your shoes. You will need good polishes that can keep your shoes shiny and clean for a day or two. There are a number of things to be considered here as well. First of all, it would be wise if you get the same colored polish as your shoes. If you want a polish for black colored shoes, then the process becomes easy. You will find many types of black shoe polishes in tubes and containers. If your shoes have a particular shade of brown, then look for the same colored shoe polish. Your technique is also important when it comes to polishing your shoes. Put small amounts of polish on a brush and apply on the shoes with circular movements. Cover all areas of the shoe equally well. Now leave the shoes for some time. Finally, if you are looking for an extra edge, you may use a damp cloth to rub the outside of the shoes after doing all of the above to make your shoes look even better. So, basically you should get the proper conditioner and polish for your shoe. Refrain from using low quality accessories on your shoes as they may fade the color of the shoes."
4,Achieve a Little Wiggle Room with Toe Socks,shopping," Toe socks tend to stick out from the other socks that can be found in the clothing aisle. Sometimes it’s the bright, vibrant colors that are usually associated with these types of socks that catch people's eye, other time it is the unique five individual toe design that captivates people's attention. While these socks might appear bright, bold and sometimes a little silly, there can be a few advantages that come from slipping into this style of sock. The following are just some of the many advantages people can have when they choose to wear toe socks over a traditional tube sock. The biggest advantage that comes from wearing toe socks is the extra warmth people receive from these types of socks. A toe sock is designed to wrap each individual toe with cloth. This can provide an extra layer of warmth during cold winter months. Tube socks or other styles of traditional socks just wrap the entire foot with cloth and don't take the time to provide warmth to each toe. A toe sock does just that by having individual spaces for each of the five toes. Another big advantage of wearing toe socks is the ability to provide extra wiggle room for the foot. Tube socks or traditional socks often encase the entire foot with cloth. This doesn't provide the foot a lot of room to move when you are walking or running. Toe socks can provide feet with the extra wiggle room they need to comfortably move around while walking or running. Toe socks provide extra wiggle room for the foot by allowing the toes to move in all different directions. This allows the sock to really customize the fit for your individual foot stride and not have to confirm to a pre-made model. The five toe design allows the foot to really move around while you are walking or running. There are other advantages that can come when you slip on a pair of toe socks. Other advantages include providing an extra layer of cushiony support between the shoe and the foot, and even the ability to show your personality with bright, bold colors. Most toe socks are designed with stripes, patterns and other designs that are meant to catch a person's eye. People find the ability to pick and choose different colors and designs to be exciting and thrilling, and one of the many advantages to choosing to wear toe socks over other traditional pairs."
5,Tips On Wearing Men’s Cardigans And Jumpers,shopping," The arrival of winter leaves many people breathing sights of discontent. That’s not just because of the poor weather the season brings, but also because it means an end to a usually colourful and inventive summer wardrobe. Clothes in winter often don’t seem to have the same creativity or spark as their summer counterparts. But this doesn’t have to be the case – with a little imagination, staples like cardigans and jumpers can still ensure that your winter outfits stand out from the crowd. How To Wear Cardigans The resurgence in popularity of the men’s cardigan over the last five years has much to do with its convenience. Simply slip on a cardigan over your t-shirt and your outfit is complete. But there are different types of cardigans, each of which is suitable for different occasions. Pair plain button-down cardigans with tailored trousers and a collared white shirt for office-wear that’s smart but not overly formal. Look for these cardigans in a delicate fabric like Merino wool, which is thin but warm and avoids adding bulk to your silhouette. Cable knit cardigans, on the other hand, are chunkier and more suited to casual wear. Pull a cable knit cardigan over a t-shirt for a relaxed dinner out or a wander around a Christmas market. Hooded cardigans are a great casual option too: these look best worn over jeans and a t-shirt, and under a blazer for a chic but laid-back vibe on a night out. The Best Jumpers For You Similarly, there are several types of jumpers that suit different physical frames and personal styles. Crew neck jumpers, for instance, are ideal over a t-shirt while v-necks better accommodate collared shirts. Some men’s wool jumpers can be bulky, adding unnecessary padding to your appearance. Fabrics like Merino wool may seem thin but are actually great at keeping you warm, so are ideal for smarter jumpers. Try wearing a Merino wool jumper over a shirt and tie for elegant office-wear, or under a suit jacket at a winter wedding. Alternatively, funnel-neck and roll-neck jumpers are luxuriously warm and lend themselves to layering. These jumpers cover your whole neck so they’re perfect for cold climates, though they’re often better suited to tall and slender men. More petite men may prefer jumpers with a few buttons at the neckline. This simple detail prevents high neck jumpers from making your physique appear smaller, and is the perfect way to give your body some air when it gets a bit stuffy on the bus or tube."
6,How to Wear Men’s Jackets,shopping," Whatever the time of year, men’s jackets are an ubiquitous clothing item in the UK. That’s because our notoriously bad weather means leaving the house without a jacket is a high-risk move, even in the summer. But jackets aren’t just about keeping warm and dry. In the 21st century, men’s jackets have been just as influenced by fashion trends as the clothes worn beneath them. So if you’re thinking about buying a new jacket, you might be bewildered by the array of options at your disposal. Choosing a Jacket For Everyday Wear Men’s jackets cover a range of possibilities, from straight-laced work jackets to stylish military-influenced coats. If you’re choosing a jacket to wear to work, go with stylish and simple. Blazers make the ideal work jacket, thanks to their precise tailoring and versatility. Blazers can be easily dressed up with a smart shirt, suit trousers and formal shoes for meetings, for instance, or worn with chinos and a t-shirt for casual office wear. For something more outdoorsy, look for a Harrington jacket. Defined by a simple zip-up fastening, breast pockets and fitted cuffs, this jacket looks great during the day and on a casual night out. Pair a navy blue Harrington jacket with burgundy chinos and black trainers for an easy look that will be big in 2013, or simply wear with straight-cut jeans. A leather biker jacket is a timelessly stylish option too: wear with a knit insert jacket or gilet in winter to keep your body warm, or loosely unzipped over a white t-shirt for a 1950s summer vibe. Or for a jacket that offers more comprehensive protection from the elements, go for a quilted panel jacket to shelter your body from the wind or a fur-collared aviator jacket to keep your neck warm. Formal Jackets Choosing a jacket for a formal occasion requires a more discerning eye than its casual cousins. Most men rely on a standard suit jacket for formalwear but there are other options. For instance, look for a tweed jacket or blazer to wear with suit trousers and pair with a bow tie or cravat for a preppy look that will be in vogue in 2013. If you have a lean frame, double-breasted jackets are a great alternative to the usual two-button variation. And if you can’t find a formal jacket style that suits you, men’s tailored jackets are the way to go. Bespoke tailoring takes into account your specific body measurements and style preferences, so you’ll always end up with a flattering jacket that’s unique to you."
7,Women’s Gym Wear: Taking Care of Fitness Wear and Yoga Clothes for Women,shopping," Investing in proper exercise clothing can be expensive although it is an investment worth making. That’s why it’s very important you care of your fitness wear. It may be painstaking to take care of women’s gym wear, especially yoga clothes. It is worth the effort, however. Your clothes will last much longer and you’ll be proud of your investment if you simply take care of it. General Women’s Gym Wear Instructions It is extremely important that you follow the care instructions of your women’s gym wear to the letter. If you don’t, you can wind up destroying the fabric. To prevent shrinking, wash your exercise clothes in warm, cool or cold water. Unless otherwise stated, use a mild detergent to clean your clothes. Check the care instructions before putting your clothes in the dryer. It will tell you if heat can be used on your clothes. If it says ""low iron if needed"" this means the garment tolerates a very low amount of heat. Throwing it in the dryer while it’s on the hottest setting can burn or shrink these types of clothes. Once they shrink, you usually can’t stretch them back into shape. How to Take Care of Your Yoga Clothes Before you put on any yoga clothes, you should wash them first. This applies even if it says it’s ""pre-shrunk."" The reason for this is twofold. First, pre-shrunk fabrics can still shrink. Second, you’re ridding the clothing of harmful dyes that may cause rashes on your skin. You need to wash your clothes out after every session. This will prevent bacteria from building up in your clothes. Typically clothes for yoga cannot be dried in a dryer. Hang them on a plastic hanger instead. They should dry pretty quickly. If you do yoga frequently, you may want to invest in more than one set of clothes. This way you’ll always have a fresh set for each workout. Making Sure Your Bright Fitness Wear Lasts Your fitness wear likely comes in bright colours. Bright coloured garments are cared for differently than other colours. Bright coloured clothes should be washed together. Don’t mix them in with darks, lights or whites. When bright clothes are wet, keep them away from other clothes. This will prevent the colours from rubbing off. Don’t use a lot of detergent when washing. If mild detergent is leftover in the clothing it will cause the fabrics to break down much faster."
8,How To Wear Men’s Blazers In 2013,shopping," In times past, blazers were mainly worn by public school students and Oxford undergrads. But today, the humble blazer has undergone a huge revolution, transforming into one of the biggest men’s fashion statements of 2012. Thanks to its refined tailoring and versatility, this trend looks set to continue well into 2013. Not sure what all the fuss is about? Here’s a quick guide to why men’s blazers deserve their new fashionable status, along with a few tips on how to wear them. Why a blazer beats a coat While men’s coats often prioritise function over style, blazers offer protection from the elements as well as an effortless sense of fashion. That’s not to say they should be worn in a blizzard – instead, they offer the perfect form of outerwear for spring and autumn, when the weather is in a transitional phase. Better still, they’re also suitable for wearing indoors, as an alternative to a cardigan or jumper. Another great thing about blazers is that they suit men of all shapes and sizes. Paired with fitted trousers, they highlight the lean shape of tall and slender men without over-emphasising a slim frame. Shorter men too benefit from the fine tailoring of a good blazer, because they help to define the upper body and make legs look longer. Men with a square or stocky frame, on the other hand, should pair a blazer with an open-collared shirt for a flattering smart-casual look. Ways to wear a blazer If you’re looking for a blazer to wear to the office, concentrate on serious colours like navy blue, brown or black. Pair with fitted chinos, a collarless shirt and brogues for an easy smart look that’s not too formal. For a more laid-back office vibe, swap the shirt for a crisp white t-shirt and wear boat shoes instead of brogues. For a casual outfit that oozes contemporary style, look for men’s blazers made from jersey. Choose a block colour and pair with a striped or gingham top for a striking informal statement. To add a dash of colour to a cocktail party, go for blazers in bright colours like emerald green, mustard or electric blue. Coloured blazers are a great way to liven up formal events that don’t specify a black-tie dress code. That said, blazers are appropriate for weddings too. Try switching your suit jacket for a tweed or velvet blazer and pair with your usual suit trousers and a tie or a bow-tie. Tailored blazers go well with kilts too and are a stylish alternative to the traditional Bonnie Prince Charlie jacket. Or make an elegant statement at a summer wedding with a pin-striped blazer and crisp white trousers."

Get the most out of your tight-fitting trousers by learning some great ways to ensure you can wear your skinny jeans all year round, whether you're planning a day at the beach or looking for a glamorous party ensemble. When it's warm outside, your skinny jeans will look great with the cuffs turned up and a pair of flat sandals. Team with a t-shirt and sun hat for a very relaxed summer daytime look. If you’re hoping for something a little dressier, swap the sandals for a pair of heels and pair with a sparkly strappy top. A chunky bracelet and pair of oversized earrings are perfect for giving this outfit that extra sprinkle of glamour. For a smart look during the warmer months, slip on a pair of ballet shoes and a light, batwing top for a floaty, yet professional feel. A well-tailored white shirt also looks excellent with a pair of dark skinny jeans and can be perfectly accessorised with a thin cardigan for the office. To give your outfit a professional and eye catching edge, you can add a strong shoulder jacket which will balance your top half and hips perfectly and ensure you have a business like air. As it becomes a little chillier, you can start to swap your t-shirts to long sleeved tops and your shirts for jumpers without losing any of the stylishness associated with your jeans. When you're going for a casual look, pop a pair of gym shoe style trainers on and if it's something a little smarter you're hoping for, a nice pair of brogues or ankle boots will do nicely. When you've got a special night planned, team your jeans with a long sleeved lace top or a thigh skimming wraparound. Once there's a real chill in the air, it's time to start thinking about knee and thigh high boots, which should be worn over your jeans. Choose flat, practical styles for running around during the day and indulge in some tight, heeled boots that will transform your jeans into gorgeous eveningwear. A loose top in metallic shades is the perfect accompaniment for a big night out and looks wonderful when teamed with super skinny jeans. Outer wear is also a cinch and there are very few jackets that don't look great with these trousers, from tight blazers to big, heavy winter coats. Accessorise with woolly hats and oversized scarves for a cute, cosy look. Once you've got your hands on a good pair of womens skinny jeans and started experimenting with all the great looks you can pull off in them, you'll hardly ever want to wear anything else."
11,Get the rock chick look for grown ups,shopping," Growing up doesn't mean you have to start dressing like your more elderly relations, there's plenty of room in your wardrobe for fun, exciting and interesting outfits no matter what age you are. There are few styles as great for letting your hair down and getting ready to party as the classic rock chick, and you'll be glad to know that you don’t necessarily have to leave it behind as you get older. All you need to do is make some minor adjustments to the basics and you'll have a rock chick look that will allow you to party all night whatever age you are. The rock chick look can be very flattering to women of all ages as long as you're willing to say good-bye to some of the more risqué favourites. With a few simple swaps, you're already halfway there. Ditch the teeny tiny mini skirts in favour of tight black pencil skirts and swap bright pink leopard print leggings for a pair of muted metallic tights. The rock chick look is all about attitude, so look for ways you can tone down the style without losing any of the intent. Slim or skinny fit jeans are perfect especially when teamed with a classic, fitted white shirt or a vest top. Good boots are another essential and even if you think your days of thigh highs are past, a small heel and some kick ass pointy toes are just the thing to give your outfit an edge. The key to updating the rock look is to mix grunge with grown up glamour. Think faded band t-shirt combined with a gorgeous gold pendant or a rough and tough jeans and jacket combo softened by a pink slip and a slash of red lipstick. Leather trousers and skirts are another characteristic rock look that just keeps coming back and if you have the figure to get away with them, go for it. Moderation is the key thing to remember here, while leather trousers and a simple singlet can look great, if you pair leather boots, trousers and jacket, you could end up looking like a washed out star rather than a fashion-savvy woman in her prime. Of course, the real crowning glory to any rock chick ensemble is a beautiful, tough leather biker jacket. Choose wisely and your leather jacket will see you through thick and thin as it will look great with everything from skinny jeans and plimsolls to covering a floaty white dress and sandals. There are few jackets as versatile as the biker jacket and while it has real rock and roll roots, it’s now also a firm fashion favourite with trend setters the world over. Transform yourself into a sophisticated rock chick ready for a wild night on the tiles by slipping on your womens leather biker jacket, using some soft kohl to outline your eyes and accessorising with some oversized silver or gold bangles. You'll have the grown up rock chick look down to a T, all you'll need to do to hang on to that glamorous aura is stay away from karaoke bars and the temptation to blast out a few classics."
12,Making skinny jeans work on men,shopping," Skinny jeans have snuck their way to the heart of more than one fashion trend and can now be counted as an essential for any fashion-forward guy. However, as with many of the most popular trends, skinny jeans aren't always easy to get right. To look good in these tight-legged trousers, you need to make sure you not only get the right fit, but you also need to make sure to accessorise well. With a few handy hints and tips, you can conquer your fear of figure-hugging bottoms and try out the joys of skinny jeans for yourself. The most essential part of introducing skinny jeans into your wardrobe is the moment you try them on for the first time. A close fit is essential to carry off the style but you don't want jeans that are so tight that it's possible to see the exact shape of your leg through them. Instead, you want skinny jeans that skim over your thighs and calves. It's also really important to make sure you get the waist measurement right as there's nothing worse than skinny jeans with straining buttons. Avoid pipe cleaner legs or sagging bottoms by taking your measurements or trying on lots of different pairs until you find the right fit. You may also want to choose denim jeans that have a small amount of spandex in the mix, as they will have a little more stretch to them than other varieties. Footwear is perhaps the biggest make or break choice when it comes to getting your skinny jeans right. Skip big, white trainers and choose something a little more flattering such as classic Converse boots or a gym shoes style. Boots can sometimes look good, especially if you're rocking a cosy, winter look, but avoid wearing any too thick or sturdy, or they can make your feet look out of proportion. A pair of smart leather lace ups can also coordinate nicely. Wear these with a t-shirt and cardigan or to go with a fitted white shirt. When it comes to your outerwear, you have a few great choices. Skinny jeans look particularly good with tailored coats and military designs. Throw on a pea coat or a structured army-style jacket for an effortlessly stylish look. On the other hand, you can team your jeans with a white t-shirt and a leather biker jacket for a real rock star vibe. If you prefer a preppy look, wear them with a thin jumper, a simple blazer and a pair of geek chic rimmed glasses. The only thing you really need to watch out for are jackets that finish above the hip, as these can give you an awkward looking shape. Bomber jackets are a particularly bad offender in this regard. When it's cold outside, you can pile as many layers onto your upper half as you need to without compromising on style as skinny jeans tend to balance the weight out nicely. Accessorising with skinny jeans is easy once you know how, so stock up on some well-fitting mens skinny jeans and get ready to show off your legs – and your well-developed sense of style."
13,Cosy men's coats for cold seasons,shopping," When you were very small, winter was a time for bundling up in layers and layers of puffy anoraks and huge gloves and mittens so you could play in the snow unscathed, but that look is only cute on the under tens. This year, instead of turning yourself into a snowman-sized pile of jumpers and unflattering cosy coats, take a look at some of the fashionable alternatives that will keep frostbite at bay while leaving you looking great. One of the best ways to stay warm is to choose outfits that have a lot of layers. Warm air becomes trapped between layers of clothes, so you're better off wearing three fairly thin layers than you are smothering yourself in one big jumper. This means that you don't have to choose the biggest, heaviest coat out there, you just have to think smart about what you're going to wear underneath it instead. Leather jackets are great for cold, nasty weather, especially if they are well-lined biker jackets. The tough outer layer means that it will withstand all kinds of rain and hail and will be great at cutting the chill factor out of any wind. However, if your leather jacket only has a very thin lining, you might have to work quite hard to keep the heat in on very cold days so you'll need a jacket big enough to fit several layers underneath. An alternative that’s also great for rainy days is a wax jacket. A very UK kind of jacket, these were originally only worn by men who spent their spare time fishing and hunting, but the style soon moved onto the high street. Available in both straight and quilted styles, and typically in a muted green, these are very popular jackets that can offer some great practical warmth when it's cold outside. It’s also very handy if you tend to carry a lot of gear around with you as they typically have a lot of pockets, so you'll find a place for your phone, your keys, a pen and anything else you might have on you. Another excellent and stylish option for staying warm no matter what the weather is the classic pea coat. Based on a style once well loved by sailors in general and members of the navy in particular, pea coats have a very distinctive look characterised by their large lapels and double breasted fronts with large buttons. Tending to be quite thick and cosy and coming to under the hips, they are great for pairing with tight jeans and a pair of boots or study brogues for a winning winter look. Whether classic mens pea coats or heavy leather jackets are your thing, remember that the most important thing is how you accessorise – there's no point wearing a cosy jacket if you've forgotten a hat and scarf. Wrap up warmly in simple, classic styles and lots of thin layers and you'll be able to keep the cold at bay without looking like a kid."

16,Maintaining the Appearance of Knee High Socks,shopping," Knee high socks are a popular accessory that can add a lot to the appearance of any outfit. While they are not as pricey as some other accessories—such as shoes, purses, wallets, or jewelry—they are still not exactly cheap. It should come as no surprise, then, that most individuals want to maintain the appearance of knee high socks as long as possible, so as to avoid their replacement. When it comes to maintaining the appearance of knee high socks, washing, drying, and storing the items in a responsible manner are all essential steps. Washing knee high socks is perhaps one of the most important steps when it comes to maintaining the appearance of the items. While it can be tempting to toss a pair of knee highs into the washing machine with the rest of one’s clothes, this can be quite detrimental to the items. In fact, this process cannot only leach color and thin the material, but is very likely to can runs and tears. Instead, owners of knee high socks should hand wash the items in a sink or large bowl filled with cool water and a gentle detergent. Be sure to wring all soap from the knee highs to ensure optimal results during cleaning. While washing socks by hand is crucial to maintaining their appearance, drying the items properly is just as important. Though knee high socks can be dried in a machine dryer, this is likely to cause them to shrink, and may alter their color. Instead, they should be laid on a clean dry surface or over a stable bar/rod and allowed to remain until all moisture has been removed. Individuals who own an outdoor clothes line can quickly dry knee high socks by placing the items on this line. Finally, storing knee high socks properly in the final step in maintaining their appearance. These days, people are in such a rush that they often throw all of the socks, underwear, and other similar garments into one drawer without concern for their longevity. To extend the life of knee high socks, fold them carefully and store them in a cool, dry place—such as a dresser drawer, cabinet, or shelf. Socks that are made from a durable material, such as wool or cotton, can be rolled into a ball and placed in a safe location."
17,Giving The Gift Of Food This Christmas,shopping," One of the highlights of Christmas, is that it helps bring family and friends together. Relatives travel across the world to spend this month with the ones they love, many staying over with loved ones also. Reminiscing and eating food are two of the key elements that no family gathering would be without. So this year why not replace the standard gifts given to family and friends with festive foods that contain much more love. Anything that is handmade, with added love will be appreciated more than anything you can simply buy. Being creative can help increase the possibilities and help bring a smile to those that you love. Even making Christmas treats for when family and friends come to visit, will create a great talking point. So where to begin?, well starting off simple is the best way to go down this route. For example, baking your very own gingerbread biscuits can be a great place to start. The baking process is incredibly simple and involves very few ingredients. What's more, they can be decorated and have many different icing and additional elements to help add colour and taste. Ideally, including children in the baking process can be a great way to spend time inside, during the ice cold temperatures outside. Other home-made gifts that provide a great festive treat, are classic jams and chutney's. Along with truffles and fudge. But these are just little treats. What about making your own Christmas cake. This food gem is eaten by almost everyone during the Christmas period, and often on Christmas day. A Christmas cake is a type of fruitcake that contains currants, sultanas, cherries and raisins. Coated with marzipan, icing and glazing. Since this will require a Christmas theme, consider presenting it with  tinsel and ornaments, or try the sugar-coated glace fruits approach. Whatever you decide to cook or bake this year, try attempting a mixture of different items. Once you have a good assortment of different baked goods, place them within a hamper. Other food and drinks can also be added. This will create luxury Christmas hampers that can be shared amongst friends and family on Christmas day. Packaging a personalised hamper full of food related gifts, is a very thoughtful present. That is a great accompaniment to anyone’s Christmas day. With other essential additions of jams other spreads lasting for an extended period. Another benefit from creating and giving food gifts this Christmas, is that it will help you save money. The materials and ingredients can be purchased in large quantities for a low price at almost every major supermarket. Anything left over can be used at a later date."
18,Handmade Christmas Gift Ideas,shopping," With the current economic climate the way it is, many are having to make what they have go that little further. This Christmas is no different. For many having to buy friends, family and colleagues Christmas gifts and presents can be very expensive. Even if they are low cost gifts the quantity of them brings the cost up significantly. Therefore, this Christmas why not consider making affordable gifts, that are unique and handmade. When simply purchasing a product from a shelf, often provides little personal touch or value. Especially when Christmas is a time for love and people to come together. Providing a less materialistic view, may not be what we are used to but may just improve the way we view Christmas.

Handmade Christmas Cards Throughout December, everyone hands out cards to wish everyone a merry Christmas and its a traditional that will not likely disappear any-time soon.

Hand-making a batch of Christmas cards, that includes your personality and style can be a much greater gift for anyone to receive. Christmas cards often are used as decoration within many different environments, especially within the home and working environment. So why not create something that will be on show for the entire Christmas period. Just don't forget to add a personal message or touch to each card in order to make then unique. The materials, such as card and other accessories will be much cheaper than purchasing a large mix of novelty gifts. Personalised Or Handmade Stockings Creating or knitting a stocking, is another great Christmas gift for any loved one. Knitting the stocking by choosing the desired coloured wool, and patterns will ensure the present they receive is one of a kind. Consider hand embroidering a name tag in addition of other Christmas related objects. This is a gift that  will last many years, from a very young age to later in life. With the possibility to be passed down among generations. The gift remains within the Christmas theme, and shows that you know the person well. Not forgetting that it will also acts as decoration. With the ability to show you dedicated time and effort in creating a highly personal gift. What's more, because the materials can be bought in bulk and cheap. Consider making one for an entire family. Or replace simple pet gifts that are often wasted with their very own Christmas stocking. The possibilities are endless. Handmade Christmas Hamper The final affordable and handmade gift idea is to create your very own Christmas Hamper. This can help reduce costs in a variety of ways. For example, when buying for relatives this can result in a large number of gifts, especially when a large number of children are involved. Whereas instead of buying a large number of individual gifts that are often generic and simply bought as a last minute idea. Exchange this for a personalised Christmas hampers  that will be given to each family to share and enjoy. Include foods that can be enjoyed on Christmas day, such as snacks and drinks. Why not making them even more special by including some home-made jams and other spreads."
19,About Emeralds,shopping," Emeralds are my favorite gem stone -  not only because of their color, but also because of their variety, healing properties and meaning. Emeralds differ in shine and color depending upon the locale of its mine. It is just the Columbian emerald that features the characteristic vivid, slightly bluish green tones of medium-to-medium darkish color. Deposits of the stone are often found in other parts of the world such as in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Madagascar and Nigeria. Nonetheless Columbia and Brazil are the leading producers of emerald at present. The 'Red Emerald' which is basically formed out of the mineral beryl takes its color from the presence of manganese in the rock. It is found only in a few deposits of Utah's Wah Wah mountain. This makes it one of the rarest gems of the world all the more so if it is facetable. Emerald is green -  the color of earthiness, happiness and joy! For ages it has been a pick of Royalty, most people are however often times confused during purchasing this magnificent gemstone. Understanding of the emerald is easy, and will help in choosing and selecting the right color and cut. ""He who possesses it shall enjoy special protection of God""-reads a talismanic Mughal emerald. This birthstone of the month of May has been the passion of Cleopatra and love of the Mughals in Persia. Along with ruby, diamond and sapphire, emerald is an important member of the big ""awesome quartet"" and has long been attributed therapeutic and mystic prowess. Being related to the planet Mercury, emerald is quite often thought to cure illnesses like forgetfulness, epilepsy, stuttering and also insanity. Attributing mystic qualities to this gem, it is well known that this piece of stone brings foreknowledge and wisdom to the possessor. Emerald happens to be a grass-green brand of Beryl. Mostly it occurs in mica schist of metamorphic-hydro-thermal origin. The creation of emerald involves a natural process referred to as exo metamorphism. During this phenomenon if the basic rock contains the elements chromium or vanadium small portion of it may get integrated in the formation of beryl. This provides the rock its gem-like green color. Varying quantity of iron also modifies the color of the rock. It has a hardness of 7.5-8 and a refractive index of 1.57-1.59. However it is not really a gem sanctioned for 'everyday' use since it falls in the category of soft stone. The real worth of the gem rests in its green dazzle and variations in shades. They vary in color from a bit yellowish green to more dark bluish green. The cut of the stone is also very important. Whilst faceted emerald can have round, pear, oval shapes the emerald cut, that is, octagonal shape is most preferred. Inclusions are more or less an accepted, in fact, sought after in emeralds. You may obtain your favorite emerald from your local jewelry store, or if you wish to have more fun, head for the mountains in North Georgia to try your luck in gem mining. Of course most of the gem stones are imported from various mines throughout the World, and the quality of gem stones that you may find is not the best, but nonetheless, you can find your own particular emerald, which can be faceted, polished or wire wrapped to make a very unique piece of jewelry."
20,British Gifts for Friends or Family Abroad,shopping," Do you have friends or family abroad who you'd like to send a wee Christmas treat to? These days, most of us have someone who's left the country for work or an adventure. Surprise them with a British gift to remind them of home. Who knows, that might entice them to come back for good! Clothing Buy local by supporting up and coming young designers. Visit graduate shows and keep up to date with fashion blogs. In the run up to Christmas, there could also be gift fairs and markets going on around town where many of these rising stars are likely to exhibit their crafts. Alternatively, opt for traditional British fashions in fabrics such as tweed, cashmere and tartan. Country clothing and wellies are also great as presents. The selection in the UK is larger than elsewhere as outdoor clothing is worn more regularly, as opposed to places like mainland Europe where, often, fashion wins over practicality. Homeware Kitchen shops in the UK are among the best with their ample selections of tools and gadgets to make cooking so much easier. See what's new in the world of kitchen aids and get an innovative device that might not have reached foreign markets yet. As cuisines vary, some items may never be available to buy all over the world. For example, the very simple poached egg is only common in some parts of the world so egg poachers might not be available for purchase in countries where this is a less popular way of preparing an egg! Food One of the easiest ways of ensuring a truly British gift is by sending food. You just have to remember that some countries have strict customs regulations so don't ignore these, otherwise you risk leaving your friends or family abroad gift-less this Christmas. These apply to countries outwith the European Union. Consult Post Office regulations for details. A great place to stock up on local produce is your nearest farmers' market. Here you'll be able to purchase authentic British goods from farmers and local businesses, supporting your community. It's almost guaranteed that these items aren't available to buy in foreign countries. Traditional British goodies include shortbread, malt loaf, cheddar, pies, tea, chocolate oranges, boiled sweets, oatcakes, chutneys, salt and vinegar crisps, haggis and more. Struggling for time to buy individual gifts? A quick and easy option is ordering hampers. These can be ordered online and delivered directly to the recipient. Hampers are often themed so could feature a specific type of product, such as sweets, products of Scottish origin, or family-friendly items."

1,The History And Application Of Merino Wool,shopping," Merino wool is not a commonly known wool that is used to produce a high quality piece of clothing. But what is merino wool and how is it sourced, and how is it different from traditional wools? Merino is an influential breed of sheep that is well known for its quality wool. These sheep are regarded as having the finest and softest wool, when compared to all the different breeds of sheep. The History An unknown fact is that more than half of the world's sheep population are descendants from merino sheep, or from a merino cross breed. This breed originated from Spain. Sheep are mainly traded for their meat and for wool, with the merino being chosen and traded for their wool, specifically. This can also be a result of them having much smaller bodies than other breeds. Australia and New Zealand and many other countries are now considered major exporters of the wool, along with Spain. Originally the term 'Merino' would strictly mean wool that is from Spanish merino sheep. But since other countries are providing high quality wool also, the term has been broadened further. Applications & Current Uses Merino wool is often described as springy and tightly crimped, although there are different strains that produce different classifications of wool. The different classifications can be divided into medium, fine medium, fine, superfine and ultra fine. The wool has many different applications throughout the clothing industry. This ranges from high-end fashion to running clothing. Not forgetting that it is also widely used within skiing, hiking, cycling and mountain climbing clothing. It has become a main choice because of its ability to provide insulation and because of its superiority over other wools and fabrics. The reason for it being used so widely is because of the properties of the wool, when compared to other fabrics. Here's a short list of the benefits: A high warmth to weight ratio, compared to other wools. Contains antibacterial properties. One of the softest wool types available. It's ability to maintain warmth when wet. Great at regulating body temperature. Stretches but maintains its shape. A breathable material. The fashion industry has also not overlooked the additional benefits that the wool can provide their clothing. For example a large number of high quality women and mens merino jumpers that are 100% pure are very popular, for the benefits listed above. Another reason that is often overlooked is the sensitivity of the wool. Because it is a natural fibre, it is soft on the skin and will reduce the irritation for people who have sensitive skin."
2,A Man's Guide To The Blazer Jacket,shopping," Most men do not mix up their clothing enough. Using their jeans as part of casual clothing and only using blazer jackets as formal wear. But both of these types of clothing, including many others can be mixed. Not only does this increase the amount of outfits that can be created with a set amount of clothing in your wardrobe. But this can create smart but casual clothing that is suitable for a variety of occasion. The line where formal and informal dress is never closer. With many events merging between the two. Let's focus on the men's blazer jacket. This piece of clothing is only really considered when a smart look is required. Limiting the potential of the blazer. Try matching a blazer with different coloured trousers to create a much less formal look. While providing much greater possibilities over a single coloured blazer and trousers. First and foremost, its vital that the blazers you own and intend on buying in the future have a great fit. Therefore it is advisable that when worn regularly a tailored blazer is recommended. Not just because it will be greater quality and will most likely last longer than an off-the-shelf blazer jacket. But because a correctly fitting blazer is essential. It will be much more comfortable and give of a greater image. If you do decide to buy off-the-shelf, then remember that when measuring your body to find the correct size, you measure around the widest part of the body. Placing the tape close under your arms whilst keeping the tape flat across the back. Another consideration when choosing a blazer is between the different styles available. There is an American style blazer and an English style blazer. The American style blazer is identifiable, by looking for 2 buttons and a centre vent. Also featuring notched lapels. The English style blazer features a special cut that will emphasise the shoulders and chest. Most commonly found as double breasted and a double vent. Most likely have peaked lapels and three buttons. Each style will suit different body styles, therefore it can be worthwhile to try on both before deciding. But it must be noted that the American style blazers are much easier to be dressed down that their English style counterpart. Now the basics of the blazer have been covered, lets view the combinations and recommended clothing that best suit blazers. The first step is to remember that a blazer is not a suit coat. Therefore, unlike a suit, the blazer colour should never match the colour of trousers worn. Lastly, personalisation is key. Choosing a good well-match combination of trousers and blazer, taking into account the colour is key to standing out. But it doesn’t have to stop there, consider mixing the blazer with different combinations of buttons and pocket squares. Mens blazers have remained in fashion for hundreds of years, and for good reason. Learn to re-kindle your love for the blazer today. Understand the versatility and functionality that it can provide every man."
3,Men's Winter Wardrobe Must-Haves,shopping," To survive the chilliest time of the year whilst still looking smart and stylish, every male needs to invest in a few men's winter wardrobe must-haves. Shirts As a base layer and for extra warmth, always make sure to wear a short-sleeved t-shirt. For work, wear this under a classic button-front shirt in a block colour or with a neutral pattern such as checks, polka dots or stripes. Vintage-inspired prints are once again very modern. Alternatively, just slip on a jersey shirt with a V-neck or round-neck, depending on what shape best suits you. Jumpers and Cardigans No winter wardrobe is complete without a quality woolen jumper. Ideally, this should be a real Nordic or Scandinavian design item, however, these are not so readily available in shops and can cost quite a lot. Instead, invest in an Arran knit or faux-Arran design garment, ensuring it's not purely synthetic and will genuinely keep you warm. Fair Isle knit patterns are also bang on trend. For warmer winter days, a few basic jersey jumpers and thin crew jumpers are extremely versatile and can be worn for both work and leisure. Fan of the cardigan? These are very much still en vogue and look great paired with most styles of trousers. Choose warm fabrics like cashmere, wool or mohair. Chunky knits look good. Trousers Jeans are a must for all seasons, but in the winter it's important to choose a style made in thicker, heavier denim to better withstand the chill. In general, avoid thin, light and floaty materials as these will make it very unpleasant to spend prolonged periods of time in the outdoors. A wise idea for kicking about at the weekend is to invest in a trendy pair of sweatpants. The fabric is often soft, warm and cosy, making it ideal for wearing while out and about in the winter. For wearing during the week and in the city, chinos in a heavier cotton are a good choice. Coats Every fashion-conscious male should have more than one winter coat: one for work, one for play and, ideally, another for evenings out. Most men get away with having just the two, however, by choosing a versatile key piece that can be worn both to the office and in the evenings. Mens pea coats are ideal in terms of versatility. They look equally cool paired with tailored trousers as they do a pair of jeans or chinos. For weekends and more casual occasions, duffle coats are a good choice."
4,What to Wear to a Staff Night Out,shopping," Can't quite figure out what to wear to your upcoming staff night out? With Christmas just around the corner, most employers have come up with some idea of how to mark the end of the year and revel in the festive season. In most cases, it's a party that starts with a meal and ends on the dancefloor, at a karaoke bar or a chip shop late at night... With such a potentially jam-packed agenda, it's important to choose your outfit well, for practical reasons such as comfort, warmth and stain potential. Be sure to find out as much as you can about the plans and the dress code. You don't want to risk showing up underdressed or overdressed, or wearing the same outfit as a colleague. Therefore communication is also a must. While this is easier said than done when it comes to big companies, at least make sure to coordinate outfits among those you work closest with. Menswear If you're not headed to an overly formal venue, but rather a smart casual affair, choose a pair of chinos in a subdued block colour like grey, khaki, clay or navy. Team these with a crisp, button front shirt in either a sheer colour or a classic pattern such as checks or polka dots. Accessorise with vintage pieces: a leather belt and brogues. Top off the smart casual look with either a cardigan or a smart blazer, depending on the venue. Is a more formal shindig on the cards? In this case you may indeed have to opt for a suit, but why not jazz things up a bit by opting for a less conventional colour than black or grey? Navy, dark green and dark red can look really effective teamed with a simple shirt and leather shoes. Alternatively, if you feel that might be too much of a bold statement, choose trousers and a jacket in two different tones. Womenswear There is no ""just wear a suit"" option for women so you have to be a bit more creative with your outfits. One of the most practical types of party dresses is the t-shirt dress. It's a trendy and very comfortable piece that can simply be thrown over a pair of opaque tights or leggings and accessorised with heels or flats according to the venue and planned activities. For warmth, throw on a fitted blazer in a seasonal colour like dark red, dark green or deep blue. Choose a dress with detail like sequins, metallic thread or lace so you don't have to go overboard with jewellery. These days, it's also perfectly acceptable to wear a pair of trousers. Ideally, black or magnolia are the way to go. Tight fitting or wide leg styles are both bang on trend. Team with simple tops in statement fabrics such as silk or velvet."

With the nights becoming darker and the cold air and snow starting to become a reality. Its time to begin preparing for Christmas. Getting presents for all the family, friends and relatives. It can be a testing time not only financially but also mentally because of the limited time to complete everything. But one of the biggest tips anyone can give is to begin buying and preparing for Christmas early. This can involve beginning to prepare early in the year. This not only helps reduce the stress throughout December but will also spread the cost out. This year why not try and get as many personalised gifts as possible. Doing this can give someone a gift that will have much greater value and purpose than a voucher or item that may not have been wanted. Here is a brief descriptions and ideas of personalised gifts that are fairly simple and not expensive: Photo Albums Since the rise of the digital camera and increasing capacity of hard drives not many people are printing their pictures, as before. Many images will remain on a computer their whole lives. But do you not remember enjoying going through old photos and passing them around. There's no better occasion to print a previous holiday's photos, or pictures of people when they were younger. Whatever the occasion, by getting these images printed and placed in a personalised photo album can be a very well thought out gift. And a great opportunity to spend Christmas day looking through them together. If a photo album is not preferred then why not get a picture framed or made into a canvas. This is another great gesture that will last for years to come. Experience/Adventure Days Because Christmas is the time of giving, why not give someone something they may have always dreamed of doing. Although not exactly a personalised gift, it is a gift that is personal. Maybe they forgotten about wanting to learn to fly or even bungee. Then the variety of experience days that are provided can let anyone achieve this. The common experience days range from a day in a supercar, scuba diving, water rafting, 4x4 experiences, to many different spa days. The options are surprising and can be a great surprise on Christmas day. DIY Jewellery Although considered difficult and expensive, creating your own jewellery as a gift is in fact relatively simple and fun to do. Ranging from necklaces, bracelets, earrings to rings. The most simplest and most popular being the charm bracelet. Using string, or a silver bracelet and adding charms or beads can be a simple and interesting challenge, with endless possibilities. Why not trying using older and unused jewellery to experiment with and help add a personal touch. Engraved Gifts One of the easiest personalised gifts you can get someone during Christmas is a present that is engraved. This can range from the classic engraved cuff links, tankard and hip flask that men often receive. But think of it from another angle, if the person is getting a ring, watch or any other special and expensive gift then why not have it engraved. After opening the present, they will be very grateful and may not notice the specialised engraving until later, which will be another surprise. Gift Hampers Gift hampers are a simple choice and have been a great choice for many different occasion for many years now. But the importance and significance can come from making it personalised. This can be from a simple card stating who it is from, wishing them great luck during the Christmas season. Or one can make completely unique Christmas hampers that will be completely modified to help offer everything the person enjoys. This can range from a simple wine hamper to hampers with champagne and chocolates. Gourmet food hampers are increasing in demand, but don't forget that if you have a friend or loved one living overseas then why not get a hamper that represents the local delicacies and favourite foods. Most companies will allow for personalised wine bottles and champagne bottles. Also allowing the selection of the contents to be tailored and often the hamper itself.

Anniversary rings are a romantic investment into your future and the pieces purchased should be a reflection of your budget, personal taste, and statement you want to make wearing the pieces. What are Anniversary Rings? Anniversary rings are more widely known as eternity bands. They reflect and reaffirm the vows you took on your wedding day and are given to one another for any anniversary desired as another symbol besides your wedding bands, to wear that recommits yourselves to one another for eternity. They are not worn to replace your original wedding rings and bands, and are worn on the right hand or on the left hand next to your ring finger.

Such items as the pocket square and cuff links can set  a man apart and help give a unique and professional image. As suggested, the pocket square is an essential part of clothing when wearing a suit. As essential as wearing black socks. Many overlook the pocket square because of their insignificance and size, therefore not realising their actual purpose. Many may consider it to be too excessive or are too shy and therefore do not want to attract further attention to themselves. Whereas, in fact the pocket square can help demonstrate confidence and personal style. Choosing a specific colour that best matches your suit and tie.

So let's view the simple events and occasions where a pocket square can be worn. Firstly, any formal event whether this is a business meeting to a social gathering a pocket square should be considered essential. As much as the jacket and trousers.

15,Different Suit Combinations To Help Revitalise Your Wardrobe,shopping," When deciding on what to wear, many of us have the 'go-to' dress, suit or combination of clothes that feel right. But a problem with this mentality is that it limits the functionality of each piece of clothing. By realising the full potential of each and every individual piece of clothing and this includes accessories, it can be simple to increase the combinations and therefore adding to your wardrobe's potential. Let's specifically look at the suit. A simple choice of clothing that is generally worn at work and special occasions. Something that is placed at the back of the wardrobe and only generally used a few times a year, out with work. But there are many ways to increase the functionality of a suit, that can open many doors and occasions suitable to wear a suit. This can be achieved by simply replacing a shirt and tie with a t-shirt. Using a single coloured t-shirt with or without a pattern can compliment a suit greatly. Consider contrasting colours and possibly one of the many mens graphic t-shirts. Whatever your choice is ensure that it is age appropriate and provides an interesting alternative to the formal look. Because this will make a suit much more casual and comfortable. This can also be spread out into the accessories and shoes worn. By adding colour and accessories and help differentiate what is worn at work and what is acceptable within a casual social event. By switching the jacket can also provide another gain in opportunities. Its always worth trying to get  a second opinion, to ensure the styles not only match but it is stylish. Moving from the accessories such as watches and cufflinks, consider using a pocket square that can add extra flair and personality. Or even sunglasses, folded into the pocket. Don't forget that during the winter months gloves, scarves and hats are an easy opportunity to mix up not just dressing down a suit, but also giving life to your entire wardrobe. To finish, don’t forget about the type of shoes you can wear. In a working or formal environment the choice of a dark leather or brown leather shoe with a shine is the expectation. But because the goal is to aim for a casual look, simply changing your footwear is a quick win, having a huge impact. But what are the replacement options?, although controversial wearing a pair of dark Converse or tennis shoes work well with a suit. Providing a casual alternative to the work shoe. It can also provide a sense of individuality and style."
16,Five Quick Fashion Tips For Men,shopping," Being fashionable is often construed as difficult and hard to achieve, especially for males. But, simply following several key tips, it can be simple to ensure the latest fashion looks and seasons are simple to capitalise on. Lets view some simple tips that can help bolster your wardrobe and help prevent any fashion faux pas. The first tip, is to ensure every piece of clothing fits, comfortably. Begin by throwing away any t-shirt that are baggy, or simply too large. Ensuring your clothes are snug but not too tight is essential to making sure clothes fit. Although pyjamas are the exception. If you have a smaller build and this impacts the availability of the suits and other pieces of clothing you own, then always keep an eye out for slim fitting or tailored clothing. This ultimately helps provide a nice fit with no compromises. This is especially essential with shirts and suits. Secondly, remember to keep it simple. Thinking flared trousers are back in fashion or trying to re-kindle old fashion styles on your own is a serious faux pas. This also is similar to the amount of accessories that should be worn at any one time. Try picking accessories and jewellery that can help you stand out and help extend your personality. But be conscious of the amount and what you are wearing on the whole. For Men a stylish watch can be the perfect accessory, without going overboard when also combined with a ring. The third quick tip is detail. Putting effort into the amount of time you spend dressing yourself can be obvious and make everyone aware that, depending on the occasion, you are professional or casual. For example owning a quality suit should not be news to anyone, but by including a pocket square or even an iconic trench coat over the shoulders can demonstrate your ability to put clothing styles together. Another example can be to accommodate a suite jacket with jeans with a scarf. Taking into consideration the chosen colours. Being able to use the seasons and weather to mix clothing is also another potential to try new things. The fourth tip involves owning a quality pair of shoes. Many underestimate the power and confidence that a great quality pair of shoes can provide someone. When wearing a suit or formal wear a pair of brogues or any other type of leather shoes are a great eye catcher and setting a great statement. Not only in a formal setting, but smart shoes can be worn in many different conditions, such as smart casual wear. Including with a merino jumpers or a t-shirt with a suit jacket and jeans. Therefore don’t think that spending that little bit extra would be going to waste. Now time for the final tip. This involves not being shy and being able to ask others for help and for their opinions. It can be a great idea to go shopping with your other half or a friend to help get a second opinion when picking clothes. By doing this and trying on clothes you may not normally pick can help increase your wardrobes flexibility and allow for the ability to grow your style. Whilst having a second opinion to keep you right. These are just a few tips that can help you improve you style and avoid any fashion faux pas."
17,Top Gift Ideas for Teenage Girls,shopping," Contrary to what most women's magazines will tell you, not all girls like the same things: fashion, shoes, boybands, film industry celebrities, makeup, and holidays in seaside resorts. Heck, some girls don't even like boys! This is the 21st century, in which there is no room for gender stereotypes. This means, when it comes to gift ideas for teenage girls, you can't just buy a voucher for the local shopping centre or tickets to an upcoming gig without thinking about it first. You've got to put a lot more thought into gifts, and actually consider the person's personal interests as opposed to what media and trends dictate a girl of her age ""should"" like. To help get you on the right track to finding that perfect gift, here is a selection of presents received and approved by an array of very different young ladies over the years. Tina was 14 when she got the gift she remembers best from her teenage years. At the time she was really shy and only just discovering her interests, which were vary varied. Tina highly enjoyed when her mum took her to the ballet, at home she loved nothing more than listening to folk rock music, and over the weekends she spent time pottering around the garden with her gran. It was her father who excelled himself in the gift department. He realised her love for folk music and invested in a violin that Tina still plays to this day. The young lady joined the school orchestra and conquered her shyness by taking part in public performances. When Jenny turned 16, she'd just gone through her first major break up. It felt like everything she'd previously liked doing (playing computer games, cycling, baking) reminded her of her ex-boyfriend so she was on the lookout for new adventures and hobbies. Her best friend came to the rescue with a voucher for a surfing lesson. Jenny loved her time in the great outdoors and gradually learned to love cycling again too, helping her get over her heartbreak. Lesley was 19 when she attended her first beautician course, specialising in evening makeup. She had a part time job working as a waitress to fund her studies. When not at college, there was nothing she liked more than practising her newly acquired skills on friends and family. She was also keen on sports with her favourites being swimming and athletics. Lesley's friends chipped in for her gift: a nail technician's college kit complete with files, buffers, tweezers, a cuticle  knife and nail polish. This meant she could enrol in another course at the college, which she couldn't otherwise have afforded, and also had the means with which to practice at home. As you can tell from these examples, the best gifts seem to have a lot to do with timing. Fortunately, birthdays and Christmas don't come unannounced so in the run up to these occasions, be curious and find out what's going on in your dearest teenage girl's life. Get to know what she's been doing lately, listening to, seeing, visiting and otherwise passing her time with. It's attention to detail that will make it possible to buy or make that perfect gift she'll treasure."

20,Autumn Winter Party Outfit Ideas for Women,shopping," Autumn and winter are a time of year to look forward to when it comes to parties. Thanks to occasions like Thanksgiving, annual awards, and Christmas, social calendars have a tendency to fill up fast. But what should one wear to stay warm but look drop dead gorgeous during the coldest months of the year? Dresses To avoid freezing, it's important to keep yourself covered. This doesn't mean, however, that you can't get away with wearing a slinky dress. On the contrary, a slinky dress can look just as good when accompanied with a flirty shawl to wrap up in, or a shrug. To keep your lower half warm, make sure your dress is either floor-length, or short but worn with a pair of sleek tights in black or skin tone. Autumn and winter tones should be subdued: black, dark blues, deep purple, dark reds and browns. These look great set against pale skin. Accessorise with heavy jewellery and lots of sparkle. Trouser and Top Combinations If invited to a party where trousers will be considered appropriately formal attire, you're not at any risk of getting cold. Black trousers are best as they are so easy to combine with a top, and make for a classic classy look. Both fitted and wide leg styles can look gorgeous teamed with the right top, and high waistlines are a modern touch. For the top half, choose a low cut top in a statement fabric such as silk or velvet in a dramatic colour such as emerald green for a nice contrast to the simple trousers. Sequined blouses look equally fabulous. Still feeling a tad chilly? Throw on a fitted blazer to complete the look and ensure you stay warm. If you can pull it off, where this look with red lipstick for added pzazz. Outerwear Making an impressive entrance is one of the most fun moments of attending a party. While in the summer this is easily done by showing off some leg or revealing a tanned decolletage, in the autumn and winter fashion season, this is made a little more difficult due to the necessity of having to wear a coat. Unfortunately, we're not all in a position to arrive at a party in a toasty, chauffeur-driven car! You're sure to be noticed if you arrive wearing a fur or fake fur coat with a big collar, or a cape. These are among the most glamorous fabrics and are also sure to do the job of keeping you warm well. Alternatively, wrapping up in ladies leather jackets is also bang on trend, chic and sexy. For added warmth, choose styles with thick linings. Jackets can come in short or long styles, but look best when tight fitted. To ensure that wow moment upon your arrival, be sure to slip out of your outerwear seductively and with a smile."

1,Methods to Buy Juicers,shopping," If you're looking for juicers and reviews, you're probably looking to buy juicers.  There are many methods you can use to buy juicers, and we'll go over them here.  You can buy new or used to begin with.  Buying a used juicer isn't always a bad idea.  If you personally know the person you're buying the juicer from, then you should know how old it is, and what kind of shape it's in.   This could potentially save you tons of time searching through juicers and reviews trying to figure out which one is right for you!  You'll still want to research the juicers and reviews, so you know what kind of juicer you're getting.   Most people want to buy juicers new, and this is the best option unless you know someone to buy from. You can opt to buy juicers through Ebay, if you've already searched through juicers, reviews, and pricing to find exactly what you want.  Keep in mind though, unless you're looking to buy used juicers, you're probably going to find pretty near the same prices as you would anywhere else, and possibly without the guarantees.  Bottom line, Ebay may be great for many things, but it's probably not the best bet to buy juicers. You can buy juicers directly from a store as well.  This is not a bad option at all.  You do get whatever return guarantees the store offers, and the trusted name.  What they don't offer is varieties of juicers, reviews, and ratings to help you decide.  You also may not be able to buy the juicers at the lowest price possible. So research juicers, reviews, and pricing before you go to buy juicers! You can also buy juicers through the company website.  This is not a bad idea either.  Buying the juicer from their website will ensure any warranties will not be voided. If you've researched any juicers or reviews, you know that some companies will quickly void warranties!  If you buy juicers from the company website, remember the juicers reviews could be biased, faked, or embellished.   So don't base your research off just the company's website of juicers and reviews. You can also buy juicers from Amazon.  This method is highly recommended as well.  You can browse juicers, reviews, and pricing there.  You also know they are a trusted name to buy juicers from.  It's at least a great place to do some research.  The problem is, you can literally get caught up in hours of research going over juicers, reviews, and pricing before you get to buy juicers.  You can save time by going to some juicers reviews sites before you buy juicers!"
2,Between-Seasons Fashion Tips for Women,shopping," It's never easy to decide what to wear in the morning is it? But at certain times of year it's even more challenging than usual. These are the between-seasons phases at periods around the end of September and beginning of October, late April to mid May and others when the weather just can't seem to make up its mind. To help survive these challenging times, there are a few ideas us women can implement to make it that little bit easier for ourselves. Layering One of the keys to surviving ever-changing temperatures is layering. It can be so hard to guess just how cold or warm it is outdoors by peeking through your window in the morning. And online forecasts have a nasty tendency to be incorrect. There are so many places worldwide where mornings are chilly, offices are overheated and the weather considerably improves by the end of the day when it's time to go home. Wearing layers is ideal because you can peel them off and put them back on again to your heart's content. Layers are particularly effective if you wear modern fabrics, some of which have been specially developed to control body heat and moisture. Merino wool, for example, is known for its excellent moisture management, warmth and proper insulation even if damp. You can also buy thermalwear at outdoor shops to wear as a lower layer. If you really find yourself perspiring heavily, nip into the loo to take off your bottom thermal layer. Investment Pieces Some carefully selected garments can make it a whole lot easier to weather the between-seasons times of year. These are investment pieces that should be bought to last for years ahead so classic, adaptable styles work best. Trench coats are a fashion staple that are perfect to throw over a late spring or early autumn outfit, adding just the right amount of warmth. Their classic styling means they can be worn both to work and social outings. Leather jackets work similarly, but add an edgier feel to outfits. Bomber and biker jackets are great for wearing at the weekend. Good quality denim is also a between-seasons fashion essential. A sturdy pair of jeans in a dark denim can be dressed up with a blouse and smart blazer for work, or teamed with a pair of heels and glittery top for nights out. Obviously, they are also one of the most comfortable pieces of clothing to slouch around in at weekends."
3,Women's Style Advice: the Ultimate Winter Holiday Suitcase,shopping," Packing for a winter holiday is a tad more challenging than packing for a summer vacation, particularly if you've chosen the hand-luggage-only route that so many of us do these days for reasons of a money and time saving nature. Winter clothing has the inconvenience of being much heavier. To stay warm in the great outdoors we all love layering on our chunky knits, leather accessories, fur collars and alike. When it comes to packing for that winter weekend away or longer seasonal escape, there are a few practical choices we can all make to make life easier and avoid having to repack at the airport, having to put on an additional three layers ""thanks"" to luggage weight restrictions and arriving at our destination looking completely bedraggled. Layering Instead of wearing a thick and heavy woolen jumper, invest in a few thinner but warmer layers. Work your way up starting with thermalwear as the base layer. From then onwards opt for natural fabrics such as cotton or cotton blends that will let your skin breathe. Choose stretchy T-shirts or polo necks to keep you cosy. Top it off with a cashmere or mohair layer. These lovely natural materials are so light yet so very warm, and look great. Another feature is their versatility. A simple jumper or cardigan can be dressed up or down with jewellery and accessories such as scarves and shawls. Make sure your top level layer is easy to remove. Ideally, it should feature buttons or a zip so that you can slip it on and off easily when splitting your time between the indoors and the outdoors where temperature levels can vary greatly. Lower Body Instead of bringing heavy trousers, pack tights and leggings or lighter trousers to pair with them. This simple layering trick is one that most ladies in northern climates will admit to over the winter months. It's amazing how much difference  a pair of tights can make. For evening hours, you can throw a light skirt on over the leggings, or a jumper dress for a classy, French chic look. Outerwear If you can get away with bringing just a single pair of leather boots, that will save you so much space. Just make sure they're fully water-proofed and treated for salt that gets scattered on pavements to dissolve ice. Ideally, bring some polish along. It's lighter than an extra pair of boots! A womens winter coat should be stylish yet fully practical for chilly climates. Choose a style that reaches down to the knees for extra warmth around the waistline and below. Trendy styles include coats with asymmetric front and back hemlines. This adds a touch of fun to winter holiday wardrobes."

7,Mix and match your pieces of handcrafted jewellery,shopping," When you are choosing the right pieces of handcrafted jewellery to accessories your outfits it can become quite an art form.

8,Choosing the right freezer,shopping," Freezers have been an essential part of every home since they first appeared in their roughly modern incarnation at the hands of German engineer Carl von Linde during his research between 1873 through 1877. Even before that point freezing food had been, for centuries, one of the only effective ways of preserving it for any significant duration, and the process had often been essential to human survival. In modern times we tend to view our freezers more as a comfort than a necessity, and yet when they fail us we find ourselves immediately faced by a quite real and pressing predicament. Here, therefore, is a short guide on the subject of buying a new freezer, and knowing when to buy a new one. The first consideration to keep in mind is that while there is no ""expiry date"" on them, most freezers are expected to last roughly 10 years. If your freezer is nearing this date then you should give yourself over to the realization that it may be about time prepare yourself for finding a new one. Quite simply, the most reliable way to know that your freezer is due a replacement is as you could expect, if it stops freezing your food. When this time is upon you and you find yourself in need of a new freezer to see you through hopefully the next 10 years, then there are several things to take into consideration. Firstly you should keep in mind that while second hand freezers may be more affordable, they are generally less desirable for two key reasons. Firstly, of course, they will have a shorter than average lifespan by the time they come into your possession. Secondly, new freezers are simply more energy efficient - buying a freezer more than 5 years old would be detrimental in the long run. But if cutting down on freezer prices is a major concern for you, then fear not. There are more ways of achieving this goal than simply buying second hand. For one thing, sacrificing some space will cut your costs in half over the long term and most likely the short term as well, and there are certainly a good range of high-functioning mini-freezers on the market. As a final measure for attempting to maximize savings once you already have a freezer in your possession and aren't in the market for a new one, you can turn to the somewhat controversial strategy of ""freezer blocking"" - that is, to fill up all of the empty space in your freezer in an attempt to save energy. The basis of this idea being that the less air is inside your freezer, the less time and energy the compressor will need to spend in keeping the freezer cool, and as a result the less electricity will be consumed by the freezer. Freezer blocking has not been scientifically tested, but your energy bill should show the evidence of its effects after a few months."
9,A Short Introduction to Industrial Refrigeration,shopping," Get to know a few basics about the industrial refrigeration industry. What is the machinery used for, and what does it consist of? Common Applications Fully functional, high level industrial refrigeration plays an intrinsic role in the success of any business working in the food industry. From keeping fish fresh onboard trawlers at sea to ensuring bananas are allowed to ripen in a suburban warehouse, refrigerator plants are used worldwide for a whole host of purposes. Dairy products, for example, need to be kept chilled at all times. Most commercial, industrial and retail buildings will have an air conditioning system in place. This is one of the most common uses of refrigeration that is put to use to cool hot air. In manufacturing, refrigeration is an absolute must in many cases. For example, it is used to liquify gases such as methane, oxygen and nitrogen. You will also find sophisticated cooling equipment in oil refineries and chemical plants. Types of Refrigerants The most common refrigerant used is anhydrous ammonia, also referred to as NH3, R-717 or simply ammonia. It is the most economical of the lot, which contributes majorly to its wide use. The chemical has other advantages as well, such as its excellent heat transfer and latent heat properties. Ammonia, unlike some of its counterparts, is biodegradable and does not contribute to the destruction of the ozone layer. Propane and propylene are usually found in refineries or major chemical plants. As gases, their downfall is the high flammability so these refrigerants cannot be used in environments where fire and explosions can occur. Carbon dioxide is an environmentally friendly refrigerant as it is simply gas recovered from the atmosphere. It is predominantly used in situations where particularly low temperatures are required. Other types of refrigerants do also exist. Their use depends on individual situations and requirements. Refrigerator System Components At the heart of the system lies the compressor, occasional referred to as the vapour pump that takes care of pumping the refrigerant, lowering and increasing pressure. Various types of this exist, such as rotary screw compressors, piston compressors and diaphragm compressors. The evaporator plays an equally important role. It absorbs heat, allows heat to boil off the refrigerant to a vapour, and allows the heat to supercharge the remaining vapour. A condenser is needed to forbid sensible heat and latent heat from entering the system. The refrigerant metering device restricts the free flow of the refrigerant, ensuring only a safe and controlled amount is allowed to pass through the liquid line at any one time."

Pieces that can be seen worn in the summer are pendants, rings, necklaces and bracelets that all have a vintage style.  Because the clothes we wear in the summer are lighter, then our accessories are also lighter so bracelets are slim but will wear more than one at a time.

These details are just the kind of things you need to ensure your wardrobe always has a hint of classic cool about it. A well-cut suit is one piece of clothing that you’re guaranteed to get plenty of wear out of and seeing as your most expensive suits aren’t likely to be everyday wear, they are the perfect candidate for a little classic cool. Ignore flashy trends when it comes to choosing a suit and stick with a classic style that shows off your shoulders and back. Think Don Draper in Mad Men and rock a slim fitting suit with some serious style. Invest in extras such as cufflinks, a tie-pin or a card case if you’re ready to rock the look. Another look that shouldn’t be underestimated is the laid back cowboy. Don’t get carried away with a ten-gallon hat, but a pair of blue jeans, an understated shirt and some scuffed boots creates the kind of classic cool everyone wants a slice of. Accessorise with a brown leather belt with a hefty buckle and if you’re brave and it’s sunny outside you can even add a cowboy hat, but if you do, make sure your shirt and boots are plain.

12,How To Wear Tailored Leather Jackets,shopping," A good leather jacket can be your best fashion friend. Not only will quality leather last for years, but it will also turn out to be one of the most flexible items in your wardrobe. Don’t be scared of slipping into a tailored leather jacket and experimenting with your look. Women’s leather jackets come a in variety of cuts, including biker and boyfriend styles, but for a leather jacket you’ll be able to wear to a whole variety of places, a tailored one is your best bet. Team your leather jacket with a flowery, flowing dress for that boho chic look beloved of stars like Kate Moss and Sienna Miller. This works so well because the structure and heaviness of the jacket contrasts alluringly with the light, floaty fabric of the dress. Wear your hair tousled and free and pick some sassy boots for your feet and you have the perfect mixture of sassy and sweet. On warmer days, you can even make this look work with sandals, but only if you keep your legs bare and accessorise with a pair of statement sunglasses. A tailored leather jacket is also a great choice for women who work in busy offices as it can be beautifully coordinated with a skirt or trouser suit. For this look, think of high heeled boots and hair swept back off your face but avoid wearing too much jewellery as the look is already very powerful. When a chilled out jeans and t-shirt day rolls around you can throw your leather jacket over whatever you’re wearing. It will look especially lovely if you’re wearing three-quarter length jeans and a pair of ballet flats as you channel old Hollywood glamour. On the other hand, baggy jeans and a vintage band tee is a great way to let your hair down. For a more daring but equally casual look, swap your jeans out for a pair of leggings and wear an oversized belt loosely around your hips. For your top half, either a tee or a tunic top will look great and a pair of Converse or some demure heels will set the outfit off nicely. If you want to give your leather jacket a more casual feel, just push the sleeves up to your elbows and leave the zip or buttons undone. This looks even better if you’re wearing a large necklace or flowing neck scarf and gives you a great touch of seemingly effortless glamour. For the opposite effect, cinch longer tailored jackets at the waist using a belt and you’ll have a more professional edge instantly. When it comes to accessorising a leather jacket, there are few feistier choices than a pair of bright red lips, a wrist full of jangling bangles or a nice long pendant. The only thing to avoid is very small or fussy jewellery as it can look a little swamped and fiddly when you’re rocking a tailored jacket. There are so many ways to wear womens tailored jackets and also leather bomber jackets you’ll quickly find they will become one of your favourite fashion staples. It’s a good thing leather is so hard wearing, you might find you hardly ever want to take it off."
13,Putting Together The Perfect Work Outfits For Autumn,shopping," No matter how bad the weather’s been, swapping your summer wardrobe for your autumn and winter one can be a depressing task. That’s usually because autumn always has a ""back to school"" sense about it. Even if you’ve taken very little time off over the summer, July and August always seem to have a much more relaxed atmosphere than September or October. If the thought of facing your autumn work wardrobe is making you despair, perhaps it’s time to procure some new and exciting wardrobe additions. By investing in a few key items, you’ll soon be putting together the perfect work outfits for autumn. Don’t Skimp On The Basics Before you start your autumn shopping trip, make a quick list of the kind of outfit you feel most comfortable in at work. This might be a simple trousers-and-shirt combination, a blouse and skirt or simply a dress. Whatever you choose, establish the basics first and make sure you invest in a high quality outfit that suits your style and taste. For instance, if you favour wearing trousers to work in the winter, look at high quality pairs with flattering cuts and well-finished stitching instead of opting for the cheapest pair you see. Well-made trousers will usually last you much longer than cheaper options, and often hang better on your body. Steel grey is a good colour to choose for autumn, and tweed trousers are also experiencing a resurgence this autumn/winter. Both will look fantastic with a tailored white shirt, either a plain, button up variety with a collar or one with a little smocking detail on the front. Outerwear And Accessories Once you’ve got your basic work wardrobe items together, it’s time to think about outerwear and accessories. Opt for women’s tailored jackets rather than bulky duffel coats or parkas as they look more professional. If you choose a tailored jacket that’s fairly close fitting, you may even be able to wear a slightly oversize raincoat over it on rainy days and still retain an effortless sense of style. Shoes are also important: look for heels at a modest height, that won’t make too much noise in the office. And if you don’t have a good pair of winter boots, now’s the time to snap them up, though make sure that they’re office appropriate when you make your purchase. Finally, if your ideal work outfit is skirt-based, accessorise with some wooden bangles (glass and metal ones can be a little noisy). Or, if you favour dresses or skirts, a long necklace that you can double around your neck is a sophisticated option."
14,Tips On T-Shirt Fashion,shopping," Along with jeans, t-shirts are perhaps the world’s most ubiquitous fashion item – not bad for a garment that started out life as underwear. Since World War Two, t-shirts have gone from strength to strength, and today it’s rare to meet someone who doesn’t have a t-shirt in their wardrobe. But since they’re so common, it’s easy to become bored of wearing t-shirts quickly. Looking for new ways to wear a t-shirt? Here’s a few tips for men and women on t-shirt fashion. In Praise Of Plain T-Shirts For some men and women, there’s nothing better than a plain white t-shirt. It might sound boring, but plain white tees are versatile and timeless: they’ll never go out of style. But if you’re going to wear a plain white t-shirt properly, you’ll have to make sure the style suits you. For instance, most men plump for a crew neck white t-shirt with short sleeves as the default option. If you’re of a more muscular physique, you may suit a t-shirt that’s a little tighter in the body, while men with beer bellies should ensure their t-shirts are loose-fitting and several inches longer than waist-length, to provide ample coverage. In the same vein, women with large chests often look more flattering in a v-neck t-shirt with short sleeves or a scoop neck t-shirt with three-quarter length sleeves. It’s all about making sure that your body shape looks in proportion. Notably, some fashion experts suggest avoiding white altogether if you have a large chest as it may overemphasise your assets. It completely depends on your body shape, but if you think white t-shirts don’t quite suit you, try a dark colour instead. Black or navy, for instance, may have a slimming effect. Printed And Graphic Tees Tie-dye might have been big in the 1960s and 1970s, but since the 1990s printed t-shirts have become the norm. From slogans to characters from Sesame Street, there’s no limit to what t-shirts may have printed on them in 2012. If you’re replenishing your stock of t-shirts, look for graphic tees that suit your own personality. If you’re a music or film buff, look for t-shirts with prints of famous films and album covers. The cover of Joy Division’s album Unknown Pleasures, for instance, is a design that’s gained a lot of cache on t-shirts over the past few decades. If you want to go graphic-lite but need something more arresting that a plain t-shirt, go for a simple but colourful striped design instead. It’s also worth considering a t-shirt with a comic slogan, or a simple image – like a piece of fruit or a plant – as well to add another dimension to your t-shirt collection."

16,Men’s Guide to Geek Chic,shopping," There was a time when men shied away from embracing their geeky side, but this fairly recent fashion favourite means they no longer have to. Geek chic, which now has some close links to a few hipster styles, is a well-recognised sub-set of fashion and one well worth dabbling in. The biggest thing to remember about geek chic is the fact that less is more. This is a style that plays on old preconceptions of the geekiest computer programmers and design workers around, and if you embrace the style too enthusiastically, you might end up looking a little too authentic. The good news is that it’s incredibly easy to give yourself a little splash of geek chic. When you’re dressing for the office, swap your shirt for a graphic t-shirt, preferably one that references a comic book character, computer-related in-joke or an old gaming system, and you’re already half way there. Alternatively, go for a plain or striped polo shirt but instead of pairing it with a suit jacket, wear with a cardigan or V-necked jumper instead. On your legs, you want a pair of slim fitting trousers with a low rise and a tapered leg. Wear these with trainers such as Converse high-tops or a pair of lace up brogues. When you’re doing geek chic, you can also forget about most sock rules and wear a bright or pattered pair even when you’ve got dark trousers on. Corduroy trousers are another favourite, they’ve been lurking around in geek wardrobes for years and if you make sure they are long enough to gather at the top of your shoes and you pair them with a thin leather belt, they will look great for years to come. As with many looks, the devil is in the details and one of the most well recognised geek chic accessories is a pair of thick rimmed, slightly oversized glasses. However, only indulge in this trend if you genuinely do need prescription lenses, there’s nothing that will lose you more geek cred than faking a need for specs. Striped ties are another easy step into geekdom, just be sure you buy decent brands that are long and thick enough to shake off any schoolboy overtones. Keep your hair neat too, a tousled style is fine, but if you let it become too unkempt you really will look like you’ve been up all night playing games. Other looks that should most definitely be avoided are coloured suspenders (unless you are the kind of confident guy who’s looking for a serious style challenge), bum bags and pocket protectors. As a general rule, these are the kind of dorky looks that are best left to the geeks of yesteryear. Adding a touch of geek chic to your wardrobe is easy and with the help of graphic tees, a few carefully chosen accessories and some slim-fitting trousers, you’ll be ready to let a little of your inner geek shine through."
17,The leather jacket in popular culture,shopping," Leather jackets occupy a unique place in fashion history. They’re one of the few items of clothing that almost never go out of style, even though they do experience phases in their popularity. This is partly because of the special place leather jackets occupy in popular culture, particularly in films. If you’re wondering how the leather jacket became so cool, here’s a quick introduction. The history of the leather jacket Leather jackets are commonly thought to have been popularised by the military and pilots in the early 20th century. Indeed, some of the most iconic images of leather jackets are from World War Two, when they were nicknamed ""bomber jackets"" since they were worn by fighter pilots. During the war, leather jackets were reinforced with thick insulation, to protect pilots from cold weather while flying. However, leather jackets were also said to be popular in Russia with the Bolsheviks, and the exact origins are often disputed. The popularity of leather jackets in the immediate post-war period is often attributed to a combination of their wartime importance and their appearance on film. David Niven, for instance, glamorously sported a bomber jacket in the film A Matter of Life and Death (1946), in which he played a RAF pilot. Actor Jimmy Stewart – a real-life US bomb squadron leader during the war – also wore one in the 1957 film Night Passage, as did Marlon Brando in The Wild One (1953). But the most famous wearer of leather biker jackets in the 1950s was James Dean. His iconic turns in films like Rebel Without a Cause, coupled with his tragic death, only helped to boost the stylishness of the fashion item. Leather jackets after the 1950s Punk bands like the Ramones kept leather jackets fresh in the 1970s, as did films like Grease and the TV series Happy Days. And Tom Cruise’s fleece-collared leather jacket in Top Gun sparked a new trend in the 1980s. Leather jackets are still popular today, though they have largely lost the associations with the military. And since they are generally quite warm, leather jackets have become a practical choice as well as a stylish one with many people across the UK. Traditionally, leather jackets are made from animal hide. Today, leather jackets may be made from this material, but are more likely to consist of an imitation material like PVC or polyurethane. As a result, they’re usually vegan friendly and often cheaper than those made from real animal hide."
18,Handmade fashion jewellery in unusual and unique designs.,shopping," When designing a piece of handmade jewellery in the latest fashion the designer can let their imagination fly and create unique jewellery designs in bright and beautiful colours.  The materials that are used in these designs can go from acrylics to semi-precious stones. Gone are the days when we only wear handmade jewellery for special occasions and these pieces are traditional and crafted from precious metals like gold and silver set with precious stones.  Today fashion jewellery is created in unique jewellery designs from many different materials. One of the things that are very popular at the moment is acrylics as these can be made into any shape or any colour and they can come opaque or translucent. Acrylic can be used to make beads in any size, any colour and any shape and they can be made into any shape so these acrylic shapes can make fun and funky earrings, bracelets and necklaces. These acrylic beads and shapes let the designer’s imagination create unique jewellery designs that are limitless. Wood is one of the natural materials that can be used to make these pieces of fun and fashionable handmade jewellery.  These can be in there natural colours where the wood is only polished so that the natural beauty shows through inspiring the designer in there unusual designs. The wood can be made into beads and these can be left plain or they can be painted bright colours and some of these will have designs painted on them and these can be anything from geometrical to flowers or animals. Mixing the painted designs with the plain colours can produce some unusual jewellery designs with earrings, necklaces and bracelet jewellery in all the latest fashion designs. You can use these pieces of bright handmade fashion jewellery to brighten up a dull outfit or bring a little bit of colour to a dull day. Glass beads and pendants are another bright material that can be used to create bright and funky handmade jewellery.

Earrings can be made from buttons, bracelet jewellery from leather, necklaces from beads made from paper. Whatever the material the design has to be bright and beautiful and fun to wear and it has to make a unique fashion statement."
19,The Small Retailer's Survival Manual,shopping," In this tenth and final part of a series of articles about how to survive as a small retailer, I will summarize the main points from the articles and have a look at what the future holds. Retailing is one of the toughest businesses there is. The reason is that, although trade may be steady, it is a low margin business. This means you work long and hard for little reward. You are in a market where the customers are very knowledgeable about the products they are buying and the have a preset idea of what range of price they are prepared to pay. You are in a business where ""the big order"" never comes. All you can do is grow your business steadily and hope that a superstore doesn't open over the road and steal your customers. If you seriously struggling as a small retailer, the first thing to ask yourself is ""am I ready for the fight?"". If you have doubts, it may be time to quit right now. On the other hand if you are up for it, by working to your strengths as a small retailer and by hanging in there, the rewards may be better than you imagined. Some people bemoan the demise of small stores and blame the large chains for their downfall. Superficially this is true, but this is like Yahoo! blaming Google for its downfall (should it ever happen) or radio stations blaming television for losing audience and advertising revenue. I suspect that few of the people who want small stores kept as museums would be prepared to support them by buying goods from them if they are given the choice of better value for money in a chain store over the road. So get real. Forget blaming the opposition. You need to do this for yourself. You never know, you may one day expand your business into a large chain yourself - and then the little guys may all blame you! If you are struggling as a small retailer then the most obvious thing you need to do is to change what you do. Some changes may be low cost and easy, others may require you to invest in the business and will mean a lot of effort and commitment. The key thing is to compete with other stores by working to your strengths. The greatest strength a small local retailer has is that it is small and local. Large chains cannot be small and, although an individual branch is local, it's primary focus is to the company and not the community it serves. Large chains will never be good at buying local products. Fragmenting buying power from localities is a contradiction of the way large chains are structured. They buy in bulk for a large customer base spread over large areas - that is why their prices are competitive. On the other hand, a small retailer can forge links with local producers. There may be a factory down the road that makes toy cars (OK then, a factory down the road that imports and packs toy cars that are nowadays made in China). You may also have a local dairy that sends their milk to a large store chain but may be happy to sell you a few pints each day. Explore your locality - you may be surprised at what you discover, and the bargains that you can negotiate by going straight to the source rather than through a wholesaler. Offering your customers local products is a good way of demonstrating one of your greatest strengths and having your own unique selling point (USP). You may even be first in the queue for new product trials. This will give your store a very specific and potent USP. A small retailer can't offer the lowest prices. This is usually impossible in the face of the buying power of large chains. What a small retailer can offer is intelligent pricing. You may reduce prices at certain times of year or even on certain days of the week. You could offer a buy-one-get-another-product-free deal by combining healthy sellers with less healthy ones. What you need to do is avoid giving customers the impression you are always more expensive than the large chain down the road. By majoring on price reductions for limited time periods you will give a quite different impression: your store will be a place where customers can often pick up a bargain and where most days there is a bargain price being offered somewhere in the store. Be just as nimble with your product range - it should never be set in stone. Be prepared to strike out poor sellers and try out new lines. Change the range when there is a major festival such as Christmas in order to accommodate different buying patterns. Remember, though, to keep changes limited and as gradual as possible so that customers can still find what they want and don't feel excluded. Get to know your customers' buying habits and anticipate demand patterns. Keep a close eye on possible out of stocks and react quickly when out of stocks occur. Customer service is one area where you have the ability to beat larger store chains. No matter how well they treat their customers and how polite they are, you can treat them even better and be even more polite. The same goes for hygiene: make your small store a beacon of cleanliness. You'll be amazed how many customers you will win over by having a spotlessly clean store. Also, consider extending customer service by having a home delivery service, perhaps teaming up with other local retailers. You may consider refitting your store, but before you dive in, make sure you employ good people to do the job. A refit can be a nightmare but, when it is done well and for the right reasons, it can do wonders for your sales and profits. For more latest news, check out myretailmedia"
20,Bracelets a beautiful piece of handmade jewellery.,shopping," There are many different types of handmade jewellery, earrings, pendants, necklaces, brooches and of course bracelets. Bracelets are one of the most versatile pieces that can be worn both buy the young and old and come in many unique designs. A bracelet is a piece of jewellery that is worn around the wrist and can be crafted from may different types of materials and different designs. You can have bangles that are usually made in one piece and these can be carved out of wood, a semi-precious stones or made from glass. Cuff designs made from metals like gold, silver, copper, brass and you can see these design crafted from leather. Charm bracelets are also very popular and these can be found with beads or charms or a mix of both.  Bracelets are worn by both women and men. The word bracelet comes from the Latin word brachile which means arm. If we look back through history we can see that both Roman and Greek soldiers wore bracelets that had been handmade from soft leather straps and to these were added designs that were inlayed with gold and silver. Woman would wear small versions and only on the wrist now up their arms and many of these designs were crafted from precious metals and set with semi-precious gemstones and so the bracelet was born. Today the modern day bracelet can be found in many forms and is one of the most popular pieces of handmade jewellery. We have mentioned charm bracelets and in the last few years these have become very popular and can be found in many forms. The traditional designs where made from a heavy gold bracelet that was made from chain that had large links. On these links would be placed charms and these would come in many forms. These would be given to you on special occasions to celebrate a birthday or anniversary or a special event. The charm usually symbolised something like an Eifel tower if you had paid a visit to Paris, a rose if that was your favourite flower or something with a secret meaning and these pieces of unique handmade jewellery were treasured as there was a lot of sentimental value with them along with the monetary value.  Today you will see these that have been crafted from many different types of materials, silver is very popular and to these are added charms in plain silver and many that have been enamelled with beautiful bright colours. Some of these charm bracelets have lots of beautiful beads added to their unique and original designs and now you are able to purchase bracelets that only have beads. This is a single bracelet that opens so you can add beads that have a large hole through the centre. You will find handcrafted bracelets that have been made from precious metals like gold and silver and you will find these in simply elegant designs or you can find some with intricate engravings. These precious metals are also used as settings for semi-precious gemstones and sometimes crystal beads to add shine and shimmer to the unique piece of handmade jewellery. Bracelets beaded from both glass and semi-precious beads are also very popular and many of these designs have the beautiful beads strung on elastic so that they stretch and will fit any wrist size. This is one of the reasons that make them so popular because it means you can by anyone of these pieces and know that it will fit. It also means that you could buy a bracelet beaded onto elastic as a gift and be confidant that it will fit the recipient. Bracelets of every kind can be worn in for both casual and formal events on their own or with another complimenting piece of handmade jewellery."

1,"Kelty Child Carriers - New Kelty Pathfinder 3.0 and Journey 2.0, What's Changed?",shopping," The new Kelty Child Carriers are here! And their popularity is growing fast. The Pathfinder 3.0 and Journey 2.0 are the newest additions to the Kelty Child Carrier line up. They offer all of the same features that the older Kelty FC 3.0 and 2.0 offered, with a few bonus features that will make our outdoor adventures that much more fun. Well, first of all, these two new Kelty Child Carriers still offer all of the same features that made the Kelty Child Carrier so popular to begin with. For instance, the auto-deploy kickstand, height adjustable set, and sliding torso-adjuster. The new Kelty Child Carriers also offer the same V-Bar structured cockpit, also known as the roll-cage. Both still offer the sophisticated suspension system capable of carrying up to 50 pounds, and Kelty's signature rain/sun hood. The waist belt and shoulder straps still offer plenty of padding, and the back panel is still thermo-formed for comfort. So, what's new? So What's Changed? The child safety harness on these two Kelty Child Carriers is definitely an improvement. You now have buckles at the chest that allow you to unclasp the shoulder straps, and easy-access leg loops that buckle over the legs. In other words, you no longer have to feed little arms and legs through small openings. Both the Pathfinder 3.0 and Journey 2.0 Kelty Child Carriers also offer hydration pack storage behind the back panel, as well as an easy access water bottle pocket located on the waist belt. The storage capacity is pretty much the same, except that the Pathfinder 3.0 Kelty Child Carrier now offers a zip off day pack with two zippered pockets of its own, as well as two mesh water bottle pockets on the sides. How Much Do They Cost? With all the added features you'd expect a much higher price tag, but that's the thing, these two new Kelty Child Carriers are about the same price as the old ones. They cost roughly $30 dollars more than the previous models, depending on where you get them. Now the Pathfinder 3.0 Kelty Child Carrier does cost about $50 dollars more than the Journey 2.0, but that's because you get the zip-off day pack as well."

Painite is another gemstone that is quite rare and is not widely used in handcrafted jewellery designs. The lovely smoky colour has deep hints of gold, amber and this is one of the rarest stones on the planet so it is obvious that this is going to be one of the most expensive. Black Opals are stunning with their myriad of sparkly colours and these are a lot rarer than the white opal.

This stones shine and shimmer in the light making it a very popular gemstone to use in the making of handcrafted jewellery.

5,Handmade and handcrafted Celtic jewellery.,shopping," Handcrafted jewellery has always had a very special place in Celtic life. We can see this because of all the items that have been found in burial tomes and in sacred religious settings that have been very important in the Celtic history. These pieces of handmade jewellery were worn by both women and men unlike today when jewellery is prominently worn by women. The crafts men of the ancient Celts were very talented and skilled and produced some amazing pieces of jewellery considering the equipment and materials that were available to them.  These pieces were produced with the popular Celtic patterns and themes and these stunning designs are still produced today in the same way. If we are to think of a piece of handcrafted Celtic jewellery our first thought might go to the famous Celtic ring. This ring has great significance and can be given on an engagement, as a betrothal rings, and as friendship rings. These are predominately a European thing but in the last few years the demands for these designs have become worldwide.  These traditional handmade Celtic rings have very beautiful intricate designs of spirals, knots, scrolls and chevrons and all of these have a special meaning and significance. The most popular and well known of these designs is the Celtic knot and the significance of this lies in obscurity and no one knows it’s true meaning or origin.  Some scholars say that the knot symbolizes all the interconnections of life in all forms both in nature and in relationships. The connections of nature were very important to the Celts. Many of these references are seen in myths and legends but no clear theme has been emerged from this. Celtic crosses are seen on many pieces of handcrafted jewellery and this is no ordinary cross it is quite unique to the Celtic culture. This Celtic knot work is found in designs that pre date Christian times. The designs of these crosses have equal arms that have been enclosed by a full circle. This is known to symbolise and represent the four corners of the earth and the four elements which are air, water, earth and the forth being fire.  The circle that is around the cross symbolises infinity and also represents the path of the sun to the sky. This is a contrary mix of designs both the religious Christian symbolism and also the mystical. This cross design was not only used in making pieces of handmade jewellery like pendants, necklaces, engraved on bracelets and in charms but it can be seen on pottery and in the designs of handcrafted fabrics. The next most popular design used in the making of handmade Celtic jewellery is the pentangle and this is a five pointed star and this star sits within a circle and again this is said to represent the five sacred elements, fire, water, air, earth and also the spirit. It also represents the five stages of our lives. These five stages are birth, the coming of youth, the coming of adulthood, aging and finally death.  This pentangle sign has its roots in paganism and is also associated with Wicca. Many of the pieces of Celtic jewellery have designs of animals and these are used to represent various aspects of life.  Handcrafted jewellery will contain motifs of a geometric motif and these play a large part of the designs and these have been the inspiration for these beautiful pieces for centuries.  You will find single spirals, dual spirals, triple centred spirals and chevrons that look like arrowheads. These designs of arrowheads were used by hunters and warriors as good luck charms. These designs can still be seen today in modern pieces of handmade jewellery and you will see them on earrings, bracelets and pendants and the metal that is commonly used to create these beautiful pieces is silver."
6,How to find the perfect jewellery for you,shopping," Finding the perfect jewellery can be difficult when there’s such a wide selection to choose from. Whether you’re on the High Street or shopping online, the sheer number of retailers available means you’re rather spoilt for choice. Whether it’s something traditional or a more contemporary piece, there is, quite literally, something for every taste. But when it comes to choosing something for a more special occasion – such as a wedding – you want to be sure that you get something that’s just right. Many jewellers will be happy to help, but there’s a vast difference between wearing something in a shop for a few minutes and owning an item indefinitely. Indeed, even the light in the showroom can affect the inherent lustre and qualities of the piece, meaning that it can look a lot different when seen under the unforgiving glare of daylight. This is particularly the case with gemstones, as these will often have a varying luminescence depending on the type and quality of light that refracted off of them. Though it might be difficult persuading the jeweller to let you venture into the street for a better look at an expensive ring, he might well accompany you to the window, so you can admire the various tones from the safety of the shop. You also need to think about the material of your jewellery item. If you want to wear it with other pieces in your collection, then you either need to find something that perfectly complements or contrasts with them. Different shades of gold are notoriously tricky to match and failing to do so could have you end up looking like a less stocky version of Mr. T. This is certainly the case with yellow or rose gold, as they are often subject to a lot of variation depending on the purity of the mix. White gold and platinum are easier to match up, but even here, there is a notable difference between the two materials and pairing them in close juxtaposition will only end up looking gaudy. Matching different styles can also be difficult and this is sadly one of the reasons why so much jewellery is sold for scrap. Contemporary designs from a little as the early nineties are very much out of fashion and the erstwhile trend for looped earrings and chunky bangles goes some way to show that it’s not always the best idea to buy purely according to fashion. Unless you like the inherent qualities of a piece of jewellery, then you’re better off saving your money for another time."
7,About semi-precious stones and there us in creating handmade jewellery.,shopping," Semi-precious stones have been treasured for many years and have been used as a form of adornment for as long.  A gemstone or as we will refer to them as semi-precious stones  are a natural mineral and when these beautiful stones have been cut and polished they are used to create stunning pieces of handmade jewellery. Not all semi-precious stones are strictly gems and they do not all sparkle and shine, natural minerals such as Opals and pearls but neither the less they still come under the heading of semi-precious stones.  After these natural stones have been cut and polished they are used set in precious metals to make earrings, bracelets, pendants, necklaces and jewellery sets. The value of the semi-precious stones will depend on many different factors. One of the determine factors is how rare the stone is, like everything in life the rarer it is the greater its cost. Gemstones like beautiful Rubies and Emeralds are available to us in smaller amounts than Diamonds and this is the reason why they are more expensive. If a stone is in vogue then this may add to its cost as it becomes a piece of semi-precious jewellery that everyone is looking for. The colour, the clarity and the quality of the cut are all factors in the cost of the stone and also its aesthetic nature and if it has both of these the cost will be very high. These stones can be cut and polished into beads and pendants. Some of the semi-precious stones that we use in the making of handmade jewellery are Turquoise, Rose Quartz, Amethyst, Tigers Eye and Amazonite. These can be used on their own or they can be set into precious metals. The beautiful natural colours of these semi-precious stone can create stunning semi-precious jewellery designs like earrings crafted from Rose Quartz cabochons, Rings set with polished Black Onyx stone, necklaces that have the lovely blue stone of Turquoise set into a unique and original sterling silver setting or a bracelet that has been handcrafted from beads made of Tigers Eye. A sparkling Diamond is the typical gemstone we think of when we think of a typical gemstone and the value of this determined in different ways than other gemstones. The Diamond has been highly valued more for its physical properties of hardness, its stunning clarity, and beautiful brilliance. Other gemstones like Rubies and Sapphires are judged on different qualities such as their depth of colour but in the case of all these stones the larger the carat then higher the value and this will determine the price of the piece of handmade jewellery they have been set in. These beautiful stones can be used on their own in a semi-precious jewellery designs or they can be mixed and matched creating unique and original jewellery designs. You will find Ruby rings where large single Rubies have been surrounded by small diamond.  Pearl earrings that have diamonds added for sparkle and glamour. It could be a bracelet with a mix of gemstones making a colourful piece of unique handmade jewellery. The same rule applies to pieces of semi-precious jewellery, the natural stones can be used on their own or they can be used in combinations mixing colours and also shaped and size of beads. Pendants of one stone can be set in the centre of a beads necklace of another stone or a total mix of stones can be used. Adding pearls and crystal beads to the mix can give a totally different look to the piece of handmade jewellery making it unique in design.  The possibilities are endless and it will all depend on your personal choice and style."
8,Diabetic Socks Are Useful For Protecting Your Feet,shopping," One of the major mistakes that diabetics make is to neglect the seriousness of the disease. Although medication can keep blood sugar level under check, the disease can cause a lot of internal harm such as nerve damage, blood vessel damage, and much more. The feet of diabetics are at a risk of infections because of a condition called diabetic neuropathy. This is the condition in which diabetic people lose sensation in their toes because of nerve damage and lack of proper blood flow. Feet are also vulnerable to infections, which could spread to the blood. In order to avoid such problems, it is very important to take good care of the feet. The use of diabetic socks is one way of doing it. What are diabetic socks? Diabetic socks are specially made socks for people suffering from diabetes. These socks are a combination of cotton, wool, nylon and elastic so that the feet are very comfortable and dry. The composition of fabrics in these socks gives them good absorption capability which prevents sweat logging and infections.  In the past, it was believed that cotton or wool socks were good for diabetics. However, research has proved that cotton and wool should not be used by diabetics because they retain sweat, germs and odor, which is a deadly combination for high blood sugar patients. Similarly, nylon socks were also not recommended because they do not absorb sweat and the feet remains moist. In order to remedy all these lapses in different kinds of fibers, special socks with a combination of different fabrics have been designed. Considering the response, these socks for diabetics have proved effective in keeping feet comfortable. Why are these socks a necessity? Cotton and wool socks tend to be harsh on the skin, especially at the seams and the soles of the feet. They make the skin raw and bruised with regular use. Small injuries or cuts can aggravate the already fragile diabetic feet. People who suffer from neuropathy do not have much sensation in their feet because of damaged nerves that frequently occurs in diabetics. As a result, sometimes diabetics do not even notice or realize injuries has occurred on their feet. Wearing wrong socks can worsen this condition and cause very harmful repercussions. The fabric used for making diabetic socks is usually hypoallergenic, which means that they do not cause allergies on the skin. The fabric is light and breathable. So, sweat build up does not happen. Artificial dyes and chemicals are for the most part not used in the manufacture of these socks. In order to enhance comfort, the toe area is wide. This gives the toes enough space to move around. Diabetic socks are of the right thickness, which helps to relieve pressure on the feet compared to regular socks. All these factors make them highly beneficial and important for diabetics.  Diabetic socks are a combination of functionality, comfort and safety. Investing in a few pairs can be a major preventive measure against common diabetic foot problems."

13,How to Look Fashionably Great Without Spending a Lot,shopping," We all know that your choice of clothes would create a very significant impact on your expenses. Shopping could be the most fun activities that girls find however, after going into your wallet and credit card statement, you would half-wish that you shouldn’t have spent so much.  Many of us have this notion that the more expensive your clothes and accessories are, the better it would look. However, it all would depend on how you project it. A lot of us don’t even notice that this woman is just wearing a top that is less than $10 and yet, the way she wears it looks so expensive on her. Furthermore, I would more than agree that in this economy we have, we cannot afford to lose that hard earned money we have. On the other hand, we do have our wants and one is to look fashionably good. So, how could we make both ends meet? As a frugal fashionista myself, I try to several options that would lead me to saving more and to look chic enough. Here are some tips that you too could also use as you venture into another spending mode when it comes to fashion. 	Try to purchase as well cheap clothes at some thrift stores 	Go on and venture into different shops looking for bargains or on sale items, also try to buy some clothes which have that classic look so it won’t wear out any time of the year. There are a lot of stores and consignment shops that are available in most of the areas. You would find really great clothes once you have the gut power to rummage through their items. 	Aside from those big malls and other large enterprise retailers, look into those small boutiques or stores. They have a lot of unique and handmade clothes that are affordable. 	Online coupons and deals are very popular nowadays. Look up into some websites that offer coupons or promotional codes. These are very useful! There are some codes that would give you free shipping or simply some that gives you at least 20-40% of its retail price. You would definitely have great savings once you do that. All you have to do is search for it online and type in promo codes or coupons.  However, I would say that it is usually better to look for such codes after you have already decided on what to buy. 	Do you know why French women always look stylish? That is because they just buy few of the classic clothes that they really want with the best quality for which they could afford. From there, they would be using it many times or for several years, using different accessories, these looks would vary from time to time. If you are wondering what those pieces are then here is a must-have list for French women: o	A white tailored top o	A black jacket o	Perfect jeans o	Sweater – preferably cashmere o	The rest are just inexpensive clothes which they could buy like some shirts, etc. 	Another thing you should do is to update your clothes from last year. Do your own mix and match. Those accessories, again, could create fresh look.  You could use some belts, funky necklace, etc. You could also have some of your clothes retailored. For example, if that flowing skirt last year was so popular and now has gone out of fashion then let the tailor do some readjustments and have it created into something fashionably new. 	Lastly, the key to saving is to really take extra care of the clothes. Many of us don’t really bother to have a stain washed immediately from our clothes, we just opt to leave it there and never wearing it again. If we take care of our clothes, it might just very long. You could save a lot of money instead of spending so much on clothes every year. Here are some tips tat you might want to do to your clothes: o	Washing your clothes in cold water is gentler on the fabrics o	Wash only if it is really dirty. You don’t have to wash each piece every time you use it to avoid wearing it quickly. o	Don’t forget to zip those items that have zippers so that the items won’t get snagged in the washer. 	Lastly, when you go shopping, make a list of what you really need so that you won’t have to splurge into something that you would see immediately."

Agates are formed in bands that resemble the band growths you would see in a tree and are formed in a myriad of stunning natural colours making it an ideal stone to use in jewellery making. The Agate stones are created when gas bubbles from inside the cooling lava meets salted water. The gas bubbles mixed with the salt water when mixed turn into a gel.

Because Agate is a natural stone the colours can vary significantly with each stone and this is all depending on the distribution of the minerals within each band. The minerals in the stone are what determine the natural colours. Minerals that contribute to the colouring are: iron oxides which produce bright reds, browns, black and shades of green, magnesium will give us pinks, violets and again black, chromium creating stunning colours of green, yellow and red, titanium produces a deep blue, cobalt will give use reds and purples, nickel gives us green, and copper produces red, blue and amazing shades of green.

19,Review Of The Kindle Fire – Solution To A Gap In The Tablet Market,shopping," Since Amazon released the original Kindle in 2007, there has been a lot of excitement surrounding their e-readers and an astounding amount of worldwide sales to go with it.  Amazon has since upped the ante by releasing their first tablet, the Kindle Fire, at the end of 2011 to compete with the likes of the Samsung Galaxy, Motorola Xoom and RIM's Blackberry Playbook, not to mention the market dominating Apple iPad. So does it offer you what its competitors do? First and foremost, I’d like to point out that the device on a whole is a fantastic product when you consider all of its features and the astounding price of just $199. It immediately stands out from the crowd with the iPad 2 for example starting at $430.  It however does not come complete with all the features that the higher end tablets do. Now we’ll take a look at the Kindle Fire specifications to see how it holds up. Aesthetics: The Kindle Fire looks and feels great!  Despite its cheap price, it defies the expectation of looking or feeling cheap.  It’s not the lightest tablet available, but I certainly wouldn’t call it heavy and it is easily held in one hand for long periods of time. It has a high-resolution multi-touch 7 inch screen with a wide viewing angle.  Given its size it’s great for reading, browsing and some apps, but movies and games are probably more trilling on larger devices. Performance: The Kindle Fire uses the TI OMAP 4 dual-core processor so operates at a very competent speed (1 GHz). It runs on a customized version of Android 2.3 OS which many of us are already familiar with. Put these two together and you have one very efficient machine.  If it wasn’t already fast enough, Amazon have ingeniously devised a new web browser exclusively for the Kindle Fire which has allowed for seamless exploring on the internet. They call it Amazon Silk. Through the built-in Wi-Fi, Silk does all the loading on Amazon’s remote servers so that your device doesn’t have to.  This means not only lightning web browser speeds but longer battery life as well. On that note, it’s worth mentioning that Amazon has said you can expect 8 hours of continuous reading and 7.5 hours of videos before your battery requires charging. I found this to be pretty spot on. In comparison this falls a little short of the iPad’s battery life by 2 hours. The Kindle Fire also falls short when it comes to memory.  With only one option in the range and having 8GB of storage, 6GB of which is usable, there isn’t a lot of space to keep an abundance of movies and songs etc. With the competing 16, 32 and 64 GB iPad options, this may be something we can expect to be addressed in later versions of Fire.  My only other qualm with its performance is that apps aren’t quite as fast on the Fire as they are on other devices in the higher value range of the market. To be fare though, the internet browsing experience is compensation enough. Additional Features & Benefits: While iTunes is tough to beat, the Kindle Fire has a couple of tricks up its sleeve.  As Kindle products run on the Android system, users have access to the Google Android App Market.  They also have access to Amazon’s Appstore which offers over 20 million movies, TV shows, songs, magazines, and books, and thousands of popular apps and games, including Netflix, HBO GO, Hulu Plus, Pandora, and more. To top it all off, I introduce Amazon Prime. A new platform that runs on Kindle products where by members receive many benefits such as the ability to borrow an e-book each month for free, and unlimited streaming of over 10,000 movies and TV shows at no extra cost.  It also has a feature called Amazon Whispersync which allows you to start streaming a movie on your Kindle Fire, then resume from where you	left off on your TV.  New buyers of the Kindle Fire get 1 month free membership to experience Amazon Prime. What the tablet is missing compared to its competitors is the ability to connect to the 3G network.  The Kindle Fire only has Wi-Fi capability which is a set-back if you are without a decent connection. It also is missing a camera; however the Fire is not intended for the same functions as other tablets so I fell this may be harsh criticism. In summary; Amazon has not intended to go beyond the other tablets on the market with their Kindle Fire, far from it in fact.  They have instead come up with a brilliant alternative catering for those with a need for a device somewhere between a basic e-reader and an iPad.  They have very successfully created a middle ground for those on a budget or someone looking for a simple device which will perform their basic needs with efficiency. And all at the generous price of $199. Following my review of the Kindle Fire, I would happily recommend the device to anyone. It is an excellent tablet to use for movies, music, TV, books, magazines, apps, games and browsing, and a strong adversary for the other tablets especially with upgrades and later versions to come. For only $199, why wouldn’t you want one!"
20,Why Need One Osprey Backpack,shopping," With the new school year getting ready to start you will find yourself searching around for all of the supplies your child will need to begin the term. While paper, pencils, and notebooks may be easy to locate, more specialized items can be a little more difficult. Backpacks come in many different shapes, styles, colors, and sizes. While a basic backpack can be found at most stores selling back-to-school supplies, a specific design such as an Osprey backpack may take a little more legwork. One of the easiest ways to locate such an item is to do an internet search. Type in the keywords ""Osprey backpack"" into a search engine and see what results come up. You can also try keywords that include ""for sale"", ""retail"", or ""back-to-school"". You will get a list of places online where backpacks with ospreys on them or in the shape of ospreys can come up. You may have to special order the backpack from an individual or company that makes customized items. This will usually cost more than if you purchased a basic pack from a storefront or online. It may also take longer to arrive when you order it because it is made after you pay for it and not before. Calling around to your local office supply storefronts is also a way to find what you are looking for. They can put you through to an employee working in the backpack department and you can ask if they have anything like what you are looking for. This may take longer than doing an internet search will, but if you find the object you won't have to pay shipping like if you ordered it online. Another way to find what you are looking for is to ask other parents and students where they got their items. If they have the same pack you are looking for, or something similar, you can find out where they got it and hopefully buy one of your own there. You can also ask if they got the item on sale and if they have had any issues with it that you need to know about. While an Osprey backpack may be harder to find than a basic pack, if that is what you are looking for there are ways to find it. You just need to be willing to spend some extra time considering your options, doing some research, and locating what you want."

2,Neon No Show Socks,shopping," There has been an evolution of popular sock styles over the past decades. Anyone failing to adhere to the social ""sock code"" was at risk for dealing with the stigma that sometimes comes with nonconformity. Knee socks coming to just below the knee put in an appearance in the sixties, followed by tube socks with no stitched in heel during the seventies, then bulky crew socks and ankle socks that accessorized stirrup pants appeared in the eighties. The latest generation has developed an attitude of tolerance to diversity that has extended to clothing and footwear. Now white socks, colorful socks, ankle socks and no show socks are all accepted as the norm, but no show socks boast a greater popularity than many other styles. If they are neon colored socks and low cut, it is just that much better. These lower socks that come up to just below the line of the shoe are favored for many reasons. Some people believe that the line of the sock parallel to the top of the shoe adds another line across the ankle and leg that is unflattering. Others feel a visible sock can detract from the appeal of a good shoe. Some like the fact that they can avoid a tan line and the white ankles that result when higher socks are worn. Others claim that socks that are not visible eliminate wasted time trying to match up pairs for aesthetic reasons. Last, there are those who claim to like the fact that they quickly slip over the foot with no fuss. Socks, even low cut socks, are an opportunity to make a fashion statement to the world. When they are colorful socks, or even neon color socks, they have a bright fun appeal. Buying a pack with 6 pairs or more socks allows the wearer to mix and match the colors for a subtle touch of the outrageous. When the time comes to remove shoes, someone wearing an amusing mix of socks can tell the world they look for the fun in life. When shopping for a quality pair of white or colored socks, there are features to consider. Worthy no show socks will stay put and not slip off of the heel, so it makes sense to check for quality fabric and firm elasticity. A shopper should examine the toe of the sock for smoother seams that will not be irritating. If value is a concern, multi packs makes sense. Packs that have 6 pairs of socks usually provide a better deal. Whether wearing white socks, or colored socks, or ankle socks, or socks that barely cover the heel, it is important to find the pair that best provides the most comfort and coordinates with the lifestyle of the wearer."
3,The Top 5 Affordable Cigar Lighters,shopping," The Five Best Cigar Lighters So you've taken a liking to the wonderful world of fine cigars. Initially, the aromas, relaxation, and fellowship pulled you in so you bought a few sticks. Of course your collection quickly grew and now you find yourself in a full-on hobby, a tasty hobby, I might add. One thing you might not have anticipated from all this stogie madness is all the little things that go along with cigar smoking: the humidor, cutter, and lighter, just to name a few. And while there are just too many aspects of the cigar world to consider for this article, I thought I might give a few pointers in the way of the all-important cigar lighter, possibly the most important cigar accessory you can own (tied with the humidor of course). First of all, there are many ways to light a cigar, some better than others, and some you simply shouldn't try (trust me, I've lit my stogies in ways I care not to mention). Now I'm sure you've heard this already, but I'm going to mention it anyways - throw out that Bic lighter! Cigars deserve more respect than that, they have special needs… Kerosene and other oil-based lighters (Zippos) should not be used for cigars as it taints the flavor of the cigar. Matches can be used to light up, but avoid sulfur tips (strike anywhere) as they too will have a foul taste. Another downside to matches is you'll end up using half the box if you're going to get a proper light. Some will light cedar sticks called ""cedar spills"" and use these to light the cigar, but most choose a butane torch lighter; clean-burning, easy to carry, and affordable for the most part… this is what you want. What to look for When making that vital decision of what lighter to purchase, you'll notice right away there's a lot of options out there! From the widely varying prices, to size, brand, and more, there are generally five factors I watch for. Look/size: You're going to be using this thing a lot (I hope), make sure it's something that catches you're eye. It should also be easy to fit in your pocket, so don't get some ridiculous dragon-shaped torch… Ease of Use: Again, you will be using this often, a good lighter should be simple to fill, open, and light. Look for lighters that open and light simultaneously if you really want to avoid a hassle. Flame Count: This is entirely up to the individual, one flame will take longer to get the cigar started but works great for those fine touchups. Three flames will get you up and running with no questions asked. Like you might expect, two flames is kind of like the best of both worlds! (in my opinion) Fuel Capacity: Something you might not think to look for, a small fuel size can get rather annoying rather quick. A good lighter should be able to handle a table of cigar smokers no problem. On the other hand, a lighter can get fairly bulky with a large fuel tank, try to find a good balance. Reliability: This is the most important factor for a good lighter. What's the point in a lighter that doesn't light?! The best lighters light every time, no exceptions. And while the top-of-the-line lighters are generally the most reliable (naturally), a dependable lighter can be found at a decent price, you just need to know where to look. Consequently, a ""cheapy"" lighter is almost guaranteed to be unreliable, avoid those ""great deal"" $5 lighters if you want something that will work when it should. So what lighters are out there? What brands can we trust to deliver on all or most of these aforementioned traits? While I haven't tried 'em all (who has?), I've been around long enough to get a good feel of which lighters are the ""real deal"" and which ones just… blow. In my opinion, these are some of the best cigar lighters out there for your hard-earned cash. The Top 5 Affordable Cigar Lighters #5. Blazer Optimus This is an interesting and unusual lighter in that there is actually a guillotine cigar cutter built in! On the front of the Blazer Optimus is a magnetically held cutter that simply slides off and on. The blazer also has a nice lighting mechanism as the cover doubles as the striking button. On the downside, the Optimus is a little bit bulky in size and doesn't feel as solid as others on this list, loosing the guillotine cutter can also be an issue which compromises the look and feel, be careful to keep this lighter in one piece. #4. Colibri Evoke The Colibri Evoke is a single flame torch lighter made with style and class in mind. The Evoke is a slim, metallic lighter that will fit into any pocket with ease. It has a flip-top that feels very solid and smooth, this also reflects the lighter's higher $55 price range. There is a viewing window on the side to gauge your butane and a punch cutter that opens from the bottom. This is a very solid and reliable lighter with features (and price) that may not be appreciated by the beginner. #3. Xikar Tech This is your traveling lighter: durable, easy to operate, and one huge butane reservoir! The Xikar Tech is a single torch lighter that simply gets the job done. With a large flame adjustment wheel on the bottom (no screwdriver!) and a clear body, this thing makes it incredibly easy to manage that oh-so-precious butane. With a fair $30 price range, this is a must-have for the traveling aficionado. #2. Vector Vulcan The Vulcan is a solid, triple flame torch lighter. The thing I love about it is the lighting mechanism, located on the side of the lighter, simply squeeze the lighter and the top opens while giving a huge triple-flame burst of heat! The Vector Vulcan has a nice heavy weight in the hand feel as well as extras like a punch cutter at the bottom and an easy fuel gauge on the side. Be careful though, as the triple flame uses triple the fuel, something to keep in mind. At $50, the price feels a little steep, try to find this lighter on sale, you won't be disappointed. #1. Xikar Element This is a beast of a lighter! The Xikar Element is a double-flame torch lighter that seems to have the best of everything. A solid, heavy, metal feel lets you know this thing aint breaking, and hey, if somehow it does - it's guaranteed for life, no questions asked! Go ahead, run this thing through its courses, you'll never need another lighter. Again, the lighting operation is seamless, press the button on top and the cover slides to expose the double-flame (my favorite)! The Element also has the extra gizmos like punch cutter and fuel gauge, with front and back side-grips to ensure a steady light. With a mid-range $45 price tag, cigar lovers of all levels will find this to be a great mixture of design, quality, and reliability."

6,Designing handcrafted semi-precious jewellery,shopping," I have been designing handcrafted semi-precious jewellery for many years now and I love to use stunning semi-precious beads and pendants in my original and unique designs. By creating my own handcrafted jewellery I can create original and unique designs that cannot be found anywhere else there by creating my own unique collection wearing pieces that no one else can be seen in. I look to Mother Nature for my inspiration for my semi-precious handcrafted jewellery designs both in the choosing of the natural colours and for the shapes in the designs. By looking in your garden or taking a walk in the country you will be inspired to create your own unusual pieces of handmade semi-precious jewellery. Let the different seasons inspire you in your own unique and original designs. First you have to choose the type of piece you would like to create. Then the colours you would like your piece. If you want to match an outfit then having swatches of the fabric will help. When you have done this then you have to decide on which natural semi-precious beads you would like. I love to mix my semi-precious beads and pendants beads with other handmade beads made from glass, pearls shells and always crystal beads to add a little sparkle and glamour to my handcrafted designs. You need to decide if you would like a focal point for the unique handcrafted designs and a semi-precious gemstone pendant will work beautifully for this and these come in many beautiful shapes and sizes. You do not need a focal point for you jewellery design as if you are feeling confident you can go for an asymmetrical design but always remembering that you have to get the weight balance right or your piece will not sit correctly around your neck or on your wrist. I find that a bead tray is very useful when creating a handcrafted jewellery design as you can lay out your semi-precious beads and pendants in order without them rolling all over the table (and having to crawl around the floor picking them up) and you can see the length of your jewellery design as it grows. This way allows you to move the semi-precious beads into the order you desire before you actually finish stringing them. When you have created your unique handcrafted design you have to choose the type of clasp you would like and this is total down to personal preference. You can use a lobster clasp, a hook and eye or my preference is toggle clasps that come in many unique styles. Magnetic clasps are also great for people that have difficulty with fiddly things. Tiger Tail is my preference for stringing my semi-precious beads and this is wire covered in plastic and has the strength to keep your unique piece of semi-precious jewellery safe and is able to take a lot of weight that sometimes comes with heavy beads. Tiger tail also does not stretch like many other stringing materials. Let your imagination run away with you and create your own piece of handcrafted semi-precious jewellery and be known for having your own style"
7,What to Wear with Leggings - A Little Legging Can Go a Long Way,shopping," It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. It was the best of times because there are these comfortable things called leggings that we get to wear. It is the worst of times because we have no idea what to wear with leggings. This confusion is due to the fact that leggings are neither pants nor tights, but are so comfortable that we want to find out all the different ways we can wear leggings and give a free makeover to our wardrobe. Before revealing different ways to wear leggings that can lead to a self-propelled free makeover, we must agree on three very important rules: Rule #1: Leggings are not pants so do not wear them as such. Rule #2: Wear leggings with a top that is long enough to cover your derriere and cover our lady parts. If you don’t understand why this needs to be a rule, stop what you are doing and proceed to the nearest mall. Grab a seat at the food court. People watch for thirty minutes and then come back and finish the rest of this article. Resist the urge to give the people you saw a free makeover. Rule #3: You do not talk about fight club. Sorry, is this an article about leggings? Then don’t forget the two rules about leggings and disregard the comment about fight club. Taking into account the rules above, here are some items you can wear with leggings. High heel knee-high boots. Love this look. This is great for fall and winter. Just tuck your leggings into the boots. Long cardigan. You can throw on a long cardigan (over a long top). The cardigan can keep you warm and cozy and can offer a pop of color. Long T-shirt. Throw on a long T-shirt over your leggings. To prevent the outfit from looking sloppy accessorize well or pair with a stylish pair of shoes. A short dress. You can pair many summery dresses with leggings so that you wear the dress as a top instead of wearing it as a dress. This is essentially a free makeover for many of the dresses in your closet. Ballet flats. This goes great with a pair of capri leggings and a summery dress worn as a top. Be careful if your have really big calves and this look can make your legs look like tree trunks. Long tank top. This is great for summer. You can even layer the tank tops to bring in more colors. Long top and short jacket. Wear a long T-shirt or tank top and then layer on top of it a shorter jacket, so that the fabric of the shirt hangs out below the jacket. Boyfriend blazer. Wear an oversized men styled blazer over your top. Remember the jacket should be past your bottom. High top sneakers. This a little bit of a younger look, but a very hip way to wear the leggings. Chunky sweater. Great for fall and winter pair a long chunky sweater with leggings. Originally introduced in the eighties, this time around the legging style seems to be lingering much longer and has proven to be a comfortable and versatile addition to our wardrobes. Let us take full advantage this free makeover wardrobe item before it goes away and we are just left with the sweat pant, which does not go with any summer dresses.Try it, use it, but never abuse it. Let us enjoy the era of the legging. Oh and one last thing, don’t tell anyone that we mentioned fight club."
8,How to look after your Jade Jewellery,shopping," Owning beautiful and high quality unusual handmade jewellery is one thing while maintaining it and keeping it in tip top condition is another thing all together. Some semi-precious stones have very sensitive colours that require a lot of care and attention for them to last long and remain transparent and the same condition as the day they were purchased. Jade jewellery is a wonderful spiritual type of semi-precious jewellery that is very strong and tough and is available in a variety of very bright colours and has a lovely smooth texture to the semi-precious stone. You may think that this stone will not need to be taken care of since it is strong enough to withstand knocks that it may have while being worn; but on the contrary, it requires a lot of care as it can be very delicate. However, a Jade necklace can easily crack if it drops from your neck. These cracks will continue to get bigger if the problem has not been taken care of and with this lose its appeal and its value. Your beautiful and special pieces of Jade jewellery should not be stored in a place with very high temperature because this will affect the colour and the texture of the semi-precious stone. You must always avoid wearing jade bracelets when cooking because the high temperatures are likely to cause oxidization of the jade which will render it valueless and spoil the beauty. Your jade jewellery should not come into contact with things such as oil and perfumes because the oil will tend to stick on the semi-precious stone hence affecting its colour, texture and sheen. It is even worse when the grease sticks on the handmade jewelleries  cracks because removing it will be almost impossible and it may end up causing the jade infilling to peel and this can also be due to continuous scratching. Since these Chinese jade jewels are a symbol of holiness and style, they should be kept clean always to make sure they retain their beauty. Cleaning jade rings shouldn't be a great deal because all you will need for this task is lint free soft cloth and a neutral detergent or a delicate washing up liquid.

In the event that your jade comes into contact with these chemicals, make sure you clean it immediately. You are able to take care of other things that have been handcrafted from Jade like carvings, hair combs, and many other ornamental pieces."

11,Your Fantasy Makeover Starts With Visualization,shopping," Do you remember the days of paper dolls, dress up, or playing beauty salon with a pile of rollers and barrettes all in an attempt to be more than a plain jane? And of course there was Barbie - that B---- had everything! These are all popular dress up games from our childhood. As we get older our makeover games and activities are confined to one day out of the year, Halloween. Even on that one dress up day, the outfits are restricted to occupations that have simply had the adjective ‘sexy’ placed in front of them. Can’t you tell by the black leather mini skirt that she is a sexy Supreme Court Justice - duh! The allure of Halloween is that it allows us to escape. The wimpy computer science engineer who can’t even pick up a Reese’s Pieces can be the Incredible Hulk for a day and a plain jane can be a dominatrix for an entire earth rotation - apologies, sexy dominatrix. The holiday allows us to indulge fantasies and test drive a different aspect of ourselves. As women we all have the same fantasy almost daily that we never indulge. We have a phantom version of ourselves that we daydream about. This ghost self is smart, funny, not a hair out of place, and dressed so sharply that if she tripped and fell, she would could her leg off. And her shoes, her shoes are so beautiful that they make you want to cry. However just like when the theater house lights come back up after a movie, you are often brought back to reality and convince yourself that it could never be real. You look in the mirror and you become untroubled labeling yourself a plain jane. As a child your time wasn’t your own. You had no resources and no money to make these makeover games stick. When you were done playing you had to put everything away and go wash your hands for dinner. As an adult, you have time or money or resources to make your now self and your phantom self come closer together until they intertwine like the hands of young lovers. Perhaps, you hold yourself back because you secretly believe that even your phantom self will not measure up and so you don’t even attempt to and thus you remain a plain jane. Here are some steps to get your present self and your phantom self to begin to tango: Visualize who you want to be. Try to get as precise about it as possible. What does she look like? What does she talk like? How does she smell? What does she like to do for fun? What does she do on the weekends? This sounds very New Age but as the Cheshire Cat responds when Alice says she doesn’t care where she goes, ""Then it doesn’t matter which way you go."" You need to know which way to go. Make a list that describes her Start crossing off items on the list. As you focus on an item, people, books, articles, and websites will begin to catch your attention to help you accomplish the item. Along the way, you will probably discover that you had some of these qualities all along just like a girl from Kansas with a dog named Toto. Plain jane or not, we can all benefit from attempting to better ourselves and it should be a life long endeavor. It widely reported that when Winston Churchill was at a commencement to give a speech, he approached the podium and then just said, ""Never, never, never give up,"" and then he just sat down again. In becoming the woman you want to be inside and out, you need to adopt this philosophy of Winston Churchill everyday, ""Never, never, never give up."" Remember it everyday, 365 days a year. Maybe even dress up as Churchill for the next Halloween - apologies, sexy Winston Churchill."
12,How To Easily Rip Screen Printing Separations For Complex Graphics Or Grunge Vectors,shopping," Grunge t-shirts with distressed, large graphics that cover a shirt are crazy popular right now. It’s hard to walk into any store, whether it’s a discount superstore or a high-end boutique, without seeing this style shirt on nearly every rack. There are plenty of DIY t-shirt fanatics looking to create custom t-shirts in this style and odds are you’ve had a hard time finding a t-shirt printing company that can help you. Right now everyone wants to create custom t-shirts that resemble the wildly popular Affliction and Ed Hardy Brand t-shirt styles. For the average Joe this can get expensive and even though ""Affliction style t-shirt"" printing requests are becoming very common, access to printers that can pull it off still aren’t. However, I have seen some dye-sublimation printers online that can do pretty nice all over t-shirt printing. Your most cost effective printing method is probably going to be screen printing or possibly plot printing for super low quantities and one-offs, using one or two colors, but if you’ve ever tried to submit full coverage complex art to a screen printer you’ve probably had your art handed back to you to simplify it to a point that no longer achieves your goals. The typical set up for all over t-shirt printing requires one set of screens for each size t-shirt usually with a minimum order somewhere in the neighborhood of 72 pieces per size. As you can imagine prices add up quickly. If you get creative, often times you can work within your screen printers screen size limitations and create some really cool effects derived from the style that Affliction and Ed Hardy use. This tutorial will show you how to create color separations in Adobe Illustrator from complex art quickly and easily. This technique can be used to create screens for custom t-shirt printing without oversimplifying your art. You can use Photoshop, but there’s a couple reasons we prefer vector art instead of a pixel-based image. With screen printing, it isn’t necessary for artwork to be vector, but if the design needs to be scaled to a larger size or includes text, it will look much clearer if the artwork is in vector. What exactly is vector? Vector art is created using mathematical formulas to create lines. This means that the artwork can scale really small or really large without losing integrity. This is unlike pixel-based graphics (like.jpeg or image files), which are made using tiny squares of color. With plot printing, vector art is a must, as the design is cut from a colored foil and heat pressed into the fabric. This technique gives the shirt more vivid, crisp colors and also offers a more durable design, especially with small details. Frankly, it’s just much quicker for me to rip separations from Adobe Illustrator. Step 1: Create a New File In Adobe Illustrator, create a new file that is the exact size your design will be. For the custom t-shirt designer I am using, they recommend my art be 11.8 by 11.8 inches. If you are working with a screen printer, ask what the screen size will be, so that you can set your file up to the exact size and maximize coverage. This saves you from a headache or a design rejection down the road! If you already have artwork, open your design and copy it into the new file. I’ve chosen a graphic that is overly detailed. It has gradients, grunge elements, and strokes - which are all really cool, but also make it more difficult for t-shirt printing. If you are screen printing, you can try and keep as much of this detail as you want, but with plot printing minimum size requirements, many elements may need to be increased in size or removed completely. Keeping in mind that my design will ultimately be 3 colors, I need to simplify what I have. Step 2: Strip and Simplify your design. Add a temporary background color that matches the shirt color you will be using. This helps to eliminate any surprise white elements in your design and allows you to visualize the final product. Make sure you lock this background (⌘2), so it won’t interfere with your alterations. Delete the hard edge background and extra elements that aren’t needed in the final design. With plot print, avoid including any details that are smaller than 1.5mm. Change gradients to single color and reduce number of colors used. Only solid colors can be used for the plot printing technique, so it’s important to change gradients to one color. To add a fourth color to the design, I incorporate the t-shirt color. This won’t actually be a printed color, but instead will be ""knocked out"" of the design in later stages so that the actual shirt shows through. This is a clever way to add more design details without adding more cost. Continue deleting small details and changing colors until all you have are three colors (plus the background/t-shirt color). Step 3: Expand Any Thin Line Art NOTE: this step is not a requirement for screen printing - only plot printing. As mentioned above, all artwork for plot printing has a minimum size requirement of 1.5mm, so with complex designs, you must expand the size of some elements. Click on an element that is too skinny or too small, then go to Object > Path > Offset Path and enter a number that will make your line art large enough. This expands your artwork in all directions, so keep that in mind (my grunge texture was pretty skinny, so I used.75mm to make it work). Step 4: Create Separate Layers for Each Color. This is a really important step. For screen printing, each individual color is printed separately (hence the term ""color separations"") and applied to the shirt one at a time. The easiest way to create separate color layers is to follow these steps: Create a new layer and name it ""Separations."" Add three more layers INSIDE this new layer - one for each color - mine are aptly named ""navy,"" ""orange"" and ""yellow."" Copy your artwork into the Separations layer and then hide your original layer so it won’t interfere. NOTE: Make sure your artwork does not contain any strokes, as they will interfere with the next step. If it does, expand any strokes you have and unite them with the object. (Object >Expand>Stroke and then in the Pathfinder palette, choose the ""Unite"" button.) With all artwork selected (⌘A), go to your Pathfinder palette and click the ""Divide"" button. This basically takes all objects and cuts everything that intersects into it's own object. The result is a puzzle effect, with no objects overlapping. All pieces take on the attributes of the object that was originally on top - in this example, the navy pants are on top of the background elements, so where they intersected, those pieces are now all navy. Click on an object with the first color, navy blue is used in this example, and in the main menu hit Select > Same > Fill Color. With all the navy colored objects selected, go back to your Pathfinder palette and click the ""Merge"" button. This takes all the smaller pieces of the same color and converts them to one object. Move the navy object into its own sub folder. Continue the above steps with the other two colors - orange and yellow - then delete any of the remaining extraneous objects. (This includes the temporary background and t-shirt colored elements. Step 5: Save! You can now delete all extra layers you may have (such as the original layer with the unmerged artwork) and then save your file as an.eps file. The three sub-layers serve as separations for your design and will help ensure your custom t-shirt printer can print your art onto an awesome shirt! Step 6: At Home Mods While your shirt will be pretty sweet as it is from the printer, it still won’t be as customized and crazy as the ones you see in stores. The best way to achieve the vintage or textured feel is to start with a good fabric foundation. A bamboo or organic heather t-shirt may cost a little more but the end results will be more authentic. To further customize your unique shirt you may even try using bleach, extra dye, or sewing on embellishments. There are plenty of DIY tutorials for t-shirt modification, so get creative! Hope you find this tutorial helpful in creating t-shirt separations using Adobe Illustrator. Good luck printing custom t-shirts and happy t-shirt designing!"
13,How to Make Jean Shopping Less Terrifying and More Enjoyable,shopping," One of the most soul crushing and self esteem destroying activities for women is shopping for jeans. Some may argue that shopping for bathing suits is worse, but at least with that there is an expectation of awfulness. When shopping for jeans you are surprised almost every time. It is the Pearl Harbor of shopping. A self esteem sneak attack that leaves you wondering if you are subconsciously a masochist for taking on this kamikaze mission. At best you end up in the dressing room with a pair of jeans that won’t make it up past your hips and are forced to do the walk shame - returning the jeans you tried on and grabbing a larger size only to return to the dressing room.  At worst, you get the jeans over your hips, but are unable to remove them - requiring the sales girl to enter your dressing room with some sort of vise while onlookers film this escapade on their cell phones which makes you the next YouTube sensation. There is a way to spare yourself this indignity. The solution is online shopping. A plain jane can graduate to fashionista by using this wonderful method to spare her gas, time, and self-esteem. Here are reasons why online jean shopping is a salve to your self-esteem. You have a greater variety in sizes and lengths. You are not Noah, you are not building an ark, so why do you look like you are dressed for a flood? Go find the jeans online for tall women. A plain jane becomes mesmerizing with a pair of good fitting jeans. Many sites offer free shipping both ways. This means no more walk of shame and the only indignity suffered is between you and your postman when you return the too small jeans. You can control the lighting when you try on the jeans at home. Most dressing room lighting makes the Vegas Strip look subtle. You can see every dent and dimple. At home, there is a dimmer switch or candlelight. While you are at it why not throw in a bottle wine and mood music, for some it may turn into the best date you have had in a while. You can move around to see if the jeans will really work for you. Putting on jeans in a 4 x 4 box does not offer a real test drive of the jeans. At home you can put them on, walk around the house, and try sitting down. You don’t want to be a plain jane that discovers that she has to unbutton the top button of her jeans to sit down. You want to be the woman in great fitting jeans that is comfortable and exudes confidence to the world around her. You can get real opinions if you try them on in front of friends and family. You don’t have to listen to the sales girl telling you how great you look while she is silently counting her commission. As far as plain jane self esteem building activities go, jean shopping is not going to crack the top 100. The best you can do is minimize the damage like the giant concrete wall built around the Chernobyl nuclear reactor. If you contain the potential disaster to the confines of you home, you may able to get through trying on jeans without having to program the suicide hotline into your cell phone. Shopping on line for jeans will definitely prevent gene therapy from becoming jean therapy for PTSD. Who knows you might grow to love shopping for jeans but you will also need to buy a tether for your flying pig."
14,Are You in a Fashion Rut? 2 Signs That You Need to Dig Your Way Out,shopping," It is one of the great riddles of the ages. One of life’s few mysteries remaining and one of the last puzzles to be solved. How is it possible to have a closet full of clothes, but yet have absolutely nothing to wear? This thought has plagued women for millennia. Even Eve looked around the garden and complained to Adam that she could not find the right fig leaf. Later in history, Greek women threw open their closets and announced sadly, ""More togas?"" Here is a possible reason that in the age of internet shoe shopping, dry clean delivery, and custom-built closets you have still not solved this riddle. You my friend are stuck in a rut. Others might even refer to you as a Plain Jane. In the world of fashion, this means you are always wearing the same things in the same way. However, you can wear the same things in different ways and multiple your wardrobe without even involving Mr. MasterCard. Here is are two signs that you are stuck in a fashion rut: 1.) Have you ever looked at a picture of yourself and noticed that you are wearing the same outfit as you are in the picture? It is a very existential feeling, but also a little embarrassing. Diagnosis = rut. 2.) Have you ever gone to reach for an outfit to wear only to realize that you haven’t done laundry for a week so you can no longer wear the outfit? Romeo and Juliet are no match for you and your favorite T-shirt, the Shakespearean characters could at least be parted for a week. Diagnosis = rut. So you have identified that you are in a rut. What is the next step? Well, you are going to invoke the slogan of the famous Apple campaign ""Think Different."" We all have ""uniforms,"" meaning this blouse goes with this pair of pants and that is how we always wear them. We wear them together like peanut butter and jelly. However, peanut butter goes together with many other things. For instance, peanut butter and chocolate is light years better than peanut butter and jelly. The problem is that most of us do not even pause to consider other pairings with our clothing and these other options could be really awesome like peanut butter and chocolate. Now that you have a craving for Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, here is an easy trick to discover other pairings. If you can reach to left six inches, you can do this. If you can reach to the right six inches, you can do this because that is all there is to it. Think, ""Left Six, Right Six."" Let’s say you grab your white blouse out of the closet and you go to grab your black pants out of the closet because that is always what you wear with your white blouse. Before you reach for those black pants you are going to pause and then think, ""Left Six, Right Six."" This means you are going to look to your left six inches to see if there is anything to wear with your white blouse and you are going to look to your right six inches to see if there is anything to pair with your blouse. Six inches over from your black pants may be the perfect brown skirt - your chocolate. It could compliment your blouse better and you could get more compliments from your coworkers. You are Plain Jane no more. While ""Left Six, Right Six"" is not the Rosetta Stone, it is getting us one step closer to solving this age old having-nothing-to-wear paradox. The secret hope of women everywhere is that the U.S. space program was shut down this year so that NASA can redirect their efforts to answering this wardrobe puzzle. Finally this puzzle will be solved or maybe we’ll just get a new flavor of Tang. Until then just remember ""Left Six, Right Six"" and say bye-bye to Plain Jane."
15,5 Reasons Why You Didn’t Get the Job: How What You Wore Cost You the Job,shopping," The job interview process can be summed up nicely by reviewing the words of the wise zen master that is Carrie Bradshaw, ""A first date is just a job interview with cocktails."" However, there is one big difference, there are no beer goggles that can erase the image of a horrible first impression. So here are 5 reasons why your wardrobe may have cost you the job and how you can avoid being a Plain Jane on the next job interview. ""Put on your dancing shoes"". You didn’t get the job because you wore flip-flops, sneakers, too-tall stripper heels, scuffed up shoes, or you went barefoot. Yes your shoes do tell a story about you and that story should be that I am confident and want this job. Therefore ladies, you should always lean more conservative (this does not mean Plain Jane) for a job interview. This means that you must wear heels (non-negotiable unless you have a doctor’s note). The heels do not need to be really high. They can be a kitten heel with a one inch height, but they should not be over 3-4 inches. Additionally, your shoes should look like they are in good condition so you may need to take a shine to them. Some of you may be thinking, ""Can I wear sneakers with my suit, Ellen Degeneres does it?"" Well, until you have the #1 daytime talk show, a Cover Girl cosmetics deal, and are married to Portia De Rossi, you better steer clear of the sneakers during an interview. A plain jane wears flats that resemble house shoes. A well qualified job candidate wears heels - no matter how little they are. ""I can’t hear you. Your clothes are too loud"". You didn’t get the job because your clothes were too loud. Remember for a job interview, you want to be more conservative. That means you probably need to wear blacks, grays, navys, browns, or maybe ivory depending on time of year. You can have a bright-colored top, but you want to keep the overall outfit a little subdued with just a little pop of color. A plain jane would wear a black suit with a plain white top. A top-tier job candidate would wear the black suit, with a red and white print top and color coordinated accessories.You might be thinking, ""Well if I wear my yellow skirt suit. I’ll stand out from all the other candidates."" You are absolutely right Big Bird, you will stand out, but not for a good reason. If you want to add color to the outfit do it with your accessories. ""Is that a solar flare or the glare from your earrings."" You didn’t get the job because your earrings, bracelets, ring, or man-hole cover sized brooch blinded the interviewer. The motto to follow is less is more, you should use accessories to dress up your outfit and bring out a little more of your personality because you don’t want to be a plain jane. However, your accessories should not overwhelm the outfit. You want them to remember you and your skill set, not the tambourine hanging from your earlobe. The interviewer may be so distracted by your earring that they will not hear your story of how you increased office productivity by 25%. A plain jane wears no earrings to a job interview. A job candidate with a job offer has simple but carefully coordinated accessories. ""The pen you can find is mightier than the sword"" You didn’t get the job because when you went to get the pen out of your purse and it took you 10 minutes plus a water break due to exhaustion. A messy purse says a lot about you. It can say ""I am so busy coming up with ideas that I can’t bother with such trivial matters as cleaning out my purse."" But most likely it is saying ""If you think this is messy, you should see what my desk will look like after a working here a month!"" As with your shoes, you should choose your best handbag and make sure that it is cleaned out so you can easily find a pen or a notepad. Avoid using a handbag that shows a lot of wear and tear. A plain jane uses a reusable grocery bag as her handbag. A must-have job candidate uses her best handbag for the job interview. ""You’re late, you’re late for a very important date"" You didn’t get the job because you were late, even a minute late looks bad in the world of job interviews. To avoid this catastrophe, wear a watch. In the age of cell phones, this idea may seem old-fashioned. What’s next going to the job interview in a horse and buggy. However the watch is beneficial in two regards: 1) It will keep you on time, 2) It creates the perception that you are on time and responsible. Even you don’t normally wear a watch, this is the one occasion that you should. No need to go visit the Cartier website, you can just go to Target or Walmart to get a decent watch just for interviews and it will pay dividends. A plain jane has a bare wrist. A second round interview candidate wears a watch to the job interview. So you didn’t kill during the job interview and you didn’t get the job. As they say in the dating world, there are plenty of fish in the sea. However during a recession it’s more like sardines in a wading pool, so you need the right bait. Plain Jane equals unemployment check. Knowing what to wear during a job interview...priceless."

17,Sexy Costumes: Fun or Too Far?,shopping," As the weather heats up and we all strip down as bare as we dare, the debate over modesty in American culture, much like the heat, rages on. One particularly fiery area of this debate centers on the popular trend of wearing sexy costumes on Halloween night. October is rapidly approaching so the question becomes: are sexy costumes fun or too far? The Case Against Sexy Costumes: Some argue that Halloween just gives people (read: women) an excuse to look totally inappropriate without being yelled at by their grandma or arrested for solicitation by the police. As a female, I can tell you that both of those things often happen anyways. Also, as someone who didn't exactly jump for joy when I saw a sexy Koala costume last year (Seriously? Now I can't even go to the marsupial exhibit at the zoo anymore without feeling dirty!), I can understand why that argument can seem valid. Why not cover up and look cute on Halloween? Why the fishnets and bustiers? Not only are sexy costumes ""inappropriate,"" they also can be quite uncomfortable. Nobody likes pulling down their skirt all night or trying to avoid eye contact with the middle-aged creep who's eying you across the room at a college party. Maybe it sends the wrong message. Though it may not be an ideal first impression, a sexy costume says...sex. It says it loud and clear. Maybe that's not the word us ladies should be projecting on a night when too often people get drunk off pumpkin punch and make poor choices. Perhaps modesty is the best policy. These are arguments repeated time and time again by worried parents, gossipy middle school girls, conservative Republicans, and protective older brothers. The Case For Sexy Costumes: To those who don sexy costumes or support them, these arguments are either wrong-headed or irrelevant. Not only do sexy costumes themselves not send an inherently immoral message about the character of the woman who wears them, but even if they did, it doesn't matter! Hating on sexy costumes is just another way of people (read: men) trying to tell women what to do. Men dress up completely inappropriately on Halloween all the time and nobody bats an eyelash, but as soon as a girl wears a mini skirt and some clear heels the whole world has to splash holy water and cry ""Sodom and Gomorrah!"" I once saw a man in a skin tight Batman costume. You could see ALL of his business. But nobody was running around behind him telling him to cover up his little caped crusader! This isn't the 17th century. Women can read. Women can vote. And they can wear whatever the feel like, whenever they feel like it. It's that simple. Sexy costumes are just another avenue of expression. They are a way to step into a fantasy, even if just for one night. There's no reason adult women shouldn't be able to wear whatever makes them feel sexy. I was once a sexy school girl for Halloween and found the whole thing quite liberating, even if some drunk dude kept snapping my suspenders. It was a night of pure fun and isn't that what Halloween is all about? Also, who says that sexy is just for women? Men who want to show a little skin should feel totally free to do so! I know I enjoy it. So carry on, skin tight Batman. Carry on. The Verdict: Let freedom and sex appeal ring! I say, if you got it, flaunt it. Halloween IS an excuse to be scantily clad and ain't nothing wrong with that. What do you think? Are sexy costumes a ""do"" or a ""don't""?"
