1,In What States Are Radar Detectors Legal to Use,autos-trucks," A fair amount of people that own cars in the United States have their own radar detectors. Their reason for having one is because they feel the speed limit presently is too low. Most Americans are not satisfied with a moderate speed while driving. They want to be the fastest driver on the road, as well as get to the places they’re going to in record time. The radar detector serves as their alarm whenever there are police near by. Once the radar detector alarm sounds, they can ease up on the gas pedal and slow down their speed. The radar detectors work by picking up a signal from the policeman's radar gun.  Unfortunately they are not effective 100%of the time. Because of the radar detectors being used by so many motorist, cops have resorted to hiding in alleyways or behind bridges, in an attempt to avoid being detected by the radar detectors. Motorists on the other hand are being clever themselves, they are aware of these tactics from the police.  So to overcome the cops strategy of being deceptive, more enhanced, top-dollar detectors have entered the market. Although the police are always improving their techniques of catching the radar detector users, they are not able to keep the road radar detector free. Another form of radar detection are laser jammers.  They work by transmitting an invisible light source back to the original police laser gun.  The return signal confuses the laser gun and the officer is unable to clock the driver's speed. Radar detectors are legal in many cities and states throughout the United States. But, in some of the states that allow radar detectors they have some restrictions. I have prepared a list below that discusses the states with laws against radar detectors and the states with restrictions. -Virginia, Georgia currently prohibits the use of radar detectors. -The District of Columbia does not allow radar detectors.  Radar detectors are also not allowed in all commercial vehicles and all vehicles over 18,000 pounds or heavier. -Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Maine, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania,  Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming have all banned mounting radars and/or obstructions on the windshield. -Missouri and North Carolina have no restrictions on window obstructions. -Radar jammers are not allowed in any state.  This is a federal law. -Alabama prohibits radar detectors on all commercial vehicles. -New York does not allow radar detectors on commercial vehicles over 18,000 pounds. -New Jersey and Ohio prohibits radar detectors on all commercial vehicles. Florida does not allow radar detectors on commercial and personal vehicles over 10,000 pounds. -The following states permit radar detectors in private vehicles but not in commercial vehicles:  Alaska, Montana, Iowa, Arkansas, Maryland, Nevada, Connecticut, Idaho, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Kansas, Arizona, Maine, Kentucky, Delaware, West Virginia, Michigan, South Carolina, Louisiana, Missouri, Tennessee, Nebraska, Mississippi, Wisconsin, Vermont, New Mexico, Hawaii, North Carolina, Massachusetts, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Illinois, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming, In Illinois, radar detectors are only regulated in commercial vehicles of over 26,001 pounds. -On US military bases, radar detectors are legal to have but illegal to use. (??) -Laser Jammers are illegal to use in California, Illinois, Colorado, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Tennessee, -Virginia, and Washington D.C.  And since there is no federal law banning them, they can be used in other states. If you are considering buying a radar detector be sure to know what your state's law is regarding the use of them.  Also do some research on the different types of radar detectors available to suit your needs. Before you start shopping for a radar detector, make sure you understand what options are available. Such as: Corded Radar Detectors Cordless radar detectors Remote-Mount Radar Detectors The Factors: Range Filtering Smartphone or GPS connectivity Budget Take your time in selecting the right radar detector.  Lighten up on the heavy foot with the gas pedal and be safe."

3,What's Coming in 2022: The New Electric Cars Poised to Hit the streets,autos-trucks," 2021 was a pivotal year in the EV world, with more sales and registration of electric vehicles hitting a record high. More electric cars were registered last year than in the past five years combined. Despite the continued worldwide supply and semiconductor crisis, some of the world's biggest manufacturers flexed their muscles on the biggest stage, delivering new models to carry on with the common goal of promoting zero emissions. Volkswagen ID 4, Ford Mustang Mach-E, and Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo were some of the most notable market entrants. February BMW i4 Rivaling Tesla Model 3, the BMW i4 features the controversial BMW front grille. Top-rung i4 m50 models are expected to range between 259-324 miles. Even better, the £63,905 EV will offer 536 bhp with the power coming from an 80.7kWh battery. Mercedes-AMG EQS 53 Mercedes was among the big boy brands that put out new EV models last year, and this year will not be an exception. The AMG EQS 53 is poised to be the Porsche Taycan Turbo S rival, and with the title of the first entirely electric performance car from AMG, we don't doubt it one bit. Besides the motors and steering getting AMG-specific tuning, the EQS model is expected to offer a dual-motor set up with an impressive 752 bhp and 752 lb-ft of torque. Note: The dual-motor setup is more powerful than a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged GT S coupé V8 unit. Genesis Electrified G80 Genesis Electrified G80 is a luxury model boasting a four-wheel-drive powertrain and a twin motor. The Mercedes EQS rival also pushes the limit with the remarkable 0-62mph sprint of 4.9sec. Other notable features include 350kW charging speeds thanks to the 800V system and a unique structure that allows you to switch between two and four-wheel drive for maximum efficiency. Spring March Cupra Born According to reports, Cupra's sporty Volkswagen ID 3 should be available in the three variants. The 58kWh battery variant will lead the way, with 45kWh and 77kWh variants following. Cupra has a standout design and additional driving dynamism as the two main selling points. And if you want more power, a 231 bhp performance variant will be released later in the year. Volkswagen ID 5: The ID 5 is expected to retail at £47,000 for the entry-level model with 172 bhp and 201 bhp models on the line. Notably, Volkswagen will have an ID5 GTX model with an impressive 0-62mph sprint of 6.3secs and 295 bhp. Ora Cat: The Chinese EV brand Ora is poised to release a retro electric car retailing at £25,000. The Volkswagen ID 3 rival will return 261 miles of range, and even with the affordable pricing, it boasts impressive technology, including over-the-air updates and mobile phone-initiated remote functions. What's more, its great 0-30mph time of 3.8 sec and a 0-62mph time of 8.5 sec makes it perfect for different use, including everyday city driving. Tesla Model Y: Branded by many as Tesla Model 3's SUV version, Tesla Model Y will make its UK debut this year. Like the compact model Y, we expect it to bear all the hallmarks for convenience and reliability. For the moment, our impressions are good. We especially like that the Model Y will benefit from Tesla's charging network. Volvo C40 Recharge: The C40 is Volvo's first EV-only car. On top-rung models, especially, we were impressed by the silent 0-62mph sprint of under 5.0secs. And with the 78kWk battery providing 260 miles of range, it's only fair to say that Volvo's EV-only car debutant will be an exciting choice for electric car owners. In the UK, especially, the prices will start from £57,000. April Citroën Ami: Citroën Ami is a French electric car whose positive reaction in the Western European country led the automobile makers into making a bold step, leaping into the Britain market. The heavy quadricycle seats two people, and with a 5.5kWh battery and 28mph, it's a reliable and affordable way to move around. And while it was initially destined for France, the EV has grown in popularity since Citroen announced it. BMW iX M60: This massive BMW SUV will arrive this year, with most EV enthusiasts looking forward to the standout styling. On performance, the German beast 611bhp and 4.0-sec charge to 63mph is remarkable. It also has a 357-mile range, and with top-notch styling and performance, the £111,905 didn't come as a surprise. Porsche Taycan GTS: Like the Porsche Taycan Turbo S model, the GTS will have a 626lb-ft torque figure and dual-motor setup. More importantly, it'll slot between the Taycan 4S and the Turbo models, with the significant difference being the power restriction of 590bhp instead of 670bhp. Porsche Taycan Sport Turismo The Sport Turismo's main takeaway is the switch from Taycan's off-road styling to a more 'low-rider' profile.' May Lexus RZ With Lexus already promising its fans an ""exhilarating driving performance"" with the highly anticipated RZ, you know we can't wait. According to the automobile giant, the four-wheel-drive EV will offer ""incredible cornering and road-holding."" Additionally, Lexus's first bespoke electric car will have steer-by-wire technology, further improving the driver's experience. Genesis GV60: While it might be Genesis' first personalized electric vehicle, this four-wheel-drive EV boasts a dual-motor setup poised to compete with some of the best 2022 debutants. The maker has even claimed that the model might match the performance of a sports car. And with the GV60 based on Hyundai's E-GMP platform, we don't doubt Genesis. Mercedes-Benz EQT: Developed in liaison with Renault, the EQT is a fantastic MPV ideal for everyday driving. Notably, it previewed the new T-Class' electric sibling design. Summer June Hyundai Ioniq 6: According to emerging reports, the Ioniq 6 could have the power to rival Porsche Taycan. And while it might be Hyundai's second bespoke EV, it comes with an impressive 77.4kWh battery. The larger battery addition comes after unforeseen production delays from last-minute design changes. So, even if moving the arrival to mid-year was a bummer for many Hyundai faithfuls, upgrading from a 72.6kWh battery makes the delay worth it. Mercedes-Benz EQE: Made from 100% recycled steel, the new CLS-sized saloon is poised to challenge the BMW i4 and Tesla Model 3. And according to the German carmaker, the EQE will offer a remarkable 410 miles between charges. And for the bog-boy fans, a taller model will follow in 2023. Dacia Spring EV: In line with the company's philosophy of keeping things simple, Dacia's first EV sits four people. And as the company sets its sight on starting selling in the UK in March, Europe's most affordable EV has a 44bhp electric motor and 140 miles of range. Lotus Evija This all-electric supercar has a top speed of 200mph and 250 miles of range. In addition, it has four motors combined to produce a staggering 1972bhp. And while the pandemic might have delayed the production, we were impressed by our prototype drive and can't wait to see the supercars on the street. Genesis Electrified GV70 Notable GV70 model features include 482bhp, 516lb-ft, and a 310-mile range, all of which offer a formidable challenge to the BMW iX3. And with a 350kW charger, the posh-looking Genesis offering can be charged from 10-80% in 18 minutes. Other standout features include a noise reduction system, E-Terrain mode to simplify your driving experience in challenging environments, and an automated electronic suspension system. Skoda Enyag iV Coupé: We expect Skoda to retain the battery size from the standard Enyag iV model, but efficiency might be improved. The new model features improved aerodynamics with up to 333 miles for the range-topping 77kWh battery. In addition, Skoda's Enyag iV Coupé will have a sloped roof for aesthetics. July Toyota Bz4x: Like the Nissan Ariya, Toyota's first bespoke EV price tag in the UK will start from £41,950. And while there are doubts about the maker's ability to face off with the industry's established rivals, Toyota's long-standing experience with high-end crossovers can't be overlooked. The Bz4X model is available in a 201bhp single-motor model and a 248bhp twin-motor four-wheel-drive model. The latter top-range has an impressive sub-8.0sec 0-62mph time. Nissan Ariya: The Nissan Ariya is a powerful Volkswagen ID 4 competitor, and with entry-level models starting from £41,845, it looks like the rivalry will go all the way. The electric SUV has front-wheel-drive models powered by a 63kWh battery and range toppers four-wheel-drives with 248bhp and a sub 8.0sec 0-62mph time. Volkswagen ID Buzz: The ID Buzz brings back the legendary bus styling, complete with the retro styling. It comes in three variants as well – people carrier, commercial vehicle, and camper. Notably, all the variants are modeled with the firm's MEB platform in mind. More importantly, Volkswagen has a long-wheelbase model lined up for 2023 and another mid-decade model promising ""fully autonomous driving."" Autumn September Lucid Air: According to the carmaker, the coupe's top-rung models will offer up to 500 miles of range with a staggering 1056bhp output. And with such astronomical numbers, it's no surprise that people refer to it as the next Tesla. The entry-level models have a 395bhp electric motor and a 75kWh battery (Samsung-supplied) with 240 miles of range. Renault Mégane E-Tech Electric Despite the looming transformation into a crossover, our first impressions of the Megane E-Tech Electric were largely positive. The 215bhp power output and 221lb-ft make it quick, while the unique styling makes it efficient and comfortable to drive EV. Besides the alluring design, the car also has a claimed range of 186 and 292 miles, and you can expect to hit speeds of 62mph in 7.4sec. Winter November BMW iX1: The German carmaker is readying itself for an X1 electric version. The electric car will replace the i3, a car model that has been around for about a decade. And with the brand's eyes set on capitalizing on the growing EV model range, the BMW iX1 will be a perfect addition. Hyundai Ioniq 5 N: The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N will possibly pack a twin-motor powertrain with a remarkable sub 4.0sec 0-62mph time. The retro-styled EV will adapt its N performance credentials with the 600bhp figure, making it the fastest Hyundai car. Polestar 3: While details might be scanted on the ground, we expect the Polestar 3 styling to be inspired by the Precept concept. There's very little information on the final design and powertrain specs, but sustainability will be a significant driving factor in the production process. Audi E-Tron: Depending on the variant, we believe the E-Tron could offer between 249 and 373 miles. Besides the cliché facelift, you can expect a more powerful battery, among other improvements. Lotus Type 132: Like Polestar 3, details are thin on the ground about the model. Some of the details we know now are that the EV will be assembled in China, and there will be two variants. The entry-level model is expected to offer about 600bhp while the flagship might go as high as 750bhp. We're not sure why the maker decided to snob LOTUS' Hethel facility, but let's hope the output will amaze us even more. Kia EV6 GT: With an impressive 577 bhp, Kia's rapid performance crossover will be faster than the famous Porsche Taycan 4S. Our initial impressions were the EV6 GT makes for a powerful and sporty electric car. December Ssangyong Korando E-Motion: After the recent financial takeover, all signs point to a rejuvenated Ssangyong. We anticipate 2022 will be the year we see the Korando E-Motion. As you'd expect, the electric supercar will be based on the standard Korando with a more rugged SUV design. Potential rivals include the MG ZS EV. BMW i7: The BMW i7 will be a perfect choice for EV enthusiasts looking for a low-slung luxurious electric saloon model. The German Autocar maker's goal is to produce a competent Mercedes-Benz's EQS competitor. We don't have everything at the moment, but spy shots have painted an EV-specific trim with bespoke wheel designs and a blanked-ff grille – an essential aspect, especially for people not fazed by BMW's newly introduced grille. In addition, the EV will have a 105kWh battery, churning out 400 miles of range and 600bhp. Skoda Enyag vRS: Skoda's performance vRS will aim to rival Volkswagen's ID 4 GTX. It will be a first-time electric model for the brand. Our anticipation is a similar powertrain with a 300 miles range of 0-62mph in 6.0 seconds. Coming in 2023 Are you not entertained? Well, if this year's electric car entrants don't excite you, we have some exciting models poised for the year after, 2023. Mini Hatchbacks and Countryman: 2022 marks Mini Oxford factory's official transition to electrified powered cars. Its three-door Hatchback and Countryman will remain popular product offerings, but we can expect more versatility. In the process of transitioning to a fully-electric model, there will be revamping and improvements to make your driving experience enjoyable. Fisker Ocean: While Fisker has had a fair share of controversy, the Ocean model shouldn't be written off. Our impression is it could be a severe contender rivaling the Tesla Model Y and Audi Q4 E-Tron. The pricing will start from £30,000 for entry-level models to £50,000 for the top rangers. Notably, the Fisker Ocean has more than 250 miles range and a spacious interior. Peugeot e-308: According to Peugeot, the new battery-electric 308 hatchback and SW estate models will have a more powerful 50kWh battery. Both variants will also be more efficient and with a longer range than its predecessor, the e-208 supermini. And with production set to commence in 2023, we can expect a front-wheel-drive system with 154bhp and 199lb-ft. Ford Electric SUV: The Ford Electric will be the first passenger car coming from a Ford and Volkswagen deal. And what's the catch? You might be asking. The upcoming electric SUV will be developed on the German manufacturer's MEB platform. And while details are still scanty about what is in store, we know the models will have about 200 miles of range. In addition, the SUV variants will be driven by a selection of single-motor rear-drive and dual-motor four-wheel-drive powertrains. Porsche Macan EV and Audi Q6 E-Tron: Making Porsche's second attempt at car electrification, the Macan sets out to replicate the first's success in the Taycan. And the best part about it is the new model will be produced after a successful Porsche and Audi collaboration. For now, we know the Macan will be built on a new platform with a four-wheel-drive dual-motor setup offering an impressive 700bhp and 750lb-ft. Chevrolet Silverado EV: Chevrolet has expressed its desire to launch its nets in the reasonably new electric car industry. The new Silverado pick-up will feature a powerful battery pack of up to 200kWh, 400 miles of range (100 more than the renowned Ford F-150 Lightning). In addition, the Silverado will come with a dual-motor, four-wheel-drive powertrain churning out 660bhp and more than 780lb-ft of torque. Rolls-Royce Spectre: How about an electronic Rolls Royce? According to the maker, the first one on the line will be big. Like the petrol-powered Wraith, the Spectre will use the patented luxury platform. We should also expect a 600+bhp dual-motor powertrain. MG Hatchback: While it might be small in size, MG's Hatchback is set to rival UK's best-selling car, the Vauxhall Corsa. The Hatchback will join the 5 EV and ZS EV in the brand's electric line-up. Volkswagen Aero-B According to the German automotive manufacturer, the Aero-B will rival the Polestar 3 and Tesla's Model 3. It will be developed on the largest Volkswagen MEB platform with notable features, including remarkable 431 miles of range. The aerodynamic efficient electric car will also be sold with front or rear-wheel drive. Vauxhall Astra: The Astra is an exciting prospect with all the metrics pointing to a possible UK's best-selling car. The company will launch petrol, diesel, and plug-in models next year, and we can't wait to see what the EV variant has in store for us. Smart SUV: With the production set for China, a Smart SUV will be here with us in 2023. Smart is a partnership program between Geely and Mercedes, with the SUV model taking up the former's SEA platform."
4,The Beginner’s Guide To Electric Vehicles,autos-trucks," If you were introduced to driving in a petrol or diesel car, electric cars may seem like they're a whole world apart. Many drivers find themselves clinging to the familiarity of a fuel-powered engine, when in fact, electric engines are usually cheaper to maintain, drive, and insure. If you've just made the leap to electric, you might be wondering what exactly you're dealing with. Luckily, we're here with our essential Beginner's Guide To Electric Vehicles. What Is An Electric Vehicle? An electric vehicle, also known as an alternative vehicle, is a general term for any vehicle which is driven by an electric engine, as opposed to conventional vehicles which are powered by petrol or diesel. A vehicle which uses both electricity and petrol/diesel is known as a Hybrid. The fact that there are no fossil fuels involved makes electric cars more environmentally friendly, as they release few to no carbon emissions. They are also fume-free, cheaper to run, and can even earn the driver tax incentives and other benefits from their national government. The Basic Guide To Electric Engines Electric vehicles are driven by an electric motor, which is powered by a traction battery pack (also called a stack). Each axle is controlled by one motor, so EVs are usually front or rear-drive. Some manufacturers, however, add an extra motor, which makes the vehicle a four-wheel drive. When the driver puts their foot down, they can adjust their speed using a controller. The controller manages their speed by regulating how much power is directed to the motor. The batteries can be charged either at a selected charging point or home charging setup. Some electric vehicles can also be charged using the energy that is generated when the vehicle is moving. Common Maintenance Issues As a general rule, electric vehicles contain fewer parts than cars with internal combustion engines. This means that they are usually easier to repair and require less maintenance. However, as with any car, there are a few mechanical issues that you may need to watch out for: Brakes An electric car decelerates using a system called regenerative braking; kinetic energy is transformed by the motor into stored energy for later use. This means that the car is not as reliant on the brakes to slow down. As such, there is much less wear and tear on the brake pads of an electric car versus a petrol or diesel car. However, you still need to regularly flush out the brake fluid; electric cars use the same gyroscopic hydraulic fluid found in combustion engines, so unless you regularly flush out your brakes, your system is still at risk of corrosion. You will also need to replace your brake pads and discs, just the same as with a conventional combustion engine. Battery The battery of an electric car is an essential component. As nearly all parts of an EV are reliant on the battery to operate, it is essential that the battery is in top condition. This means that you should not allow your battery to run completely flat, and keep your car charge above at least 20%. You should perform regular maintenance on the battery of your vehicle. If you are having problems starting your car, there are two batteries that you should check: the twelve-volt battery which powers the dashboard and electrical components, and the lithium-ion battery. The twelve-volt battery can be jump-started from a petrol or diesel car, but the lithium-ion battery cannot. You also cannot jumpstart the twelve-volt battery car using another electric vehicle. If your lithium-ion battery breaks down, you are better oﬀ investing in a new vehicle. The batteries for electric cars are worth tens of thousands of pounds, plus labour costs, so it is more financially viable to replace the whole car, instead of just the battery. Tires Just like a standard vehicle, your car’s tires will get wear and tear issues over time. Many electric cars are prone to erosion of the tire tread, due to the heavy weight of the vehicle. You should get your tires replaced at least every 6-12 months for your car to stay in top condition. Just as with a petrol or diesel car, you should check your tire pressures and pump up where needed. Fluid Levels Electric cars don’t use radiator fluid or automatic transmission fluid, so the only fluid levels that you have to worry about are your coolant, brake and wiper fluids. Replace your coolant regularly, and then you only have to top up your brake and wiper fluids when necessary. How often you have to change your coolant may vary from model to model, so check your driver’s manual. Coolant should be replaced by a qualified technician, as EV cooling systems are usually sealed. Servicing Electric vehicles generally need to be serviced just as regularly as conventional cars, however, there is usually less that needs to be done, meaning that you will still save money when getting your car serviced. It may, however, be more diﬃcult to find a mechanic who specialises in electric vehicles, so look for big chains, as they are more likely to be experienced in servicing electric cars."
5,6 Popular Accessories That Protects Your Vehicle's Interior,autos-trucks," There are 6 popular accessories that you can purchase to protect your vehicle's appearance.. The accessories mentioned here are the most purchased products to keep your vehicle looking clean and attractive. Whether you are looking to protect the interior or exterior, measures taken to keep your vehicle looking its best and, at the same time, insuring retention of the vehicle’s top value, will be highly beneficial when it comes time to trade it in or sell. Even if you are not looking at selling your car in the near future, using accessories like new seat covers, floor mats or a car bra will make you proud to be seen in your vehicle, as well as the protection these accessories will provide. Lets take a moment and see how each interior accessory can improve a vehicle's appearance. Front-End Car Bra: The front-end car bra is an accessory that will provide protection for your vehicle’s front end, including chips to the paint and grill. The car bra is made to fit snugly and perfectly for maximum protection. Its value is in its ability to act as a guard from road hazards, such as bugs, chemicals (tar) and gravel on roadways. The bra also protects from pitting damage on your automobile’s grill and paint surfaces. The bra, while having an important protective feature, can also give your vehicle a classier appearance. A car bra is usually constructed of heavy vinyl and a firm padding underneath, the vehicle bra will stand the test of time. Most vehicle bras are easy to install and remove. The benefits in adding value, protection and a sleek look to your vehicle are well worth the small investment of a car front-end bra. Bug/Chipping Shields: Bug shields are another valuable protective piece you can add to your vehicle. Modern bug shields are designed aerodynamically to not only compliment the look of your car’s front end, but they also maximize fuel usage. By not allowing the air force to push against the vehicle, the aerodynamically made bug shields create a diversion in air flow so that your car doesn’t have to use extra fuel to compensate for the additional pressure. Bug shields are great for protecting your car from road debris, excessive bug collection and chipping from stones or other road hazards. Car Covers: A car cover is an essential accessory if you leave your vehicle outside in the harsh elements of the sun, rain or snow. The cover will protect your car from wear and tear and the hazards of extreme weather conditions when a garage or cover protection is not available. It should fit snugly around the normally exposed portions of the vehicle. Car covers are usually made of a heavy duty protected material that will keep the damaging weather elements away from the automobile’s painted surfaces. Car covers are especially valuable if you use them while shopping or when the vehicle is parked near someone or something that can bump into the vehicle and create paint or body damage. Floor Mats: Floor Mats are the perfect accessory to give your interior a new or more finished look. The mats are indispensable in the protection they provide against wear and tear on the floor's carpet. You can purchase floor mats in most any variety of colors, styles, and designs. They are available in materials such as rubber and clear plastic to name a few. Floor mats can be custom made specifically to your vehicle or purchased at auto parts stores. The benefits to having floor mats cannot be overstated. They aid in comfort when driving on long road trips, they protect from shoe damage in the acceleration area of the floor and they keep everyday dirt and grime from attaching to your vehicle’s original carpet. Purchasing floor mats at nominal prices can give your vehicle protection from years of floor or carpet damage in the vehicle. Window Tint: No matter what part of the world you live in, tinting your vehicle’s windows can offer protection in many ways. Window tinting has long been known to reduce the heat coming into your vehicle. Anyone that owns an automobile in the southwest will tell you that the sun’s heat (and damaging ultraviolet rays) is not only destructive, it is downright uncomfortable. So in these two ways, tinting can increase your comfort while driving and decrease fading or discoloration of the interior’s vinyl or fabric seats and dashboard. By choosing a safety film, you will get even more protection. A safety film on your vehicle’s windows has been known to reduce injuries to occupants from flying shattered glass in auto accidents. If you have a large object hit your windshield, the safety film may also stop the object from coming directly into your vehicle and hitting the driver and any passengers. If you live in tornado or earthquake zones, this type of film can also prevent injury as well, by acting as a buffer between you and the shattered glass. Seat Covers: Lastly, but certainly not less important, is seat covers and their numerous benefits. Seat covers protect the material of your car’s seats. This is very important for owners that: Live in sun drenched areas of the world, Work in conditions where your clothing is contaminated with dirt, grease, or other destructive materials, Participate in activities such as biking, hiking, or swimming (the chlorine alone is severely damaging if you are not fully dried off). Seat covers are not just about protecting, they can also provide a tailored and clean look to your vehicle’s interior. Your vehicle will look well kept and well taken care of if you purchase seat covers before any damage occurs. You can pull them off before selling or trading in your vehicle for that eye-appealing look that says you, the owner, took very good care of the car. Sometimes a clean and fresh looking interior will sell a vehicle even if the exterior is a bit worn. While there are numerous other accessories out there for your vehicle, the ones mentioned here will go a long way in giving you peace of mind. You will know that you have done what you can to insure that your vehicle looks close to new, even when it is ten years old. If you choose to sell your vehicle someday, the added accessories will most likely bring you the maximum value when you sell or trade-in your vehicle. You can never lose by adding protective accessories to your car."
6,Driving Safety Tips and Advanced Protection with Car Insurance,autos-trucks," Driving safely should always be your top concern when you're behind the wheel of a car, whether you're alone or with passengers. People are more distracted than ever, so it's crucial to know the basics of safe driving and practise them every time you're on the road to drive responsibly. According to global statistics, around 1.35 million people die in car accidents; on average, 3,700 people die daily. Non-fatal injuries affect another 20–50 million people, with many of them ending in long-term physical disabilities. Injury from driving is the most significant cause of death among young people aged 16 to 29. More than half of traffic deaths occur among young persons aged 15 to 44. Safe driving practices may appear straightforward and routine to drivers, yet they are frequently forgotten or ignored in today's frenetic driving world. Using shared insights and understanding the common causes of accidents will prevent them and help make the roads safer for everyone. Common safety measures for your safe driving Say goodbye to drunken driving: Drunk drivers cause the highest accident rates. Each year, these kinds of accident cases are increasing. Alcohol spawns a variety of impairments, many of which result in car accidents. Intoxication impairs response time, coordination, and inhibitions, even at low blood alcohol levels, leading to drivers making poor decisions. In larger quantities, alcohol causes impaired or double vision and loss of consciousness. Drunk driving isn't only a wrong idea; it's also against the law. It is easy to avoid drunk driving and save yourself and the surrounding people. Avoid distractions while driving: Some recent studies prove that distracted driving accidents are very close to those caused by drunken driving. Using a cell phone while driving can cause a twenty percent delay in reaction times; however, it isn't the case! In fact, given the continuous surge in cell phone use while driving, those figures may be too low. Distractions aren't limited to cell phones. Eating, applying makeup, using technological gadgets, or mingling with passengers all can potentially divert a driver's attention in dangerous ways. The best advice for avoiding driving distractions is to keep your mind focused on the road. Say goodbye to over speed: Posted speed limits follow the best requirements. You must make sure that your speed fits the limit. Faster speeds make controlling your car more difficult if things go wrong. To keep control of your car, ‌manage your speed. Along with this, you must keep a safe distance from the vehicle in front of you. It will significantly lower the chances of a collision, but it may be impractical in congested areas. Wear your seatbelt correctly: Safety experts believe that Seat belts are lifesavers. When worn correctly, they protect you from being thrown around inside a crashing vehicle and will improve your likelihood of outliving a car accident. Even a low-speed collision can send someone who isn't wearing a seatbelt careening into the dashboard or side window, causing severe head injuries or shattered bones. The unbelted occupant's conceivable fates at higher speeds are gruesome: from being thrown through the glass to being struck by other vehicles. Service your vehicle on time: Regular vehicle maintenance will ensure your safety. They will detect any potential safety hazards during the test so that car owners can fix them before they cause an accident. Improper tyre pressure is one of the most challenging maintenance issues that might cause a crash. You can check it with a pressure gauge and compare the pressure to the manufacturer's recommendations. The brakes of the vehicle are another critical component. If you sense a softness in the brake pedal or vibration when you apply the brakes, have them looked at by a competent mechanic. The brakes may be worn out. How to protect your car from unexpected losses Sometimes unexpected events may destroy your happiness. In most countries now, car insurance is compulsory by law. Car insurance typically includes financial protection against physical damage, bodily harm, or other related responsibilities from vehicle accidents. Auto insurance will act as a shield for your car's repair needs because of an accident and protect you if you're responsible for an accident that damages another person's car. Apart from the legal minimums, additional optional coverages you can add to your policy to improve your protection. After you and your insurer sign a contract, you'll pay a premium to keep your auto insurance coverage current and ready if something happens to you or your vehicle. The car insurance premium varies according to the factors such as the type of your car, your driving experience and coverages that are used for your policy. You can add extra coverages as per your needs. Now car insurance quotes are available online, making your insurance strategies more safe and easy."
7,Features And Applications Of Bobcat Excavators,autos-trucks," Excavators are massive construction machines with a stick, boom, cab, and bucket mounted on the ""house."" Hydraulic cylinders, fluid, and hydraulic automobiles are used to carry out a hydraulic excavator's capabilities and actions. A hydraulic cylinder operates in an essentially distinct manner from cable-operated excavators, which appoint winches and metallic ropes to reap actions. Attachments And Parts Of Excavators Excavators are made so that they can be used for various works. The power of hydraulic excavators has grown far beyond bucket excavation. Excavators are now commonly used for multiple purposes other than excavation. Many excavators have a fast coupler for easier attachment mounting, allowing the machine to be more productive on the worksite. Excavators are often used in conjunction with loaders and bulldozers. A dozer blade is found on compact, wheeled, and medium-sized excavators. This horizontal bulldozer blade is mounted to the undercarriage and is used to level and push discarded material back into a hole. It's made up of attachments that help in digging and holding. It also has a rotating platform and wheels, which provide it with the moving ability to lift and remove debris. Bobcat excavators use a set of hydraulic attachments consisting of lamps, quick couplers, and drills to do various works. The branches and parts used in excavators are augers, buckets, coupler, clamps, breakers, rippers, thumbs, boom, hydraulic cylinder, engines, cab, track frame, and a counterweight. People use excavators in massive and small systems. They are used for small housing initiatives, marine applications, removal of debris in construction areas, etc. Several types of excavators are based on the brand, purpose, and application. Different Types Of Bobcat Excavators Bobcat Crawler Excavators This type of bobcat excavator, also called a general-purpose excavator, has a boom, bucket, and arm on the machine's front side. It is known as an all-around excavator because it is used to dig worksites, demolish surfaces, lift heavy loads, and carry out trenching. These excavators are available in different sizes. Bobcat Dragline Excavators These excavators, recognized actually as draglines, are big excavating machines used for terrain development and floor mining. Draglines function by decreasing a bucket onto the terrain from an increase, reeling the bucket in with a winch placed on the front side of the machine. Bobcat Suction Excavators (Vacuum Excavators) Suction excavators function as suction pipes that impart as much as four hundred horsepower. It will release a water jet for losing the ground. After this, the tube, which consists of sharp enamel on the edge, creates a vacuum that contains soil and particles as many as two hundred miles consistent with the hour. Bobcat Skid Steer Excavators Skid steer excavators are lighter than tune loaders, making them less difficult to transport regularly and less time and cost. They even have a strong recognition within the production world, way to pinnacle producers who have constructed pleasant machines over the years. Bobcat Long Reach Excavators Long-achieved excavators are the remaining general-motive excavators. These machines have a prolonged growth and arm, giving a wide operating variety for duties pretty far from the system that is difficult to attain, including deep trenching and underwater digging. Bobcat Backhoe Excavators Another device you might often see on production sites is the backhoe loader. It is likewise frequently used for landscaping and mining duties. The edge of the backhoe loader is used to push surfaces with miles of substances together with the soil. Multiple blades (bucket) are hooked up to the front of the device, and an arm, boom and bucket are on the lower back. The boom and arm on the lower back have the same motive as a general-motive excavator. However, as opposed to being capable of rotating 360 degrees, it best rotates approximately 205 degrees. Bobcat Power Shovel Excavators A power shovel is a piece of production equipment that excavates the soil and loads it into trucks or different hauling devices. They can excavate all parts of the earth beside the stable rock without earlier loosening. Bobcat Wheeled Excavators They are general-motive excavators. The principal difference is that they run on wheels instead of going for walks on tracks. A wheeled excavator could push from one process to another, even if it were on the road. But, for long-distance travel, crawler excavators usually carry a trailer. This manner is extra convenient and saves extra time and fees for the company. Bobcat Short Swing Radius Excavator Bobcat short swing radius excavator is one different variant on a general-motive excavator, with an equal degree of overall performance and utilization; however, a brief swing radius superstructure gives many blessings in the city and limited areas."

9,How to keep the car stable in winter?,autos-trucks," In extremely cold weather, there are many potential risks. So, here are some car parts you should take the time to check before going on long winter journeys. Antifreeze prevents the engine coolant from freezing, so make sure the mixture is mixed in the correct ratio - otherwise the radiator or water pump could freeze and cause significant damage. During the winter months or in areas with very low temperatures, your car will need a more concentrated coolant - consult your car's owner's manual to choose the right fluid. Some car models use antifreeze with a very long shelf life, while other models may require the solution to be changed after only a few years. Antifreeze solutions are very toxic, so close the lid tightly and store them in a safe place. Whether your car is powered by petrol, diesel, hybrid or electric motor, lower temperatures mean more work on the battery. Every vehicle you use has a 12V battery to ensure that critical electrical systems run smoothly, so battery health checks are essential. Consider replacing the 12V battery pack if it is more than 5 years old. If you do not plan to use it for a long time, consider using a battery charger to ensure the best condition of the battery. If you drive electric vehicles and don't plan to use them during the holidays, make sure the battery level is at least 10% before you park your car. Your vehicle will usually have basic emergency assistance equipment, depending on the regulations in each country, but if you are planning to travel during winter time, do a thorough check and prepare some extra gear. Check the condition of the spare tire and inflator, or any associated equipment such as a jack, a screw changer or a tow hook. Bring a phone charger. If the vehicle is not equipped with a USB port, buy an adapter for the 12V outlet on the vehicle, which is usually very affordable. Bring warm things like blankets, coats, hats, gloves and boots – just in case you get stuck on the street in bad weather. Keep water and snacks like cookies or chocolates in the car in case of an emergency. Make sure the fuel tank is kept at least 1/4 of a tank because if you suddenly get stuck while on the road, it is necessary to keep the car engine running. During winter, the number of hours of sunlight is less, plus bad weather will reduce your visibility in traffic. This means that the lighting system on the vehicle is an important factor to ensure safety when traveling. Make sure all lights are working and clean. Carefully check the side turn signals as well as the license plate lights. Pay attention to adjust the headlight illumination angle in case of carrying more passengers/cargo than usual. Tires are the only part of the vehicle that is in direct contact with the road surface - with an area just larger than a fistful - and in bad weather, tires have to work harder, so maintenance and tire condition control is paramount. Tire grooves are recommended to be at least 2/32"" deep. Check for damage to the tires and make sure the tire pressure is appropriate for the vehicle's load. If you plan to go into ice and snow terrain, be sure to use a series of specialized tires suitable for your journey"
10,Why Are Catalytic Converters Being Stolen?,autos-trucks," Why Are Catalytic Converters Being Stolen? A Catalytic converters is a key component of a car’s emissions system, reducing the amount of harmful pollution going out the tailpipe. Catalytic converters first appeared on vehicles in the  United States in 1975. They help transform hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides (all the bad stuff) into water vapor and carbon dioxide, (the stuff we can live with). In a catalytic converter, the catalyst (in the form of platinum, palladium and rhodium) is coated onto a ceramic honeycomb that is housed in a muffler-like package attached to the exhaust pipe. Where is the catalytic converter located? The catalytic converter is located on the underside of your car, in the exhaust system between the exhaust manifold and muffler. How Are catalytic converter being Stolen? Thieves generally steal catalytic converters by sliding underneath a vehicle and sawing it  with a powerful hand-held power saw that’s capable of cutting metal at a very high speed, the whole operation can take under a minute. Vehicle repair shops that used to see 2-3 of these thefts per month have reported an increase of this thefts to as many as 5-10 thefts per day within the last year or so. How to tell your catalytic converter has been stolen When a catalytic converter has been removed, your car or truck will make a loud roaring sound that will get louder as you push the gas pedal. Depending on your vehicle, you may have check engine light turn on. Most newer vehicles are equipped with an engine control unit, also known as an ECM, that monitors various sensors in your engine. You can have a look under your vehicle and if your catalytic converter is missing, you will likely be able to see that somebody has cut a chunk out of your exhaust system. What should I do when my converter is stolen? Step 2: Contact the local authorities/Police If you find your catalytic converter has been stolen, its highly recommended to contact your local authorities/Police immediately so they can start an investigation by checking cameras nearby and work to see if they can help catch the person or group responsible for the theft. Additionally, a police report may be essential for you to get re-imbursed by insurance coverage. Step 2: Contact Your Insurance Company Depending on your vehicle insurance, your car insurance may cover your catalytic converter replacement. If you have comprehensive coverage on your vehicle, then you're typically covered against catalytic converter theft. Step 3: Visit a Mechanic Most cars will require an aftermarket Catalytic Converter to be welded to your vehicle exhaust pipes. The average cost of a catalytic converter replacement is between $500 and can be as high as $2500 including parts and labor. Prices will greatly vary depending on year, make and model of your vehicle. It usually takes from one to two hours for a typical catalytic converter replacement. While your new catalytic converter is being installed, you can ask your mechanic to add an anti-theft device to prevent future thefts. Can you drive without a catalytic converter? Most vehicles can be physically driven without a catalytic converter without any damage to your vehicle but it may be illegal to drive your vehicle without a catalytic converter in your state and your vehicle will most likely to fail and emissions test during inspection. How to prevent catalytic converter theft Its always a good idea to park your vehicle in well-lit areas when possible. If you have a personal garage, keep your car in the garage with the door closed when the vehicle is not in use. Some newer vehicles have a security settings that trigger the alarm when it senses vibrations. The sawing of your catalytic converter will be enough to set off these alarms. An after market alarm can also be installed on most vehicles at an affordable price. This will make your catalytic converter identifiable to law enforcement. The idea is that a thief who sees the etching moves on to an easier target. Police in some communities have joined with local vehicle repair shops to sponsor etching events. You can contact your local mechanics and find out if they offer this service. Having a Video surveillance around your garage or driveway is also useful if you have the budget for it. Most thieves would automatically leave when they see a camera. A steel shield that fits over the catalytic converter, requiring time and extra tools to remove. Cages made of rebar or other high-strength steel that's difficult to cut. Stainless steel cables welded from the catalytic converter to the car’s frame. Having the converter welded in place also makes it more difficult to remove"
11,How to Get Paid For Scrapping a Car,autos-trucks," Thanks to the high cost of scrap metal, your old, rusty, banged up car can make you decent cash if you know what to do with it. On average, you can make anywhere between $400 - $1200 on a non-running junk car if you follow the right steps to scrap your old car. The question remains how to do it. The following paragraphs will tell you exactly how. Most will tell you to find the nearest local scrapyard to get cash on your junk car but there are some things you need to do that will save you time and money. Step 1: Drains the Fluids The scrapyard will not take your car if it has fluids in it. So the first thing you want to do is drain the oil, the transmission fluid, the differential fluid, the freon, any gasoline in the tank - virtually everything needs to be evacuated. You will not be able to drain the freon because the process requires special equipment. Your local AC guy will have an evacuation machine to help you out in that regard. Step 2: Identify and Take Out Sellable Parts A common mistake a lot of people make is to move from step 1 straight to the scrap yard. The problem with that is, taking your junk car to the scrap yard without first identifying and removing some valuable parts will reduce the money you will get on the car. The scrapyard will give you a lump sum price that is usually determined by the car’s weight and sometimes its condition (availability of resellable parts like the airbag for example). Making you lose out on getting extra money on some of the things on the car you can remove and sell yourself. There are few things on a car that are worth money. For example, if your car has alloy or aluminum wheels you will want to take them off and sell on craigslist or Facebook marketplace. They are worth a lot of money on their own. You can get up to $250 for all four wheels. Other parts you would like to sell for extra cash are the center caps, hub caps, and emblems. They are easy to ship and are usually in high demand. You will be able to sell them for $30+. Tail lights, headlights, and side mirrors are common impact-damaged car parts and they are also usually in high demand. It takes a few minutes to disassemble and you can sell them north of $60 online. Step 3: Get Appropriate Paperwork To be able to sell your car to a scrap yard, you must have at least two documents - your ID and the vehicle’s registration papers. Most scrap yards will not demand the car’s title because they can just easily check for the VIN number on the car. As far the paperwork for the process goes, any reputable scrap yard will help you out with that (this should be a criteria in choosing a scrap yard you want to sell to). Step 4: Pick a Scrap Yard Speaking about choosing a scrap yard, there are some things you should look out for. First is the obvious - their prices. Some will try to lowball you on the cost of the vehicle so it is important you find out the price of vehicle parts so you can have a rough estimate in your head. This will guide you to get a fair price on your vehicle. Another thing you should look out for is their special service. Reputable scrap yards provide convenience and will most often offer to come pick your car for free. Also look out for their customer service. Questions like “how long does it take to complete a transaction” and “how will I get paid” should be satisfactorily answered. Typically, the answer to the former question should be nothing more than 24 hours."
12,7 Signs Your Car Tire Is About To Burst,autos-trucks," Imagine being stranded in the middle of nowhere because of a flat tire. Just thinking about it is stressful, so you must pay attention to the health of your tires to avoid being in this situation. In addition, a good tire significantly improves your car’s braking performance; hence it’s recommended to check your tires’ pressure frequently or at least once a month. Here’s a list of signs you should look at when checking your tire’s pressure and call a tire repair service immediately, in case you find any. It’s an alarming sign if your tire is losing air pressure. It may be due to a small leak coming in contact with a sharp object on the road. You can get it patched or replaced. The tread on the tire is the rubber surface that should be as firm as a rock. But with time, the tread on your tire can deteriorate, which means you’ll need fresh rubber. An easy way to check the state of your tire’s tread is through a penny test. Often the tread on a tire wears off at different rates. Some parts look fine, while others may look worn out, which is essentially uneven tire wear. Uneven tire wear is usually an outcome of misaligned wheels, improperly inflated tires, and faulty suspension parts. You should be concerned if strange noises and vibrations are coming from your tire even on smooth roads. The cause may be incorrect wheel alignment or an improperly inflated tire, so it’s best to take your car to a mechanic before these odd vibrations snowball into a larger problem. If you see bubbles forming on the sides and threads of your tire, it’s time to get a new one. These bubbles might be a result of production defects or air seeping into its internal layers. And once that happens, there’s no option other than tire replacement. Cracked rubber of your tire calls for a new tire since it’s an indicator of rubber having worn out to the point that it’s beyond repair. A wrench kit on a tire. If you’ve used a tire for a long time, it’s going to wear out one day.

13,Habits that cost you money to change tires,autos-trucks," Parking on uneven surfaces, parking too long in one spot, or slamming onto the sidewalk can all cause tire damage. Currently, many car owners do not have the concept of needing to protect or take care of their tires due to their long tire life, usually 3-5 years. In addition, tires are only external details, so many car owners think that they do not need to be cared for too carefully. However, the failure to take care of the tires and some habits of using the car are inadvertently affecting the life and safety of the vehicle when operating. Tire pump Overinflating the tire can cause the tire to explode when it collides with a sharp object such as a stone, nail, or pavement. Even operating for a long time in hot weather can cause a tire to explode. Meanwhile, underinflating will cause tires to wear quickly due to the large contact surface, especially when carrying heavy loads, in addition to affecting the rims and shock absorbers. The manufacturer recommends that the tires should be inflated as indicated on the door stamp. In winter, they can be inflated more, in summer less than 0.1 kgf/cm2 (often called ""weigh""). Do not change the tire parameters given by the manufacturer. Parking Many car owners have an unbalanced parking habit, which puts pressure on the different tires, leading to the wheels parked on the road surface being pressed, wearing out faster than the wheels parked on the sidewalk. This way of parking also causes the suspension to degrade unevenly. Parking too close to the sidewalk will cause the tire to rub against the concrete and sharp positions can cause a tire to be torn or punctured. Some drivers even drive recklessly to the point of parking half the wheel on the road, half on the sidewalk, which will cause the wheel to be distorted. Parking in the sun can also be harmful because rubber is more resistant to heat. Parking on uneven, steep terrain puts weight on uneven tires, which wear out faster. Car owners should also note that if you park your car for too long without moving, you should inflate the tires more than recommended by the manufacturer, choose a flat place and should start the engine at least once a week. Vehicle Operation With universal tires that are only suitable for traveling in the city or on flat roads, do not carry too much weight for a long time, should not move on off-road roads with many rocks. Constant braking, continuous accelerator pedaling, and high-speed cornering can also cause tires to wear out faster. Going quickly down a pothole or over a speed bump is also not the right thing to do. When subjected to great force and folding, tire wear, distortion or explosion is quite likely. Car owners should also have tire maintenance habits such as tire rotation, dynamic balance for the safest and most effective tire operation."
14,Matching your  classic car's paint colours might not be as easy as you think,autos-trucks," The classic car is usually given a complete respray to mark its relaunch at the end of most repair efforts. There are always individuals who are adamant about maintaining the vehicle's authenticity by respraying it in its original color, especially if the majority of the paintwork is in good condition. No one expects a fresh color to blend seamlessly with a paint job that has been in place for at least two decades. The paint will have rusted and become embedded with road dirt over time. It's possible that the sun bleached it. Furthermore, there's a good chance you'll find newer paint on some of the panels. Because matching paint colors to the original is challenging, these good intentions almost always come as a cost. Failure to match paint colors accurately will cause a lot of frustration. A costly makeover can end up looking patchwork quilt-like. It will be time and effort well spent  to invest the time and effort to precisely match paint colors. Matching existing paintwork may look simple at first inspection, and it should be if the proper steps are followed. The first step is to figure out what color you want to use, and as everyone who has seen the movies knows, there are at least fifty shades of every color. As a result, it's essential to arrive to the paint store with as much information as possible on the exact color and shade of paint which will match the existing color. To get the most accurate results, locate the vehicle identifying number (VIN)plate, which is normally situated in the engine bay. The VIN is made up of 17 elements (digits and capital letters) and is unique to each car. It has the key to a wealth of genetic information, including the paint code. Any restorer should have access to the VIN code since it has the key to precisely duplicating existing paint colors. The paint matching hunt isn't done just because the code has been uncovered. It has only just begun in most situations. The reason for this is because paint makers have a tendency to revise formulas on a regular basis. In ideal light, two batches of the same paint color may be identical. Its various colors may absorb light in quite different ways, causing it to reflect differently under certain lighting circumstances. To prevent this from happening, always bring a sample of the ""original"" paint color with you, ensuring sure the sample isn't taken from an area that has been resprayed at any point over the car's long history. Having the full car with you whenever possible is the greatest way to locate the perfect solution. If the VIN cannot be located for any reason, the ever-helpful members of the owner's club relating to the vehicle manufacturers club may be able to assist. Many of these groups will have their own archives, which will chronicle which colors were used on which models and when. Choosing a paint facility with high-quality mixing equipment will go a long road toward ensuring a good paint job. These companies have cutting-edge technology at their disposal  that allows them to match vehicle paint while employing employees with knowledge and a desire to alter the color using their tried-and-true ways. These are the finishing touches are essential for a flawless paint match and restoration."
15,Its wise to keep your eyes on you classic car's suspension system,autos-trucks," Shock absorbers, springs, and other components of a vehicle's suspension system, particularly those used in cars made in the 1950s and 1960s, were designed to last. If a car has been on the road for sixty or even seventy years, its suspension system has almost certainly been overhauled at least once. That doesn't mean the owner/restorer shouldn't maintain a close check on the suspension system of their beloved car, including how it sits on the road and behaves. Risks should never be taken, and maintenance, including entire overhauls, should never be postponed. When a car is driven on public roadways, it puts the driver, their passengers, and the general public in danger. When evaluating a historic car for purchase, it's important to pay close attention to the suspension to make sure it's in good operating order. Complacency must now be allowed to creep in after the restoration has been finished. That means the suspension system should be inspected on a regular basis and any indicators of damage, including potential harm, should be remedied. That's why it's critical to have at least a rudimentary understanding of a vehicle's suspension, including what parts can be replaced and what options are available. A suspension repair can be approached in two ways by antique automobile owners. The initial step is to look for parts made by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). Car makers used to make these parts model specific, even taking into account the year a certain model was manufactured, all those years ago. Those who value guaranteed safety and authenticity will virtually always choose OEM parts in order to restore their vehicle to its original condition. OEM parts are becoming increasingly difficult to come by these days, and the rarer the model, the more difficult it is. As a result, OEM parts have grown prohibitively pricey for those who aren't particularly concerned about authenticity. Aftermarket parts are another option for historic automobile owners. Unlike OEM components, aftermarket parts are manufactured by third-party companies. Aftermarket parts are typically less expensive than OEM parts, and they allow drivers to modify their suspension system to something more modern without compromising the vehicle's aesthetics. The ease with which the vehicle's suspension can be reconditioned and repaired will vary from model to model with the necessary parts in place. The parallelogram type, swinging arm type, and multi-link system are the three forms of suspension available for vehicles. A coil spring is positioned between two wishbones, and either a transverse spring or a double transverse spring is used to replace the lower wishbone or the upper wishbone in parallelogram suspension systems. In many cases, the lower wishbone is larger than the upper, causing the wheel to tilt as it rises, preventing tyres from rubbing against the vehicle's inner wing. Although swivel pins are fairly popular in parallelogram type suspension systems these days, an older vehicle can be equipped with a kingpin and stub axle setup, often known as a hang-over beam axle. The swinging arm suspension is the second type of suspension. Wheels and bearings are located at the end of an arm that carries the steering swivel pin in this arrangement, with the entire assembly pivoting in a format known as the Dubonnet system at the time for reasons that have never been explained. Anyone who owns a car with a Dubonnet system swinging arm suspension system will quickly learn how much maintenance is required to keep the system in good working order. As a result, when most owners and/or restorers changed their suspension systems, they did away with Dubonnet. The centrepoint of a Dubonnet featured encased coil springs and shock absorbers sealed in oil to ensure that the suspension parts were constantly lubricated, consisting of an extremely rigid axle beam with sprung steering and suspension arms that pivoted around kingpins mounted on the end of the axle. Everything was fine—as long as the system was kept in perfect working order, resulting in a pleasant ride. Any lubrication leaks would have a severe impact on the vehicle's suspension and ride quality almost immediately. The multi-link suspension system is the third type of suspension system that may be found in UK and European cars from the 1950s and 1960s. A multi-link suspension system features one or more longitudinal arms, with a flexible mounting replacing the traditional top link and a telescopic arm acting as a kind of kingpin. Mercedes-Benz introduced it in the 1960s, and it can now be found on many automobiles made in the late 1960s and early 1970s. While only the driver and passengers will truly benefit from a well-maintained suspension system, with little apparent evidence for casual spectators to appreciate how much effort and money has gone into making ideal suspension, it will still be a sensible investment in terms of comfort and safety."

18,Customising Your Company Vehicle: Why You Should Choose Wrapping Over Repainting,autos-trucks," We’ve all seen those company cars and vans, with custom logos, artwork, and advertising. Having your details written on a vehicle, alongside an eye-catching design, is a fantastic marketing strategy that quite literally takes your name on the road to your next potential client. But why is vehicle wrapping your best option, and not painting? Let's take a look. Affordability Having your vehicle(s) repainted can be a huge expense that will not only decrease the resale value of the vehicle, but make it difficult to alter in case of a rebrand, change of information, or liquidation. On the other hand, car wrapping is a less intrusive and often cheaper way of redesigning your vehicle to promote your business, by placing a large vinyl decal or graphic directly over the original paint. If you decide to resell the vehicle, the resale value will be much greater than a repainted car. This is due to being able to completely remove the wrap without damaging the original paintwork, meaning the vehicle will appear brand new. Durability Can you imagine spending your hard-earned money on a full body repaint, only to find it has been scratched by a stray stone on the road? Vinyl wrap is a lot more durable, providing a layer of protection over your original paintwork. It won’t get scratched as easily as paint, so you can relax knowing that your new look vehicle will stay looking great for much longer. Precision Painting graphics and specific designs can be extremely difficult. You are relying on the artistry of an individual and there is no guarantee that your vehicle will live up to your expectations. But when you decide to have your vehicle wrapped, you will be able to see exactly how it will turn out before the wrap is applied. Design elements like lettering will also be more precise, as there is more freedom to adjust and reposition the wrap to suit the contours of the vehicle. Installation Time If you were to opt for having your vehicle repainted, you will be looking at one to two weeks before it is ready for collection. Once receiving your newly painted car, you will then need to allow time for the paint to dry properly before driving it regularly. It only takes three to five days for a vehicle to be fully wrapped, and it will be ready to drive immediately after collection. Maintenance To keep that ‘new car’ shine on your repainted car, you will need to make sure it is washed and waxed regularly. This can take up a lot of time, money, and effort. Car wraps will keep that ‘new car’ shine automatically and will only require occasional washing (bar any unforeseen bird mishaps). This means you can spend less time cleaning, and more time driving. Repetition Something you may want to consider if you have a fleet of vehicles that need customising, is the ability to correctly duplicate the same design. If you are spending money to brand your vehicles, you want your graphics to be consistent across all of them. Repainting vehicles can lead to all sorts of unforeseen, unavoidable variables such as colour changes, lettering issues, and positioning problems. The benefit of opting for a car wrap is that you can guarantee a uniform fleet, identical to the original design, and you won’t have to worry about a misspelt word or wonky logo. Changing Minds The great thing about car wrapping is that if you change your mind, want to go in a different direction, or no longer have use of a company car or fleet, you can easily have the wrap taken off. This will revert the vehicle to its original state, causing no damage to the original paintwork. Conclusion The way your company vehicle looks reflects you and your business, so it is vital that you give your potential clients the right impression. Opting to have your car wrapped will ensure that one of your key marketing assets will look eye-catching, professional, and make people want to know more."
19,5 Simple Tips For Smooth Driving In Winter,autos-trucks," Winter can be one of the most challenging seasons for driving. Weather extremes might include heavy snow, freezing fog, reduced visibility, slippery conditions on the road, and more. But it is also a time when many of us are still very busy — especially when preparing for Christmas and New Year. While it is important to prepare well for driving in Winter and take all the necessary safety precautions, this does not need to be difficult or time-consuming. With the simple but highly effective tips below, you can prepare your car to meet the challenges of Winter and enjoy a smooth season of driving. TIP 1: Book In Advance As the busy holiday season of Halloween, Bonfire Night, and Christmas approaches, demand for services may be higher than ever. This is also true of all things automotive. If you urgently need a repair or service, consider booking early to avoid disappointment. Many garages are currently experiencing busy periods and may have weeks of waiting time to consider. This is also the case for driving tests - which have experienced a major backlog since lockdown, when social distancing made taking the test difficult or even impossible. Leaving an issue too late, such as a problem that then makes the car unsafe to drive, can be a major inconvenience. To avoid disappointment, aim to book necessary services and appointments well in advance. TIP 2: Reduce Your Driving Where possible, it can be helpful to reduce your driving in the Winter to only include essential journeys. Sticking to essential journeys can be safer as well as more environmentally friendly. You will not be contributing to additional congestion on the roads, or risking dangerous icy conditions, for example. If you use your car for work or business deliveries, consider delegating the task or outsourcing where possible. For example, more businesses than ever are switching to professional couriers to reduce their own driving. Decreasing your driving — or at least driving in a more fuel-efficient manner — is a great way to reduce overall spending and keep your Winter budget in check too. This is especially important due to certain seasonal added costs such as Christmas shopping and increased heating bills, for example. TIP 3: Make Any Minor Repairs It can be tempting to skip a car service until we find we have a serious issue that needs to be addressed. But taking early action can be safer and more cost-effective in the long run. Winter weather often exacerbates existing complications. It can make small issues into big problems in a short space of time, and leave you urgently needing a service at a very busy time of year. You can avoid this problem by doing a realistic assessment of what is currently bothering you about your car — such as unusual sounds, struggles, or a crack in the windscreen, for example — and then booking in at a reputable garage to get everything sorted. Shoring up minor issues is a great way to reduce the likelihood of a major issue later down the line as the weather becomes more severe. TIP 4: Be Prepared There is no better way to deal with an emergency or inconvenience than to be prepared for it in advance. Any change of season — and perhaps especially Winter — is a great time to take steps to prepare your car. This can include ensuring that you have up-to-date breakdown cover or roadside rescue in the event of an emergency, as well as packing your own essentials kit. A kit might include anti-freeze, blankets, a torch, mobile phone charger, water, and any details for your breakdown cover. It can also be worth checking any important routes in advance in case of diversions or accidents, and allowing extra time for journeys in the event of bad weather. This may be especially important for visits to family, or to Santa’s Grotto! Plan ahead, allow extra time, and you will be prepared for any eventuality. TIP 5: Protect Your Car The Winter season can be punishing for a car. Damage can be caused by excess moisture, frost, rust, and more. Take extra steps to prepare and protect your car where possible — such as investing in a car cover, using a garage, or even just parking safely - such as far from trees in windy conditions. You could also invest in specialised Winter tyres with the safest tread depth, incorporate a regular check process in your routine to identify any problems, as well as being sure to clean your lights and windscreens of any debris."
20,Limohire and sports car hire,autos-trucks," EXPLORE OUR BENTLEY MODELS Bentley, thanks to its owner (the Volkswagen Group), delivers a captivating blend of old-world British charm blended with modern luxury electronics and performance. The Bentayga, which joins the Flying Spur sedan and Continental GT coupe in the Bentley lineup, is the company's first SUV. The Mulsanne is still the ultimate Bentley, with an extended-wheelbase version available for people who would rather be driven than drive themselves. Bentley Motors is the world's most coveted luxury car brand, and it is celebratinit'sts centennial year Explore our model ranges for hire: Arnage, Bentayga, Continental GT, Flying Spur, Mulsanne and S1 1956 For pricing, specs, and additional information, see our Bentley reviews below. ARNAGE BENTLEY The Arnage is a luxurious sedan in the grand tradition, and it's very reliable and smooth. It accelerates almost as quickly as the 6.75 litres. The comfort level is top-notch, and the interior finishes can't be found in today's modern vehicles. Also, the Bentley Arnage was one of the first saloons to have its bodyshell built in-house at Crewe. This means that any issues two decades later are likely to be down to subsequent repair work. The Arnage can suffer from rust around the sills and rear wheel arches, as well as in the rear suspension mount areas. Replacement panels aren't cheap, but you can get brand-new front wings for around £1196 each, while replacement outer sills are priced at almost £489 each. The fairly tall and blunt front ends of the Arnage can lead to damage from road debris, so be on the lookout for signs of stone chips and damage to the (expensive to replace) radiator grille. Before you hire Bentley Arnage, ensure that: Leather and wood veneer are in good condition, with no cracks or splits to spoil the overall condition. You need to check the condition of the carpets and headlining for damage and signs of sagging. The same goes for the wood veneer used throughout, which should be in excellent condition and showing no signs of cracks in the lacquer or delamination; and you should carefully check the condition of the carpets (including in the boot), as wear isn't unknown on high-mileage examples. BENTLEY BENTAYGA Indeed, the speedy Bentley Bentayga is built to inspire exploration in its most basic form. Its commanding design is combined with a suite of cutting-edge technology to create a vehicle that excels on city streets, highways, and beyond... The Bentayga Speed is the pinnacle of SUV performance. The unique exterior makes a bold statement by itself – and it can be further emphasised by the various personalisation options available to you. Furthermore, about seven paint colours are available as standard on Bentayga A, Bentayga V8 and Bentayga Hybrid, increasing to 17 with Bentayga Speed. You can also prefer two additions to the range: Cambrian Grey, a solid grey suggestive of performance, and the striking Snow Quartz Pearlescent. You can explore these colours further with the Bentley configurator. BENTLEY CONTINENTAL GT The Bentley Continental GT is a great vehicle for making the trip memorable, even though it's designed to make you feel like you are living in the future. All of this magnificence comes at a high cost, but the six-figure investment only adds to the Bentley Continental GT's appeal. Most importantly, the Touring Specification comes standard on your Continental GT Speed and includes every feature you'll need on your distinct and diverse trips. Every trip is embarked on with the comfort and safety that you expect from a luxury grand tourer, thanks to Active Lane Assist, Adaptive Cruise Control, Night Vision, and a Head-Up Display. FLYING SPUR BENTLEY In the Bentley Flying Spur, Bentley has brought together effortless performance, sculpted design, and masterful technology to create a car as graceful as it is dynamic. Whether you prefer to be the driver or the driven, consider it the definitive luxury sedan. Our Bentley Flying Spur is available with a choice of three engine configurations: Bentley’s smooth, powerful 6.0 litre W12, the agile 4.0 litre V8 or the progressive new 2.9 litre V6, teamed with a 100 kW electric motor in the new Flying Spur Hybrid*. The Flying Spur Mulliner, meanwhile, represents the pinnacle of Bentley luxury. To learn more, contact us. Unfortunately, the Flying Spur Hybrid is currently not available for order. MULSANNE, BENTLEY Wealthy people like to boast about their prosperity almost as much as they like to be chauffeured, and the Bentley Mulsanne helps them accomplish both. The hand-crafted sedan is the patriarch of the Bentley family, with an imposing outward impression and intimate cabin experience. The Mulsanne is surprisingly agile for its size, giving it the performance to ensure that its passengers arrive on time and in style. Inside, beauty is realized through the sedan's rich ornamentation, opulent features, and expansive roominess. Although the 2020 Mulsanne is a shining example of excess and status, that's precisely what Bentley customers crave. S1 BENTLEY — 1956 The Bentley S1 1956 represented significant changes for Bentley with an all-new independent front suspension X-braced chassis, four-wheel hydraulic brakes, and a wider track. Most important, though, was a modern coachwork design that de-emphasized the fenders. Custom coachbuilders like Harold Radford, James Young, Freestone & Webb, and Hooper enthusiastically endorsed the new Bentley design concept and continued to endow both Bentleys with distinctive, individual, and elegant designs. Notably among them is this 1956 Bentley S1 sedan by H.J. Mulliner. Even more refined than the standard steel saloon bodies, it continued the tradition of bespoke British coachwork while incorporating features like the rear-hinged doors that facilitated graceful entry and exit, especially with the assistance of a chauffeur or footman. This 1956 Bentley S1 sedan by H.J. Mulliner embodies the quality and refinement that Bentley automobiles had come to reflect. A righthand drive car, it is finished in a subtle grey with matching grey leather upholstery and carpets. The interior is fitted with a radio and writing tables (no Grey Poupon in a Bentley). The paint, chrome, and interior are very attractive and the Bentley runs and drives as a Bentley should: well. Bespoke bodied Bentley S1s are not only rare but also exhibit fine touches and details in their appointments and details that complement H.J. Mulliner's refined coachwork design and execution. This is quality motoring at its Fifties best, and even more luxurious, exclusive and refined today than it was six decades ago. For more information on finding any of our Bentleys for hire or rent, contact us today. We're here to help."

1,5 Great Ways That Car Wrapping Can Promote Your Business,autos-trucks," If you own a business, then you know the importance of standing out from the competition. Car wrapping is a simple yet powerful way to promote your business all year round — and more companies than ever before are choosing to use it. Car wrapping involves a professional team adding a striking, bespoke design to your vehicle that will promote your chosen message, logo, or business. The effect is sleek, cohesive, and very memorable — whether in personal or professional settings. Car wrapping is acknowledged as an innovative and effective way of promoting businesses. Below, we take a look at some of the key ways that it achieves this, and how they could apply to you and your business. A huge advantage of car wrapping is that it is a constant, ‘evergreen’ form of advertising. It does not require anyone to be on-site or in a particular location to see it, such as on the premises of your business. The advertising is always there on your company vehicle, regardless of whether you change your location, premises, or website, for example. For as long as you have a company car, your business can enjoy constant promotion! Bespoke vehicle wraps are incredibly striking and eye-catching for whoever passes them. The advantage is that they do not need to be in one static place such as on a billboard or sign that only certain people may pass. As advertisements, they are completely portable! This allows you to make use of every journey and travel opportunity — even your daily commute — to advertise your business or sponsor. Your bespoke car wrap could include a logo, contact details, simply a stunning design with your business name, and more. Car wrapping is especially effective if you are regularly attending events, conferences, or industry roadshows too. You are advertising to like-minded people and industry insiders without even having to open your mouth. Your stunning car wrap speaks for you and your business! Because car wrapping and vehicle wrapping is so portable, this can also mean that you are constantly widening your demographic. It is not only one type or age range of person that sees your advertisement, for example. It is whoever is on the road or in the vicinity, especially at busy times. This can mean that your business is reaching those who may not otherwise have come across it. This can be a great way to ‘fill in the gap’ between those potential clients who may, for example, search for a business online and those who may not even know it exists. While it is likely that other forms of advertising for your business may be very targeted and specific, a bespoke professional car wrap can be a powerful addition to your advertising that is constant, versatile, and affordable by comparison. Car and vehicle wrapping does not only have to be a way for you to advertise your own business. You may also choose to advertise sponsors, or other businesses you collaborate with. As an advertising opportunity, or for sponsors specifically, this can serve as additional income for you and your business. You may choose for your car wrap design to combine both your business logo and the logo of a sponsor, for example, or even run monthly advertisements or sponsorships for paying clients. This can be especially successful for upcoming events or promotions. Car wrapping is a great way to create visual cohesion in your team and company. If you have multiple vehicles, a service that sends out drivers or personnel, or simply want to foster a strong company culture visually, then car wrapping can be a great way to achieve this. Car wrapping helps to ensure that your vehicles look official, distinctive, and instantly recognisable. It helps personnel to feel a part of the team, and has the additional benefits mentioned above of advertising on the go! If company cars are used regularly or are visible to clients and customers, a variety of vehicles and designs can quickly create a sense of clutter and disorganisation. Car wrapping helps the company to embody an image that is sleek, cohesive, and ‘official’."
2,6 Simple Ways To Prepare Your Car For The ‘Back To School Season’,autos-trucks," Whether it’s back to work or back to school, September marks the end of Summer and the start of a busy new season. With so much to organise and remember, it can be easy to become overwhelmed and overlook some of the things that could make your life simpler — such as taking care of your car. But a well-maintained, reliable car is a great way to help ensure that journey times, commutes, and busy daily life all go as smoothly as they can. Browse the six simple but highly effective tips below, and see how much easier you could make your Autumn! Spring cleaning may be the most famous, but cleaning at the start of any new season is a positive habit. Before the rush of the school and work runs, it is a great time to declutter and sanitise your car. Remove any rubbish that has built up, wipe down surfaces, and make especially sure to clean or tidy areas that may impede visibility while driving. This includes ornaments or objects that obscure the back or front windscreens. A tidy, clutter-free car will not only be safer and more hygienic, but it may help you to feel more refreshed and in control too. Carrying various essential kits in your car can be a great way to ensure peace of mind without taking up too much space. The best kits include first aid, repairs, and breakdown items such as a spare tyre, tools, or even just important roadside service contact details. You can also pack things that are specific to you or your family — such as additional medication or inhalers for example, or snacks, a spare mobile phone, and more. There is no need to overload your car, or feel like you have to plan for every eventuality. But a few important items can make all the difference! A change of season is a great time to book in at your local garage for a comprehensive check-up. Perhaps there is something that has been niggling in your car, or you just want to check that it is running optimally. Now is a great time to fix minor repair issues before they have the chance to worsen. Your car will be safer, more comfortable to drive, and likely to last longer too! Your local garage can also be a great place to stock up on some of the seasonal essentials — especially anti-freeze, car covers, and other handy items that will help to make the cold weather easier. As the weather changes — and especially when more wind and rain arrives — journey times can take a little longer than we expect. Rather than rushing, risking an accident, or arriving flustered, simply prepare to allow a little extra time in your journey. You can also save time by ensuring that your car is prepped in advance for longer journeys, such as by inflating tyres, topping up with fuel, or charging an electric car to its full mileage range. Weather-appropriate tyres are a great idea to improve the safety and manageability of your car, as may be suggested by your garage. You may also feel confident enough to do it yourself, but otherwise seek the advice of a professional. Using Summer and Winter tyres can be especially important because they function best at different temperatures, and have different tread depths that suit the weather they were made for. Be sure that your tyres can cope with your local climate, whether that is mild and wet, cold and icy, or anything in between. Once your car is clean, safe, and roadworthy, now is the time to emphasise comfort. Why not add some form of treat or luxury to refresh your car for the new season? A new scent, a favourite soundtrack, or even more comfortable seating can make your car a pleasure to drive. Pick a change to suit your needs and budget, and you will feel like you’re driving a whole new vehicle! Small investments and maintenance from season to season are safer and more cost-effective than arranging major overhauls when a problem develops and you really need them. With the tips above, you can help ensure that your car is a pleasure to drive in the ‘back to school season’ and beyond!"
3,History of Chrome Plating,autos-trucks," What do you picture when you hear the word “chrome”? For most people, chrome is a very positive word. It stirs up images of sleek, shiny, reflective metal that always looks new. Manufacturers may think of chrome as a lifesaver for making their products stronger and more durable. Most chrome products aren’t actually made of chrome all the way through — they are electroplated with a layer of chrome. This layer can transform a product, both aesthetically and functionally. It’s no wonder chrome plating is a popular process. Let’s take some time to look back and learn more about who invented chrome plating and how the plating process has evolved over time. The Origins of Chrome Plating Before we learn when chrome plating was invented, we have to go all the way back to the early 19th century, when electroplating was first discovered. An Italian chemist named Luigi Brugnatelli discovered that submerging metallic objects into a solution of dissolved gold and applying a charge with a Voltaic pile caused the gold to cover the surface of the objects. A Voltaic pile was the first electrical battery that was able to provide uninterrupted electricity to a circuit. Brugnatelli shared his findings in 1805 in a Belgian scientific journal, but the scientific community did not embrace this discovery. One concern, held by Napoleon Bonaparte, was that lower classes would be able to use the process to have gold-plated belongings. Electroplating did not begin to be widely used until it was rediscovered a few decades later. It quickly became a popular way of creating jewelry, relics and more that appeared extremely valuable but were affordable to broader populations. In addition to gold, other types of metal plating, like nickel plating, became popular. While the idea of electroplating in general was developed in the early 19th century, it wasn’t until the early 20th century that chromium plating began.  One of the pioneers of chromium plating was George J. Sargent, who earned his doctorate degree in 1912 by studying chromium deposition. His studies led to Colin Fink and Charles Eldridge developing a commercial process for chromium plating in the following decade. By the mid-1920s, there were two companies advertising their chromium plating services: The Chemical Treatment Company in New York and the Chromium Products Corporation in New Jersey. These two companies quickly merged, forming the Chromium Corporation of America. Following some patent interferences, the Chromium Corporation of America merged with a new company, General Chromium Corporation, and formed United Chromium, Incorporated in 1927. It’s clear to see these early companies had high hopes for the success of chromium plating, and they were right. Chromium plating’s popularity took off rapidly. When something was chrome, consumers knew it would have a shiny, sleek appearance and would be more durable with greater corrosion resistance. How Chrome Plating Has Changed Over the Years It’s no wonder manufacturers and consumers embraced chromium plating — or, as it came to be known, simply — chrome. Chrome could be applied to nearly anything to improve its appearance and durability. Cars, bicycles and motorcycles, among other products, started rolling onto the market with sleek chrome parts. During World War II, the use of metals like chrome was partly put on hold, but after the war, it resumed in full force. In fact, the French government created a Center of Information on Hard Chromium just after the war, which gave the world a comprehensive textbook on the topic in 1952. Chrome was a common design feature of many objects in the 1950s. Picture a mid-century diner, for instance. Bar stools, trim on the bar and tables and even exterior features on the building were often chrome. Throughout the 20th century, up to today, chrome has continued to be a common finishing feature for everything from automobiles to doorknobs to sink faucets. You may not see it in all the places you would have in the 1950s, but the sleek appearance of chrome isn’t likely to ever go out of style. When chrome is used purely for aesthetics, it is known as decorative chrome plating. Decorative chrome plating is done differently than hard chrome plating, which is also sometimes called engineering or functional chrome plating. When chrome is applied for aesthetic purposes, it goes on in a much thinner layer than when it is meant primarily for practical purposes. Hard chrome plating is often applied to components and tools that need to hold up to a lot of wear, like hydraulic cylinders, for example. The way chrome plating is done has evolved since it was first developed in the ’20s. Originally, hard chromium plating was done by painstakingly calculating the surface area of an object to be plated and supplying the appropriate level of current to achieve the required current density at a known speed. Marvin J. Udy challenged this process by claiming that all chromium plating could be done with the same voltage level. Along with Phil Hale, Udy set out to prove his hypothesis by attempting to plate various parts all at the same time with the same current to all of them. He found that “if you have a definite known electrode spacing and apply a constant voltage, the current density will be constant.” A successor named Clarence H. Peger gave the system its name, the Reversible Rack 2 Bus Bar System, and helped to popularize it. Around the same time, T. H. Webersinn was experimenting with the trivalent process of chrome plating, which he intended to be an improvement over ordinary hexavalent baths. The process was, in fact, easier and more cost-effective. However, it resulted in a darker, less appealing surface appearance. Trivalent chromium more closely resembled stainless steel. Other issues were that the chromium didn’t adhere well in thicker layers and was porous, causing a lack of durability. Over time, the “recipe” used for trivalent chromium plating was refined. Today, companies use additives to achieve the right color. Depending on the chrome plating applications, both trivalent and hexavalent solutions are used today. Hexavalent solutions are still preferred for most heavy-duty applications."
4,History of Bumper Stickers,autos-trucks," Some people plaster them across the entire rear of their car, while others prefer to have them nowhere near their vehicle. No matter what your opinion on bumper stickers may be, no one can deny the time-tested success of what initially began as a crudely attached advertisement. From vouching for preferred businesses to promoting your particular political candidate or even just expressing yourself on the road, these stickers have enjoyed decades of helping drivers to spread their message to anyone and everyone behind them in traffic. In the accompanying infographic, we'll take a drive down memory lane to examine the evolution and popularization of the bumper sticker we know all too well today. Honk if you hate noise pollution! Introduction of The Sticker You may be forgiven for thinking that stickers have been around for thousands of years, that in biblical times the Romans might have been sticking little labels on their swords and shields... ""Augustus VIIs Non Tangre (do not touch)"" but in fact they're not quite that old. The humble sticker actually started out as a type of label, made from various materials such as paper, plastic and vinyl to name a few. The sticky side is a pressure sensitive adhesive varying in strength to enable it to stick to various types of surfaces. But you already knew that didn't you? Today, stickers come in many different shapes, sizes, colours and designs. They can be used for all sorts, such as decorations, instructions, labels, customising items or to simply brand up your laptop or phone. Stickers are a worldwide phenomenon and you'll find them being used in near enough every country on the planet, and even out of this world, making it one of the most universally used and diverse products of all time. Creation of The Sticker Although many people claim the creation of the sticker dates back to the 1700's, the stickers they are referring to are in fact stamps, which depending on your definition of a sticker affects the outcome. For this instance we're putting stamps and stickers as two completely separate products. The first modern day sticker as we know today was created in 1935 by Stan Avery, also known by his catchy nickname 'Stan The Sticker Man'. Stan created a die-cut labeling machine using a washing machine motor, parts from a sewing machine and a saber saw. This is credited as the first machine to make self-adhesive labels which birthed the sticker, known originally as Avery Labels. To this day the company Avery set up still makes pressure sensitive, self-adhesive labels or stickers if you will. With the launch of his Avery Labels (Stickers) becoming increasingly popular across America, the company grew internationally, allowing the company to grow in size, giving Avery's company funds to perfect the finished product. Avery later developed a quick release coating for the back of the labels allowing his product to be easily peeled off without damaging the surface it was stuck on. In addition to this, the company also developed a more efficient production process allowing the entire sticker to be printed on one production line as opposed to a multi stage process which was in place before. Not only did this save on time, space and money, it enabled the company to keep up with the increasing demand of his revolutionary and unique product, the sticker. Rise of The Sticker With the rise in popularity of companies using the sticker for their products and advertising throughout the 1940's and 50's it also started to gain popularity for the everyday man to use. Forest Gill, a silk screen printer is credited with creating the first 'bumper sticker' for the back of your vehicle. Gill combined self-adhesive paper and day-glo ink to create the first ever bumper sticker. At first he faced many issues with the product, having found they faded very quickly due to the residue on the cars surface. Gill didn't give up there. With the help from a nationwide advertising company they helped him pioneer the first vinyl stickers with adhesive backs that would stick to vehicle bumpers without fading. With the idea of putting stickers on the bumper of your vehicle was initially interpreted as a gimmick, it quickly grew in popularity and within a couple years even politicians were using them to help promote themselves in the run up to general elections by displaying voting details on the back of their cars, encouraging voters to do the same in the help that spreading the word would help encourage people to vote for them. This early use of gaining widespread attention through stickers quickly caught the eye of large corporate companies who jumped on the bandwagon, realising the stickers potential to spread the word of their brand or message the sticker revolution was in full swing. Throughout the 60's and 70's stickers were now a mainstream product used for labels, decorations and directions, just some of the many uses stickers are still used for today. With companies looking at the product's potential and seeing how quickly bumper stickers took off, hundreds of companies worldwide started to pioneer their own version of what a sticker could be used for, these included car decals, instrument decals and the most successful - collection stickers. The rise of sticker collecting came to be a multi million dollar industry in itself. Many popular sports stars, TV shows and blockbuster movies all released their own versions of sticker collection with an emphasis on collecting them all, whether that's collecting an entire sports team (with the best players usually the rarest) or collecting all the characters from a TV show. This concept was incredibly popular with the youth of the 70s,80s,90s and still holds up today, with Panini Group the largest sticker collection company still producing stickers to this day and have an annual revenue of over $800 million. Current Life of The Sticker Stickers are still used today on a global scale, available in more styles, shapes, sizes and designs than ever before. From fluffy stickers to mirror stickers to 3D stickers, the multi billion dollar industry has created some of the most varied, diverse and unique products ever made. Thanks to the creation of digital print you can now buy a sticker in pretty much any design or form you could ever think of, it's creative possibilities are truly endless. Stickers are used more than ever right now, with people finding more and more uses for them. From its humble beginnings as just a purpose fit label for products it grew into a multi functional product with it still being used for labels and bumper stickers today. In addition to this sticker collecting is still absolutely massive worldwide and the current craze of decorating technology with stickers to make them stand out and be recognisable is the latest phenomenon to be adapted in the world of stickers. Future of The Sticker As for the future of the sticker, we firmly believe it's innovation isn't over yet and the next big sticker craze will be just around the corner. One theory we can see taking off in a big way is the partnership between stickers and technology, whether that's a sticker that can be linked to an app on your phone or ones that play videos or GIFS. With digital stickers already being created and a lot of them featuring augmented reality, we definitely know it's just gonna get bigger and better! We challenge anyone to name a more diverse product that has been anywhere near as successful and globally loved as the sticker. Stan The Sticker Man would be proud. In my research I found the Egyptians used stickers for their marketplace. They say artifacts found during archaeological digs show them to be some sort of paper, first written on then being stuck to a surface by an adhesive. Amazing the artifacts have lasted so long. It reminds me of my favorite place to get bumper stickers... ProSportstickers! The stickers there probably would last that long too! I found their website looking for a gift for my Dad. The items were so great I had to order some for myself. They have a crazy selection so it was pretty easy to find something I loved. I'd highly recommend checking them out!"
5,Can You Sue After An Uber Accident?,autos-trucks," Uber and other rideshare apps continue to increase in popularity. In relation to this increase, naturally, there will also be a rise in car accidents. If you’ve been in an Uber accident, you may be wondering what legal rights you have with looming questions like: Who is going to cover my medical expenses? Should I sue the driver? Is Uber responsible for my accident? We’re here to help clarify these concerns. Here’s an overview of what you need to know if you were involved in an Uber accident. Who to Seek Damages From Uber and other rideshare companies, like Lyft, have regulations in place that may protect them from liability if an accident occurs while a driver is driving for them. All of this is contained in the terms of service that you agree to when you download the app and set up an account. The short answer is that you can sue a rideshare company, but there are limitations. You will need to determine fault and who was negligent, resulting in your accident. Sometimes, it’s not the rideshare driver who caused the accident, but another motorist on the road. In that case, you would seek damages from that other motorist. Depending on the circumstances, sometimes the rideshare company is partially or solely responsible. Insurance companies will typically determine who is at fault and award settlements accordingly. However, even if the insurance company determines that a driver or the rideshare company is at fault, it doesn’t mean they will offer a settlement that is fair. In this case, you may decide to file a lawsuit in order to get the compensation that you deserve based on your injuries, medical expenses, and lost wages. Determining Fault in an Uber Accident Uber Accident Again, liability could fall on either the rideshare driver, another driver, or the rideshare company. If the driver is at fault, there are different levels of liability depending on the actions of the driver. Things to consider include: If the driver was or was not logged into the app at the time of the accident The driver was transporting passengers while off the clock If the driver was logged in with the passenger in the care and waiting for the passenger to plug in the drop-off address If they were on the way to pick up a passenger after accepting a ride Whether they had a passenger in their vehicle Other drivers can also be at fault if their behavior caused the accident, such as driving under the influence, reckless driving, distracted driving, or failure to obey traffic signals. It’s up to law enforcement and the insurance company to determine fault. When it comes to holding the rideshare company responsible for your accident, there are limitations. For example, you would have to show that Uber was negligent in performing proper background checks when they hired their driver. Otherwise, your options are to sue Uber’s insurance company or the driver’s insurance company. Compensation If you are injured in an Uber accident, you are entitled to the same type of compensation as someone injured in any other car accident. The damages that you can be awarded typically include: Medical expenses, including future medical care and rehabilitation Lost wages Loss of future wages Property damage Punitive damages, such as pain and suffering or loss of quality of life An experienced personal injury lawyer will be able to help you estimate what your case is worth. Steps to Take After an Uber Accident Uber Accident If you are in an accident while riding in an Uber or other ridesharing vehicle, there are some steps that you should take to ensure that everyone is safe, receive medical attention, and that you properly document and report the accident. If anyone needs immediate medical care, call 911. Otherwise, you may decide to wait and go to the emergency room on your own. Be sure to keep any receipts for out-of-pocket expenses, medical records, and doctor’s instructions. You should report the crash to the police. Most states require this if there is any property damage and you will need a police report if you should decide to file a suit later on. You also need to report it to Uber or Lyft, depending on what company you are riding with. There is a way to report in the app or you can report online through their website. Don’t Settle With the Insurance Company Many insurance companies will try to get you to settle right away after the accident. They want you to settle for the lowest amount possible, so they will often make you a low-ball offer shortly after the accident. Don’t accept this and don’t speak to the insurance adjuster without getting advice from a lawyer first. An experienced Uber accident attorney will be able to help you determine what is a fair settlement amount, navigate the process for you, and speak to the insurance companies on your behalf. You can focus on healing from your injuries and let an attorney handle your case. The Benefits of Hiring an Uber Accident Attorney If you’ve been in an Uber accident or an accident with another rideshare company and have suffered injuries, don’t delay in speaking with an experienced attorney. Car accident injuries can be costly and could have long-lasting impacts. You need to make sure you are adequately compensated for your injuries when an Uber driver is at fault.

6,5 Great Ways To Modernise Your Driving,autos-trucks," We live in exciting times. But with rapid changes in technology, ways of working, safety, and transport, it can be easy to feel like we are falling behind or failing to keep up with the advancements. With driving, this can be especially true. We may feel like we have been driving the same old car forever, or struggle to understand some of the newest rules, regulations, and advances in technology. With our helpful guide below, you can explore five simple but effective ways to modernise your driving. TIP 1: Be Safety Conscious Modern driving is highly safety conscious. People are more aware than ever of how their choices on the road impact other drivers, so a great way to modernise your driving is by emphasising safety in a variety of ways. Ensure that your car is safe and roadworthy with regular visits to the garage. Brush up on your skills and knowledge through reading or even attending courses, and consider investing in the relevant safety technology. This might include warning lights and alarms, or high visibility features such as fog lights. The future of driving is in ensuring that drivers, passengers, and other road users are as safe as possible. TIP 2: Go ‘Green’ The environment is a hot topic and a more pressing issue than ever, particularly following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report of August 2021which stated that ‘human activity is changing the climate in unprecedented and sometimes irreversible ways.’ Transport is a significant contributor to pollution and environmental harm — especially options that use fossil fuels or produce harmful emissions. More drivers than ever are keen to do their part and reduce any negative impact they may have on the environment. Whether you can make a big change or only a small contribution, every little helps! Perhaps you might consider switching to an electric car, for example. Even drivers with long commutes are now opting for the electric cars that offer a longer range. Alternatively, you might use your car only when necessary and choose other options when possible. Whatever choice you make, do it with the environment in mind and you will be making a positive impact on the world. TIP 3: Be Energy Efficient Even if it is not possible for you to have an electric or hybrid vehicle, you can still modernise your driving by being energy efficient. Even petrol and diesel users can drive in a way that wastes the least amount of fuel possible. Choose the appropriate gear, for example, reduce wind resistance, and anticipate the road ahead so that you don’t make sudden movements that require a lot of fuel. Also, keep your car in good working order as this can contribute to better energy efficiency overall. You will save money, increase the longevity of your car, and drive in a thoroughly modern way too! TIP 4: Be Prepared If recent years have taught us anything, it is to expect the unexpected! Therefore, being a modern driver means being as prepared as possible for potential disruptions. One way to do this is to carry a kit for all eventualities. This might mean a breakdown or repairs kit — complete with tools and equipment, a spare tyre, and a mobile phone charger, for example. It could also be as simple as a kit for hot weather (with water and hand fans) or even hygiene (with masks, hand sanitiser and wipes). Using your car safely during the outbreak of COVID-19, for example, required drivers to utilize more sanitary practices than before. So be as prepared as you can, pack effective kits, and do your research by checking routes in advance. TIP 5: Use Technology Technology plays a large role in modern driving, but it doesn’t have to be expensive or overwhelming. While some drivers choose to invest in all the latest kit, you can select technology that best suits your needs and budget. If you use SatNav regularly, for example, make sure that you have the best model you can afford and that it is always in good working order. If you have a particular safety concern, try to ensure that you have the right kit and technology that will help you cope with the particular circumstance — like for example, by taking safety lights with you during night drives in case your car develops a fault and comes to a halt in the middle of the road. Overall then, as the above tips illustrate, modern driving is mainly about prioritizing your comfort, safety, and efficiency while driving."

8,Car Brakes: When Is It Time To Change Them?,autos-trucks," Those who have a daily commute through heavy traffic know that a vehicle’s braking system can bring your thousands of pounds of metal to a stop hundreds of times before you have gotten to work. Your vehicles brakes will eventually wear out, but they do slowly, meaning you may not notice they need attention until it is too late. Neglecting your cars brake braking system can lead to more expensive repair costs or worse, no brakes at all. Fortunately there are some signs to watch out for that can hep you keep up on your cars maintenance, helping to save you money and not rear ending the guy in front of you on the way to work. The most noticeable indicator your brake system needs attention is a high pitched squeal you when stop. Brake pad manufacturers include a wear indicator on the pad. This is to let you know when they are worn down to the point of replacement. The indicator touches the brake rotor and sounds almost like fingernails on a chalkboard. You will usually have about a month before you MUST replace your brakes, so it gives you a little time to put some funds back for repair. Sometimes this indicator however can rust or fall off, and many aftermarket or cheap pads won’t come with one at all. For those more observant there are other signs you need to replace your brake pads. If you notice it takes longer to stop than your used to in your car, or your brake pedal travels father than it did a few months ago… it may be a good idea to get them checked out. Regular brake pad checks are a good idea and don’t require much more than removing a wheel and knowing what to look for. Brake rotors are a little more complex, these can usually last through 2-3 sets of brake pads before needing replaced. If you notice a wobble in your steering wheel when you go to stop, then you most like have warped rotors. Many mechanics or shops may offer to turn them for you, however many newer vehicles are equipped with thinner, lighter rotors to help on fuel economy and overall costs. Therefore, Kraken Automotive usually recommends to replace them with a good quality replacement along with your brake pads. Although you can never go wrong with OEM replacement brake pads and rotors, a variety of aftermarket options are available for your specific driving needs. If you find yourself replacing them often, slotted or heat higher quality Z-Clad coated rotors may be a better choice. While they are more expensive initially, the slots or coated rotors will help disperse heat better than the OEM stock rotors will, this will also help avoid warping them as well. Another upgrade you can look into are ceramic brake pads/ These type of pads stop better and are one of the most common upgrades to a braking system. They perform better that OEM stock pads and product MUCH LESS brake dust and are usually quieter. Although you can always opt to wait until your car is grinding to a halt, it will cost you unnecessary replacement of rotors. calipers and even a possible tow bill. Not to mention loosing your stopping ability and causing an accident. Keeping up routine brake maintenance, paying attention to the signs of brake wear and choosing the right equipment for your vehicle will let you slow down like you should."

If you want, you can take some steps to keep the storage empty on the phone. Let's discuss in detail what steps to take. I hope you find it useful. Ways to keep storage empty: When you take a picture with a camera, maybe you click and take a lot of pictures. So I don't remember to delete all the duplicate images a lot of the time. So you should delete them from the phone. Uninstall all duplicate files and apps on the phone. This will make it possible to keep most of your storage empty. We usually use Messenger, Face-book, Whats-App on the phone. Try to clear the mobile data of these apps regularly. All you have to do is: Hold the app for a while, or try uninstalling it directly. You will see   that there is an option called “App Info” which is situated next to “Uninstall” option. Click there from there go to Storage option. Then click on the Clear Data option. This will clear all the data in your app. And for this I will suggest you to Clear Cache instead of Clear Data. It is   below the Clear Data option. However, when the data is cleaned, the storage is extensive. Explain one thing, listen carefully. When you clean the data of Messenger or Whatsapp, it will log you out. You just have to log in later. But if you don't clear any data for a few months, it will freeze. Now I say extra tips: Do not use any storage booster. It slows down your phone a lot. Besides, due to special features, the phone sits with different safety permissions. It is more harmful. If you follow what I have said, your phone storage will be empty. If you like it, follow my blog. Go to the Follow Me option next to your email. There is no spamming here. So, we have finished our discuss about how to free up space on android internal memory. I have a request to you.   Please visit my website."
10,5 Things To Watch Out For On The Roads This Summer,autos-trucks," Summer is a carefree time for fun and holidays. But busy roads and extra travel also mean we must remain vigilant while on the roads. With turbulent times of change and upheaval in recent years, it is especially important to pay attention to any changes that might have occurred — to your route, your car, and your own capacity to drive. If your car is well maintained and you are ready to get out and about in the driver’s seat again, we have the tips for you! Here are five of the key things to watch out for on the roads this Summer. With alertness, awareness and flexibility, your Summer will be safe as well as fun! Times of national lockdown and working from home saw a sharp increase in the number of delivery drivers on the road — for groceries, work supplies, essentials, and entertainment. However, even with recent changes and the easing of restrictions, the demand for online shopping remains at an all-time high. This has meant that you are likely to encounter a greater number of delivery drivers and professional drivers on the road — including because of the demand for transport that doesn’t involve mixing with the general public, due to social distancing. Consider leaving extra time for your journey if you are expecting to use busy routes that may be congested with both professional and non-professional drivers. There has been significant investment in transport technology in recent years and this is starting to be visibly reflected in the cars on the road. The future of driving has already arrived! You are more likely than ever to encounter unusual vehicles — ranging from the more common electric and hybrid vehicles, right through to self-driving cars and those with new safety technologies or renewable fuels. The longest mileage range for electric cars is growing all the time, for example. The aim of new technology in transport almost always has an emphasis on safety, so these new vehicles may help to make the roads safer in the Summer and over time. But as the technology is still developing, it is especially important to remain careful and vigilant! It is expected that the coming Summer months will see some of the greatest congestion on the roads yet. This is because of the increase in holidays and ‘staycations’ following national lockdowns, as well as many workforces returning to their offices. Take your time and remain patient. Expect and plan for delays, and never take unnecessary risks on crowded roads — such as leaving your vehicle or rushing an attempt to complete a difficult manoeuvre in a small space. There are several reasons for the higher number of cyclists on the road at present. Better weather often means more people opt for transport options like cycling, while many are also trying to return to a more active lifestyle after working from home or being unable to get out of the house during the COVID-19 lockdowns. The environment has also become a major concern for both businesses and individuals alike — with many opting for more environmentally-friendly travel options, such as cycling. Cyclists can be especially vulnerable road users because they are less visible than drivers and may not have designated cycle tracks that they can use. They are also far more exposed than drivers in the event of an accident or injury. Remain vigilant for cyclists and motorcyclists this Summer, and you will help to keep both yourself and others safe! This Summer, expect to encounter some form of social distancing on the roads and in car parks. This might include longer queues, greater distances needing to be left between parked vehicles, or only being able to collect ‘drive-thru’ and not enter a building. Be aware of these possibilities and consider carrying any relevant hygiene supplies in your car — such as hand sanitiser, masks, and wipes — to avoid inconvenience. BONUS TIP: Be Aware Of Changes To The Road If some time has passed between your last drive or use of a particular route, be aware that changes may have happened. These could include maintenance and diversions, and even road closures. As with all the tips above, try to be patient and leave yourself time — especially for important journeys such as to the airport, while maintaining increased awareness and ‘expecting the unexpected’ will help to ensure that your Summer is safe, fun-filled, and enjoyable!"
11,What’s Coming Next In Car Safety? 5 Areas To Keep An Eye On,autos-trucks," Recent times have marked a global shift in many practices, industries, and ways of operating. This is perhaps especially true of transport — which has seen major changes due to national lockdowns, a reduction in commuters, working from home, and other restrictions. But several new areas — especially regarding safety — are now emerging. Read on to discover five of the key ways that driving and transport may change, becoming safer and adapting to the ‘new normal’. Number 1: ‘Safe Exit Assist’ Technology The first impending change in car safety is the release of ‘safe exit assist’ technology. This can include cameras, sensors, and other details that are designed to increase the safety of leaving the vehicle. Opening a car door can be hazardous for the person leaving the vehicle — such as if a motorbike rider, other drivers, or a cyclist passes and injures either themselves or others. This is an especially common problem when parking is close to a cycle track, or in particularly congested urban areas. The technology is designed to make exiting a car safer not only for those leaving the car, but also for anyone in the vicinity. More manufacturers are exploring incorporating this technology into new vehicles in the hope of reducing a serious current safety issue. Number 2: Increased Cleanliness & Hygiene Many drivers, whether they use their car for work or personal use, are investing in ways to keep their car clean and hygienic in light of the global pandemic. This may mean carrying masks, sanitary gloves, cleaning solutions, antibacterial wipes, and more — but it could also develop into more permanent solutions such as creating an inbuilt area of the car designed for carrying such materials. There may also be more sophisticated ventilation and onboard sanitation systems developed, as well as more widely practised cleaning routines. In many cases, these are already a requirement of employers who use professional drivers. Increased cleanliness and hygiene is expected to become more widely implemented, and may even start to impact on the manufacture of the car itself. Number 3: A Growth In Professional Drivers An under-discussed safety issue has been the rise of professional drivers on the road, while other regular drivers - such as commuters or parents doing the school run - may have been confined to the home. While professional drivers may even be safer than regular drivers, as they may have undergone specific training, their increase may increase congestion on the roads. Many people have become aware of the reasons to use couriers or special delivery services — whether for personal or professional use — and this has changed both the number and type of drivers on the road. This is expected to impact road safety going forward, and it remains to be seen whether roads will become less crowded during the return to 'normal', or more congested due to the continued use of professional drivers and delivery vehicles. Number 4: Augmented Reality While not yet widely implemented, it is expected that new technologies such as augmented reality and thermal imaging will soon become significant in-car safety tools. Augmented reality may be used to project images into a driver’s field of vision, highlighting real-life hazards such as pedestrians waiting to cross, dangerous vehicles, or a sudden upcoming bend in the road. Thermal imaging is also being used in the manufacture of new cars to reduce the dangers of driving in low visibility. While these newer technologies may still be in the testing phase — or only available in newer, high-end cars — it is expected that they will gradually become cheaper and more widely available over time. Number 5: Driver Monitoring The use of driver monitoring systems and software is expected to have a huge impact on the future of car safety. Driver monitoring systems may include cameras, software, or augmentations to cruise control systems, braking and speed, for example. The new technologies will be able to tell if a driver has become unresponsive, such as during a medical emergency. They will also be able to sense whether the driver is not paying attention to the road, or is perhaps intoxicated. The more sophisticated systems will then also be able to initiate a safety response, such as slowing down, steering to a safe stopping place, or calling for help. Whether through technology and new manufacturing practices, driver choices, or widespread changes in general driving and transport, there is expected to be a global effort to make our roads and cars safer than ever before in the coming years!"
12,Auto insurance - Things Every Canadian Should Know!,autos-trucks," Auto insurance - Things Every Canadian Should Know! While the internet does it simply to analyze policies and rates, it’s still easy to get distracted by all the unknown terms insurance agents use. Auto insurance is one of those troublesome financial needs in life. Although many of us don’t like shopping or spending on it, you’ll be very happy if you’re ever caught in a collision. How Does It Work? Car insurance works similar to home insurance, except instead of giving coverage for your residence, your policy gives coverage for your vehicle. The premiums you’ll spend on an insurance organization are based on the insurance company’s assessed yearly cost of embracing your vehicle. Your auto insurance premiums are determined based on many factors. One of them is the amount the insurance company considers it will have to spend out on titles in the following year. You’ll give your car insurance firm premiums on a monthly or yearly basis in return for getting on your car's peril. The insurance firm then combines all the premiums it receives from the motorists it shields together into one big pool. The insurance organization uses the pool of premiums to meet the needs of the motorists who make claims in the year. Who Needs Auto Insurance? If you’re a driver in Canada, you’re obliged to have car insurance, and skipping out on it can drive to a higher fine. Ontarians found without car insurance, are expected at a fine within $5,000 to $50,000 for an offence, and could also have their driver’s permit discontinued and car seized. Types of Auto Insurance in Canada? The type of auto insurance needed in Canada alters provincially, and it’s essential to understand yourself with your province or area's demands to assure you comply. Third-Party Liability Coverage The fundamental type of auto insurance is third-party liability coverage. Third-party liability coverage shields you upon paying for the loss you cause to anyone’s assets. It also shields you if anyone else is hit or hurt as an outcome of a car accident done by you. The least coverage differs by province, but at the minimum amount, it should incorporate the medical expenses of anyone hurt in an accident. Third-party liability coverage is compulsory in Canada. Collision Coverage The second variety is collision coverage. In extension to shielding you from third-party liabilities, collision coverage further holds you if you drive into anything other than a vehicle. It’s fairly normal for this policy to also defend you if you’re committed in an accident with a motorist who isn’t insured. This more general level of coverage typically takes more than a liability. Comprehensive Coverage The third variety is comprehensive coverage. As its name suggests, comprehensively gives the most comprehensive range of protection. Not only does it normally cover medical and collision-related injuries, but it may also defend you in the case of theft and floods. But that comes at a cost, as comprehensive premiums are normally the highest among the three. Specified Perils and All Perils Two other optional types of auto insurance you might consider signing up for are specified perils and all perils. As its name implies, specified perils protect you against specific loss to your vehicles like theft or attempted theft, and weather-related damage, such as fire, lightning, windstorms and earthquakes. All perils combine the assurance you receive under collision and comprehensive coverage. It’s essential to weigh the amount of coverage you need with the premium you’ll pay to find the auto insurance coverage that’s right for you. A lot of us like to shop for auto insurance with the lowest premiums, but as the old saying goes, you get what you pay for. When shopping around, it’s important to also look at the amount of coverage you’ll receive to ensure it’s sufficient. The last thing you want is to end up paying a lot of money out of pocket if you ever need to file a claim. Is Auto Insurance Different from Province to Province? Although auto insurance is compulsory for drivers in all provinces across the country, key variations are depending on where you reside. For example, the rates you’ll pay for the level of coverage change considerably from province to province. In most provinces, your only option is to obtain auto insurance from private companies. That being said, some provinces allow private and public auto insurance coverage. Factors Influence the Cost of Auto Insurance Your insurance premium might make more sense if you know how it’s determined. Insurance companies rated auto premiums based on several factors including your vehicle’s make and model, your driving history, your age, and gender. Vehicle Make, Model and Production Year Your vehicle’s make, model and production year have a major bearing on premium costs. For example, sports cars are typically more expensive to insure compared to sedans. This boils down to two factors: sports cars not only tend to have a higher retail price, but they’re also more likely to be involved in a collision. Driving History Your driving history is another big factor. If you’re a very safe driver who’s never received as much as a speeding ticket, you could save thousands of dollars in auto insurance premiums compared to someone who has several speeding tickets and has been involved in collisions. Demerit Points Incurring demerit points for driving infractions, such as dooring a cyclist and speeding, can impact the auto insurance premiums you’ll pay as well. Demerit points won’t affect your auto insurance premiums immediately, but they will when the policy comes up for renewal, as long as your insurance company checks your driving record. Place of Residence A lot of motorists aren’t aware that where you live can have a big impact on their auto insurance premiums. Some neighborhoods have a history of filing more car insurance claims than others. If your area has a lot of break-ins and collisions, be prepared to pay for it. Although I’m not saying that auto insurance premiums should motivate you to move, it’s certainly something to be cognizant of. Age and Gender Two more factors that influence car insurance premiums are the policyholder’s age and gender. Insurance is one of the few industries where companies can legally discriminate based on age and gender in pricing. All things considered equal, you’ll generally pay less for auto insurance the older you are. Men generally pay higher auto insurance premiums than women, as men are known for exhibiting riskier driving behavior."
13,Tips When Buying Quality Used Cars on Sale,autos-trucks," There are many sources for finding on sale cars for your needs. The internet is the best option, since it offers the largest amount of car sales, and is also free. Online sources like Auto Trader can give you the best prices, while other websites specialize in selling used cars at cut rate prices. In addition to online prices, newspaper classifieds can be a great way to find the best deals on sale cars. Cars being offered for sale through newspapers can be from new, used, or both types. When trying to find on sale cars for your needs, make sure that you are clear on the type of car that you wish to purchase. It would be best to know what kind of car you want, and to eliminate the possibilities of buying a car in an inappropriate category. For instance, if you are looking to buy a car for daily use, it would be best to look for a vehicle with good fuel efficiency, and room for passengers. However, if you want to use your car for racing, then go for sports cars or sedans. You need to remember that fuel efficiency is not everything; reliability and safety should also be considered when you consider the best deals on cars. Before You Decide To Buy Used Cars Before you decide to buy used cars for sale, it would be best to conduct research on the vehicle. It is necessary to know all about the history of the car in order to determine its reliability and the likelihood of having mechanical problems with it. You can do this by contacting the car's previous owners. If you have some specific questions, try to ask the salesperson so that you can learn more about the car that you are going to buy. Most of the car dealers are willing to help you figure out the best deals on cars; however, you should be prepared to ask the dealer some questions as well. Ask about the car's fuel efficiency, transmission, handling, safety features and other important parts of the car. Once you have decided on the car that you are looking for, you should find out the history of the car, as well as who the owners are. The best deals on cars can be found when you are aware of its history. Many people may think that they are buying a reliable car because of the fact that it has a clean title and a flawless history. However, if you take a closer look at these cars, you will see that they are prone to mechanical problems, which may prevent them from fulfilling their purpose for you. Planning To Buy a Used Car If you are planning to buy a used car that requires a certain level of maintenance, you have to make sure that you get one from a reliable dealership. You can use the Internet to find such dealers. If possible, ask the dealer if you can take a test drive before making your purchase. This will allow you to determine the car's condition, performance and other essential information. You should not hesitate to bargain if the car doesn't meet your expectations; therefore, it is important to be assertive. In order to save money, you have to plan ahead. It is always best to go to used car lots on the weekends or when there is no local public transportation. This will allow you to test-drive cars without having to incur additional costs. Conclusion Once you have decided to buy a car, you should also check the car's history and background. You have to be able to tell what repairs it has undergone and how many times it has been repaired. Check for signs of theft and vandalism. It is also a good idea to ask the seller if the car has any outstanding loans or finance. It will be best if you are acquainted with the history of the car before you buy it on sale. Finally, it is essential to consider your budget. Before you make your purchase, set your budget and stick to it. You should not go out of your budget to buy the car that you want. Most car sellers offer great prices, but you have to keep your priorities in place in order to find the best one."
14,7 Important Safety Tips For Summer Driving,autos-trucks," Summer is a great time to travel and enjoy the outdoors. But while Winter is famous for its ice, fog and slippery roads, Summer is not without its hazards too. Hot weather can lead to dehydration, overheated engines, heavy congestion on the roads and more. That’s why we have compiled these six essential safety tips below to help you when driving. Here you will find some of the simplest yet most effective ways to stay safe — and cool — in your car this Summer season. Summer can be an especially busy time on the roads. It is not only more congested with holiday travellers and tourists, but it is also more likely for there to be motorcyclists and even pedestrians on the road. Many are also travelling with children or pets, so be especially vigilant. Allowing extra time in your journey helps to avoid the disappointment of arriving late, as well as allowing for unexpected circumstances and delays. It may also help to keep your engine cooler if you don’t have to travel at a high speed. Each season can require a different type of tyre so try to ensure that yours is appropriate for the most likely weather. Differences in Summer and Winter tyres can include the temperature at which they perform best, the depth of the tread, the stopping distance and more. A visit to a reputable garage at the start of each season is always a good idea. This allows you to check that everything is in good working order with your car so that you can take longer trips with confidence. This is especially important if your Summer holiday will involve a lot of driving or is a long-distance drive away. Checking tyres is a must, but it is also a good idea to ensure there are no problems with any essentials — such as windscreen wipers, the engine, the brakes and more. With long Summer days, as well as frequent delays on busy roads, having all the necessary devices fully charged before a journey is a must. This not only applies to mobile phones but can also apply to the vehicle itself! If you drive an electric vehicle, ensure that it is fully and adequately charged to avoid the disappointment of a breakdown. It may be more difficult to get assistance during busy times, as well as inconvenient if it delays your day out or holiday. Electric vehicles vary in their range — though the range for new models is increasing all the time — so be sure to check yours in advance. An emergency kit can include a first aid kit, torch, batteries, mobile phone chargers and a car repair kit — but it can also be made especially appropriate for Summer. This might include extra water, a hand-held fan, allergy medicines (as allergies can be especially active during Summer) and a spare mobile phone. While it may be unlikely you will ever need your kit, having one to hand can give great peace of mind. Staying cool and hydrated during hot weather is a must, but especially while driving. This helps to ensure that you stay healthy and alert while on the road. Use your air conditioning, regularly seek out shade, stay hydrated and try to keep the car cool before you even embark on the journey — such as by avoiding parking in direct sunlight. Fluids in your car can dry out especially quickly during the Summer months, and the engine is more vulnerable to overheating. Ensure that you are topped up with coolant, windscreen solution and all other essential fluids — especially before embarking on a long journey. Don’t hesitate to visit your garage if you are unsure of your fluid levels or how to replenish them. Many know that dogs die in hot cars — but it can tragically happen much quicker expected, and also in lower temperatures. Even a car in 20 degrees celsius heat outside can rapidly reach over 40 degrees celsius inside. Parking in the shade or leaving the windows ajar may simply not be enough. Hot cars are equally dangerous to pets, children, and the elderly — as well as many adults. If you have to leave your car, be on the safe side and take everyone with you. Even if you only intend to be gone for a few minutes, you may be delayed. If this isn’t possible, always leave pets in the safety of the home."
15,"Electric Motorcycles, is it time?",autos-trucks," Electric Motorcycles, is it time? To answer this question right off the bat - Yes, it is! Electric motorcycles are in current times capable of competing with ICE (internal combustion engine) motorcycles, in pretty much all aspects. With recent years advances in battery technology, and specifically battery production cost reductions, there is an ever growing flow of electric vehicle companies. There are several aspects from economic to performance all the way to technology being equipped on some motorcycles. In addition, since motorcycles are not normally being considered as major polluters, the move towards these models are actually driven by the riders and their savvy understanding of the advantages electric motorcycles hold. In the 4-wheel space, where governmental tax credits and statements towards all electric cars by 2030, there is an ever growing economic aspect and legislation aspects that have greater impact on this shift, whereas in the 2-wheel space, the practicality, performance and many other pros give electric motorcycles an edge on their gas powered rivals. So, what are the main advantages an electric motorcycle have? Let's see some of the major points. Superior Torque and Power Electric motors produce immediate power and torque, whether the motor sits on the wheel axis (hub motor) or power a chain/ belt (mid-mounted motors) - they both produce immediate power to the wheel. While gas-powered engines take more time to reach peak power and torque, and reaching high RPMs, electric motors reach peak power and torque from 0 RPM - immediately. There is already a MotoGP - MotoE, with electric motorcycles make by the great Italian Energica, which makes these special track models that race the MotoE showing the gas powered bikes what the future will look like. The power courve looks much different when put side by side, take a look; This allows a comparable performance to a gas bike with a smaller motor size electric motorcycle, so that smaller power levels of an electric motor will just accelerate faster. Comfortable and (pretty much) Maintenance free Electric motors are not as noisy, and before you get started - I love the sound of a gas motor - but have you heard a 200hp electric motorcycle motor? Those have a very distinct and unique sound of a power and speed. Besides the noise, the lack of complex moving parts make the bike more stable, less shaky, and an overall smoother ride. No clutch or gear shifting, even on models that have gears on their electric motor, makes the ride more focused - as you can really put your ride to the limit, get a free feeling of riding, and let the motor take care of speed from zero to top, with shifting zero times. That's a very different riding experience. Technology is here! Almost every electric motorcycle these days have at the very least a 'management app' with some cool features. But those are no game changing things, compare to AI ride assists, hepatic motorcycle parts signaling danger, or extreme riding conditions - many more of these safety related and riding experience related methods are already here. With recent year technology, we see AI assistance already coming to electric motorcycles, aid and danger warning motorcycle accessories are created - and cutting edge technology is produced every single day. The “human machine interface”  created by Arc Vehicle. Damon motors - 360° PREDICTIVE AWARENESS’ system Maintenance and convenience Home charging that makes your home garage your gas station - just plug in to the socket, and you are ready to ride next morning. And if range bothers you - there are definitely models you can take that have the same range of the gas powered similar model. And yes - it may take longer to charge - but a big bike like the Energica, with a 21kWh battery pack can charge in about 45 minutes to full charge, or 30 minutes for 80%. The maintenance and economic savings are very significant. Less motor parts equals less malfunctions, and electric motors are quite more reliable than combustion engines, they last longer, operate smoother, and break down less after longer time spans. Save your money, and get an electric motorcycle Electric motorcycles are still more expensive than gas powered motorcycles, for the most part. With some exceptions for Chinese made models, which are bringing a heated competition to Europe and the US, despite that local competitors are manufacturing great quality. One of the reasons for the price is that batteries have only come down in price in more recent years, and the breakthrough in price to make it much cheaper should gradually set in. After paying the initial purchase price, electric motorcycles will surely save you a lot of money. With every commute cost being cheaper than gas, you could spend a few dollars in electricity instead of tens of dollars in gas. You will have absolutely staggering low maintenance on anything related to parts or breakdowns too. Insurance is another area where you can save cash. Electric motorcycles often get classified as smaller class brackets, making the insurance cheaper. Are you not convinced? Do you ride sport bikes? a cruiser, or a dual-sport? even a scooter, an MX or a dirt bike? All of these models are already produced by many great companies - come check them out for yourself on our website."
16,The Ultimate Guide to Caring for and Upgrading Your Car,autos-trucks," You may consider your car an investment. If you're looking to sell it in the future, or even just keep it running for a long time with little to no problems, then investing in upgrades and regular care is key.

Professional car detailing is the art and the craft of cleaning and restoring a vehicle to like-new condition. Car detailing services are much more precise and labor-intensive than getting a car wash. A car wash is normally an automated system that a car passes through to clean the exterior. Professional auto detailing is always done by hand, and includes exterior and interior car detailing services. What Car Detailing Services are Included in Professional Car Detailing? While anyone can detail a car by cleaning the inside and outside as best as they can, a professional detail is done by an experienced detailer with the right techniques and high quality products. Often, professional detailers set up packages and pricing in advance for the services that they want to offer. Many use a business management app like Mobile Tech RX to keep track of their packages, pricing, estimates, and invoices. You can try the app completely free – it will help you set up your customer database (CRM), your price list, branded invoices, your bookkeeping (through QuickBooks), payment processing, marketing, and more. Here are common car detailing services that professional detailers typically include in their packages: Exterior Car Cleaning •	Exterior wash and dry – This washing and drying process is done by hand. The detailer will spray and wipe down the body of the car with specialized products. This includes hand washing the rims, door handles, and glass. •	Paint Claying – A clay bar is used to remove any contaminants, overspray, or residue left after the car has been washed. Claying results in a cleaner and smoother surface, and helps increase the effectiveness of polish and wax. •	Polishing – Polishing buffs an abrasive compound onto the car’s paint to remove small layers of clear coat. This makes small scratches and swirls in the paint disappear. •	Sealing or Waxing – To give the car a glossy shine and to add a protective layer to the car’s paint, a sealant is applied. In some cases, wax can be used.

18,5 Ways To Find The Faults With Your Car,autos-trucks," Is your car behaving badly? Acting strangely? Then it is time to get to the bottom of it with this quick checklist of five alternative ways to find the fault with your car! There are many times when our cars may have unusual niggles, quirks, or complaints. But it is of course important to judge when these may be unsafe, or an indication of something seriously wrong. In these cases, please ensure you take your car to a reputable garage for an expert opinion. But otherwise, if you are keen to solve a minor problem yourself, boost your motoring experience as well as your overall knowledge of your car, then the five tips below are a great starting point. Problems with our car may be subtle or insignificant at first. It can be hard to keep track or understand what triggers and relieves them without first paying close attention. That is why it is important to begin keeping a record at the first sign of trouble. This can include making a note of any unusual sounds, sights, or burning smells, for example, as well as when they happen and what seems to trigger them. It could be that you experience a problem when accelerating, for example, or after a particular type of weather. Issues with brakes or braking should be taken straight to an expert or a garage to ensure the safety of driver and passengers. But if the car is otherwise functioning optimally, then begin keeping your own records. After a few drives or days, you may be able to see a pattern that gives you a strong indication of what is causing — or exacerbating — the issue. Problem-solving and troubleshooting can be fun and rewarding if undertaken sensibly. After noticing and keeping a record of your problem, it can then be a good time to do your own research. A good place to start is with the manual of the car itself. This can often include details that we may first overlook, such as what certain warning lights mean on the dashboard, for example, or other issues to be aware of. The manufacturer website can also be helpful, as can general car maintenance and troubleshooting guides. It may not be as fast as simply typing your problem into an online search engine, but you will get answers more specific to your type of car and be saved the time of sifting through sites that may not be relevant. While filtering through online information can be slightly overwhelming, the advantage it has over information presented in print is that it can be easily updated. Researching or asking about your problem online is bound to retrieve the most up-to-date answers — especially if you use the manufacturer’s website or a knowledgeable forum. Questions can be both broad and specific, from the longest range on an electric vehicle through to how to change a tyre yourself, or even how the future of driving may look. When seeking the answer to a detailed problem or question be as specific as you can; this will help to ensure that you are not bombarded with general information. Be discerning with reliable sources — trusting only reputable websites — and when in doubt do not hesitate to seek the advice of your garage. Then, you can proceed to tip number 4! For many drivers, the simplest and most effective way to troubleshoot a problem with their car is to take it straight to an expert. Whether your issue is large or small, the most reputable garages will be able to provide you with answers not only on what is causing the problem, but also how to manage or correct it. If this requires specialised parts, repairs, or maintenance, they can give you a quote and advise how best to proceed. Through reading and research you can become more knowledgeable and capable, but industry experts are always there to help you too. Whether at home or through a reliable garage, one of the most sophisticated ways to solve a problem with your car is to use diagnostic fault-finding or specialised software. The latest diagnostic tools and equipment can read and interpret fault codes from a variety of car makes and models. Once this has been correctly identified, you can then create a specific strategy and course of action to get you back on the road!"
19,Driving In 'The New Normal': 5 Key Things To Know,autos-trucks," We are all adjusting to 'the new normal'. After a turbulent period around the world, many are now taking positive steps: coming out of national lockdowns or restrictions and returning to a regular routine. But this 'normal' is new. The return to our old habits and routines has already changed significantly, giving rise to a new situation that we must all be aware of. Below, we explore five key things to know within the world of transport that could affect the way you travel and drive in this new environment. By being aware of these things, you will help to ensure that your transition back into the world is safe, smooth, and positive. The first important thing to note when returning to normal is that the rules on the road — and beyond — may have changed. But as with all areas of the law, ignorance or lack of awareness is not a defence! Rules that may have changed include bridge tolls and prices, safety laws, and even national borders. This is especially true for drivers who are travelling or transporting goods around the European Union. Britain’s departure from the EU — Brexit — has impacted British imports and exports significantly, for example. There are now new rules, regulations, and tariffs in place. It is important to be aware of these so that you are not hit with any fines or penalties for breaking them. There may also be new rules and laws that have come to pass during the lockdown and are not yet common practice, such as a new rule that bans drivers from filming videos while driving, and not simply from making calls and texts. Be sure to check if there are any significant changes that will affect your driving or travel plans in advance. It is not only the rules of driving that may have changed - the routes may also have altered. During national lockdowns, many roadworks and construction projects have been undertaken that could completely modify a familiar route, whether with a temporary diversion or something more permanent. Be sure to expect changes and alterations such as these and remain alert at all times, even on routes that were previously familiar. Also, be sure to allow extra time for your journeys to avoid disappointment and to avoid rushing. This will help to ensure that you drive safely and responsibly. Now is a great time to rely upon satellite navigation and electronic maps that are regularly — even instantaneously — updated, rather than maps in print that can quickly go out of date. If in doubt, check your route beforehand, or simply allow extra time for your journey. Many people have been driving less during the last year - whether because of lockdown, illness, working remotely, or a range of other reasons. If you have been driving less than normal recently, be aware that you may be a little out of practice. You may wish to allow more time for your journey, or to take small daily trips in the car to build up your confidence and skills again. Even if you must drive normally straight away, try to ensure that you are extra vigilant and safe. If in doubt, take a break, and work your way up to longer journeys. Recent studies have shown that many people now feel more nervous or anxious when driving after a long break. Experts say that by starting with smaller, more familiar journeys on a regular basis, your confidence should soon return. Returning to your car after a long break might make you realise that it no longer suits your lifestyle, or could benefit from a refresh. You may choose to sell your car — adding a few simple upgrades to raise its value — or alternatively, you may take smaller steps. These might include booking in to a reputable garage that can update any out of date parts, check for damage, or run safety checks. It is especially important to ensure that your car is still roadworthy, and that brakes, tyres, and other essentials are functioning optimally after weeks of underuse. Many drivers have found that their car has a flat battery following the lockdown! The 'new normal' may also include carrying new essentials that were not always necessary before. Water, a phone charger, and a first aid or repair kit can always be helpful, but new additions might now include face masks, hand sanitisers, and medicine. With preparation and a relaxed approach, your transition to the 'new normal' in driving will be safe, easy, and enjoyable!"
20,"Mobile Car Valeting - South West London, Surrey by AutoCar Valet",autos-trucks," Car cleaning can be one of the most exciting businesses in the motor industry, believe it or not. Some might find it hard work as a low-key occupation. Somebody sees the approach to an interesting systematic work that could be even drawn on a piece of paper from A to Z, including every single step just like a well pre-planned stage performance for the audience to see. While a car wash service is provided in several different ways, to start with a paintwork killer Automatic car wash, we will talk about the mobile car valet service provided by AutoCar Valet. The small company based in South West London specialising in detailed car valeting, or simply [American way] called car detailing. Mobile car valeting is the process of a car wash both exterior and interior on the premises as and where requested by the customer, whether it is home or work, preferably NOT in a busy High Street that may distract a car cleaner from doing the job. We should also consider that valeting a vehicle on a busy street would cause inconveniences to the passes by both pedestrians and drivers. Like any other car handwash business, AutoCar Valet offers a range of services required by the customers. From basic car cleaning to a full valet that could take up to 6 - 7 hours to complete, from headlight restoration to intensive machine polishing that takes mostly a full day of meticulous work to see outstanding results. Two points make a difference between service providers - a level of expertise, a balance between quality and quantity. It would be impossible for AutoCar Valet to compete with a car washing station in London that serves a hundred cars in a day. For the same car washing station would be mission impossible to compete with AutoCar Valet on a level of quality. That is why many customers choose to pay more for the job at high standards that comes along with comfort, a big smile and personal customer service. AutoCarValet covers South West and partially West London and Surrey, only to mention Richmond, Wandsworth, Kingston, Hammersmith, Fulham, Guildford, Dorking, and neighbourhood areas. Bookings for a single basic car cleaning is accepted only within a radius of up to three miles around postcode area SW14.

And if you do, then probably you should be getting one of their membership packages https://autocarvalet.co.uk/#membership. Rip great benefits by saving hundreds of pounds in one year! The below explained how. While the rate table on the web https://autocarvalet.co.uk/#rates indicates the initial price for each service, the actual cost quoted on three factors: There are three sizes to add: Small Cars ( A [city] - e.g. Smart, Toyota Aygo, Fiat 500, etc., B [small] - e.g. Mini, Toyota Yaris, Vauxhall Corsa, etc. and C [compact] - e.g. VW Golf, Skoda Fabia, Ford Focus, etc.), Medium Size Cars (D [family] - e.g. Audi A3, Ford Mondeo, Vauxhall Insignia, etc.) and Large Cars (E [SUV, 4x4, Vans up to 3.5 tons], e.g. Land Rover Discovery, Volvo XC90, Mercedes-Benz Vito, etc.). The initial price depends on a chosen service and a car size for both a single booking and membership package plan. It primarily impacts the actual cost when purchasing a one-time service. For example, there is a request from the customer to do a full valet for their Volvo XC90 (one of the filthiest cars on earth!). The initial price for the service and the size of the vehicle stands at £160.00. However, the price may increase within a range of up to £90.00. Due to an extra workload required to complete the task. The owner of a membership plan would pay only a flat rate with a discount of 10%. AutoCar Valet located in SW14, the closer the customer resides, the less chance for any extra charges. The owner of a membership plan would pay only a flat rate with a discount of 10% wherever they reside within South West London and Surrey. The owner of a membership plan can share it with their family members, neighbours and friends who are equally eligible for the same benefits. Enjoy the comfort of a mobile car valet by your door! No queues, no hassle, no damaged car by dirty sponge that gives a rattle!"

1,Why Window Tinting Cars Is Beneficial,autos-trucks," Sometimes, you may wonder why many people have their car tinted but seem confusing. Do you know that one crucial factor is that it protects you and your vehicle? Does that sound like HOW? Interesting! Window-tinted cars provide a long-lasting functional benefit. Below are the benefits of window tinting in the modern century. One of the reasons why people consider tinting their car windows is that it helps upholstery from fading. Not only that, but it also serves as a great way to protect the investment. Also, using a windshield sun protector or shade temporarily reduce sun damage and consistently block harsh sunshine. Blocking the sun's harmful ultraviolet can accelerate skin aging. Aside from that, it blocks up to 99 percent of harmful ultraviolet that can cause skin cancer. So, for people who drive for long, tinted windows provide a critical advantage to save them from unnecessary health-related problems. Besides, prolonged exposure to sunray may lead to skin darkening, premature aging, and many others, to mention a few. It's no doubt that tinted windows in a car contribute to the rejection of solar heat. Although this may depend on the grade of your window being tinted but it's perfect for preferring a solution to the air conditioning dilemma. If you've been looking for the right air conditioning that'd fit your car, don't look further if you have your window tinted. This is because it can block up to 35-65 percent of the solar heat in the car. However, you can balance climate and comfort while driving, and this may likely cut down your fuel usage from air conditioning service. The benefits of installing glass protection in your car cannot be overemphasized. In the event of an accident, the tinted windows protect passengers from being ejected through windows. Besides, thieves find it challenging to enter the car while embarking on a journey. Window tinting has different shades and types that solely protect the car and passenger. Also, it brings a level of privacy as people find it hard to see the driver and passenger in the car. Moreover, it improves the car looks and adds to your peace of mind while driving. If you've been craving for tinted windows in your car, search no more as you've landed on the right platform. You can refer to the International Window Film Association chart."
2,5 Great Ways To Upgrade Your Driving Experience,autos-trucks," Driving does not have to be tedious or monotonous. It can be comfortable, easy, and even exciting! Whether you are commuting to work, visiting friends and family, running errands, or doing the school run, a car is one of the most convenient and cost-effective ways of getting from A to B. But how can you make it better? How can you improve your overall driving experience so that driving is no longer just a chore, but a pleasure? Read on to discover how to upgrade your driving experience with these five simple tips. Many drivers are not aware that their level of driving skill is one of the most important factors in several areas. It not only affects how enjoyable driving is, but can affect how much you spend on travel and fuel, how well maintained your car is, your safety, level of carbon emissions, and more. Simply driving more efficiently — such as by selecting the appropriate gear, reducing wind resistance and driving at the correct speed, for example — can transform your driving experience. Long-term, it can save you thousands of pounds as your style of driving will no longer be burning unnecessary fuel. Efficient driving is also safer and less likely to result in unnecessary wear and tear on your car — meaning fewer expensive trips to the garage! Driving more efficiently, or with more skill, also gives you more confidence and helps your journeys to feel smoother and more enjoyable. Studies show that more drivers than ever before are keen to go green and make the switch to a hybrid or electric vehicle. This is not only better for the environment, but it may be more cost-effective too. You may even be eligible for particular discounts, incentives, or tax reliefs by driving a more environmentally-friendly car. One of the most common concerns about electric cars is whether their range on a single charge will be long enough for most journeys. But the range and mileage possible for electric cars is growing all the time. Research some of the electric cars with the longest range and you can proceed with the confidence in which one is most suitable for you! You will not only be upgrading your driving experience by selecting a new car, you’ll be doing more to help the planet too! If you are employed, why not discuss with your employer if you could claim a company car? Although you are still liable for some charges associated with the car (such as the Benefit in Kind Tax), maintenance, and fuel, obtaining the car itself can be your employer’s responsibility. Many employers are keen for their employees to make the best and most professional impression on clients and other companies, and arriving at meetings in a new, clean, and well-maintained company car can be a great way to do this. As a result, company cars can be a great way to experience a luxury vehicle for a fraction of the usual cost! If your budget allows, and you would like to upgrade your driving experience by obtaining a new car, why not ‘try before you buy’? Recent surveys have shown that renting (of homes, cars, furniture, and more) is more popular than ever. When it comes to a car, this can be a great way to test whether a car really is the right fit for you. The car needs to be appropriate for your lifestyle and budget, as well as suit your style, driving practises, family needs, and more. A new car can be a significant financial investment, and renting is a great way to test the water before you take the plunge! Renting is especially suitable for customers who may only need a car on a sporadic basis, and therefore do not wish to make a full-time investment in one. Upgrading your driving experience does not have to be expensive or time-consuming. It can be as simple as making the very most of what you already have. Such as by keeping your car clean, tidy, and well-maintained, for example. A well-maintained car feels much smoother and more comfortable to drive, while being safer and more cost-effective overall. You may also choose to add some accessories or fragrances, or to invest in new parts that will make the car drive like brand-new, even if it has seen many years of service! Whatever your budget and time constraints, with a few subtle changes you can make your driving experience smoother, safer, and more enjoyable."
3,World premiere of the electric Audi Q4 e-tron and Q4 Sportback e-tron,autos-trucks," With the Audi Q4 e-tron and the Audi Q4 Sportback e-tron, Audi is taking the next step in the design language for its electric cars. The two compact SUVs are already in production and the lines are recognizable from the concept cars shown in 2019. The proportions are powerful with short overhangs and large wheels while the lines are drawn with precision over clean and reduced surfaces. The new Audi Q4 Sportback e-tron has a coupe-like roofline that ends in a powerful rear section where the spoiler is placed far down on the two-part window. The aerodynamic design is typical of Audi where form also follows function. The Q4 e-tron has a cw value of 0.28 while the coupe shape in Sportback gives an even lower air resistance value of 0.26. Both models can be equipped with Matrix LED headlights that illuminate the road to the maximum without dazzling other road users. The driver can also tailor the digital daylight and choose between four different signatures, a novelty that Audi is first with. In addition to the basic version, the exterior variants advanced and S line exterior is also offered. Thanks to its versatile character, the Audi Q4 e-tron and Q4 Sportback e-tron are perfect for everyday use. The outer dimension of 4.59 meters in length provides impressive interior space. The luggage compartment also holds more than usual in the compact class and rather matches the middle class with its 520 to 1490 litres in the Q4 e-tron and 535 to 1460 litres in the Sportback. Both models can pull up to 1000 kg. Another advantage in everyday life is long-range. The Audi Q4 40 e-tron has a range of up to 511 km (WLTP) on one charge. Thanks to a maximum charging capacity of 125 kW, under ideal conditions it takes 10 minutes to charge the battery to run 130 km (WLTP). The interior of the Audi Q4 e-tron and Q4 Sportback e-tron is designed to create an airy feeling. The instrument panel faces the driver and is divided into two separate units with two screens and the gear selector located in a separate unit. The sporty S line interior is also offered with a seat upholstery consisting of recycled polyester. The infotainment and navigation system are mainly regulated via the center-placed MMI touch screen of 10.1 inches, which will also be available in 11.6 inches towards the end of the year. As an option, the Audi Q4 e-tron and Audi Q4 Sportback e-tron can be equipped with another innovation - a head-up display with augmented reality (AR-augmented reality). The information from the assistance systems and the navigation symbols are then projected on top of the real environment at a distance of about 10 meters, which makes it easy for the driver to follow the directions. Both models are offered in several variants for different customer needs. The entry-level variant Q4 35 e-tron has a battery with a net capacity of 52 kWh (55 kWh gross), while the Q4 40 e-tron and Q4 50 e-tron quattro has a larger battery of 77 kWh net (82 kWh gross). The new Audi Q4 35 e-tron and Q4 40 e-tron are rear-wheel drives with outputs of 170 hp (125 kW) and 204 hp (150 kW) respectively. The top model Audi Q4 50 e-tron quattro is also equipped with two electric motors with a four-wheel-drive that gives a total power of 299 hp (220 kW) - enough to do 0 to 100 km / h in 6.2 seconds with a top speed of 180 km /hrs. Q4 40 and 50 e-tron have a heat pump as standard, which i.a. uses the excess heat from the high-voltage battery to temper the interior, which also helps to reduce consumption, especially on longer trips. The Audi Q4 35 e-tron can be equipped with an optional heat pump. The new Audi Q4 e-tron will begin selling in April. The Q4 Sportback e-tron will be launched after the summer."
4,5 Key Changes In The Transport Industry That YOU Need To Know About,autos-trucks," These are turbulent times. Upheaval, change, and unprecedented circumstances have been seen all over the world. Whatever your field, you are bound to have noticed major shifts in the way that your industry operates. This is certainly true for the world of transportation. In this article, we explore five key changes that the transportation industry has experienced — or expects to experience — in recent and coming years. Importantly, we also explore how they might affect you and your business, or at the very least, the way you travel and commute. By being aware of these five key changes, you can take steps to prepare. That might mean adjusting your budget, changing the way you drive, making alterations to travel and commuting, or exploring ‘greener’ and more environmentally friendly options. The circumstances may not be within your control — but the way you react to them is. Browse these five key changes, be prepared to adapt, and you will not only survive the changes, but learn to thrive in them too. KEY CHANGE 1: Environmentally Conscious Policy & Incentives The environment is one of the hottest contemporary topics across a range of industries. More businesses than ever before are aiming to address what experts are calling a ‘climate crisis’. This is being seen not just in business, but also across national and international policymaking. Examples include things such as the introduction of the popular Walk to Work, or Cycle to Work schemes, which is designed to reduce the congestion and pollution on major roads, as well as incentivise workers to improve their health. More national or policy-wide examples include tax relief and incentives for businesses and individuals to only purchase environmentally-friendly cars — such as electric or hybrid vehicles that can then be written off as a legitimate expense. Other widespread transport policies with an eco-slant include the construction of cycle tracks and bike routes, as well as congestion charges and tariffs designed to reduce the use of non-essential transport — especially in areas with high levels of pollution. It is expected that there will be even more ‘aggressive’ or proactive environmental policies affecting transport in the future. For all these reasons then, and more, if you are considering purchasing a car for your business, environmentally friendly options have the best chance of suiting your budget and standing the test of time. KEY CHANGE 2: Automation A key change expected to substantially affect the transport industry in the near future is automation. Whether through the use of robots and AI in manufacturing, engineering, and administration, or even the use of self-driving cars and autonomous vehicles, transport is getting smarter. Digital elements have been incorporated into almost every new type of transport, and are being relied upon for an increasing number of uses and responsibilities. Many of us — and many businesses — are already fully familiar and reliant on GPS tracking, for example, but in the future, this may become more futuristic and less populated by physical people. Managing a fleet of drones for delivery, or self-driving cars, may reduce an entire working team to just a single managerial individual, for example. It may be years away, but it is always worth exploring the small ways that automation and artificial intelligence could help you, your mode of transport, or your transport business to thrive. It might be as simple as using software to log your business miles when you travel for work, right through to exploring entirely automated delivery options, and more. KEY CHANGE 3: Borders & Tariffs One of the most controversial recent changes to the transport industry has been the upheaval surrounding Brexit — i.e. the UK’s departure from the European Union. This could have a major impact on British imports and exports, and many are finding the changes difficult to fully understand. Some key areas that will be affected are an increased level of bureaucracy and ‘red tape’, potential shortages and delays with goods, higher prices due to increased levels of difficulty in supply, and contentious border issues — such as with Northern Ireland (which remains in the EU single market for goods). Overall, it is expected that it will not just be Brexit that will affect transport in the coming years, but that there may be several new border issues and tariffs imposed worldwide. The global marketplace is more volatile and competitive than ever, and the coming dramatic changes in the transport industry are expected to reflect this. KEY CHANGE 4: Faster Changes To The Law Until recently, a change to the law was often slow to be reviewed and even slower to come into effect. But that is starting to change. Experts in the transport industry agree that there may be widespread reviews of certain policies, approaches, and laws in the coming years — and that they are expected to come into effect faster than ever before. Laws can change the way we drive — from the rules on hands-free phone use in cars, rises in car tax dictated by how much CO2 the vehicle uses (coming into effect in 2021), and the new rules that will see motorists face a fine and penalty points if caught filming videos, taking photographs, or holding their device while driving. Due to the rapidly changing nature of driving, transport, and (especially) their intersection with technology, it is expected that laws and policy will be reviewed and rolled out faster than ever before. Stay up to date to avoid being caught out by a rule that you may not even have known existed! KEY CHANGE 5: Remote Working One of the most major changes experienced by the transport industry is the rise in remote working. But remote working is no longer just a response to national lockdowns or the reduction of travel during a global pandemic. It is also a widespread change in the way that we work and how businesses are choosing to operate. Remote working can reduce the amount of congestion and pollution on national roads. It can save time and money in commuting and connect workforces from all over the world - regardless of their physical location. It is a complex issue with pros and cons, but will inevitably become a major talking point in the contemporary transportation industry. No matter your background, you don’t have to be an expert on these topics, but by possessing a fair level of awareness around these key issues affecting the transport industry, you will be better prepared for the future!"
5,The Emerging Green Face Of Transport: And 5 Ways To Keep Up!,autos-trucks," Transport is a rapidly changing industry. With governments, businesses, and individuals keen to make environmentally-friendly choices, transport could easily get left behind. But it doesn’t have to! The way we drive, the way we travel, and how we use transport all has an impact, but we can help to ensure that impact is positive. The transport industry has seen a shift towards cost-effectiveness, accessibility, and environmental awareness. Read on to discover some of the ways that you — and your business or employees — can make the most of this! While it may not be an option for everyone, many businesses, employees, and freelancers have made the switch to working 100% remotely. Others have switched to remote options for special events, or for a few days a week. Working remotely has helped to alleviate congestion on the roads as well as to reduce air pollution. It also has the added benefit of improving accessibility for employees, clients, or customers who may be less able to travel. Hosting events or conferences remotely and online, holding meetings over the phone or via video call, and more, are all ways to help minimise transport and travel in your business. Whether you are an employer, an employee, or a freelancer, exploring remote working and flexible options can be a great way to stay ahead of this important trend in transport. Where transport is still necessary and essential, consider making the switch to an environmentally-friendly solution. Many businesses and even governments are offering incentives to do this, in the hope it will affect a wider change. If your budget allows, you could make the switch to an electric or hybrid vehicle — effectively saving thousands of pounds on fuel over time, as well as helping the environment. You could also offer or suggest Walk or Cycle to work initiatives, or group travel solutions to reduce the number of cars or taxis on the road. Public transport may also be an option if social distancing measures permit. Whatever your circumstances or role, many people are staying ahead of the curve by thinking about how they can make the most environmentally-friendly choices in their travel — even if just for one day a week. Keeping your car well-maintained and driving in a fuel-efficient manner also helps! Walk and Cycle to work initiatives are already popular in the workplace — but you could take it further. Employers could offer rewards or prizes for those who cover the most miles, for example, or you can make it fun by challenging a rival department. Many people are also ensuring that they are taking full advantage of any tax relief or financial incentives for making environmentally-friendly decisions in their work or business. Be sure to do the same! Saving the environment through your transport choices doesn’t have to be costly or time-consuming. It can actually save you money! These are rapidly changing times. New rules, restrictions and regulations are always coming into play, and this is also true of transport. Enlisting the help of experts in transport or logistics, for example, is saving countless businesses time, money, and fuel. Experts stay abreast of issues such as the new rules on Brexit, for example, or any charges or discounts related to transport that you may be entitled to. Transport is a highly changeable and important industry. Experts stay up-to-date so you don’t have to! Seeking their help can save you money, but also a lot of time, stress, and complexity. Rental options are especially popular across a wide range of areas — furniture, electronics, and now transport! Renting a car is not only helpful for those who do not want to make the full financial commitment of owning a car. It is also especially attractive for anyone wanting to reduce their overall car usage and carbon footprint, without giving up driving altogether. Car rental is a popular option for both individuals and businesses. They can use the car for busy travel periods but then return it when things become quiet again, without being left with a car that still needs year-round maintenance, insurance, and more. Rental options are becoming highly popular in the transport industry — for both business and personal use. With a bit of research and consideration, you could assess whether this trend might also be a good option for you or your business!"

7,5 Things to Know Before Choosing Car Insurance,autos-trucks," So, it is a well-known fact that Australia is the home for a lot of cars, but did you know that the estimated number of cars that Aussies own is a whopping 18 million. I mean that is a LOT! It just shows how big of a country Australia is. We all know that driving is an integral part of a normal Aussie’s life, so isn’t it important to ensure the car that drives us around and helps our day-to-day life? When it comes to cars, no one can is a cent percent sure of what would happen when traveling on road. You might be an excellent driver but accidents happening cannot be your fault but still be something which would give you losses. This is a thing that is completely out of your control. Ensuring your car is the best way to protect yourself from things that happen in an unexpected way. But, there are a few important things you need to understand before you sign the dotted line, and those important things are listed below. Be in terms with the important terms Here are some of the important terms listed with the car insurance policies: ● Accident: An event that is unexpected or unforeseeable. ● Agreed value: The amount your car is covered for over the length of a policy — this is an amount that’s agreed on between both you and the insurer. However, some providers don’t offer this as an option. ● Claim: Any application you make to your insurer after an accident, so long as it’s covered under your policy. ● Comprehensive cover: Coverage for the cost of damage — either to you or caused by you — after an accident. You’ll probably still have to pay an excess, but at least your repairs will be covered whether you were at fault or someone else was. ● CTP: Compulsory third-party (CTP) insurance is the minimum cover that every driver in Australia needs. It’s illegal to not have it. It covers you in the event someone is injured during an accident you’re responsible for. ● Excess: When you make a claim and you’re at fault, you usually have to pay an agreed excess before your claim can be processed. ● Premium: Your on-going payment (either fortnightly, monthly, or annually) to maintain your car insurance policy. ● Risk: The likelihood of you making a claim that the insurer will have to pay out on. This may be different between a number of providers. ● Write-off: When the cost of your car’s repairs is considered too expensive to be worth fixing. If you have comprehensive coverage you could be paid out a specified amount or given a similar vehicle. Read the PDS Here is something which the people don’t follow at all, mainly because of how a chore it is. But it is really important to read the Product Disclosure Statement (PDS) as it will help you understand what you’re getting covered and for what you’re not. Under Australian law, your insurer must include all the terms and conditions of the policy in the PDS or a policy document included with the PDS. The details are explained in plain English so you don’t need any kind of prior experience to go through this. Also, an important pointer to keep in mind, the PDS is not customized or specified for your personal needs and financial situation. So we surely recommend you to read the PDS from your car insurers without fail. This will help you make the best decision according to your circumstances. If you still feel that you are confused you have insurance brokers Perth like us, who will help you find the best insurer there is based on your needs and make sure that the insurance that you take up is the best you can get for your car. Figure out how often you drive These days, drivers are lucky enough to have a wealth of car insurance options at their feet. And one alternative policy that’s on the rise is Pay as You Drive (PAYD) insurance. Drivers these days are lucky to have the luxury of car insurance options right at their feet. There is also an alternative in this which is the Pay as You Drive (PAYD) insurance option. PAYD is defined by The Australian Securities and Investments Commission as “The premium is based on the number of kilometers you expect to drive in the coming year. If during the year, you think you will drive further than planned, you can ‘top up’ your kilometers for an additional cost. However, if you exceed your elected kilometers and don’t tell the insurer, your level of cover may be reduced.” Thus if you have a fairly good idea of how much you would drive in the upcoming year then you have good chances of ending up with a lower premium when choosing this option. Comprehensive or third party cover — Decide Aside from PAYD, the car insurers offer you three different levels of covers. But obviously the higher the coverage you want, the more you’ll pay in premiums. Here’s how they stack up: ● Comprehensive: The gold-standard of car insurance! It will cover the cost of damage to your vehicle and any others involved in an accident, as well as fire and theft cover. ● Third-party property, fire, and theft: Covers any damage to other people’s vehicles if you’re responsible for the accident, but it doesn’t cover damage to your own car. However, you will be covered in the event your car is stolen, damaged by fire, or is maliciously damaged. ● Third-party property damage: This is a step above the mandatory CTP insurance, covering the cost of repairs to property damage you cause. It’s usually the most affordable option but remembers your own car damage won’t be covered if you’re at fault. Compare the quotes Okay here is a reality check; there is no one-stop-fit-all approach for your car insurance. So it is important for you to browse different places so that you can find the best place which would suit you and your current lifestyle. Not all the car insurance products are equal, as each of them provides something different on the basis of comprehensive, third party property damage and third party property, etc., these will not have the same inclusions across the board. So it is absolutely crucial for you to have insurance brokers like Millpoint Insurance who help you find the right provider and help you even with the PDS. Our trained brokers will help you break down complex policies and allow you to get easy info that will cover everything from premium to a value that you will agree to. Being through with you every step of the way and indicating pointers that would help you find the right insurer based on your needs is what we are there for. We all know how important cars are in our life, right from managing grocery shopping, to school drop-offs and heading home after work, a car helps through all of that. Having the right car insurance can help you get back on the road faster after an accident, and will give you financial peace of mind knowing that a portion of the cost of repairs is covered. So if you want to get covered properly then Millpoint is the best place for you and your family."

9,4 Unexpected Ways To Save Money On Transport,autos-trucks," These are challenging times, and many people are looking for ways to cut costs and save money. One of the most expensive outgoings in daily life can be our transport — whether that’s through commuting to work, visiting family, travelling for leisure, or more. Luckily, there are many ways you can save money on transport, thereby significantly reducing your overall expenses. Some of the more tried-and-tested tips include simply travelling less, looking for discounts on car maintenance, shopping around for better fuel prices, and more. But the tips below are slightly more unexpected. These tips are also ideal for implementing when you have already applied the usual ways of saving money on transport, such as those described above. These simple ways to save money on transport could help to cut costs and make travel a more manageable expense. Try them today, and see how much you could save! Studies show that many people are driving cars that are poorly maintained. This not only has an impact on safety, but it can significantly impact expenses too. Poorly maintained cars are often inefficient with fuel — leaking or guzzling it — leading to you needing to purchase more of it than you should. Cars in need of maintenance may also end up requiring a large and sudden output of cash to fix a major problem. It is instead far more cost-effective to spend little and often on your car, with regular visits to a trusted and reputable garage. Keeping kit or transport in good working order also applies to cyclists! Ensuring that your bicycle, seat, tires, and more are all in good condition means you are less likely to need to spend on a total upgrade. You will also be helping to ensure you have a smoother and more efficient journey. Comfortable daily transport like a well-maintained bicycle or car also makes it less likely that you will have to splurge one day on taxis or emergency transport if you find your vehicle unusable! Whatever transport you use regularly (even if that just means walking shoes!) aim to keep it in good working order and it will save you time, money, (and stress!) in the future. If your circumstances permit, a great solution for saving money on transport can be arranging to work from home. If this is not a permanent option, many people arrange for it to be a temporary solution, or even just for a few times a week. Working from home not only saves you money but is also considered to be better for the environment; this is because it takes cars off the road and reduces the need for public transport. This solution is of course not an option for everyone. But a creative approach to how you can reduce your travel, or make your job and business more flexible, can often be highly cost-effective. Approaching transport in the most environmentally-friendly way possible is not only better for the planet — it can also be better for your budget! Whether in large or small ways, environmentally friendly travel can have a huge impact. If social distancing measures allow, you could consider carpooling or using public transport, rather than travelling in your own car. You could consider cycling or walking to work (even if only for one day a week) or suggest a challenge or incentive at work that rewards this. An electric car or more fuel-efficient car can also be a great way to go green and save more money in the long run. Even solutions that require an initial outlay can still be more cost-effective as the years go by. If you run a business, demonstrating environmentally-friendly or carbon neutral decisions — such as the use of an electric car — could be tax incentivised too, helping to save you money! A final unexpected solution for saving money on transport is to explore a change of route. This could mean optimising your daily commute, for example, but it is especially relevant for those running a business. If you are transporting goods or products, ensuring that you are using the most efficient route possible is essential. Relying on expert logistics firms and couriers is a great way to confirm that this is the best route for you and that you are fully compliant with all restrictions. Whether travelling from home to work, transporting goods, or anything in between, your route matters and should be factored into your budget!"

11,The 5 Electric Cars With The Longest Range,autos-trucks," Imagine a car which has zero emissions, government subsidies of £3,500 off the purchase price, and is tax-free. Oh, and it requires less maintenance, has lower running costs, AND creates nearly no noise. This car is not a mere fantasy, it exists today in the form of an electric vehicle (EV). But despite all these benefits, electric cars only comprise 1-2% of UK annual car sales - so why aren’t more UK drivers buying EVs? In a survey by YouGov, the most common concern for 81% of respondents was their range. But the ranges of EVs are improving all the time, meaning many options are available if you require a car which provides significant mileage. Here, Yellow Car Shop have assessed the longest-range EVs, comparing their top speed, 0-60 mph acceleration time, range, and budget bracket.

You can reserve your Roadster for a deposit of £29,000 The price tag: The Founders Series costs a staggering £250,000! Design flaws: Some reviewers have expressed doubts about certain design components, including the ‘butterfly wheel’ which is not road legal in some areas Top Speed: 162 mph Range: 405 Miles 0-60 mph in: 2.3 Seconds Price: From £73,990 Pros: Cheaper than the Roadster: At £73,990 The Model S Long-Range is more affordable than its £250,000 counterpart Similar features to the Roadster, but more practical: The Model S has more space than the Roadster; it can be transformed into a seven-seater AND includes extra storage space Offers Semi-Autonomous Driving Assistance Can seat 7 Cons: BIG!: The Model S is pretty chunky. Get used to inching around country lanes and squeezing into parking spaces! Price: While it’s cheaper than the Roadster, buying a Model S is still not a decision to take lightly seeing as it costs £73,990 Top Speed: 99 mph Range: 340 Miles 0-60 mph in: 7.1 Seconds Price: From £32,000 Pros: Seats 5 Offers a quiet, smooth, and responsive drive A practical vehicle which provides a decent amount of space and a reasonably large boot At 340 Miles range, it offers a lot of distance for its price Cons: Too familiar perhaps? Little difference between the appearance of this vehicle and the Volkswagen Golf Not flashy: Some reviewers have found the ID.3 ‘unmemorable’ on account of its practical design. But for a daily-use car, it’s a great compromise. Top Speed: 127 mph Range: 292 Miles 0-60 mph in: 4.1 Seconds Price: From £49,900 Pros: A happy balance: The Polestar is fantastic value for money, and a great compromise between a practical car and a Supercar Qualifies for the UK’s low emission car grant: You can get up to £3,000 off the purchase price when you buy a Polestar 2! Has Four-Wheel Drive Has Android User Interface: Connects easily to Google Maps Has a decent amount of space in both the cabin and the boot Seats 5 Includes a front boot for extra storage Cons: It can be difficult to find charging points for non-Tesla electric cars Design hitches: The back windows don’t wind all the way down, and someone needs sit in the driver’s seat for the windows to work Only connects to Android phones: Not so good for Apple users! Top Speed: 126 mph Range: 256 Miles 0-60 mph in: 6.4 Seconds Price: From £17,396 Pros: Seats 5 Has a decent-sized boot Offers value for money: The Kona Electric has a range of up to 256 miles, and a top speed of 126 MPH.

It is also often called vehicle tracking or AVL tracking. A fleet is usually a group of mobile assets, including cars, trucks, trailers and powered or unpowered equipment (e.g. computerized systems used to manage inventory). There are several benefits of fleet management software and GPS tracking systems that businesses can utilize to improve their operational efficiency. GPS tracking devices are designed for tracking both permanent and temporary on-site assets. They work by acquiring signals from satellites orbiting the Earth. The signals, which are typically in the form of coordinates, are then analyzed by GPS tracking device units to determine the exact position of the GPS receiver within a few meters. In turn, the location of the receiver is used to determine the exact position of the vehicle being tracked. With fleet tracking, a business can reduce maintenance costs. Vehicle repairs can be avoided as a result of the management system. It can also improve the accuracy of vehicle tracking systems by reducing false signals and false negatives that can occur when the vehicle moves out of range of the GPS tracking device. Additionally, it can help to improve the efficiency of fleet management by allowing workers to more precisely locate their assigned vehicle at the push of a button. In addition, GPS tracking devices can increase productivity by allowing real-time tracking of vehicle speeds and routes. This allows employees to perform their job correctly and increase the efficiency with which vehicles are delivered to their destination. In order to make the most of a GPS fleet tracking software system, businesses should consult a professional GPS tracking device provider that specializes in the GPS technology. These GPS providers often provide customized solutions for fleets of both cars and trucks. There are several advantages to using GPS fleet tracking software. A GPS unit is designed to monitor vehicle speeds and positions. This information can be valuable to companies that operate on major roadways or in areas of heavy vehicle traffic. By using GPS fleet tracking software, companies can determine the exact locations of all of their vehicles at any given time. By using this specialized fleet management software, they can reduce unnecessary vehicle idling and improve customer service by knowing that their vehicles are located at their destinations. In addition, this specialized software offers benefits such as real-time updates of vehicle positions, fuel consumption reports, and vehicle diagnostics. In addition, these types of fleet tracking systems allow the fleet manager to establish an effective route map by adjusting vehicle stops. One of the main purposes of GPS fleet tracking system is to increase company productivity and profits. This is because when a vehicle is repaired it is not being used by the fleet manager and thus, the company is losing revenue. Using a fleet tracking system, the company can repair a vehicle as needed without having to cancel trips that have already been planned. Fleet managers who are using GPS fleet tracking devices can easily customize the software to meet their unique fleet management needs. For example, they can create a trip log for the entire fleet, or they can simply view the history of each vehicle. They can also view the location of each vehicle on a map or with the help of an electronic mapping program. These GPS devices are capable of acquiring vehicle information such as fuel consumption history, speed, direction and repair status. They also have the ability to recover a vehicle that has been stolen, so that drivers will not be late meeting their destinations. Fleet management GPS systems can provide a business with the tools that they need to manage their fleet efficiently. GPS trackers are especially helpful in large organizations, because they allow management staff to view the location of all vehicles at any given moment. By allowing employees to know where their vehicle is located at any time, they can save valuable time that would otherwise be spent chasing down a vehicle. GPS systems can also provide employees with a quick and easy way to identify which employee is making the most productive use of his vehicle. The GPS tracker can notify the driver of his location, which allows him to make better time-saving strategies."
14,What Changes are the MOT industry is Applying in 2021?,autos-trucks," MOT is said to be made more difficult in the coming years because the UK will have tougher environment targets. We have to understand that the targets are for us and our safety and health. Therefore, it is on us to meet them. That is why it is expected that 2021 will mark a shift in MOT policy. The DVSA has reported that as the environment targets get tougher, the MOT has to adapt to the changes for it to stay useful and relevant. Let us see how MOT is changing. Mot Emission Check to Become Strict As new technology emerges, manufacturers try their best to implement it in their vehicles. As they put in a lot of effort to do that, it is the government’s responsibility to check if those features are working as intended or not. That is why MOT emission checks will become stricter. Standardized Test for All Cars As new electric vehicles are on the rise, the government has also to make sure that there is a standard that can encompass both electric and non-electric cars. Since fuel operated cars are not going anywhere soon, a more refined framework will likely be implemented to check fuel operated cars to bring them at par with the electric vehicles. This means that the criteria to pass MOT will be much stricter. Furthermore, there is also a concern regarding old cars. As cars age, they tend to get less clean so MOT will take into account the general degradation and award points to the old cars based on the aggregate of their calculated mileage and age. Saving Costs The MOT industry is also moving towards more cost-effective checking procedures. There have been efforts to devise ways to make sure that minimal budget is spent while still maintaining the credibility of the MOT test. New App Now there is a new and secure way to log in to your MOT account. You can log in to the MOT testing system through an authentication app on your phone. If you don’t own a Smartphone, you can still login traditionally through your email through the web. Once you have set up the app, you will need to authenticate it once a day which will store some data to make it easier to authenticate again. If there are changes in your preferences, for example, if you have changed your preferred garage, the app will need authentication again. Once the app is rolled out, you will no longer need security cards and you will log from the MTS by using your authentication app. Once you set up your app, you will no longer be able to use your card. Bottom Line These changes have not yet been implemented and are expected to be in place by the mid of 2021. The app should be rolled out at the end of February and other things will follow eventually. Check MOT for van near me to have your van tested."

16,Why Vyncs Car Tracker Is a Great Choice for Parents,autos-trucks," Keeping teens safe while they are out in the world on their own has always been a challenge. Particularly, when it comes to driving, making sure that they are staying safe is important. Moms and Dads cannot always be there next to them when they’re driving to make sure that they’re not speeding or making risky moves. However, with Vyncs, life becomes a little easier for parents of teenagers. Today I’m taking a look at the Vyncs GPS Tracker to see how it stacks up against other trackers out there. Over the course of a month, I used the Vyncs car tracker to track more than 1,000 miles of driving, totaling more than 20 hours of driving. Below I’ve shared my thoughts on the overall experience, from the second I opened the box until my trip odometer tripped over its three-digit limit, marking the 1,000-mile mark. Vyncs is a popular connected car GPS tracking product that helps you keep track of your car at work and home along with the loved ones in your family, Vyncs Fleet is the commercial version of Vyncs designed for businesses that own vehicles. Vyncs offers state-of-the-art GPS tracking for cars with the latest technology and a wide range of unique features that make it a top contender in the connected car market. Vyncs is the popular #1 best-selling connected car GPS tracking product in its category on many platforms such as Amazon.com with 2300+ five-star reviews. Vyncs is also supported in 200+ countries worldwide.

This comes handy when some teen drivers try to cheat, by removing the device when they leave home and plugging it back in when they are back home. The 'ignition on' reporting feature informs you every time your car is turned on. If you want to know every time the car ignition is turned on during certain ""curfew"" hours (timings can be personalized using your Vyncs app or web account), then this comes handy. Vyncs also tracks where, when, and for how long your car has stopped somewhere. You can also set up 'geofences' of arbitrary shape (not just a circular) from your account to check when your car enters and/or exits certain areas. Vyncs also alert parents if their teens try to use the car at odd hours and/or to unknown locations. In fact, all of Vyncs’s car monitoring features can relieve parents of a great deal of stress. The Vyncs car GPS tracker comes with a 4G LTE device (if your area does not support 4G, then get the Vyncs 3G), a web account, and an app that you can download in any Android/iOS device. Fast speed, accessibility, and ease of use make Vyncs a popular choice, especially among parents."
17,6 Simple Ways To Pandemic-Proof Your Car,autos-trucks," Recent times have been challenging for almost everyone. Businesses, professionals, and individuals alike have all had to find ways to navigate the difficulties of the pandemic and weather the storm of sudden changes. While there have also been changes to travel rules, working practices, and the need for transport, one constant is that our cars remain an important tool for our daily lives. Even if we are working remotely, we may still need to travel for medical care, for example. Or even if we are not able to travel to see friends and family, we may still need our car to pick up essential supplies and groceries. For this reason, we’ve come up with six simple and helpful ways to pandemic-proof your car. Be sure to continue checking the rules and regulations where you are, and read on to discover how to use your car safely and effectively during this time! TIP 1: Emphasise Maintenance Whether you are using your car regularly or not, maintenance is still vitally important. A car that is sitting in the driveway unused is almost as likely to need maintenance and checking as one that is overused! Balance is best, and putting maintenance first is key. Be sure to check your car regularly for changes or damage, which includes assessing any notifications or alerts on your dashboard or lights, for example. If in doubt, take your car to a reputable garage with social distancing and COVID-safe measures in place to keep your car in excellent working order. In stressful or disruptive times, it can also be easy to lose track of important dates and information, so be doubly sure that you have all your paperwork and payments in order — such as for insurance, tax, and MOT. TIP 2: Park And Store Your Vehicle Safely Your car may not be getting as much use as usual. Perhaps visiting friends and families is not possible, or you are working from home when you might normally commute. Whatever your circumstances, try to ensure that your car is parked or stored as safely as possible. A private driveway is often best, but if this is not possible, aim for a well-lit and secure area where it will not be obstructing any other vehicles. Not only is keeping your car parked safely good for overall maintenance (especially if harsh weather is a consideration) but recent studies have found that car thefts may be slightly elevated in recent months. Be vigilant, look out for your neighbours, and keep your car safely parked, locked, and secured. TIP 3: Only Take Essential Journeys It may be that the current rules only allow essential journeys, but this can be helpful to remember at other times too. If you are between car services, for example, or have concerns that your car may not be operating optimally, then only taking essential journeys can be helpful until you can get to the garage. (Of course, if you have any doubts that your car may not be safe to drive, then do not drive it at all and contact a professional.) But otherwise, essential journeys help to minimise the wear and tear on your car, and are more cost-effective in fuel. TIP 4: Consider Selling Selling your car during long periods of inactivity can also be worth considering. You may wish to downgrade to a cheaper model, or even upgrade to a more long-term cost-effective model such as an electric or hybrid vehicle, for example. Selling your car may not be immediately suitable for your circumstances, but it is an option if money is tight or if you wish to take some time to consider your next vehicle. TIP 5: Investigate Tax Incentives Many people are having to reassess their budget. Are there any tax benefits or incentives that you may be entitled to? If you use your car for business, you may be able to claim a company car, or write the car off as a business expense. This is especially worth investigating if you have an environmentally-friendly car such as an electric or hybrid vehicle. TIP 6: Carry Essentials For essential journeys, it can be helpful to have a basic ‘survival kit’ in your car at all times. This might include items such as a mobile phone charger, long-life snacks, and a torch, but could also include more recent essentials such as masks and hand sanitisers. With the simple tips above, you and your car will be prepared for anything!"
18,When to call a tow truck,autos-trucks," It can quickly ruin your day. You're driving down a busy highway, and suddenly your car overheats. Or even worse, you are involved in an accident and your car is disabled. What do you do next? Find a professional, licensed towing service. The cost will range from $75-$125 for a basic short distance tow, but the cost is worth it. If you try to tow your vehicle yourself, you incur the liability associated with it. Also, you run the risk of damaging your vehicle further. Most areas, even rural ones, have at least one 24 hour towing service. These tow trucks can respond to your location and get you and your vehicle to a safe place, including a repair shop. You have the right to have your vehicle towed to the shop of your choice, but keep in mind that most towing companies charge additional money for additional miles. While it may be an additional burden on your pocketbook, hiring a professional towing company is a necessity. It relieves you of any liability arising from the transportation of your vehicle, and also insures that your vehicle will not be damaged further. Most insurance policies include a provision for covering necessary tows."
19,A Fresh Look at Trends and Statistics in the Automotive Aftermarket,autos-trucks," The aftermarket industry has become a huge part of the automotive economic sector. This industry is on the rise, projecting a $722 billion revenue for 2020. Moreover, market emerging trends, technological advances, industry innovation regarding materials, and e-commerce have changed the game for the benefit of the auto parts business. Statistics show that drivers are keeping their vehicles longer. About 45% of 10-year-old cars require expenses of approximately 1000$ or more annually and show good maintenance behavior. Therefore, preventive maintenance services and aftermarket parts represent a growing niche. Consumers are also demanding for precise needs suppliers. Drivers often look for better-looking products, and technology has made a physical address unnecessary for providers. The custom wheels market has changed once the online appearance of them is available now, so the market leaders can change soon. The following are some quick facts and trends regarding the automotive aftermarket industry. Older Vehicles on the Rise Automakers are selling 6% more annually. This represents 17 million new cars and light trucks sold last year. However, this does not mean the aftermarket industry is shrinking.  The U.S. vehicle fleet average is 11 years old. This represents a 17% rise over the last ten years. About 44 million vehicles are between 16 to 24 years old. Vehicle ownership length is on average 60% higher than ten years ago. Moreover, this trend has accelerated significantly over the past years and has no intention to stop. The estimated amount of ownership rise for 12-year-old cars and above is estimated at about 12% during the next few years. Accordingly, vehicles are now a long-lasting asset for owners. This might be a result of vehicle quality improving, and the rising of restoration techniques for aging rides becoming mainstream. As scrappage rates decline, a great market opportunity for profitable aftermarket businesses appears. E-Commerce Revolutionizing Aftermarket To follow a global market tendency, the aftermarket industry is going online. Parts, distributors, and auto services have been updated and transformed by e-commerce. Optimizing their website through new and evergreen content should become a number one priority for these providers. The automotive aftermarket landscape has changed completely. The ever-growing need for parts and services has moved to the digital world. Although the service/seller-side is currently led by repair shops (only 25% of auto repair is performed by dealerships), the bigger segments in the industry are wheels and tire websites. This is a sample of how e-commerce transitioning has had a huge impact on the aftermarket trades. A vital marketing strategy for this type of business is SEO optimization. Four in five consumers use search engines before purchasing. More than half of searchers look at the first links only, so being at the top is the main path to increase sales. SEO has become an integral element of the digital marketing strategy. Targeting is also a very important part of the process. Newer vehicles need a more do-it-for-me (DIFM)-type of repairs and its owners will prefer brick-and-mortar locations. However, older rides can have a do-it-yourself (DIY) approach for both routine maintenance and minor repairs. DIY owners search for better deals, convenience, and home delivery. Therefore, strategies like special discounts and optimization of the website for easy online shopping and appealing content will provide the best experience and increase continued brand loyalty. There is not a single industry unscathed when it comes to the impact of the online giant merchants: Amazon and eBay. The aftermarket is especially affected by them. A clever strategy to make the most of this situation is to move online platforms to their domains and use their marketing influence and distribution networks. Hybrids on the Rise Auto e-Commerce is growing, and automotive technology is changing. Both aftermarket products and services are expected to rise due to the increase of hybrids and electric vehicles. The rise of these types of vehicles over traditional gas-run rides forces the aftermarket industry to develop new methods for repairing their needs. From new injection systems to new breeds of turbochargers, numerous items are required to strengthen these powerplants. Furthermore, those vehicles also require specific services like cylinder deactivation. Offering these will make a significant difference in the marketplace. The emerging digital vehicle technology represents a challenge and opportunity for the aftermarket industry. Hybrids are more efficient vehicles, with fewer gas emissions and better fuel consumption. The possibility of making old rides attain the benefits of electric motors and combustion opens great potential for market penetration. Hybridization or upgrading traditional vehicles to hybrid will reduce the environmental impact of ground vehicles and it will also transform the automotive aftermarket industry. Nonetheless, the complexities of innovation will become another opportunity for the aftermarket industry to keep showing its ability to successfully adjust to change. Moreover, the industry’s future certainly depends on its ability to recognize the trends early. Innovation, adjustment, and making the most of the opportunities presented will leverage strengths and allow for continued success."
20,Does Tuning Increase Fuel Economy?,autos-trucks," ECU and ECU Remapping: The fact is that the sensors, fixed at different points of the car, monitor and regulate the parameters of the car's performance. Ignition timing, airflow, fuel consumptions, crank position, and throttle position are the parameters that determine the performance of a vehicle. These determinants are monitored by sensors, and their report is sent to the Car’s engine management or the Electric Control Unit(ECU). The ECU responds to the information sent by the sensors by improving the performance of the car. Therefore, the computer system in the car takes the track record of the car’s performance and is responsible to regulate it. The ECU remapping or tuning is a process of re-designing, upgrading, or altering with new software in the ECU. Efficient and advanced software nowadays increase horsepower, torque, throat response, and fuel economy. As the ECU is responsible to improve the car's performance, the tuning of ECU is carried out to enhance the process of improving car performance. How Does It Increase Fuel Economy? Fuel economy is different from fuel consumption. Fuel economy is a measure of how many miles does the car covers with a gallon of fuel. To put it simply, it is the measure of mileage. Fuel consumption, on the other hand, is a measure of the fuel that a vehicle consumes to cover a particular distance. Fuel consumption is one of the determinants of car performance, therefore it is monitored by the sensors in the car. The ECU regulates the amount of fuel and air sent to the cylinder. A remapped ECU means that it achieves an improved processing power. Therefore, ECU tuning makes impulsive responses to regulate airflow and fuel consumption. Which in turn, increases the fuel economy. Hence, tuning, maintenance, and clean air flows are prerequisites of fuel economy. ECU Remapping Near Me? If you live in the United Kingdom, it is not very difficult to find ECU or chip remapping services. You can visit a local specialist and he will overwrite ECU with a laptop and that is done. Other Ways of Increasing Fuel Economy: There are other ways of increasing fuel economy along tuning which are as below: 1- Air Conditioning: Air conditioners consume a great amount of the economy. Therefore, refer to opening windows when it is hot outside or wearing warm clothes when it is cold outside rather than using an air conditioner. 2- Heavy Load: The heavy load puts the load on the engine to get going, it consumes more energy to enforce the motion. Thus avoid carrying unnecessary material all around, and make your car light and steady. 3- Avoid Traffic: It is better to plan the trips; it includes picking timings when it is low traffic influx and choosing the right routes to avoid getting ceased away in heavy traffic."

1,What Are the Benefits of Dual Exhausts?,autos-trucks," The exhaust system in the vehicles is a mechanism using which they remove harmful gasses and substances that form in the engine due to the combustion of the fuel. The exhaust system is also responsible to reduce the noise that produces in the engine. Therefore, it can be attributed to the exhaust systems which purify the gas and noise. The exhaust system contains a set of pipes that direct the exhaust from the engine to outside the vehicle. As a rule of thumb, vehicles consisted of one exhaust pipe but, now they can have double or dual exhaust pipes. Vehicles having dual exhaust pipes are considered beneficial for the vehicles themselves. The dual exhausts consist of two exhaust manifolds, two mufflers, two or more catalytic converters, and two exhaust tailpipes. There are many benefits of dual exhaust therefore, Exhaust specialists near me have always instructed me to get them. Some of those benefits, along with giving the vehicle a sporty and aesthetic look, of Dual Exhausts are as follows: 1- Increased Efficiency: Consider a vehicle with more than five cylinders and only one exhaust pipe, with one muffler and one catalytic converter. The cumulative exhaust will then be forced onto one point of escape, and since it is not possible for the exhaust pipe to release all the exhaust at once, it exerts backpressure. It, therefore, robs down the horsepower of the vehicle. But dual exhausts provide double power and channel, which in turn increases the horsepower of the vehicle. When the burnt gasses are released efficiently, the oxygen intake increases, which subsequently increases the performance of the vehicle. 2- Fuel Economy: When the efficiency of the engine is lost, it consumes more energy to produce minimum results. It means that you will have to stop by a fuel station quite frequently after some mileage. But when the vehicle is at its optimum power, it will consume less energy to yield more results. Therefore, it saves the costs of fuel and increases gas mileage. 3- Protects the Engine: The life expectancy of the engine increases with dual exhausts. Because, it helps in maintaining the two determinants; efficiency and temperature. The lower back pressure helps the engine to remain cool and steady. Otherwise, the engine becomes prone to damage when its temperature increases frequently. Also, the efficiency of the engine attained by easy removal of exhaust ensures its maintenance and preservation. 4- Multiple Sound Options: The dual exhausts make a buzzing sound, which is otherwise associated with sports and muscle cars, which means that you can have your very cool and sporty car by just adjusting the dual exhaust in your vehicle. But for people who do not like the roaring sound and have preferred dual exhaust just for the performance, do have the choice of lowering it. The customization options provide you to choose the muffler, depending on which your vehicle makes less or more noise."
2,How do you know if your Car Needs Coolant?,autos-trucks," What is the Coolant? A coolant, scientifically known as the working fluid helps maintain the temperature of the engine to avoid overheating. It runs in the engine's cooling system. It maintains every component at its correct working temperature. Why does a Car need Coolant? A coolant or anti-freeze is necessary for a car to run smoothly. If a car runs out of coolant, it may stop functioning well and cause trouble. The following can be the consequences of running with low or no coolant: The dashboard warning light will go on and the temperature will start to rise. Modern cars have an automatic engine cut-off feature. This will stop the engine and you won’t be able to drive unless the engine cools down. Without engine cut-off, a car may overheat, the coolant will boil up and overflow from the radiator. This may damage other engine parts or in a worse case, seize the engine. The affected parts may include: o	Water Pump o	Engine Gasket o	Piston and Cylinder o	Crankshaft o	Connecting rods If you face any of the above problems and have no options left. Search Cheap Car Service Near me on the web to find someone who can fix your car. How to know if your Car Needs Coolant? Coolant leaks are one of the leading reasons for a car breakdown. Neglecting your car's regular maintenance may create serious troubles and damages. If you need to know when your car needs coolant. Here is a simple 5 step guide to self-maintain your car’s cooling system. Always keep a check on coolant light. If it's on, your coolant level is low, and you need to refill it. Ensure that you always use a coolant in the proper ratio with water. Adding only water will not help at all. Coolants usually come in orange, yellow, or light green colors. If rust appears in the coolant or it shows a red tone. It is time to be alarmed. Rust can get stuck in the engine cooling system and overheat the system. If your car engine produces a sweet smell. It is a sign that the coolant needs replacement. The coolant contains “ethylene glycol”. When it burns, it starts sending off a sweet smell. If you smell the same. Replace the coolant. The heating system of the car is similar to the engine cooling system. The hot coolant passes through the heating core and a small radiator pushes the hot air through vents to heat the car. If your heater stops working or doesn’t function properly. It is a sign that the coolant needs replacement. The worst of all is an overheating car. If your car has reached this stage, then the problem is more serious. Once the engine starts overheating, then the case is beyond just coolant replacement. You should call a technician and get your car fixed as soon as possible. An engine coolant can deteriorate with time. That is why it is necessary to check it frequently. It is one of those important fluids which helps maintain an engine's health and keep the car running smoothly."

8,CAR TUNEUP: WHY IT’S SO IMPORTANT,autos-trucks," Contrary to what some might think, cars are more durable and require less maintenance now than at any point in history. In the Sixties or Seventies, a tuneup was something that came along every 35k or so miles, and meant a mechanic would look at a cars ignition points, spark plugs, plug wires, setting the ignition timing with a strobe light and resetting the idle and mixture on the carburetor. In the Fifties, cars needed even more care; before the advent of oil filters and detergent motor oil, a car’s engine would be fairly worn out and in need of a rebuild by 90k miles! None of that applies anymore. It’s now not unusual for drivers to get 175k or 200k miles out of a car, with the right auto maintenance and care. Tuneups are usually not necessary before 80k or so, but that doesn’t mean they should be neglected. So what does “tuneup” even mean now, anyway? What does it consist of? New spark plugs New spark plug wires New air filter New PCV  valve New O2 sensor, possibly Diagnostic check of engine computer to look for trouble codes Tuneups are still important from the aspect of performance, drivability and emissions, just as they always have been. And once the plugs and plug wires, in particular, get to the point of needing to be replaced by an auto repair shop, you’ll know it – you’ll notice sluggish performance, poor fuel economy, and your engine may begin to misfire and run erratically. Also, if your car’s Check Engine light comes on and stays on, that’s a sure sign…it means that somewhere under the hood, a sensor is sending a reading to your engine computer that is far enough out of parameters that it has recorded a “hard trouble code” that can’t be fixed until the problem is fixed. So…tune-ups may be needed a lot less frequently than they used to be, and they may not involve as many steps as they used to, but that doesn’t mean that they’re something to just blow off!"
9,Understanding If Paintless Dent Repair Could Work for You,autos-trucks," If your vehicle has sustained a dent (large or small), it is possible that paintless dent repair could be a viable option for repair.

Typically, your vehicle will not be a good candidate for this type of repair when the underlying metal has been torn, when sharp edges are embedded in the dent, when the dent has caused the paint to flake away or become scratched, when the location of the dent is close to the edge of the panel, or when the same area has been damaged and repaired previously.

11,What is the difference between a taxi and a chauffeur service?,autos-trucks," Not everyone is familiar with a Chauffeur service. In the United States and Asia, for example, there is a clear distinction between a taxi and a Chauffeur service. Other synonyms for a Chauffeur service are Limousine service, Black car service or Private car service. Generally speaking, a Chauffeur Service uses black luxury vehicles driven by certified professional chauffeurs. Our chauffeurs are trained in driving skills and etiquette in order to perform at the highest level. Whereas taxis often arrive late, a Chauffeur Service will arrive fifteen minutes early in a clean car. While they wait, the chauffeur can prepare for the route ahead and the traffic conditions. All cars come with bottles of water, tissues, peppermints and magazines. The chauffeur maintains a low profile and will only communicate with the guests if desirable. You know the driver and the driver knows you! Unlike a taxi, the aim is to have guests drive by the same drivers as much as possible. Working this way, you know the driver and the driver knows you. The driver is fully aware of any personal wishes, which means that the service must feel safe and trusted. Chauffeur services work with a select group of specially trained professional drivers. In addition to a mandatory chauffeur pass, which most professional drivers in must have, our drivers receive in-depth and periodic driving training. During these courses, drivers are trained in road knowledge, etiquettes and driving skills. The passenger will be in good hands – should something happen. Comfort and tranquility. Chauffeur services generally work with black blinded vehicles, with a choice of eye-catching and unobtrusive luxury. For example, we always guarantee the latest models from Mercedes-Benz, where possible with an extended wheelbase and the highest possible comfort that Mercedes-Benz has to offer. During the ride we offer: bottled water, peppermint, pillows and various charging options for your laptop or cellphone. Good preparation is key! The difference between a taxi and a limousine transport is also reflected in the preparation of each ride. Before departure, all our drivers check the scheduled route for particularities and keep an alternative route as a plan B. Working this way we try to prevent and avoid any form of delay. To provide some insight, this is the professional procedure for an airport transfer: Twenty-four hours before the start of the service, the booker will receive an email containing information about the chauffeur and the vehicle. When the flight arrives, the chauffeur will park their car at the minimum walking distance and wait for the guests near the gate’s exit. When the plane touches down, a text message will be sent with the information and location of the chauffeur. They will be holding an iPad displaying the client’s (company) name. It is also possible to display a logo. Convenience and safety. In the taxi, the meter is started as soon as the guest gets in. With a Chauffeur service, the passenger does not have to worry about any direct payment for the service, we work on an invoice basis. This way, a P.A does not have to worry that guests will be bothered with the inconvenience that payment is required after the ride. Should the guest ever forget / lose something in the car due to any circumstance, our office can always be contacted directly. In general, we can quickly track lost items.

12,Reasons to buy a second hand car than a new one,autos-trucks," The automobile industry is changing and with this, vehicle prices only going up. Technology has evolved andnew cars are getting costlier each year, making it tough for the budget buyers to buy new cars. Also, thanks to the advanced technology, the average life of cars is increasing, which makes investing in used cars a great option. If you are also planning to buy a car, but don’t have the budget to get a new one, we’d like to share some good reasons to buy a used car through a top used car dealers. Save money and upgrade As you are probably aware, it takes less than a minute for a new car to lose 8-10% of its purchase price. So as soon as it comes out of the showroom you start losing money. This means that even if you buy a used car that is just a few days older, you have to pay a lot less than the original value of the car. So, you can save some serious money. In most cases, people consider buying lower models to save money, but you can actually buy a high-end model at a considerably lower amount. Tension free drive Perhaps the most pressing concern forused car buyers is the maintenance of the vehicle. Thisis particularly true when you are buying the used cars for sale through an individual, but when you buy through areputable car dealer, you get complete satisfaction as many of them will offer a maintenance warrantee. Most of the vehicles are carefully examined and repaired by the top professionals in the industry so you can be assured about its mechanical condition, which means you can feel secure when taking your vehicle on longer journeys. Certified used cars with warranty You can see the national growth in sales by focussing on a specific area. If you take the used vehicle industry in Peterborough or Cambridgeshire, you can easily see that it is growing at a rapid pace. It may be slower in other parts of the country but broadly speaking it’s on the rise everywhere. This means that there are a lot of unprofessional dealers taken advantage of a growing market. Make sure you check that you are using a reputable car dealer in Peterborough which means the car is inspected by the professionals who will carefully analyse the condition. Many of the used car dealers are also certified so you can rely upon the quality. Apart from this, you can also get additional post-purchase warranty to ensure that the used car you just bought runs more like a new one! Insurance is cheaper and you need not pay additional charges You would know that the insurance value of the new car is a lot more than what you will pay for a used car. The reason here is that the insurance amount is calculated on the actual value of the vehicle that you drive. This means, you have to pay lesser amount annually for the car insurance while avoiding any kind of additional charges that are likely to be implemented with new vehicles. So, if you are planning to buy a car, think about investing in second hand cars instead of the new ones."
13,What are the different parts of a car?,autos-trucks," What are the different parts of a car? Today, it is essential to know the auto body parts for various reasons, mainly because doing so will allow us to repair the car ourselves if any failure may result in ending up stranded somewhere. On the other hand, understanding a auto body parts can help all those who want to acquire the right vehicle at a reasonable price. Therefore, we will present these parts and their functions so that they can be of help. Parts of an automobile Although mechanical and electric cars are very different, they have one thing in common: they work with other systems inside them. These systems are the ones that allow the ignition of the car and the mobility of it. Understanding these systems is a complicated task; however, knowing them will be very helpful in times of failure. In this way, you will be able to use your knowledge at any time of emergency. On the other hand, having information about the auto body parts will allow you to acquire the vehicle you want, compare models, and even share opinions with the great community that has become fanatical about these cars' advances. For this reason, below, we present the main parts of the smart auto body parts since they are the most acquired models in the market today, mainly thanks to the Tesla car models that have integrated new technology into their systems. 1.Engine All cars have an engine that allows the systems inside the vehicle to come together and work simultaneously. In this case, we can say that electric cars can have one machine or more. It is an aspect that will vary according to the make and model of the car. The motor is the element that will allow converting the energy and recovering it since it works like inverse, and it can be of alternating or direct current. We can also say that this can be of two types: synchronous or asynchronous. In the first case, they are motors that can work as energy generators, while in the last one, it is more or less a type of mechanical engineering. 2.Batteries They work as the power source of these electric cars and characterizes them by being made of lithium. They are one of the essential auto body parts and are of direct current because they require a charger to obtain their energy. The batteries of electric cars are currently one of the smart auto body parts that are to be improved since the objective is to provide them with more autonomy. The battery can last much longer than it currently does. 3.Charger It is the element in charge of obtaining the energy that will go directly to the electric car battery. It needs to transform alternate life into usable continuous power for the whole vehicle. According to the type of electric car and its brand, this charger can be fast or slow. In the case of the Tesla models that handle new technology, their chargers tend to characterize by being fast. 4.Transformers They are the elements in charge of transforming the alternating current that they receive from the charging points to direct current that will store in the car batteries and attend to the cooling of the car to avoid spills or explosions. 5.Drivers As their name indicates, they are elements in charge of verifying, for safety reasons mainly, the vehicle's correct operation. They must be in charge of regulating the energy received by both the vehicle's battery and the engine. These are just some of the main auto body parts of an electric car that works differently from the classic cars we know today but have been taking center stage thanks to all these characteristics. Why choose an electric car? Electric cars have been gaining their place in different markets worldwide, are among the most purchased at present thanks to their performance. However, despite this, there are many people with doubts about their reliability. Therefore, it is essential to know the most that s episode about the smart car parts that come in the electric car presentation and why they are an excellent option to acquire in the markets. Among these reasons, we highlight the following: ?Less contamination Electric cars are an excellent option to reduce pollution in the world, mainly because they do not require the help of gasoline or oils to operate, and we emphasize that they make non-polluting materials. ?Economic savings One of the best-known reasons for acquiring this car is its cost. Unlike automated vehicles, electric vehicles' prices are usually meager and characterized by not needing constant maintenance. In this way, in addition to acquiring a car at a reasonable cost, you will also save money concerning maintenance, as there are very few times when smart car parts need to be changed, so this will not be a concern. ?New technology Many brands, such as Tesla, are combining electric cars with new technology so that whoever acquires these cars will enjoy a unique experience behind the wheel. As for this technology, we can highlight the automatic pilot's option where the car itself will come to life and take you to the place you want to visit. We also highlight the doors that open by themselves with the help of proximity sensors. ?Durability As we mentioned, electric cars do not require constant revision and maintenance, so they are cars that have a great time of durability both in general and in specific parts. https://www.hautopart.com/"

15,Why Dash Cams Are So Popular In Ireland Today,autos-trucks," If you live in Ireland, you may be aware of how popular – cams have become. In fact, there are many countries where these are standard issue in new cars that are sold every day. From the perspective of insurance companies, this is a wonderful way to ensure that you are being told the whole story regarding why an accident has occurred. From the perspective of the person driving, it can also be very helpful. It's a live account of what is happening in your car, ahead of you, at all times. There are other reasons why dash cams are so popular in Ireland. Here are a few that you should know about. The Benefits Of Dash Cams Regardless of where you live, dash cams do play a very significant role. However, their presence in your vehicle can also serve as a distraction. Depending upon whether these are built in the car when you buy it, or if you are needing to install one yourself, their positioning on your dashboard can be problematic. The benefits include being able to record everything that is happening to you when you are driving. If you ever have an accident, you certainly want to have these on. It can also help you in terms of people trying to break into your vehicle. They can be designed to record not only what is happening outside of the car, but also who is in the car providing you with information that you need to file charges. Drawbacks Of Dash Cams A few problems that you may have with the dash cam is that it is in the way and it might be too large. For example, you could be easily distracted by looking at your dash cam as you are driving along. Instead of just recording an accident, you may discover that it is causing you to be on the wrong portion of the road. You may end up hitting a car, or somebody going across the street, simply because you are not paying attention. The other problem is that they may not be positioned in the right spot, if you do this yourself, to properly capture the video that you need. Why Do The Irish Like Dash Cams The Irish enjoy using these cameras because they serve a very necessary purpose. If you are the person driving the vehicle, or if you are park your car somewhere, they can record everything around you and sometimes in the car. This helps with proving that someone has broken in which you will need to show your insurance company. From the insurance company's perspective, it's very similar. They want to know exactly what has happened so that, when you have filed the claim, they will know that they are paying out money for an actual incident. This overview of why dash cams are so important to the Irish should motivate you to get one if you do not have one already. If you are visiting Ireland, you will likely have one of these in your rental car, and they can be very helpful. As long as they are positioned properly, they should not prove to be distracting, although those that you install, perhaps hanging from your rearview mirror, could become a distraction in and of themselves. This information should be helpful in understanding why they are becoming more popular today in Ireland than ever before."
16,Cleaning Your Rv Protects Your Asset,autos-trucks," Rv cleaning is one of the last jobs on my to-do list. Even so, having said that, overlooking this job can be a costly decision. We clean our costly cars. They are all overpriced nowadays. But often we simply cannot make ourselves start with the cleanup process that is so valuable on our expensive motor home or travel trailer. We see the job as overwhelming. Here is a thought, break up the cleaning course of action just a little. There is nothing at all that states you need to clean it all in merely one day. Start off using a good rinse up outside. If needed, wax the camper another time. Afterward, you are left completing the inside clean up. Usually, a couple of hours will take care of every little thing that is essential there. It is possible to do that when you possess spots of time to do whatever is required on the inside. Now, let’s get to work on the outside. First, having all of the products and cleaning equipment, already arranged, could be helpful. Walking back and forth looking for cleaning items is frustrating. One thing, one can get to help in doing so is a bucket taxis. You might also simply use a 4 wheel carrier or a wagon. Wash down the exterior, starting with the top, using a high-pressure hose to eliminate any hefty dirt or dust. Next, follow with a large bucket of water with mild cleaning soap, employing a soft brush to remove the remaining dirt. Using an extension arm with the brush could move along the cleaning procedure. Climbing up and straight down a ladder is not the way to head here. You are much less likely to have an incident in this course of action by using the extension pole for cleaning the sides. For the difficult places to get to, use the hand glove rag. A shammy towel can be an excellent alternative for drying the camper. As for the tires, there are many products for wheel and tire cleaning. Be mindful that some tire manufacturers will not warrant most sidewall damage. They deem the sidewall breakdown to be a non-warranty item simply because some cleaning products may result in the sidewalls to crack. I perceive this from personal experience. These folks indicate soap and h2o for cleansing. We washed and dried the exterior. Now, it is possible to take a timeout, an escape or if you are so inclined, move on to the wax job, if required. I suggest waxing, minimum, once each year to improve in protecting the finish. Remember, you can schedule the wax job for another day. Next, to the inside, you can do this as time allows. Wipe down the fridge, the microwave oven, the stove, and check the filter in the vent-a-hood and the AC return. It may require cleaning or replacing. Vacuum clean the furniture and the carpet. Mop the remaining floors. Cleanse down the walls, home windows, and every little thing remaining which may have been overlooked. You’ve finished and you have just added to the value and condition of the travel trailer for many years to come. Segmented intervals of cleaning are the trick for cleaning your investment. There are a lot of solutions available to assist with the cleaning. Check out Wal-mart and Surf City for a few I’ve mentioned. Your local Rv seller can also provide supplies and advice for which you may need."
17,5 Things That Really Makes a Truck Good for Off-Roading,autos-trucks," It's Everything You Need to Know about Traction The very first and also essential point you can do to gain grip off-road is make use of a good collection of all-terrain or mud-terrain tires, and also run those at an ideal pressure. These are created to hold surfaces like sand, rocks, damp lawn, or mud, whereas road tires are just developed to grip pavement. The right tires for the task likewise aid supply traction while braking and also catching, which the remainder of the systems we'll state below can not, making such tires much more important. But which tires should you choose? If you drive a hefty body-on-frame vehicle, after that it's hard to do much better than the BF Goodrich All-Terrain K02s. Not only do they offer excellent grasp off-road, but they continue to be sensibly hospitable on-road, also. However K02s are created especially for those large vehicles. So if you drive a lighter unibody crossover, you'll gain from running a lighter tire, like the Cooper Detector A/T3 4S, which offers a lot of the hold and also slit resistance of the K02 in a much more civil package. Vehicles can after that be outfitted with systems developed to make use of the grip provided by those tires. The most evident is 4x4 (4WD or 4x4). When you have good on-road hold, your front and back axles need to rotate at different rates when you walk around edges. When you change into 4WD, the differential that allows those axles to spin at various rates is shut, locking their speeds together. This doubles your automobile's capacity to capitalize on the hold achieved by your tires. In addition to the facility differential that 4WD locks, a lorry can likewise be equipped with securing differentials on one or both axles. Very same deal: your within as well as outdoors wheels require to rotate at different speeds to securely navigate on-road corners. By securing the speeds of the left as well as appropriate wheels on an axle with each other, you're guaranteeing that the power being sent out to that axle needs to revolve both wheels at equivalent rates as opposed to sending all the power to the wheel with the least traction. In the great old days, it made use of to remain that basic. However after that all-wheel drive (AWD) was designed, and also truck manufacturers realized that they can utilize it as an advertising and marketing device to perplex and upsell unintentional truck buyers on a technology they didn't comprehend. These days you see 4x4 badges on AWD vehicles and AWD badges on trucks that are practically fitted with 4WD. Including in the complication, the ability of AWD systems differs extremely, and commonly the manufacturers of AWD autos are absolutely unable to communicate the methods which their systems differ. I'm most likely to attempt an incredibly simplified explanation of all this, in order to cultivate a standard understanding of how AWD jobs (or doesn't, which is generally the concern below). Torque complies with the path of least resistance within a drive system, so in an AWD automobile with three completely open differentials, all that torque will certainly be sent out to the wheel that's spinning fastest. That's the wheel with the least grip, the one that's stuck in mud, snow, or sand. Does not seem awfully practical, does it? It's not, which is why makers fit several AWD autos with a facility differential efficient in attaining some degree of lock, which then guides power to both axles. Some high-performance AWD autos will also be fitted with some sort of axle differential which can also attain some degree of lock, additional enhancing its capacity to make the most of your tires. Your takeaway: Tires are the easiest and also most efficient means to enhance your vehicle's capacity off-road, regardless of what you drive. AWD can not use the same capacities as 4WD, yet you can't rely on marketing products to figure out which system an automobile may be fitted with. Just 4WD trucks with securing diffs on both the front and also rear can accomplishing maximum traction off-road. What Your Truck Can or Can't Make It Over Off-road, these numbers are a lot more essential than horse power. They must be your main points of contrast between automobiles. For the functions of this short article, allow's approve that we're quantifying an automobile's ability off-road by its ability to prevent getting stuck. Nine times out of 10, you're going to obtain stuck due to the fact that you lose traction. In unusual scenarios, you might obtain stuck or locate on your own unable to take on an obstacle since you don't have the clearance to do so. Clearance is an additional metric that obtains extremely obfuscated by advertising. It prevails to see a truck's ground clearance marketed, but when you consider it, outright ground clearance winds up being quite unimportant. Think of the last time you hiked a tough trail: was it little rocks in the middle of the trail that presented the most challenge, or was it the larger rocks you had to climb up, over, and also down? It's your automobile's technique, break over, and also separation angles, not its straight-out ground clearance, that provide it the capacity to get rid of large obstacles. Approach is the angle between your front tires and the lowest point on your truck in front of them. Break over is the angle from the bottom of either your front or rear tires to where the opposite tire fulfills the most affordable factor on your truck. Separation is the angle from the bottom of your back tire to the most affordable point behind it. In all situations, larger angles are better. Automobile firms love to promote ground clearance, due to the fact that crossovers with independent suspension usually return a lot more outstanding numbers than associate solid axles. Without a big steel pole running in between wheel hubs, I make sure you can see why, if tire sizes coincide, a vehicle with independent suspension may have far better ground clearance. However simply by placing a tire onto a barrier, the supposed advantage of ground clearance is made moot. The simplest method to improve your lorry's angles is by suitable it with bigger tires and the taller suspension required to remove them. You may additionally have the ability to remove bodywork or devices like bumpers and also side steps as well as change them with even more off-road-oriented items. Yet some innate angle benefits are baked right into particular sorts of lorries. A two-door Jeep Wrangler, as an example, with its extremely brief wheelbase, will naturally accomplish a far better breakover angle than its longer, four-door choice. A vehicle with really brief front and rear overhangs will naturally have premium technique as well as departure angles to one with longer overhangs. Your takeaway: Never lift an AWD crossover like a Subaru. Their angles are so bad that you can not really boost them, and also whatever tiny rise in ground clearance a lift internet you will certainly attain only a destroyed flight, dealing with, and also fuel economy. If you're serious about enhancing the capability of a 4WD truck, then starting with a vehicle that has excellent angles to begin with will be much easier as well as more reliable than trying to lift an as well long vehicle right into the skies. Best of luck getting a Sprinter van down anything but a very easy dirt roadway. Gearing Does the Effort Off road Equipment multiply the influence an engine has more than the wheels. The lower the gearing, the extra the multiplication. Extremely reduced tailoring is just how you make it up really high barriers and additionally just how you descend them with control and also security. To achieve these extremely reduced gears while maintaining the ability to efficiently drive on-road, any type of good 4WD truck will feature a low-range transfer situation which switches between normal and very reduced gearing. Gears on your vehicle job much like they do on your bike. Throw either right into its dana equipment as well as the tailoring makes climbs simple. The only actual difference is that low-range tailoring on a truck makes it feasible to use engine braking to manage your rate on descents. Compared to your brakes, this doesn't create your suspension to dive, and also it spreads out the grip requirements for controlling your speed throughout all 4 wheels. With each other, those capabilities increase safety and security and also control. What Regarding Articulation? Expression is the capability of a wheel to travel up or down about the wheel on the opposite side of the vehicle. Over uneven challenges, an excellent amount of expression will help you maintain as lots of wheels as possible in contact with ground, which helps make the most of grip, which you need for both capacity and security. Having stated that, extreme degrees of articulation aren't truly essential for basic off-road traveling as well as are mainly appropriate to individuals playing in off-road parks. If you're mostly interested in receiving from A to B, after that discovering to take on barriers with as perpendicular a line of traveling as possible will get you additionally than driving a truck with severe expression ever will. Your Takeaway: Worry about traction tools and your driving abilities long prior to you stress over putting a wheel up on a concrete roadway obstacle for an Instagram article. What Types of Modern Electronics You Can and Can't Aid With Along with essential on-road safety help like security and traction control, all type of electronic systems are currently advertising enhanced off-road capabilities. Software application is much cheaper and less complicated to develop as well as replicate than mechanical elements, as well as truck manufacturers must significantly fret about the obligation developed by inexperienced drivers utilizing their vehicles to do points they're advertised as being capable of doing. Since modern-day automobiles currently featured the capability to keep an eye on specific wheel speeds and also control them with individual brake applications, it's fairly easy for truck manufacturers to extrapolate that into the capability to replicate the function of securing differentials. Additionally, with technologies like drive-by-wire strangles, truck makers are able to use genuinely dynamic switchable driving settings, which tailor a truck's performance to a wide range of conditions a motorist might face. Whereas in the current past, ""snow setting"" might have just started the auto out in 2nd gear and made sure traction control was turned on, now it might immediately switch in and also out of 4WD as on-the-fly traction conditions determine while actuating individual brakes, not only to keep the vehicle aimed straight ahead however additionally to increase via a variety of slippery circumstances. In addition to that, both Ford as well as Toyota supply semi-autonomous off-road driving systems, which can take several of the skill out of brake as well as throttle applications while crossing hard challenges and instantly actuating all of the features described above. Having said all that, none of this provides any type of extra mechanical capacity beyond that created by securing differentials, low-range tailoring, and good tires. It just makes the experience much easier. Your Takeaway: Congrats, your elegant new vehicle just gifted you with the ability to obtain stuck even additionally from sidewalk than ever before. If you plan to drive off-road consistently, take the time to find out the needed abilities to do so securely. What You Should to Adjust More than any type of various other usage instance for trucks, taking a trip off-road requires as well as awards aftermarket alteration. Actually, for many serious customers, a supply vehicle is only checked out for its benefits as a platform for modification instead of for its capabilities in stock type. Tires: The first upgrade anybody need to make. Simply a great set of all-terrains alone will certainly improve the capacity of any automobile, be it a 4WD truck or a Humvee. Increasing the dimension of the tire will certainly increase the height of obstacles it can surrender, however will reduce your effective gear ratio while adding unsprung mass, which harms your automobile's ride quality, acceleration, gas economic situation, and stopping. Suspension: If you want to considerably enhance the dimension of your tires, you'll need to fit taller suspension in order to remove them. Aftermarket suspension can additionally come with much higher-quality elements, which can return much of your supply lorry's flight quality as well as improve its capability to take care of the harsher conditions suspension deals with off-road. Differentials: Adding securing differentials to one or both axles will boost your lorry's capacity to make use of the hold provided by your tires. Gearing: If you fit larger tires, you will certainly require to change your differential equipment in order to return efficiency, gas economic situation, and control. Protection: If you want to take full advantage of your automobile's angles, after that you're going to wish to protect the bodywork. Off-road bumpers provide defense from bumps as well as scrapes while offering you the capacity to place devices like winches, lights, and tire carriers. Rock sliders install to the framework under your doors, protecting your truck's body. Recovery Gear: Off-road, you'll be taking a trip via unforeseeable problems a lengthy method from aid. Tools like a winch, irons, a take strap, and also healing boards should be considered important; they're what enable you to obtain unstuck without hiking out to look for aid. Lights: It behaves to be able to see where you're going at evening, as well as supply tools is no suit for the crazy levels of illumination that are readily available in the aftermarket. Your Takeaway: Well-chosen modifications can add significant off-road ability yet will nearly universally lower on-road economic climate and convenience. Pick elements as component of a cohesive build, taking into account what you genuinely need the vehicle to be able to do. An adventure mobile that's horrible to drive when driving is one you won't enjoy making use of. There is no magic pixie dust or advertising lingo that can transform exactly how any of this jobs. So, when you're looking for a brand-new adventure mobile, remember this post. It's my honest hope that this understanding can aid you make even more educated options"

19,Import Your Car To Spain,autos-trucks," Importing your car to Spain If you have Googled importing your car to Spain then you are doing the right thing. The time is ticking on Brexit and after the Brexit clock chimes zero you will not be able to have the same privileges you had to import a car UK into Spain. Basically, it would be borderline as to whether just to sell your UK car and buy a Spanish one instead of importing a car to Spain. Prices for putting your car onto Spanish plates as we speak are in most cases with importing your car your Spain, worth it. After Brexit, this will not be the case. So, let's talk about the present, about the ability and the process involved in importing your car to Spain and getting your car registered onto Spanish registration plates.  The first steps to register a car in Spain The first steps are to make contact. Thereafter we can help establish what will be involved in getting the car onto Spanish plates.

If not great, of so we can get the lights for you and fit them for a nominal cost. We then check the vehicle details, logbook (v5) or equivalent, VIN number, doors, modifications (if any) and a few other bits and bats including the reg plate. From that, we can give you a totally free quote of what all the taxes will be to the DGT and other associated bodies (taxes basically) then our fee to do absolutely everything for you. That includes licking up the car and taking it through the Spanish ITV (MOT) Centre. Dealing with all the paperwork and getting your Spanish reg plates delivered. Putting a car through the Spanish ITV centre Don't worry about this we do it for you. We can meet you there and take your car through or we can collect your car (if local) and we will take it through and drop it back off with you. If you would prefer this service and you live far from the ITV centre we will add a nominal fee to collect and drop the car back off. What if the car fails the ITV test? No probs, we have garages and mechanics on hand to help you get the necessary repairs done to enable a pass. We do not make money from the repairs at the garage you pay the price it costs only. Also, these are mechanics that we know and trust which is very valuable in Spain. We will take the car for you hence you will get a proper price if you understand where we are coming from. There are unfortunately a lot of unscrupulous garages in Spain. There are equally some good ones and these are the ones we know and trust.

How do I insure the Car? Through companies here in Spain we recommend getting several quotes but Abbetgate insurance in Casares / Estepona. Insurance is Spain is not paid monthly but tends to be cheaper than the UK. You in almost all cases pay the whole year upfront when importing your car to Spain. Some might let you pay over two months. The insurance tends to be cheaper as the claim culture is not the same in the UK as Spain. And also, minor scratches and dents referred to in Spain as ""Spanish kisses"" are tolerated and actually expected. In the UK a scratch is doomsday here it is normal hence not as many claims are registered. Driving on the Spanish roads Not that bigger deal really, you will definitely get other drivers blowing their horn at you bt in Spain this is more of a ""hey I'm here"" type gesture than ""I want to run you off the road"" gesture. Don't be too alarmed with this. Take your time to relax and take in the amazing Spanish scenery. Obviously the Spanish drive on the right-hand side of the road hence it differs to the UK. Roundabouts work differently so please do swat up on the correct way to exit. However, once the first nerves are out of the way you will be fine. Avoid busy towns and cities until you used to the rules of the road. What documents do I need in the Car? At all times, copy of your passport, accident report form that all collisions need to fill in at the scene by both parties, and your insurance documents. It doesn't hurt to have absolutely everything related to the car in a folder in case you get pulled over by the police. How long does the process take? From start to finish probably a month if all goes okay. The bulk of the wait to get your car on Spanish reg plates is waiting for your appointment at the ITV centre.

Did you know, uncontaminated air flowing freely into the combustion chamber of your engine makes your engine run cleaner and effectively, and use less gas? The recommended time you should change your car’s filter is once a year, or every 20,000 kilometres. Take note of warning lights Your car has warning signs that indicate when we need to alter something within your car, such as add oil. Every so often, check the symbols that light up around your speedometer.  These could include a brake warning light, check engine light, coolant warning light, ABS warning light, service engine light, electrical fuel light and oil warning light. Remember what each warning means and what actions you need to take when you notice them light up. Some signs won’t need immediate attention but others require you to pull over, such as the coolant warning light. This means your car engine is overheating and if you don’t turn the car off to let it cool down, you could cause permanent damage. Car repair service To enable your car with a long, healthy life, you need to take your car to a car repair service when things seem strange.

1,Beginners guide to engine terms,autos-trucks," Metal spraying and refurbishment Damaged metal doesn’t always result in the need to buy a whole new engine. With modern technology, even hopeless pieces can become revived and as good as new. Not only can the metal look revolutionised, but it’s working order can be dramatically improved. Engine parts You may need new parts because your old ones just aren’t doing the job anymore. Or you want to refurbish a specific engine for a different purpose or vehicle. Either way, engine parts can be altered to essentially create a whole new engine, as a whole. That is, you kept older parts and added new parts, which make for a different engine. There’s no need to worry about the expense of purchasing a whole new engine, when you can rejig your current engine. Piston rings If you’re new to the engine game, you may be wondering what a piston ring actually is. Well, a piston ring is essentially a split ring made of metal which is designed to assist with a number of functions. These include sealing the combustion chamber, balancing the amount of oil between the cylinder and piston, improving heat transfer as well as regulating the engine oil. Each piston ring is specialised for different purposes and similar to most products, there are different levels of quality available. Cylinder blocks As the name suggests, a cylinder block holds the cylinder as well as coolant passages and cylinder sleeves. The purpose of the cylinder is to allow a space through which the piston can travel. The piston moves towards the energy created by the air and fuel mixture in the combustion chamber. With air-cooled engines, cylinder walls are exposed to airflow, so that the engine can be cooled, and not overheat. As you can see, each engine part has crucial elements needed to be in working order for the engine to work efficiently. Crankshaft A crankshaft probably sounds like an unfamiliar territory. It is, in simple terms, a moving part of the internal combustion engine, otherwise known as the ICE. Primarily, its function is to ensure the piston moves in a rotational direction as opposed to linear. Connecting rods are what join the crankshaft to the piston. The crankshaft wears down over a period of time, and when the space between the crank and the bearings isn’t quite up to scratch, oil pressure will decrease and lubricity lessens. Fortunately, your local diesel reconditioning specialists can grind it down for you. Chemical cleaning Another back-to-basics element of engines is the need for chemical cleaning. To sum it up, oil moves around within the engine - pair this with the existence of heat and you’ve got yourself a build up of carbon deposit. This deposit can affect the flow of oil inside the engine. So, the best way to diminish this is by cleaning the engine, and experts advise chemical cleaning for this. Engine crack testing While this may seem dodgy at first, crack testing is simply testing undertaken to check if any parts have cracks. When engine parts crack, it has flow on negative effects. For instance, when an engine block cracks, you’ll consequently have low engine compression and then a lock of combustion pressure. The negative impacts are a poorly performing engine, and a rough idle, which may need to be replaced. Now you know general engine terms and purposes, we’d recommend you learn signs of faulty parts. From there, if something doesn't seem right with your engine, it’s not your job to instantly know what’s wrong and how to fix it. Diesel reconditioning specialists can check your engine and establish the next steps."

4,Why A Prebooked Airport Or Cruise Port Transfer Can Be The Best Option For You?,autos-trucks," Whether you are an individual traveler who is eagerly awaiting their well-deserved holiday to start or a business traveler focusing on closing that important deal, most likely you will need a transfer option from the airport to your destination. Every airport or port has different options when it comes to transfer to the city. It can be private or public bus/minibus service, trains, taxis and alternate ways of transfer, such as limousine service and various kinds of popular ride-hailing apps. In this article I will discuss why limousine service is the best way for airport or cruise port transfers. f you are a traveler on a shoestring budget, this piece is probably not for you. In all likelihood, a public bus will be your best choice when it comes to transfer in that case. Trains are often more expensive than buses but can be faster as well. This piece is for people who treat their time and money equally and also know how important it is to eliminate stress whenever you can. Prebooked limousine service offers exactly that. It is like your private jet but on the road and with a price almost anyone can afford. Additionally, it removes the worry out of your transfer service needs. Premium limo services need to deliver a certain set of standards and one of those include waiting time. Even if your flight is late or you are spending too much time waiting for your luggage or going through customs, your driver will be waiting for you. They will usually be waiting from 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the airport. The act itself will give you a certain peace of mind. Then when the sliding doors open and you see a big crowd, it is incredibly nice to see someone who is waiting for you with your name on the board. You don’t know that person, but somehow they are not a stranger to you. Another peace of mind is that you know the price of your airport transfer in advance. If you agreed that the price will be 50 euros, it will be 50 euros. It is like booking a hotel. You get a price quote. And you will pay it if you like it. It is that simple. Imagine going to a hotel where you won’t know how much you will have to pay until your departure. Nobody would like to have that experience with hotels and many people have that experience with taxis. For a limo service, it doesn’t matter whether there will be a traffic jam because of the peak hours or a traffic accident. The only transfer option that can be compared to limousine service is taxi or some of the ride-hailing apps. One of the biggest myths is that limousine service is only for the rich people, which is far from the truth. Initially, taxis are slightly cheaper, but eventually they can appear to be much more expensive. It is like comparing budget hotels to all inclusive ones. When it comes to all-inclusive hotels, you can even leave your wallet/credit card at home, whereas for budget hotels, you will pay much less in the beginning, but end up paying an amount similar to the one for an all-inclusive package, after you calculate all the expenses. And with much more hassle. If you take a cab, in many places your driver will be able to use a dedicated taxi lane which is also used by public transportation and, therefore, avoid possible traffic jams. However, there are many horror stories with taxi drivers ripping off foreigners. And you cannot do much about it. Ride-hailing apps, in comparison to old school taxis, can be a better solution because it is less possible that they will make the journey longer, as the route is monitored by the app. Their drivers are rated after each trip so they can be more easily punished or banned from using the platform if they cheat. More often than not, it applies only in theory. Nevertheless, if you get into a traffic jam, your bill can get significantly higher than planned. Not to mention if you land during the peak hours and use a ride-hailing app that usually has a so called ’’surge pricing’’. In that case, their standard rates can get 1.5–2 or even 3 times more expensive, which is dictated by the market-demand conditions. Another possible stress for you when ordering a ride through a popular ride-hailing app is that you need a mobile Internet, and in many cases in a new country you don’t have it immediately upon (your) landing. Yet, no matter if you choose a taxi or a ride-hailing app most likely you won’t get the vehicle (or service) that you will get with a limousine service. With a limo service, you will know the name of the driver ahead of time, the license plates and the (exact) car model that will transfer you, it usually being the Mercedes-Benz S-Class or E-Class. In US it usually being models like Lincoln Continental, Cadillac XTS, Cadillac Escalade ESV and Chevrolet Suburban. With a taxi service, you often have little or no choice, and in many places you will get the first taxi vehicle waiting in line, like it or not. Likewise, with a ride-hailing app you will know those details only after you have placed your order. Remember that we have mentioned above a set of standards in limousine service? One of the standards is refreshment that will wait for you next to your seat. It can be very useful , especially on a hot day. The limousine driver, besides the fact that they are always dressed in a suit, has other manners, like knowing when to talk, when not to talk, and how to give you valuable insights about the city. Whether it means they recommend a good shop, restaurant, or place to visit not on the A-list of tourist attractions, the chauffeur will gladly provide you with necessary assistance and be at your disposal. I hope you have realized why limousine transportation service can be the best option for you. The first impression of the city usually starts from the moment you leave the airport. When choosing your transportation partner, I highly recommend that you choose the ones that have an international footprint. If they are present in many cities and countries, if they are in the business for more than 10 years, have good reviews, and their quotes are the best, you will make a good choice and have a carefree trip."

8,What are the different types of car liability insurance?,autos-trucks," Car insurance can provide a wide variety of differing levels of cover, but the most essential for everyone is what it provides by way of liability insurance. So essential is this for most people, that there is likely to some legal requirement where the person lives that they have at least some liability insurance in place for any vehicle driven on a public road or highway. Where there can be some confusion, and often difficulty, is the level of cover needed, and who or what it actually covers in the event of a claim or an accident. It can sometimes seem a slightly difficult maze to navigate, but is crucially important as it can have literally life changing effects for everyone involved if the insured gets it wrong. The first thing to do is to understand the different types of liability insurance that exist. This can be slightly complicated in itself because different insurance companies and different countries will sometimes use different terminology. What is important is that the terminology is read and understood as to what it means, both to comply with any legal requirements and to make sure there is adequate insurance coverage available. Third-party liability is a phrase often used in car insurance, and it will cover all types of liability insurance. In car insurance, it is important to understand that third-party liability may or may not include passengers in the car, depending upon any exclusions or restrictions placed on the policy. Third-party liability is intended to cover people and property that the insured vehicle may come into contact with and cause damage to or loss of life to. The policy should include passengers in the insured's car as well, but this is something that should be checked to make sure. Third-party liability is a general catchall phrase, and unless specifically defined otherwise should include both property and person. Often the insurance company will make a distinction between people and property, and provide different levels of cover for each sectio.  Quite often, there is a legal requirement for specific amounts for both these areas of insurance, and the insured should make sure that the legal requirements are complied with. Over and above that, people often wonder what is the most cover that they can or should obtain in terms of liability insurance. The short answer is that they should obtain as much they can afford. This is an area where cutting costs or cutting corners is really not advisable, as the long-term effect can be devastating for everyone involved. Insurance policies will normally specify tpl as third-party liability or policies relating to physical damage or bodily injury. The third-party liability amount should cover both these areas but it is important to check this is the case. It is also important to mention that in the event of any accident or claim, that the insured does not admit liability by way of saying that they admit fault or they were in the wrong in any particular area. This might seem slightly obvious, but when an accident happens people often feel quite guilty about their driving, even if they were not the cause of the accident or they had not done anything wrong. People often want to make a bad situation better and will sometimes say things in order to try and do this. This can be quite dangerous, as admitting liability in the event of an accident can be in breach of a condition of the insurance policy. Whilst this would be quite a harsh interpretation by the insurance company, it does leave the policyholder open to the potential denial of the claim, and to the insurance company denying any liability and voiding their responsibilities to pay any future settlement."
9,Car insurance and the importance of the proposal form,autos-trucks," The transition from paper to digital hat in many ways changed both the format and the understanding of what a proposal form is in the context of car insurance. Pre internet, people would have to fill in a proposal form in order to obtain car insurance, often having been given a verbal quote first of all. Nowadays, insurance companies have pushed the whole mechanism of obtaining car insurance online, and people had to fill in a significant amount of information, often over several screens, in order to obtain a car insurance quotation, and obtain cover itself. The difference, is that many people often think of the online questions as more of a questionnaire, rather than as a legal document, which in effect is what it is. It is worth understanding the context of a proposal form, whether it be in paper or digital format, given that any wrong or misinformation can invalidate the insurance policy, and allow the insurance company to deny any liability in paying future claims. A proposal form is the basis on which the insurance company obtains information on a potential customer, that allows them to assess a risk, and decide whether or not to agree to insure them, and if so, on what terms and conditions and at what cost. The proposal form will include a number of questions designed to elicit the information that the insurance company feels it needs to know in order to assess the risk. What is often not understood about a proposal form, is that the potential customer has an obligation to disclose any information that might be relevant to the insurance company in order to make this assessment. This is irrespective of whether or not there are any questions that cover the information. This principle in insurance terms is known as utmost good faith. It puts the onus on the potential customer to disclose all information that an insurance company might reasonably expect to be relevant. A proposal form will often have several parts to it, with several sub-sections depending on particular answers. One obvious example would be that of motoring convictions. If the question is asked whether or not the insured has any prior motoring convictions, it will normally be a simple yes or no answer to begin with. If the answer is no, then the insured goes on to another question. If the answer is yes then there is normally space for the insured to give details of what these convictions were. This is a fairly obvious example of where the information is important for the insurance company to have full and frank details. If the prospective customer or insured gives wrong information, or misleading information, it can affect the judgement of the insurance underwriter. Previous convictions can be a good indicator of someones attitude to driving and any restrictions placed upon them, such as speed limits. Some people will give false information in the hope that they will not be found at, although this is a dangerous and risky premise. Normally people will give the wrong information either because they don't remember things accurately, or they feel that some information is too old or out of date to be relevant. Again this is risky, because it can invalidate their policy. One thing that is worth remembering is that insurance companies will normally only check the details given in the proposal form when there is a need for the insured to make a claim on the policy. If no claim is made, the insurance company will normally not bother. If a claim is made, then they will check  if all the information on the written proposal form was accurate, and if not, it may well give them an opportunity to deny the claim and deny any liability under the terms of the policy."
10,Car insurance – what rating factors are most important,autos-trucks," Any individual who has had to purchase car insurance may well have discovered huge discrepancies in the various quotations they are asked by different insurance companies. This has historically always been the case to an extent, but even more so given the rise of cost comparison sites online. It is perfectly possible to go to one of the major sites, enter your details and obtain up to 50 or so different quotations. It is not uncommon for these quotations to be anywhere between 200 and 2000 percent different from top to bottom of the scale. It is often assumed that all insurance companies assess risk in pretty much the same way. This is true to an extent, depending upon how much data they have, and what their experience of risk underwriting is. Different insurance companies will have different levels of expertise in certain geographical areas, regarding certain makes of car and certain individual age groups and demographics. This experience will influence their understanding of risk, and may differ widely from other insurance companies will have more on this experience in these areas. Rating a risk is not simply a mathematical formula, although in theory this is what it is based on. Whilst an insurance company will assess a risk based on their own criteria, and then load it by a small margin to make it profitable, this is only half the story. There has always been a theory and a practice as to how insurance companies rate risks. The theory is that they will evaluate a risk, essentially into a percentage figure, which is what they charge as a premium. In reality, it is also very much about what they can charge, or get away with, in order to win the business and make money out of it. This has intensified hugely the transition to lots of car insurance being done online, where it is considerably easier for the insurance companies to link it to other types of insurance, and to various utility billing accounts, credit cards or loan financing. This means that insurance companies can make strategic alliances with other companies in order to obtain business which is to their mutual benefit. Insurance companies will often undercut each other in a way that a lot of businesses will in order to attract customers, and hope that customer retention over time will allow them both to increase their premiums and keep the business without customers moving elsewhere. Whilst that is a fairly basic principle of how insurance companies work, it is much harder to do it online, it was much simpler by paper. It is very easy a customer to switch insurance companies nowadays, and this has certainly eroded a lot of the loyalty felt to companies previously. The other important factor is that insurance companies make a lot of their profits from investing premiums, as opposed from pure underwriting profits. With most types of insurance, premiums are paid up front and claims paid much later on. With car insurance, the really big claims tend to be liability claims, which are notoriously difficult to settle, and normally take several years to agree upon. This isn't necessarily insurancers dragging their feet, although this can happen. With liability claims, it often takes a very long time to really assess damage caused to an individual, and how that damage has impacted on their lives, and in what ways. What this also means is that for that for a period of time the insurancer by and large will not have to settle a claim. They might make an interim payment, but that would normally be at their discretion. This means that  companies can hang onto the premiums for quite a long period of time, before any claims have to be paid.

On the other hand, if your car’s negative equity exceeds $1,000, you can consider adding it your next loan. Just make sure to do your homework otherwise you can get trapped in the vicious cycle of increasing debt. The best idea is to avoid buying a vehicle as long as you become capable enough to pay your loan. It’s a smart way to shift your loan from negative equity zone to positive equity. In conclusion Always keep in mind to check with your dealer if the current debt has been cleared. Don’t forget it’s you have taken loan from the lender not the dealership. If you ignore it or the dealer fail to make outstanding payment on time, then it can damage your credit score."

The last thing you want is to be stranded on the side of the road, with a car that won’t start, a smoking engine, or a broken fan belt.  While these vehicle breakdowns are certainly a nuisance under normal circumstances, during the Coronavirus pandemic,  it could potentially have much more serious implications. The last thing you want is to have to call road-side assistance or a towing company.  Remember, we are trying to avoid being around others as much as possible.  This is not a time that you want to have to hitch a ride in the cab of a tow truck, stand around in a car mechanic’s repair garage, or be without a vehicle in case of emergencies. If you do have to leave your vehicle with a car mechanic, make sure they are doing everything possible to disinfect the interior of the vehicle before it leaves the shop and you hop back in your car or truck.   When you do pick up your vehicle, be sure to take disinfectant wipes and wipe down EVERYTHING! •         Interior and exterior car door handles. •         Steering wheel •         Blinker controls •         Gear shift •         Radio Controls •         Armrests •         Center console release handle •         Dashboard •         Air Vents and A/C controls •         Hood release handle Don’t forget to wipe down the areas in the backseat as well!

Explain why these things are important for any car owner to know how to do.   If the weather is nice, get the family out in your driveway and have a carwash party.  Your car will thank you and the time together with your family will create a great memory of sticking together during these scary times."
14,Useful Tips To Know When Installing And Removing A Car Battery,autos-trucks," Modern cars and heavy vehicles are equipped with high quality and innovative electronic components. The electrical circuits that are connected to the on-board computers are connected to ABS braking systems, airbag control, and systems responsible for controlling road safety. This requires different approaches for battery installation and disassembly for different vehicles. Compliance with the manufacturers' recommendations is of great importance so as not to risk it and to have negative consequences. If possible, it is best to have these procedures performed by a car service technician. However, it is good to know the main topic on this topic: • Check for yourself if the type of battery and the capacity of the battery match the one prescribed for your vehicle by the manufacturer. • When installing the starter battery, make sure it is in good working order and is charged. • Do not start changing the batteries until you are sure that you have stopped the engine and all electricity consumers in the vehicle. • The first step is always to disconnect the positive terminal, followed by the negative terminal. • Before installing the new battery, it is a good idea to clean the battery compartment niche thoroughly. Insert it precisely and slowly, making sure that it is in place, it stays there firmly and does not wobble. If not, you could expose the battery to the friction of the battery box, which will result in a shorter battery life. • Thoroughly clean the positive and negative terminals and electrodes. The terminals are greased with a thin layer of non-acidic grease to prevent oxidation. • The dirt on the battery case may be electrically conductive. The greater the pollution on it, the greater the leakage that can occur. This leads to the risk of battery draining, so it is very important that the box is always properly cleaned. • When installing a new battery, always connect its positive terminal first and then the negative terminal. It is good that they are tight and firm. When you start your car, you spend a few amps and it is important for them to have a solid connection between the terminals of the installation and the battery electrodes. In case of damage and defects of the terminals, it is advisable to replace them with reliable ones to ensure road safety."
15,How to Select the Right Trailer Hitch for Your Vehicle,autos-trucks," For a safe, secure and comfortable driving and trailer towing, choosing the right trailer hitch is an absolute necessity. So before you consider attaching a trailer on the back of your vehicle, you need to make sure you’re cross-checking all the vehicle information and using the right hauling equipment, which means the right trailer hitch accessories. To understand which trailer hitch will meet your towing needs, fit your vehicle and have the best outcome. Here are some necessary steps you can follow. You will be able to select the right trailer hitch for your vehicle when you have a clear concept about your vehicle’s towing capacity and total trailer hitch. So before purchasing, collect relevant information about your trailer, and your vehicle like Gross Vehicle Mass (GVM). Along with the towing capacity, there are four fundamental areas to keep in mind while measuring your tow vehicle: Kerb weight: Kerb weight (KW) is the weight of only the vehicle. TBM: Tow Ball Mass is the exerted weight onto your vehicle which goes towards the vehicle’s payload. Payload: Payload is the total weight of the occupants you want, including the tow-ball load, luggage and other accessories attached in your vehicles. GVM: Gross Vehicle Mass (GVM) is the total weight of your vehicle, along with all of its attachments. So here’s how you calculate gross vehicle mass: KW+ payload= GVM After measuring your vehicle weight, it’s essential to check your trailer vehicle’s Gross Trailer Weight (GTW) and the Tongue Weight (TW) to select the right trailer hitch and hitch class. GTW: Gross Trailer Weight is the weight of a fully-loaded trailer in a condition when you’ll tow it with your vehicle. TW: Tongue Weight is the downward force at the trailer coupler created coupler that attaches to the ball mount onto the hitch. After finding out the TW, GTW and GVM rating from your trailer vehicle and your actual vehicle, you have to go through different types and categories of trailer hitches to find the right one. Here are 3 basic heavy-duty trailer hitch types to choose from - 5th wheel hitch: These are robust hitches that are used to haul large caravans, pick-up trucks, SUVs, car hauliers etc. These hitches can hold up to 25,000 Ibs and a pivot capability to absorb road imperfections. Gooseneck hitch: Similar to 5th wheel hitches, gooseneck hitches are designed for pick-up trucks only with a hold-up capability of 30,000Ibs. Weight distribution hitch: These hitches are classified as hitch attachment with a purpose of adequately distributing the TW (Tongue Weight) across the tow vehicle and the trailer and taking the weight off the tow vehicle rear. ###Find out the hitch height and coupler height After selecting a tow receiver hitch, you need to choose the right shank sized ball mount which should match the receiver tube opening of the trailer, including weight ratings. Before you choose the right ball mount of your trailer hitch with the right rise and drop, you have to accurately find out the hitch height and coupler height. Measure hitch height: From the ground level, measure the distance in between the top of the hitch receiver opening and the ground. Measure the coupling height: Measure the distance between the ground and the bottom of the coupler with the trailer level. With all that information collected above, you can measure and find the right kind of hitch your vehicle and trailer needs. For further clarity, you can also consult with the authorized trailer hitch dealers nearby and come up with an expert solution."

17,Lift Kit Vs Leveling kit,autos-trucks," Never lifted a truck before? Then you must be overwhelmed with so many options available around, starting from leveling kit, suspension lift, life spacer to lift kit. Whether you want to amplify the performance or make the truck look better, the right height is significant for your vehicle. It allows you to use large tires and wheels without hitting or scouring against the fenders. If you are a truck owner, then the two most popular option for you is the leveling kit and lift kit. In today's article, we will talk about the difference between these two and also review some products available in the market. Lift kit and leveling kits are two popular methods of adding height to a truck. The difference between them is subtle but crucial. Let's get into the details. Leveling Kit Usually, the back end sitting of a truck remains a little higher than the front so that the rear end doesn't bend down when the truck is loaded with a heavyweight. It gives a nose-down look to the trucks. But many truck owners do not like this. They prefer their truck to have a leveled look. If you are more concerned about the look, you might want to add a leveling kit. A leveling kit can correct this nose-down style by bringing the front of the truck up to meet the rear. A small lift around 1-2″ is added to the front end to reduce that forward rake of the truck. This subtle change can make a big difference in the stance and helps to fit bigger tires as well. A spacer is added on top of the struts or coil springs to raise the front end of the truck by about 2 inches for a flush and even look. Leveling kits include spring spacers, strut extensions, lift blocks, and some extended length shocks. These are not as expensive as easy to install. ADVANTAGES OF A LEVELING KIT •	consistent look for your truck •	Restore balance to your truck •	easy install Lift Kit Lift kits raise the height of your entire truck off the ground by putting blocks and spacers between the body and the frame. It can provide a lift of around one to three inches. These kits can contain spacer or block kits, springs, shocks, control arms, steering components, etc. You can climb even higher if you alter your suspension. There are two different options for lift kits- •	body lift •	Suspension lift. Body lifts: These are affordable and easy to install. They cannot increase the overall clearance of your truck. It can create havoc down the line for your suspension. Suspension lift: On the other hand, suspension lifts are costly and tricky to install. But they're durable and provide extra clearance. ADVANTAGES OF A LIFT KIT •	Elevates your whole truck •	prepares your truck for the steep angles and rough terrain •	provides an awesome off-roading experience •	accommodate much bigger tires •	gives better traction and handling Lift Kit vs. Leveling Kit A Leveling Kit can only lift the front of the truck while a Lift Kit raises both the front and rear of the truck. You can maintain your stock parts as well with a leveling kit. Which one do you need? It depends on how much height you want and where do you need it. A leveling kit can give a level stance as well as front clearance for larger tires. But if you want to put much bigger tires and even more ground clearance for off-roading, then go for a lift kit.

3,Toyota Recalls 3.4 Million Vehicles Worldwide Due to Faulty Air Bags,autos-trucks," Japanese carmaker Toyota said that it will recall 3.4 million vehicles worldwide due to an electronic glitch that can result in faulty air bag deployments in crashes. The recall, which includes 2.9 million United States (US) vehicles, covers the following Toyota models: 2011-2019 Corolla 2011-2013 Matrix 2012-2018 Avalon 2013-2018 Avalon Hybrid The vehicles may have an electronic control unit which lacks adequate protection against electrical noise that can occur in crashes, which then results in incomplete or non-deployment of the air bags. It could also prevent the operation of seat-belt pretensioners, which pulls in on the belt in the event of a crash. In April, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) expanded a probe into 12.3 million with potentially defective air bags. This covered several automakers, including Toyota and the vehicles above that they are recalling. NHTSA had mentioned back in April that it had identified two frontal crash events, both involving newer Corolla models. One of the crashes was fatal, which was suspected to be due to ""electrical overstress"" on Toyota car products. They also said that the air bags under investigation where installed in more than 12 million vehicles from 2010 through 2019 sold by: Toyota Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Honda Motors Hyundai Motors Kia Motors Mitsubishi These vehicles had an air bag control unit installed, which was initially produced by TRW Automotive Holdings Corp, which is now owned by ZF Friedrichshafen. NHTSA said that as many as eight deaths could be tied to the issue in total. Hyundai, Kia and Fiat Chrysler had previously issued recalls for over 2.5 million vehicles with the TRW air bag control units, due to the suspicion that they may not deploy in crashes. Fiat Chrysler recalled nearly 2 million vehicles for air bag non-deployments back in 2016, saying that there were reports of three deaths and five injuries that may have been related to the defect. Hyundai and Kia recalled more than 1 million vehicles in 2018 due to the same concerns. They had reports of four deaths and six injuries in North America tied to the issue. Toyota dealers will install a noise filter between the air bag control module and its wire harness if needed. They also declined to say how many deaths or injuries were tied to the issue. Toyota will notify vehicle owners of the recall by mid-March this year. The number of affected vehicles in Singapore is also currently unknown. Source: CNA, Reuters"

6,4 Things that Affect Your Fuel Economy of Your Car,autos-trucks," If you are a vehicle owner, you probably take fuel economy seriously. Fuel economy is the major factor while you buy or sell a car. And your fuel consumption almost entirely depends on the choices of the driver. Choices that you make have a big impact on your car’s fuel economy. Nobody can deny the effect of fuel consumption on his/her budget. And that’s why vehicle owners use different methods to control fuel use. Some driers try to control and change their driving technique. While others try to solve this issue by keeping their car in good condition. Some vehicle owners search ‘DPF Removal Near Me’ to remove the filter. This is a common approach that most diesel vehicle owners follow. In this article, we have enlisted 4 majors that affect fuel consumption. First, we’ll talk about the driving approach and then about the condition of your car. 4 Ways How Driving Affects Fuel Economy The way a vehicle owner drives greatly impacts fuel consumption. Here are 4 habits that can seriously take a toll on gas mileage. Short Trips When you take frequent short trips, your car consumes more fuel. Every vehicle runs efficiently when its engine is fully warmed. Short trips don’t give enough time to the engine and it couldn’t fully warm up. As a result, the engine consumes more fuel to run the vehicle. Speeding Speed driving may save some time but it costs you in terms of fuel. The engine burns fuel at a higher rate than usual when you drive speedy. The vehicle starts experiencing higher air resistance around 80 MPH. This, in turn, lessens the fuel economy of your car. Heavy Weight It’s obvious that your engine works harder when the weight increases. An engine consumes more fuel when the vehicle is loaded with weight. A bike rack, cargo, trailer or interior load all come under the extra weight. Heavy Acceleration or Braking This is another factor that is associated with your daily driving habits. Heavy traffic cause drivers to use brakes more often. Whereas switching gear faster while driving aggressively affects fuel economy. Quick acceleration and heavy braking can decrease fuel economy by around 33%. 4 Ways How Vehicle's Condition Affects Fuel Economy Your car consumes more fuel when it isn’t in good condition. Below are the 4 major physical characters that can affect your car’s fuel economy. Poor Maintenance Regular maintenance keeps a vehicle in excellent condition. Poor maintenance cause vehicle parts to work less efficiently which in turn affects fuel consumption. For instance, the engine may have to work harder if your car has a clogged air filter. Oil Type Friction among engine parts is reduced through engine oil. Good engine oil lubricates the component well and help them work efficiently. Motor oils can make a difference around 12% on your fuel consumption. Fuel Injector Issues As the name represents, the fuel injector controls the amount of fuel. It decides how much fuel should enter into the engine. A minor issue or a small leak could reduce the efficiency of your engine. Alignment Issues Alignment issues are also the reason why your car is giving less mileage. Out of alignment wheels or worn-out tires can pull against vehicle’s motion. Such additional strain effects and reduces the fuel economy. That’s why experts advise drivers to replace old tires and always keep them inflated."

9,What the Hail is going on with Colorado Storms?,autos-trucks," Colorado is the LEADING State for Hail Storms Colorado is one of the top states for hail storms and hail damage. State Farm, one of the largest auto insurers in the state and country, described in their annual hail report that Colorado has surpassed other states in hail damage, as there have been ""42,414 claims totaling in $218 million for damage to vehicles"" within the last year (Heilman, 2019). But that is no surprise, as Colorado is part of what is known as ‘Hail Alley’ which receives the most severe hail storms than any other part of the country. We can thank our high elevation for this, as the hail does not have as much distance where it can melt and become rain again before falling back onto the ground (Gardener, 2019). Below is a video describing Colorado's record size hail. Are Colorado Hail Storms Getting Worse? The bad news is that it has been predicted that Colorado’s hail storms and damage will only get worse in the years to come. Researchers from the National Center for Atmospheric Research predicted that there will be stronger thunderstorms as the climate changes which will ""favor an increase in larger hailstone sizes, since stronger thunderstorms allow the hail to be cycled through the cloud layer for a longer time"" (Childs, 2018). This trend of larger hail sizes has already begun though, as the new largest hail size, a whopping 4.83 inch in diameter hailstone, was documented in Colorado in August of 2019 (Bianchi, 2019). Overall, we should expect the worst in years to come for hail storm frequency and hail damage. /center> How to Stay Safe During a Hail Storm Hail storms are dangerous and can cause fatal injuries to people, while also damaging our homes, crops, and vehicles. While most hail storms only contain quarter and even nickel or dime sized hail, it is never safe to be outside during a hail storm. The priority during a hail storm should always be taking care of yourself by getting indoors ASAP, all you can do is endure the storm. It can be very dangerous to be caught driving in a hail storm so avoid this at all costs. If you are stuck driving in a hail storm you should pull over and find cover as soon as possible. As you could imagine driving at 60 mph only adds that much more force to every hail stone that hits your vehicle. These conditions may bring your vehicle beyond repair and put you in an unsafe position. Here is a short video to help prepare, as some tips might not be as obvious as you might think. Most of the time however, there are signs of a hail storm such as dark green tinted clouds or a drastic temperature change before the storm rolls in. If you are able to predict a hail storm from these methods or informed ahead of time you are able to take certain precautions. Your car is an easy one, if you are not able to park it inside, throw a blanket or similar cushion over your car to lessen the impact of hail. For your home, or crops, being a much larger scale, it is hard to protect the extent of your assets. We are Here for YOU Overall, we should expect the worst in years to come for hail storm frequency and hail damage. The good news though, the experts at DentPassPlus can take care of all your automobile hail damage needs through paintless dent repair.

10,Applying New Vehicle Lettering,autos-trucks," Applying Your New Vehicle Lettering You have just washed and waxed your car and it’s sparkling in the sunlight looking as sweet as they day you bought it.  Sitting beside you is the new vinyl lettering you had made for your vehicle.  You’re ready to put it on except…you forgot what the custom shop told you do.  Have no fear, we’ll walk you through it. As you already know, your new lettering and graphic was produced by a computer and cut by a plotter specifically designed for this type of work.  If you find any small remnants of vinyl around the edges of your lettering, carefully trim them away with a pair of scissors or very sharp utility knife.  Make sure the area that you are going to apply this to is completely dry and free from any dirt or residue that will keep it from adhering.  Once you remove the carrier sheet that holds your letter and graphics you’re not going to be able to move them, so have the location planned out and ready before you even touch what you’re applying. Once you’re ready to start, make sure you are in a comfortable position – preferably sitting on a stool next to your vehicle – so that you can hold your graphics and lettering steady.  Place the entire sheet against the car, but do not peel off the backing.  Do all your measuring to make sure it’s centered top to bottom, left to right, and then anchor the whole thing with some masking tape using a piece at the top and a piece at the bottom. Now you’re ready to remove the carrier sheet.  When you do this, lift the vinyl image by the sticky application tape that will hold the vinyl image to your car and work in small section to trim away the backing as you go.  When you have half of the vinyl clear of the backing, hold the design above where you are going to apply it.  Pull the tape tightly and watch as the vinyl adheres to your vehicle.  Don’t pull it so tightly that you dislodge your masking tape.  Rub the image onto the vehicle with a smooth flat edge, starting in the center and working your out.  Don’t miss any area of the graphic. Once you have that half applied, start with the next half and follow the directions from start to finish.

16,Removing Graffiti in USA Made Easier,autos-trucks," Graffiti can be generally defined as writing or drawings made on a wall or any other surface, usually as a form of artistic expression, without legal permission, and directly within the sight of the public. It may range from simple written words to detailed and elaborate wall paintings. It is a rapidly developing art form, especially in the USA. There are some people who refer to graffiti as an art, but in many ways, graffiti art has its disadvantages. In order to make things clearer in this perspective and understand the importance of removing graffiti in USA, we have some arguments prepared. It is illegal Graffiti is illegal, and unless the artist has the legal permit, anything drawn in public areas is considered vandalism. While street artists do acquire government permits in order to paint murals on walls, many don’t. And while it may be decorative and look good, it is still considered illegal. Too much money is spent on removing graffiti in USA every year. Nearly 12$ billion are spent each year in order to deal with the graffiti problem all around the USA. It is necessary that people understand this, and do their part in preventing it, as all this budget can be spent on something good if the problem of graffiti isn’t as bad anymore. It is inappropriate Graffiti is considered inappropriate due to the vulgar language and vulgar images used in it. Not every graffiti is considered as a work of art. Many people who do graffiti, do it for the sake of vandalism. When the vulgar languages and images are present on the walls of a school or an office, it can cast off a negative image of the place. It shows that the owners and managers of the place have no control over their environment. That is another reason why removing graffiti in USA is important. It is used to mark territory and open gateways to other crimes Many gangs use graffiti as a medium to mark their territory. In case that territory is breached, it results in many crimes. This whole scenario is largely unpleasant and anything related to gangs and crimes must be ridden from the area immediately. So removing graffiti in USA also ensures that there are lesser gang-related and local crimes. Environmental damages The fumes that are released as a result of graffiti also damage the environment. They promote air pollution and are dangerous when inhaled. So removing graffiti in USA and taking actions towards preventing it also ensures that the environment is cleaner in the area.

17,The Best Service Of Clear Film Removal At JLN Overspray,autos-trucks," People tend to have a love-hate relationship with a clear film. A clear film is without any doubt the best protection you can give to your vehicle. Sealants, waxing, or any coating does not cover and protect the car as good as a clear film can.

18,"Until Recently, We Never Understood The Dangers Of The Internal Combustion Engine",autos-trucks," Here is something we bet you never knew! The first commercially successful internal combustion engine was created by Étienne Lenoir around 1859 and the first modern internal combustion engine was created in 1876 by Nikolaus Otto. Yes, they have been around that long! However, the fact is that family cars didn’t really come into fashion until the 1940’s – and that’s only 75 years ago, which is simply one lifetime. Indeed, if you had a family car in the 1940’s you were regarded as rather rich! Today of course, most families have at least one car, and some have two, three, or four - one for mum, one for dad, and one for each of the two kids. Unfortunately, of course, what we didn’t know back in the 1940’s was the appalling effect on the climate that these beasts would have. It simply never crossed the minds of those who owned a car that it would cause damage to the environment. And that might not have been the case if cars had been only the prerogative of the rich, so that there were not that many of them. However, as with many things, the motor car became something to which every family aspired, thanks, largely to Henry Ford – and that is in no way meant as a criticism. Nobody, including Ford, could have foreseen the damage that the internal combustion engine would do to the planet. If you think about it, virtually none of us realised the damage that plastic would do to our planet until – what – five years ago? You picked up a plastic bag from the supermarket and never gave it a second thought. Why would you? It was just something in which to carry home your purchases, and which you threw in the bin when you got home. So what? Today, we have learned more. There is no criticism of anybody: it is just that we simply didn’t know, and it had never occurred to us what damage motor vehicles could do to the planet. Heck, it was less than ten years ago that our government was persuading us to buy diesel cars because they caused less environmental damage than petrol! Erm. Yes. Right. There is an old saying that we live and learn, and it is absolutely true. Now we understand the damage that we are doing to the planet by using fossil fuels and driving petrol and diesel vehicles – even though we have been doing that for over 100 years and never given it a moment’s consideration. Now that we know better, we are changing over to electric vehicles and this is going to happen sooner than you may think. One of the reasons is the development of battery techniques which are going to allow electric vehicles to travel for further distances on a single charge than they can do today. Another is that our government has realised that it s essential to wean us off petrol and diesel and has taken steps in that direction, by introducing the OLEV grant. If you don’t fully understand what that is, it is a grant that the government will give you to enable you to install an electric vehicle charger in your home, and it is a considerable amount. How does £500 sound? Not only that, in Scotland, the Energy Savings Trust will give you a further £300 on top of that, which combined means that almost all of the cost of installing an EV charger in your home is covered by the grants. Add to that the fact that the cost of running an electric vehicle is about half the price per mile of a petrol or diesel one, and why wouldn’t you? On top of that, an electric car doesn’t need oil changes, new spark plugs every ten thousand miles, and so on, because it doesn’t use spark plugs or oil. So an electric car benefits the environment and your pocket as well. In addition, if you run a business, you can also get an OLEV workplace grant to install electric vehicle charging points at your office, factory, or whatever, so that your staff can come to work and charge up their cars during the day. What’s not to like?"
19,Charging Times Can Be A Problem For Electric Vehicles,autos-trucks," Oh wow! Did you know that one of the biggest problems with charging electric vehicles is how long they take to charge? Yes, it depends on the charging system and it also depends on the vehicle and its’ battery, but it can take several hours to charge up an electrical vehicle. As in, over 24 hours with some vehicles and some charging systems. All of which makes things a little difficult if you have to travel 200 miles and your battery will only take you for 120 miles fully charged. If you have a petrol car, which most of us do – or diesel for that matter – you can fill the tank in three minutes or so and pop into the office, pay for it, and you can be gone in five minutes. Not so, with electric cars unfortunately. So if you need to travel 200 miles you may well have to charge your car on the way. That can be a problem if it takes an hour or two to recharge your battery! 200 miles is a long way to drive anyway, but if you have to take a couple of hours recharging the battery it can turn into a nightmare. This is why so many people have been put off electric cars in the first place. Yes, they are about half the price to run, mile for mile, and no they don’t need all the servicing that a petrol or diesel engine does, such as oil changes, new spark plugs, and so on, because an electric motor just doesn’t require all that. However, what it DOES require is charging, which can take a long time. Of course, if you have off-street parking then you can install a home charging station and off you go. You come home after work, plug your car into your charger, and that’s it. When you wake up in the morning your ""tank"" is full! This does depend somewhat on your charger, because some can take over 30 hours or so to charge a battery from empty to full. But assuming that you don’t arrive home with your battery empty, and you have a reasonable charger unit, then you won’t have any problem. Ideally, you need at least a level 2 charger unit which will charge most batteries in less than ten hours and may charge some in as little as two hours. Even so, the length of time required for charging is what has put many people off investing in an electric car so far. Nobody wants to take off into the countryside for an afternoon out and then find themselves stuck in the woods – literally. And that is quite understandable. Nonetheless, we are all going to be driving electric cars in the not very distant future. If you recall, it was not so many years ago that we used to have our milk delivered six days a week by a milkman driving an electric milk van: remember those?? Yes, that was only 20 years ago! And those days are going to return. We need to protect the environment and – believe it or not – only in the 1940’s it was the case that if you had a family car you must be quite wealthy, because most people didn’t own one. Today there are millions of them. Most families have one, if not two or three. But they are going to have to change to electric. Here is the better news. Although the problem with electric vehicles has been the length of time that they need to charge, there have been developments. A problem with the lithium-ion batteries that we have has been that attempts to charge them too fast has resulted in them degrading much faster. And they are not cheap to replace. However, Dr Chao-Yang Wang of Penn State University in the US and his team have developed a method that raises the battery temperature for ten minutes to 60°C and then drops it to 23°C which prevents the battery from deteriorating with fast charging. Dr Wang says that they can now charge an electrical vehicle and give it a range of between 200 and 300 miles. Not only that, they can repeat the process around 2,500 times, giving the vehicle about half a million miles of travel. Developments such as this are going to mean that electric vehicles will become more common faster than you would imagine."

1,Benefits of Leasing a Van or Truck for Your Small Business,autos-trucks," For any small business owner, a van or truck is an important investment. But, with so many sellers vying for attention, searching for a commercial vehicle to purchase might be tricky. Moreover, there are so many different models to choose from and payment plans to approve. This is one of the reasons why a lot of small businesses opt for leasing a truck or van instead of purchasing. If you are facing a similar dilemma, keep reading to know some of the advantages of van and truck rental in Worksop. Zero vehicle ownership responsibilities When you purchase a commercial vehicle and assume ownership, it means that you have to take care of it for a very long time. Taking care of a vehicle means paying for its regular maintenance and repair. For a small business, this will be viewed as an added expense and you might not have the funds for it. Renting a van or truck, on the other hand, frees you of such responsibilities. You will only make use of the vehicle for the period that you need it and return it to the rental provider. The repairs and maintenance of the vehicle will be looked after by the rental service provider. No need to secure a loan to rent a vehicle Small businesses function on a budget and this means that you have to be very careful when it comes to fund allocation. As such, you might not have the required amount to purchase a van or a truck. In such a case, you only have two options: 	Purchase any inferior model of truck or van that fits your budget 	Apply for a loan Now, both of these options are not very favourable to you or your business. If you simply hire a truck or van for your business, you do not have to take the headache of paying back a loan. You will only pay the rental company a fixed amount for your use of the vehicle. Opportunity to drive the latest models of your chosen vehicle Providers of van and truck rental in Worksop carry a huge fleet of commercial vehicles. The vehicles are sourced from some of the biggest manufacturers in the industry. Also, they regularly update their fleet to include the latest models in the market. This means that you can drive the very best and advanced truck or van at a reasonable rental price. Also, you can keep renting different vehicles that suit the purpose of your business. There might be some days when you need a small van and some days when you need a large truck for the transportation of goods. Regardless of what size vehicle you need, the rental service providers will always have the right solution for you. Leasing offers tax advantages Tax advantages are one of the biggest reasons why small business owners opt for renting a van or truck. If you run a registered business, you can claim the rent that you have paid for the vehicle. Simply put, your rental payments are a tax-deductible expense. Around-the-clock roadside assistance When you purchase and drive a van, you are basically on your own. If you are driving from one place to another at night, you cannot turn to anyone if the vehicle happens to break down. But, when you rent a vehicle, you also get to leverage the rental provider’s professional services, which includes roadside assistance. You can call the professionals when you face any issue on your journey and they will make sure to fix your problem so that you can be out on the road. So, these are a few of the advantages that you can enjoy by leasing a truck or van for your small business. You can contact a professional rental company for more details."
2,Five of the most common accidents in underground mining,autos-trucks," The mining sector represents a huge slice of the global economy, employing millions of people worldwide and producing coal, metal and non-metal minerals from thousands of mine sites. Mining is a dangerous occupation in itself, but underground mining is particularly hazardous, with a rate of reported accidents many times higher than above-ground mining. Underground coal mines represent the greatest level of risk compared with above-ground coal-mining operations, and many of the world’s worst mining disasters have occurred in coal mines. The most common types of underground mining accidents vary, depending on the type of mine, the region, and the safety standards of the governing body. Here are five of the most common hazards that lead to accidents and injuries. Explosions can occur when methane (a highly explosive gas trapped between layers of coal) is released, which can be caused by improper or miscalculated use of tools in the mine, or when a gas detecting appliance isn’t used. Other combustible materials such as coal dust and other gases also cause explosions. Fires can result from these explosions, leading to asphyxiation – a common cause of worker fatality as the mine is starved of oxygen, and carbon monoxide is produced in its place. A roof collapse can occur when mine props subside after a tremor or explosion. Mines located in seismically active locations are at particular risk of tremors or earthquakes, and the use of explosives in these regions can also trigger an earthquake. Fallen structures such as roofs can collapse on or trap miners. Workers can also be struck by falling rocks and other debris during a tremor. A significant source of personal injury is by contact with machinery, incorrect use of machinery, or an accident involving powered haulage. Contact with drilling or cutting machinery causes entrapment or crushing of limbs or digits. Electrocution is also a common cause of injury. One cause of machinery malfunction can be overheating. Sufficient cooling systems are essential for the efficient and safe operation of underground mines. Without proper cooling systems in place, machinery can fail or catch fire, causing hazards and leading to accidents. This is thought to be one of the major causes of accidents, with some data reporting that around one-third of injuries occur as a result. These types of injuries often happen when a worker is required to use tools in awkward positions, where operators can easily become fatigued and proper control of such tools becomes difficult. Overexertion injuries are more likely to occur with increasing employee age, and to inexperienced workers. Falls can happen for a range of reasons, including mounting or dismounting vehicles or machinery, in which a worker can be thrown off, or simply walking around in the work environment where falls and slips can occur due to debris underfoot. Sometimes the fall results in a collision with a stationary object, causing an injury, or a worker can fall from a platform onto a lower level platform. Falling from heights is more likely to result in death than other types of falls, and in many cases the injury risk is exacerbated by inadequate use of protective equipment such as harnesses, or lack of preventative measures such as barriers around an opening."
3,What is Boat Shrink Wrap,autos-trucks," I will introduce the top 10 most commonly asked questions about shrink wrap that I researched and found online. Shrink wrap is covering and protecting your boat for the winter months when it is not in use. It protects from water, snow and ice. The four most common materials shrink wrap is made from is PVC, polyolefin, polyethylene, and polypropylene. Using heat shrink wrap simply isn't a DIY project. It is advised to have an expert do this for you. It is advised not to use a snap cover as it doesn't offer the type of protection that shrink wrap does. Yes, it is reusable a few more times only if it's installed and removed properly. The answer is no. Your storage company where you plan to store your boat would be able to help you there. They are in charge of these issues. It is best to contact your storage provider and check out their online reviews. You can read if other customers have experienced anything like this. Of course inside storage is better than outside storage but it's totally up to you and what options you have where you live. Make sure to shop around. They are on average 17-23 per linear ft. Make sure their prices include materials and also make sure they have insurance if they damage your boat. Depending on sun exposure, typical marine wraps are good for 5-7 years. Depending on how well you care for your shrink wrap, it can last indefinitely. Drop them off at a recycle yard. Call around for places that will take them for you. I hope these questions give you an idea about shrink wrapping your boat. Get a professional to assist you with shrink wrap for your boat. Spending the extra cost is better than doing it yourself."
4,How To Evaluate A Used Car's Condition,autos-trucks," Have you decided to purchase a used car? This is surely a fantastic idea! So, do you know how to evaluate its condition for making the best decision? If not, it is time to know how to do this right. Car dealers always prefer buyers to take the vehicle at its face value and only go for superficial checking. This gives them the opportunity to sell substandard pieces and make fantastic profits while robbing you blind. So, how can a novice avoid such spurious deals? If you are not knowledgeable about the vehicle condition, either refrain from purchasing a used car or simply take someone who understands them thoroughly. Why not do some research of your own regarding used-car evaluation to get this right when the time comes? This way, you will have a fighting chance of getting an appropriate deal besides getting the full value for the money you spend. Here is how you can evaluate the condition of a used car correctly. Check Repair Records Does your dealer promptly show you the repair records of a vehicle? This is a good sign. Such records can give you a good idea regarding the condition of particular vehicle. They indicate proper servicing and well-cared car. To remove doubt, do not forget to bring in an experienced mechanic to get spot evaluation and an accurate assessment. Properly repaired and maintained car is worth your time and investment. Signs of Abuse and Neglect The condition of the vehicle tells you much about its previous owners. When you are evaluating a car, make sure that it is properly maintained one. Are there signs of abuse or neglect on its body and elsewhere? Was the previous owner treating the car well? What do the interiors smell like? These are some of the questions to ask when evaluating a used car. Presence of strong odors, ugly stains, dents, and dings show you that you have a poorly conditioned vehicle in your hands. While these as such tell nothing about the engine or other vital parts, they surely give you an idea! After all, someone who has ruthlessly ignored the superficial condition of the vehicle seems to be the last person to care for the mechanical condition as well! Presence of Mechanical Band-Aids Is there haphazard repair work present in the vehicle before you? Do you feel that the owners have done some shoddy maintenance job is simply to get their car sold? It is important to look for signs of hastily done mechanical work when purchasing a used vehicle. Recent detailing reflects negatively on the condition of the car. It simply indicates tidying up the condition before sale. Some of the signs to look for include an engine compartment recently cleaned. This may be an indication of badly leaking oil. Keep your eyes open and you are sure to spot such tell tale indications of deceptive appearances strewn all over. Look for Signs of Smoking Do you get a whiff of tobacco smoke when evaluating a vehicle? When checking a used car, ensure that the previous owner was not a smoker. This is an extremely important point because smoking habit inside the vehicle points to words and overall reckless behavior. A person who smokes inside the car is not generally stickler when it comes to timely repair and maintenance. However, a more practical reason to walk away from a car containing tobacco smoke is that the smell is never going to go away! After all, the previous owner as well as the dealership would have tried their best to remove that smell and failed. Do you think you will succeed in removing the smell where others have failed? So, either be ready to live with a stinky car in the coming times or abandon it to find another one NOW! Check Transmission Fluid and Oil The evaluation of transmission fluid and oil gives you a good idea regarding the condition of the vehicle. While an experienced mechanic is a good judge of such things, you can look for yellow oil color. Presence of grittiness and coal black oil color, points towards a big problem. Those looking for indication of appropriate upkeep should never forget to check the transmission fluid of the used car. Burnt odor and a color verging on dark brown indicate that it is time for fluid replacement or even a transmission replacement! Condition of the Coolant Coolant condition in used vehicle is another important evaluation point that no discerning eye should miss. Presence of debris indicates complete lack of servicing. The color of coolant fluid is not an indication nowadays especially when a plethora of different brands are available for use. Presence of Accident Damage Does the used vehicle show sign of accident damage? This is never a good indication. While simple fender bender is not an issue, this can happen to any driver even the best ones around. However, a vehicle showing plenty of repair signs on four corners indicates towards a highly reckless driver. How can you be sure about proper maintenance inside when a vehicle shows significant superficial damage? If you believe that, a particular car has been through a highly damaging accident, won’t there be any long-term repercussions present? Pinched wires may lead to electrical gremlins and bent frame may cause uneven wear of tire or improper wheel alignment. Age of Previous Owner What was the age of the previous owner of the vehicle? Make sure that you know this information before making a purchase decision. It is a fact well known that people below the age of 30 are irresponsible drivers. In such a scenario, evaluation of the used car will simply be a waste of time. So, do not forget to ensure this point before proceeding further. Remember, purchasing a used vehicle is never walk in the park! You need to study the vehicle thoroughly and then decide. Mentioned above are some surefire ways to evaluate a used car and help the buyers along. So, do you feel that you have something else to add?"
5,Aston Martin,autos-trucks," I can remember seeing some of the early films on the big screen as a young boy. ""Gold Finger"" and ""Thunder Ball"" come to mind. My Mom and her sister would drop off my cousins and I at The Beach Theater in The Bronx for the Saturday matinee. Besides the 007 movies, I had the toy attache case with all the gadgets, flat throwing knife, Luger with scope and silencer, 007 ID wallet, and other cool spy stuff. I also had the match box, Bond DB5 Aston Martin with cool spy gadgets, smoke screen, ejector seat, bulletproof rear screen, oil spilling device, machine guns, and knock off hubs that would extend out to slice up the side of villains chase car. James Bond is still the boss. When ever I get the opportunity I still enjoy seeing the early films. So anyway, this is my Aston Martin Story. The year was 1972, my uncle was considering rescuing a red 1959 DB4 Aston Martin from a body shop that started putting a 327 small block Chevy engine in to replace the beautiful twin over head cam inline 6. I remember going with my Dad and Uncle to look at it. It was gorgeous. I was so hooked on Aston Martin’s. They had already started to cut the firewall to make room for the V8. I was thinking, buy it, they wanted $600.00. The reason they were fitting a Chevy engine was because the original owner had put a rod through the Aston’s engine block. In the early 70’s a 1959 DB4 wasn’t worth that much but replacement engines were very expensive and hard to come by. My Uncle’s plan was to save the Aston engine for a later date and temporarily install a Jaguar 4.2 straight six into the Aston. In those years I think the Aston and Jaguar engines were pretty similar, besides he had one sitting on the shelf from a heavily damaged 4.2 sedan. Remember, my Dad and his brother had a import salvage business. It sounded like a great plan. So after several months of back and forth negotiations Uncle Ed finally bought it. Well as some of you know my Uncle died and untimely death in a house fire in March 1974. My Dad was in charge of dissolving his brothers estate. I asked Dad, who is 82 and doing well why he didn’t hang on to it. He can’t remember details like that any more. I clearly remember begging Dad to keep it along with Uncle Ed’s Triumph Bonneville motorcycle. I was 15 at that time, a boys dream Aston Martin and a Triumph motorcycle. I really think looking back on that time in Dad’s life he was probably in shock, loosing his brother and business partner must have been difficult. There was a lot going on with closing their business and liquidating their assets. Within two years of Ed’s passing Dad sold our house in NJ and started over in Clearwater Florida. So to me the Aston Martin is the one that got away. For my Dad on the other hand I think he was trying to put it all behind him and move on. Thanks to all my readers for sharing these stories, Tony"
6,5 Steps To Take When Involved In An Accident,autos-trucks," Unfortunately, car accidents are a reality that we have to deal with in life.  Very few people will live a long time and avoid getting in a car accident.  Also, sadly it is possible to be involved in a major car accident in your life.   Below we are going to outline the main steps you need to take to ensure you save yourself money, time, keep insurance rates as low as possible and protect yourself in case of an accident. Obviously, first and foremost is going to be your safety.  If the accident is terrible, your main focus is going to be protecting your safety and health and getting to a hospital.  Calling 911 should always be your first thought to do in a serious car accident. After checking yourself for injuries, obviously check on your passengers and then individuals in other vehicles.  Ensuring everyone's well being is obviously most important. When you are involved in a collision, it doesn't matter who is at fault - Never admit it is your fault to any other parties or police.  The officers will determine this.  Obviously, if it is your fault it would be foolish to act innocent - but don't just give away your guilt. Fault this is determined by the police officers that come out as well as insurance companies!  Insurance will only pay out non necessary claims if they feel you were at fault.  So, you are not supposed to admit you were at fault even if it is obviously. Documenting the accident can be extremely valuable especially when it comes to confirming who is at fault as well as insurance needs and/or lawsuit issues.  You need to take as many pictures as possible up close of damage areas and far away showing the accident and surrounding areas.  Absolutely take pictures of any injuries as well.  When it comes to all aspects of your accident, documenting everything is extremely valuable to insurance companies as well as lawyers that may represent you if injured. If you are injured, you need to seek medical assistance.  Additionally when you are injured your best bet is to start seeking needed medical help to ensure you are brought back as healthy as possible.  For example, if you suffered back injuries or neck injuries; a chiropractor would be absolutely a smart idea.  Additionally, if involved in a lawsuit - this shows you are needing expensive treatment which is valuable for your case. Obviously if you are going to seek legal assistance, hiring a good lawyer is crucial.  Read reviews online and check their case results.  If you are in a very serious accident, you should definitely make sure you are discussing your case with several lawyers until you find the one you are confident will do the best job!"
7,Vehicular Performance - Miles vs. Hours,autos-trucks," Vehicular performance and it’s mileage – what’s the relevance? Although it’s quite a popular concept for individuals to measure the wear of a vehicle by its mileage, is it really effective? Some experts beg to differ. In fact, many experts will protest that a true indicator of a vehicle’s performance is not at all referenced to its mileage – especially for fleet trucks. For many fleet managers, measuring a trucks performance plays a key role in managing its replacement strategies, preventative maintenance schedules, identifying utilization, and overall calculating the fleet’s total cost of ownership as an entirety. And with many fleet managers also operating under a specific year or mileage replacement policy, the importance of measuring a trucks performance grows even larger. So, what is the best indicator? Many engineers have highlighted that the most effective way to measure a vehicles performance is by looking at one of two things: either the hours of engine operation, or the amount of fuel burned over a length of time. As an engine idles, the wear on a vehicle to consume one gallon of fuel is the same as driving up to 30 miles. So, by measuring certain factors by hour, rather than per mile, it uses an alternative method to analyze the fleet – allowing analysts to better understand which locations and trucks are costing more than the benchmark. Vehicles with special applications that require the vehicle to be running (such as those equipped with power take-offs) require constant charging of the battery to operate, which in return requires more idling time that won’t show up as mileage or utilization. And since idling, which can consume up to a gallon of fuel per hour, creates wear-and-tear on the engine by the hour, it’s preventative maintenance should go by the same method of measurement to better ensure the function of the engine and fuel system. Now, some fleet managers may find this a little worrisome, especially if their fleet trucks are actually required to do quite a bit of idling. More idling being calculated by the hour, means even more maintenance – and more maintenance means more cost to maintain the truck and sustain its overall performance. But, there’s an easy solution to that with the purchase of Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) to help reduce idling and a hefty portion of its costs. Take the HP2000 for example. The HP2000 has an Idle Reduction System that doesn’t just eliminate the need for the truck’s engine to idle, but it also reduces fuel consumption by up the 90% - using an average of 1/10 gallons of fuel per hour. On top of that it’s quiet, light-weight, and in a compact size built to handle the extreme temperatures and rough conditions that drivers battle with on a daily basis. All-in-all, however, measuring vehicular performance can give a fleet manager a better understanding of its usage and determine whether changes may or may not need to be made. While miles may be best for measuring many fleet analytics, hours are an important component to ensure total visibility into all aspects of fleet maintenance and measurements. And if counting the hours scares you, count on something that doesn’t - the reliability of the HP2000."

9,Some Important Reasons for Investing in Tubeless Tyres,autos-trucks, Buying a quality car is a big investment and it comes with responsibility. If you want to make sure that your investment performs efficiently then you need to pay attention to the maintenance. The tyres are a critical part of a vehicle so it is important that you choose the right tyres and keep them in good condition. If the tyres are not properly maintained or replaced in time then you will be compromising the safety of the car. It is important that you know what the numbers of tyres mean so know the manufacturing and expiration date of the tyres. Buy the tyres from a reliable supplier like Bridgestone tyres Birmingham. Until a few years ago the tubeless tyres were not common and were advertised as a premium feature. But now nowadays most of the new models use tubeless tyres. If you are looking for a tyre replacement you should consider investing in tubeless tyres even if your car model originally used tubed ones. Here are a few reasons switching to tubeless tyres is an excellent decision. With tubeless tyres you do not have to worry about punctured tyres. The traditional tyres can easily get punctured if the tube between the rim and the tyre gets punctured. With tubeless tyres you do not have to worry about puncturing the tube and damaging the tyre. Get tubeless tyres and there will be no punctures. The tyres with tubes get damaged easily if you run the vehicle on tyres that have low tyre pressure. You will face any such issue when you have tubeless tyres. You should make sure that you regularly check the air pressure of the tyres so that you can experience a smooth drive. You can use a liquid sealant to fill the tubeless tyres because it will make sure that the tyre continues to function even if it gets punctured. When the modern tubeless tyres get punctured by sharp objects the liquid sealant starts to ooze out and dries. The liquid plugs and fixes the puncture automatically. It is a great feature as you will not get stranded in the middle of the road because of a punctured tyre. The tyres that have tubes go flat in minutes in case they get punctured and it does not give you any chance to take the car to a shop before the tyre gets flat. The tubeless tyres take a lot of time to get flat when they are punctured. The air escapes at a slow rate and it gives you ample time to allow you to pull over or get to a shop. The tubeless tyres are lighter than traditional tyres because they do not have a tube. As there is one less component and there will be less unwanted friction. The frictional load will be less as well and it will result in better mileage. If you are looking to upgrade the car and have a better driving experience then you should switch to tubeless tyres. They offer better distribution and give the vehicle an ability to handle speed in an efficient manner. The tubeless tyres are pricier than the traditional ones but it is an upgrade that is worth investing in.

There are additional expenses that should consider like registration, insurance, taxes, etc. It is also important to think about regular maintenance and fuel cost. You will have to pay for the additional cost as well as the initial one so make sure that the budget you have covers everything. Determining the right down payment: Putting in down money car is a great idea because it will make the purchase much easier and affordable. If you make a bigger down payment then the amount of money you will need to borrow will reduce. When you are borrowing less there will be smaller payments and low-interest rate. But make sure you put in the amount that you can afford because in an open-ended agreement there is an opportunity to add some extra cash later on. Make sure that you consider the interest rate because it will help in determining how much money you should put in. Affordable monthly payments: You should be confident that you will be able to pay the monthly payments for the car you are buying. When you are deciding the monthly payments you need to consider the length of the term of the loan, interest rate and the down payment you can afford. The10 % rule is a common approach and it encourages the vehicle buyers to allocate ten percent of the monthly income to the car sale. If you are making $5,000 monthly then you will be dedicating $500 to the car you are buying. It is not a set rule so you can set the percentage according to your financial situation. The final decision about the monthly payments depends on how much you are comfortable with and can easily afford to make. You have to think about how much disposable income you would like every month. Use the car loan calculator: The final step of budgeting for the car purchase is to use the car loan calculator so that you can find models that are within your budget. The calculator is effective in making a final decision and finding the best car you can afford."

13,Why It Is Important to Maintain Your Car Brake System Regularly,autos-trucks," Owning a vehicle brings with its independence as well as a lot of responsibility. When on the road, you have to be a responsible driver and drive safely so you don’t break any road rules or put your life or another’s in danger. The other side to the responsibilities of a vehicle-owner is regarding maintenance. Taking the vehicle for a regular car service is crucial to ensuring the vehicle is safe for the road and that problems are spotted early and fixed before they turn into larger repairs. One of the most important parts of a vehicle that one should have regularly checked is the brake system. There are many consequences to not maintaining your car’s brake system, which is why it is important that you don’t ignore it when making a car service booking. How Often Should You Have It Checked? It is recommended that a vehicle’s brake system is checked at least once a year. You need not make a special booking for it as it can be done through a car service booking. What’s important is that a thorough inspection of the brake system is done as a cursory glance won’t be enough to spot any issues. Experienced and skilled car detailing services will conduct a thorough inspection which includes lining wear, condition of hoses and brake lines, fluid level, rotor thickness, and warning lights. During the car service, they should also take the car for a test drive to spot any problems that may be brewing in the brake system. Look for The Warning Signs You may have your brake system checked during a car detailing booking once a year, but this doesn’t mean your vehicle will be trouble-free. Between car service bookings, a problem may start up or a small issue that was overlooked may worsen. This is why you need to look for warning signs so you know exactly when your vehicle’s brake system needs to be checked. If your brake pedal feels soft or spongy when it is pressed, you may want to talk to your auto service center. A scraping or grinding noise from the brakes may also be a warning sign. If your vehicle pulls to a side when brakes are applied, that too is an indicator that you should have your brake system checked. Besides these warning signs, it’s also important that you pay attention to the indicators of your vehicle. If the brake fluid level is low or the brake system warning stays illuminated, it’s time for a car service booking. Regular Maintenance One thing you shouldn’t do is delay having these potential problems checked out. You may think waiting for an auto detailing scheduled to happen in two months’ time is perfectly fine, but during that time, you may be driving a vehicle that isn’t safe for the road while also worsening the problem. Faulty brake systems often result in collisions, which could, in turn, result in damages, injury and even death. By ignoring a problem with your vehicle, you may be putting yourself and others in danger. Added to this, ignoring a problem or delaying going to an auto service center can cost you a hefty sum if you let a potential problem grow into a serious problem. What could have been a five-minute job during a regular car service may now be a huge repair that costs you a good amount. This is why it’s important that you maintain your car brake system regularly. Brake Safety Awareness Month There are many causes that lead to the maintenance of brake systems. A few causes are driving habits, the type of vehicle and the quality of material and parts, as well as operating conditions. However, over time, it is only natural for a brake system to require maintenance or repair, which is why it is important to book regular car detailing services. In order to spread awareness about the importance of brake safety, August is celebrated as Brake Safety Awareness Month. During this month, organizations as well as car service centers shed light on the importance of brake safety as well as why brake systems should be maintained regularly. You can spend the month as well as the time leading up to it and following it educating yourself and others on the importance of brake safety."
14,What Vehicle Repairs Can You Learn to Do?,autos-trucks," Buying and owning a car is a colossal risk. You spend a large sum of money on an inanimate object that isn’t guaranteed to run smoothly or properly, and often, there will be a hiccup at some point along the way. Alas, it happens to the best of us, and, unfortunately, it’s unavoidable if we’re going to invest in risk. However, with a little bit of research and the right tools, there are some faults that can be fixed at home. When should you take your car to the garage? •	The engine specifically requires the experience and knowledge of a qualified mechanic. When your engine light appears on the dashboard, you’ll need to book your vehicle into your local garage at the earliest convenience. Not only is it difficult to identify what is wrong with the engine, it’s an intricate procedure to fix the issue without causing another one. Some of the most commons faults that occur with the engine include fuel pump issues, valve damage, overheating, smoking, rattling and running in limp mode. •	If you’ve noticed that your vehicle is pulling to the left or right, that there is extreme tyre wear, the steering wheel is crooked when driving straight, or that your tyres squeal, it may be time to get them realigned at your local garage. Wheel alignment is a sensitive and time-consuming procedure with lots of measurements involved and it’s important that these measurements are 100% correct to sit in line with the angles that were set by the manufacturer. However, there are a few tips that you can take on board to prolong the length of time before your wheels need to be aligned. This include removing unnecessary weight from boot of your car, maintaining the correct tyre pressure, and being gentle when turning the wheel. •	9 times out of 10 when fluid is leaking from your car it will result in a trip to your local garage. However, understanding what different colours of fluid mean will enable you to explain which area of the car is experiencing an issue. This helps to speed up the entire process. Let’s learn our colours and what they mean: Red or pink fluid generally indicates an issue with the power steering or transmission. Orange fluid suggests rust in the radiator, whilst yellow fluid can be a sign of either a loose hose clamp or a damaged o-ring in the radiator. Blue fluid points towards your windshield wipers as the fluid reservoir and tubing that carries your windshield cleaning fluid can degrade over time. Dark brown and light brown fluid often signal a fault with the engine, brakes or gearbox. Green fluid normally isn’t a concern, just that the incorrect antifreeze fluid has been used. Be sure to check your owner’s handbook to find out what the correct antifreeze fluid for your vehicle is to avoid this. Lastly, clear fluid is nothing to panic about, usually a leak of condensation from the air conditioning system. •	In most cases, tyres are the easiest section of the car to identify an issue for. For instance, you will need to take your vehicle in to a garage for a tyre change when the tread depth has worn down. If you notice the vibrations of the car have become more intense, when cracks start to appear around the rim of the tyre, if they squeak when going around roundabouts and corners, and if they’ve ticked over the average lifespan of a tyre which is around 5 years. •	Lastly, whenever you notice a burning smell coming from your vehicle, it’s always best practice to take it to your local garage to identify the issue. If you continue to drive your car without getting it checked, you run the risk of causing extreme damage to your, costing you more in the long run. What faults can be sorted with a self-fix? •	Apart from general maintenance, one of the easiest repairs that you can carry out yourself is replacing the car battery - a fix that literally takes 15-30 minutes to complete. All you need to do is search for a battery replacement video tutorial and make sure it is relevant to your make and model of car. This way you’ll learn what tools you will need, the correct size battery that you need for your car, where to locate the battery in the car, and how to remove and fit a battery without damaging anything else. •	Brake pads are spectacularly simple to replace and often the only item you will need to purchase is the brake pads themselves as commonly most people will already own safety glasses, a car jack, protective gloves, and a spanner. Simply search online for a video tutorial of how to fit brake pads for the make and model of car to replace these correctly. •	By carrying out regular maintenance on your car, you decrease your chances of running into issues that could have been avoided. Straightforward jobs such as checking the fuel and air filters, testing spark plugs and wires, checking the distributor cap and rotor, and changing the oil will help to preserve the condition of your car. In hindsight, if you believe you can fix the fault yourself, then you’ll be better off doing this as the most expensive part of taking your car to the garage is paying for someone’s time to analyse the vehicle, fix the fault, and carry out post-fix checks. With the power of Google and YouTube, you’ll learn quickly whether this is a solution you can achieve or if it’s out of your depth."

18,How to make sure your car doesn’t fail its MOT,autos-trucks," If your car is more than 3 years old, you will have to have a MOT every year to check that it is still safe to drive on the roads on the anniversary of the last test. To minimise your car failing its MOT, you can carry out your own mini MOT to check that everything is in place. Where can you find out whether your car needs a MOT? Each car, once it’s passed its MOT, will receive a MOT test certificate and the date will be stamped onto the certificate. If you misplace this then you can go onto the GOV website, entering your car registration and make. This will also check your tax status. Can you drive your car without a MOT? No. It is illegal to drive your car without a current MOT. There is no grace period of your MOT date, as soon as this has passed its testing date, it is then illegal to drive. Your tax will then also be void, as you cannot tax a car without an updated MOT certificate. The only two exceptions of this is actually driving your car to its MOT, as long as it has already been booked in. The second exception is that if your car is older than 40 years, you will no longer need a MOT at all. If you do not drive your car, you can declare your car as off road (SORN). How long does a MOT take? A MOT can take up to 45 minutes, you can wait for your test to be completed, or you can come and collect it after. How can you prepare for your MOT? Lower the chances of your car failing its MOT by following the below checks: Give the horn a beep to see if it’s still working Make sure all fluids are topped up: Breaks, oil and windscreen Check your tyre tread using a 20p Keep your car clean, if your car is looking like a complete mess, the examiner may refuse to carry out the test Ensure that your number plate is clean, so it is readable Rubber blades on the windscreen wipers must not have any cuts or tears in them, due to them having to clear your windscreen for you they must be in a good condition Both the windscreen washers and wipers are working Check that all your lights are working If your car has a tow bar, make sure it is not corroded or loose The seat belts must be in a good condition, not frayed or cut By following these simple steps, you can potentially save yourself the time and cost of a retest. When the test finally comes around, make sure to do your research and go for a reputable garage."
19,Tesla’s All-Electric Semi,autos-trucks," Tesla plans to formally launch its all-electric heavy duty semi-truck sometime this year in 2019 and we may see it cruising down the freeway before we know it. Certain companies as Sysco, Anheuser, Busch, Wal-Mart, Loblaw, Deutsche Post/DHL and PepsiCo have already placed pre-orders on the truck. Tesla’s electric truck has four motors, up to a 500 mile driving range and some self-driving capabilities. Mega chargers will be available throughout the US to recharge trucks up to a 400 mile range in 30 minutes. Although the exact price of the electric semi-trucks is not yet confirmed, it’s expected that the cost will be around $150,000 for the 300 mile range trucks and $180,000 for the 500 mile range trucks. Most long-haul diesel trucks cost $120,000. These electric semis could provide many benefits such as reduced costs, increased safety, and help protect the environment by slashing fuel emissions and improving overall maintenance of the trucks. Some companies feel that due to savings on fuel and better maintenance with Tesla’s electric semis; they could potentially pay back the cost of the truck in a relatively short time and save large amounts of money over the life-span of the truck. According to Reuters, Jim Monkmeyer, President of Transportation at DHL Supply Chain said, ""We are estimating that we could have a pay back within a year and a half will be based on the energy usage and as well as lower maintenance cost...The maintenance savings can be enormous as well. Just because the engines are much simpler in terms of the number of parts, and the complexities of the parts."" According to The Verge, ""Tesla claims its all-electric Semi will provide more than $200,000 in fuel savings alone over the life span of the truck."" In addition to the slashed fuel and maintenance costs according to Tesla’s website, another major benefit of the electric semi is safety. This ultimately means the money saved on insurance costs. The Tesla all-electric semis have some self-driving capabilities such as automatic lane keeping, automatic emergency breaking, and forward collision warning to help avoid collisions with other vehicles. The windshield is made of Tesla Armor Glass to protect the driver in the case of a collision. Also in Tesla’s all-electric semis, the driver is supposed to be  positioned in the center to help the  enhance visibility and control of the vehicle. The driver seat also has a low center of gravity to provide roll over protection. This could mean better driver safety and also reduced insurance costs for fleet managers. Tesla’s new all-electric semis seem to be pretty competitive in the market with many potential benefits of using electric energy in semis. The all-electric semi-trucks have a potential pay back of less than two years and can help save money otherwise spent on maintenance, fuel, and insurance costs. The trucks will also help reduce pollution and protect the environment. It’s no wonder so many companies have already pre-ordered their all-electric semi fleets."
20,Four Ways Truck Drivers Can Lose Weight,autos-trucks," Many truck drivers find themselves gaining unwanted weight due to the sedentary lifestyle of their work and lack of healthy food options on the road. Information from the National Institute of Health show that more than 50 percent of truck drivers are obese compared to the national rate of 26.7 percent. Weight gain can also contribute to problems such as diabetes, hypertension, and sleep apnea. According to the Obesity Action Organization, ""Indicators for risk of hypertension include obesity, abdominal obesity and weight gain."" They also state that, ""Being overweight or affected by obesity greatly increases your risk of developing type 2 diabetes."" Studies have even shown that obesity in truck drivers can cause more accidents. According to the NRCME, Healthy Trucking Association of America found shocking results, ""’That’s when the data stood up and shouted at us,’ says Jon Anderson, a biostatistician at the University of Minnesota, who co-authored the study. ‘We found really clear evidence that the highest body mass index drivers are at higher risk of having an accident.’"" So what are some ways truck drivers can lose weight and reduce their risk of disease and accidents? Exercise in short breaks It may seem hard to find time to exercise when you are on the road, especially for long-haul drivers. Most importantly, use whatever little time you do have to get in shape. If you are waiting to be loaded up or unloaded, grab the chance and exercise for a bit. Or even if you just have 10 to 15 minutes at a rest stop, a few times a day, walk briskly, do jumping jacks, or run in place. According to the American Heart Association, you should get 30 minutes of moderately intense exercise five days a week, totaling 150 minutes spread out over a week. But those 30 minutes five days a week, can be spread out over 2 or 3 smaller sessions a day. In addition abdominal crunches and push-ups are two examples of exercises you can do just about anywhere, even inside your sleeper cabin. Blast you favorite music to get enthusiastic and do small 10 min work outs two or three times a day. Eat Healthy Eating healthy is essential to losing weight. Avoid fried, fatty and processed foods. Try to eat more fresh foods. Keep a stock of fruits, precut veggies, roasted nuts, and boiled eggs and cheese in your refrigerator or cooler in your truck at all times. This will help you to avoid snacking on junk food while on the road. When you stop at truck stops for meals be mindful as to what you order. Try to eat more proteins from lean meats, vegetables, whole grains and lentils. Making sure you get enough protein will help you to feel full and not overeat and you will have more energy also. Reduce Sugar Intake Sugar intake should also be monitored to help you lose weight. According to Every Day Health, ""Registered dietitians and public health officials alike agree sugar consumption is a major cause of weight gain and obesity in the United States, but the relation between sugar and weight gain is little complex. While natural sugars found in fruits and dairy are healthy as part of a whole food, the problem, experts say, is the sugar that’s added to our packaged, processed foods. In addition to containing added sugars, which offer no nutritional value, these foods are usually high in calories and unhealthy fat."" If you have the craving for something sweet opt for fresh or dry fruits. Dates and figs especially are perfect for the sweet tooth. You can also look at health stores for desserts that are sweetened with agave or stevia which will taste good and be good for your body as well. Stay Hydrated Studies show that most Americans are not drinking enough water. According to The Quench Survey, ""Nearly 80 percent of working Americans say they don’t drink enough water."" Staying hydrated is the key to staying healthy. Our bodies actually depend on water to survive. The human body uses water to maintain its temperature, remove water, and lubricate joints. Staying hydrated can also help us lose weight. Hydration not only boosts our metabolism but also helps us to distinguish between hunger and thirst. We may feel extremely hungry but it might actually be that we are just thirsty. Staying hydrated will ensure that we eat only when we are actually hungry. In addition, studies have proven that drinking a glass of water before a meal can help people avoid overeating and have showed a reduced calorie intake per meal. It’s essential for drivers’ health and safety to avoid obesity and keep their weight in check. Short periods of regular exercise, eating fresh foods and lean proteins, avoiding sugar, and staying hydrated are the most effective ways for drivers to lose weight even while on the road. With a little cautious decision making and short breaks for 10 to 15 min exercise twice a day it’s definitely possible for drivers to be physically fit even while on the job. Don’t wait until tomorrow, start today and soon you won’t just look great, you will feel great too!"

1,Top Reasons GPS Technology Saves Fleet Managers Money,autos-trucks," It’s 2019 and time to make the final switch from AOBRD to ELD devices.whether GPS technology of ELD devices potentially help trucking companies save money? The answer is YES. Every year thousands of dollars is literally guzzled away in unnecessary idling, aggressive breaking, speeding, poor maintenance, and costly insurance premiums. The average operating cost for the trucking industry is about $1.38 per mile and the average total yearly cost of operating a commercial truck comes to $180,000 a year. The GPS technology used with ELD devices can help slash those figures and save you money and time. Let’s take a detailed look into the benefits of using GPS technology in your fleets and how it saves you money. Reduce Idling to Save Fuel and Maintenance Cost: Same like managers, with the help of GPS technology, you will get transparency into when and for how long your trucks are idling. According to the US Department of Transit, ""Typically, a long-haul truck idles about 1,800 hours per year, using about 1,500 gallons of diesel. Stop drivers from speeding and aggressive breaking: Speeding and aggressive breaking can rapidly drain fuel supplies; thereby causing increased and unnecessary fuel expenses. According to a National Geographic interview with Glen Kedzie from American Trucking Association, ""On average, a truck traveling at 65 mph instead of 75 mph will experience up to 27 percent improvement in fuel consumption. ‘As a rule of thumb, for every one mile per hour increase in speed, there is a corresponding 0.14 mpg penalty in fuel consumption,’ said Kedzie."" The GPS technology of ELD devices makes it possible to have a real time view, 24/7, into the speeding and aggressive breaking habits of drivers. This allows fleet managers to correct negative driving patterns and save money on fuel and wear and tear of the vehicle; as well as promote safety for truck drivers and other motorists on the road. Cut Insurance Costs: The use of GPS ELD compliant devices will keep a better check on drivers and improve driver safety. Insurance premiums are currently based largely on CSA scores. ELDs are connected directly to the truck’s engine which allows carriers to monitor driver safety and identify risky behavior that could result in higher CSA scores. Also with the use of GPS technology of ELD devices you can make sure your drivers don’t exceed HOS and thereby eliminate driving violations which would cost your company higher premiums. In order to that , the GPS technology of ELD devices can give the insurance industry with additional data to consider when determining risk models. This can reduce the impact CSA scores have on insurance premiums. Lastly, using ELD compliant devices to monitor HOS and make sure your drivers don’t drive too long without proper rest will ultimately prevent accidents due to driver fatigue and save endless lives and money. Improve Routing and Driver/Manager Communication: GPS technology can help make sure your drivers take the most efficient routes, which will help cut fuel costs and time, thereby making your business more profitable. Everyone in the trucking industry knows that time matters when it comes to transporting freight across the country. Through using GPS technology and ELD devices you can make sure that your drivers are on the fastest route possible and avoid traffic jams.Complete Driver Transparency to make sure your drivers are safe, honestand profitable: Managers must keep tabs on their employees for the success of any business; and there is no difference in the trucking industry. In many professions, employees work in a well monitored environment which helps managers have a better knowledge of their employees’ behavior and accomplishments. With the freedom truck drivers have out on the road for weeks at a time, it’s crucial for fleet managers to have a way of knowing what is going on with their trucks and drivers. According to the FMCSA out of the ten states with the highest average fatal large truck and bus crashes in 2014-2016, 51% of those fatal crashes involved at least one large truck or bus. Fleet managers need to feel comfortable that drivers are safe, reliable, and honest. While this may have not been possible in the past, it is now thanks to GPS technology. Now they have  managers can have complete driver transparency and monitor all the movements of every vehicle in their fleet 24/7 to make sure their drivers’ performance is safe, beneficial and profitable to the company. GPS technology is very beneficial to the trucking industry. By using this technology with ELD devices fleet managers can largely cut costs in their companies. Fuel costs can be reduced by omitting unnecessary idling, aggressive breaking, and speeding. This will also help to save fleet managers money on unnecessary repairs caused by the wear and tear of the vehicles. Also through the use of GPS technology fleet managers can identify risky behavior of drivers and also closely monitor HOS so their drivers don’t receive any violations and don’t drive over time which could cause accidents due to fatigue. This will in turn greatly reduce insurance premiums for fleet managers and ensure the safety of their drivers and other motorists on the road. GPS technology can also be used to direct drivers to optimal driving routes to ensure timely delivery of freight; thereby profiting the company as a whole."
2,Things Truck Drivers want other Drivers to know,autos-trucks," One of the immense dangers that truck drivers face on the road are passenger car drivers. Many times the small cars try to cutoff or follow the truck way more closely than they should. Any miscalculation on the part of any of the driver can result in fatal accidents. There are a few things passenger car drivers must keep in mind while driving along the trucks to ensure that the roads are safer for all: Whenever a truck stops on the highway, move to the next lane and give them some space. Truckers stop on a busy highway only if it is critically important – the truck is either in need of maintenance, or if there is any issue with safety. Give the truck drivers a space to cater to the emergency situation. A truck driver also have a blind spots as a passenger car driver have. They do have a rear-view mirror on the right, however due to the difference in height, the entire right side is a blind stop for truck drivers. It is safer to never try to pass them on their right. Trucks and trailers are huge, and can weigh more than 80,000 pounds. They cannot stop abruptly, and there is a huge gap in application of brakes and response time. Also, trucks and heavy vehicles use air brakes, which function differently than the brakes in a four-wheel car. therefore,unless there is enough space passenger driver should not try to overtake. While entering or exiting the highway, most truck drivers can see other passenger cars and heavy rigs, and wait for them to pass. However, if the situation arises that they cannot move, it is better for both their safety that the passenger car gave way to the heavier truck. This is simply because trucks are huge and heavy, and it is difficult for them to move. Trying to cut or not yield will only waste the time of both drivers. Truck and heavy rig drivers and passenger car drivers often communicate with each other through trailer lights, headlights, and turn signals. Repetitive flashes means the driver needs to be more attentive of the road ahead. This could be due to excessive traffic, road construction or maintenance, or any other situation. As trailers are long and huge, truck drivers are often confused about whether it is safe for them to change lanes or not. A simple flash of light from fellow traveler can assure the truck driver that he has enough space to change lanes. Making turns is another challenge for truck drivers. They have to make wide turns, and the safety of these turns depends on fellow drivers. There are white stop lines at intersections, and other drivers must pay attention to them when they see a heavy trailer trying to make a turn. Truck drivers go through intense training, and are well versed in all the rules and regulations pertaining to road safety. Because of the sheer size of their vehicle and heavy haul attached to it, they have to be extra careful. It is highly unlikely for trucks to be driving at a fast speed, as the drivers know that they cannot make an abrupt stop in any situation. So,road safety is equally important responsibility of all drivers, no matter the size of their vehicle."
3,Trailer Tracking – Important things to Remember,autos-trucks," Trailer tracking helps in finding the location of the trailer, even when it is not attached to the truck. With proper tracking system that includes tracking device, communication network, database and backend server support, and also user-friendly interface, trailer tracking can have several benefits. The GPS enabled cloud-based system provides location insights of movable and non-movable trailers in real-time. Fleet management is a highly overwhelming job, requiring maintenance of schedules of shipment, drivers, availability of vehicle and trailers, along with compliance of an assortment of rules and regulations. Since 2000, the world of telematics has evolved rapidly, providing fleet managers with a wide range of functional solutions to optimize their management. Some of the profit of having real-time trailer tracking are: Logistics:A trailer tracking system is good for easier logistics, as they provide accurate information on trailer location, allotting downtime, and also scheduling service checks. It also helps you plan the route ahead, which ensures that deadlines are met, and the customers are happy! Paperwork: Trailer tracking uses the GPS technology with cloud based applications that keep a record of everything which happens around. The information is organized and stored in the cloud, and can be accessed via any mobile device at any point of time. Its time-saving, cost-effective, as well as environment friendly. It also eliminates the chances of loss or any discrepancy, as the data is recorded in real time. Matrack’s MA-4550 is a weatherproof hardwired tracker that keeps historical data up to one year, making it easier to get the paperwork done without losing any vital data. Waiting time: Most trailer tracking systems are equipped with geofencing options that allow presetting an alarm on entry or exit to certain geo points. As soon as the trailer is in the proximity of a loading/unloading depot, an alarm is generated, and the customer can be made aware of a vehicle’s impending arrival. This ensures that the deck, goods, equipment, and labor is ready to receive the trailer, thereby reducing the detention time. Downtime: Before the trailer tracking system, fleet managers had a bad time keep track of all their trailers that were sitting at the customer’s site for too long after having unloaded. But with GPS enabled trailer tracking, have the possibility of downtime which is surely been minimized, and trailers and other valuable assets can be applied with better efficiency. Safety of Assets: Modern day trailer tracking systems come with various functionalities such as monitoring temperature, tire pressure, two-way control for refrigeration for perishable goods, and much more. In case a safety issue arises, the back-office support is alerted, and immediate action is taken to secure the assets, trailer, and the driver. Recovery: The biggest threat to trailers is theft. But equipped with GPS and geofencing, even if a trailer is hijacked, the exact location in real time is communicated to the support office, who can alert the appropriate authorities. The trailer tracking system has advanced up the process of recovery of stolen assets and trailers. Also, as the action is taken instantaneously, the loss is fairly minimized. Trailer tracking devices such as MA-1080 by Matrack, are solid, have a battery life of 3-5 years, and it has a well weatherproof system. They are GPS enabled and have an easy-to-use interface which is accessible on smartphones, tablets, or any other mobile device of choice. Through the interface, the trailer tracking data can be monitored around the clock, from anywhere in the world. Implementing a trailer tracking solution has several advantages. It offers optimized trailer utilization, proper invoicing, and better customer service."
4,Trailer tracking and Fleet Management,autos-trucks," Trailer tracking and fleet management are often mistaken to be the same thing, and the terms are used interchangeably. However, there is one huge difference between those two. Trailer tracking is a subdivision of a much wider system of fleet management. To understand this difference properly, let’s take a look at both of them separately: Trailer Tracking system is a combination of computer software and an electronic device. The device is installed in the trailer gathers information, which is processed by the software. It permits the owner to track the location of the trailer, along with several other features like geofencing, temperature control, security, and provides real time data for better execution. Some of the qualities of a well-designed Trailer Tracking device like MA-1080 by Matrack Incorporation are: Long lasting Battery life Supports high Speed Data Real-time insights Weatherproof Alerts through SMS and Emails Compact in size Together with a GPS enables cloud based application and service, trailer tracking system proves to be most beneficial in case of hijacking and theft, and helps in speedy recovery. Fleet Management, however is a much wider concept. Apart from being aware of the location of one trailer, a fleet manager has several other duties and responsibilities: Purchase and replacement of Vehicle Compliance with regulations  and rules such as IFTA and ELD, set by local and state authority Maintain electronic database of drivers, vehicles, trailers, customers, equipment, and labor Plan and schedule routes Provide workshops  and relevant training to other employees Manage maintain cost-effectiveness and fuel requirements Optimize the entire fleet operation Ensuring safety and security of assets and drivers. Fleet management platforms support a fleet manager in fulfilling the above mentioned duties and much more with better efficiency and organization, thereby increasing the ROI. An effective fleet management system is placed on the principal of IoT (Internet of things). Electronic Logging devices, generally known as ELD, like Matrack’s MA 3000 are equipped with implanted software and sensors are connected to the vehicle or assets through on-board diagnostics. It collects various data like speed, driving hours, engine status, maintenance requirements, and location. The data is sent to an analytical program that utilizes this information and generates reports for mileage, safety, fuel consumption and others. MA 3000 also helps in compliance of DOT’s hours of service rules, and as it incorporates Bluetooth technology, fleet owners and managers can be in constant contact with their vehicles. Trailer Tracking is an important part of fleet management. Together, they allow owners  and managers to operate their fleets at maximum capacity and improve profitability. It also ensures that all assets are maintained periodically and utilized properly. The reports generated are accurate and help in safety protocols and tax compliances. MA 1080 is compact, simple and easy to install. It comes with powerful inbuilt magnets, 3 years of battery life, and faster and better connectivity. Together with its application, MA 1080 can send geofencing warnings, has proactive tracking mode in case of hijacking or theft, and sends location alerts via email and SMS in real time.

Once you have installed MA -1080, you are provided user credentials to the platform, and can approach it anytime, from anywhere around the world."
5,IFTA Calculation through ELD and Fleet Management,autos-trucks," IFTA is a fuel tax agreement among 48 U.S. states and 10 Canadian Provinces to centralize reporting and levy of taxes under a single license. Before IFTA, truck drivers and operators were required to pay fuel tax separately to all state they travelled. It might seem that calculating fuel tax for interjurisdictional travel according to the rules of every state is an annoying task. With newer technology like GPS, and the ELD mandate, managing a fleet, consumption of fuel, its movement, and other tasks have become efficient and cost-effective. Calculating tax under IFTA can be easily explained in five steps: Tracking the number of miles: It is important to keep a correct record of fuel consumption in each state travelled. Drivers must record the odometer reading whenever they cross the state line, and work with fleet managers to provide accurate information. However, various fleet management software have made keeping a record of fuel consumption, travel, and overall tracking of the movement of the fleet through GPS. At Matrack, we proffer a fleet tracking system with 4 different hardware solutions to choose from, according to your needs. We also have developed outstanding application that can be downloaded into any mobile device of your choice, assisting you in keeping track of your fleet from wherever you want. With the help of our fleet tracking system, calculating the number of miles travelled in each state can be done with just a click. Fuel Purchases: To file for IFTA tax, the following information referring to fuel purchase must be submitted with original invoices or receipts: Driver’s name Vehicle plate number Fuel Purchase date Number of gallons of fuel purchased Type of fuel Price per gallon Fuel seller’s name Fuel seller’s location Along with GPS, Matrack proffers our clients with fuel cards in partnership with American Express. It greatly support the fleet managers to keep a check on fuel use, better deals, and also a detailed report on fuel purchase history, making it easier to organize the data required to file for tax under IFTA. Fuel consumption in every state: For a truck that has travelled through more than two member states of IFTA, calculating mileage for every state can be done through two simple equations: Total miles travelled in a member state ÷ Overall fuel mileage = Fuel Consumed in that state Complete Fuel mileage = Total number of miles driven ÷ Total Gallons of fuel consumed However, there are several cloud-based fleet management applications that are efficient and correct in keeping a record of fuel consumption data. Matrack Incorporation’s new product MA3000 is an FMCSA – approved ELD comes with several features that help in calculating fuel consumption easier, as it records data for duty status, miles travelled, GPS tracking, and more on a single platform. Applicable rate of Fuel Tax: Fuel tax for each state can be vary, and also different for every quarter. International Fuel Tax Association website gives a precise chart of fuel tax applicable on various types of fuel, in each state, for every quarter. Final Calculation: To calculate the original amount of fuel tax, the following formula can be used: Fuel Tax required to be paid – fuel tax already paid = fuel tax payable Fuel tax paid to the state is mentioned in the receipt or invoice of fuel purchase. It is important to remind that the equations mentioned above might require adjustments based on certain IFTA regulations that might be applicable to certain vehicles or under certain conditions. For example, adjustments for taxable miles, taxable gallons of fuel consumed and surcharges must be taken into account as per the rules of each jurisdiction. As soon as IFTA was adopted for interjurisdictional fuel tax calculations and reporting, Matrack updated all its applications to obey with rules and support IFTA regulations. Our solution makes it easier to calculate the mileage, fuel use, taxable miles and gallons, and the fuel tax for separate states. Using a Matrack Incorporation Fleet Management application and hardware makes calculating for IFTA efficient, easy and accurate. It also helps save a lot of time, otherwise spent in recording, manual collection of data, and calculation of travelled miles, gallons of fuel used, taxable fuel and total tax."

7,Historic Racing Crashes That Revolutionised Car Safety,autos-trucks," Motorsport racing events are considered some of the most thrilling and death defying sports in the world. However, this extreme thrill brings with it a sense of looming danger that puts the lives of racers at great risk. Over the decades, the safety aspect of racing events has earned the most importance, and rightly so. Racing events have seen several tragic ends to the illustrious careers of many racers and in some unfortunate incidents, their lives. However, it was these tragedies that improved racing safety in hopes of reducing the chances of more accidents in the future. The HANS device A tragic crash at the Daytona Motor Speedway in the United States prompted the authorities to introduce the HANS device, a head restraint setup to prevent serious injuries to the head and neck. The mechanism triggered by the tragic loss of Dale Earnhardt in 2001 has saved many lives in the past decade. Impact protection Counted among the most horrifying car crashes in the Formula One circuit, Martin Donnelly’s car exploded into many pieces after colliding with the barrier. Travelling at a staggering speed of 140 mph, Donnelly was left alive with severe bruises on his lungs and brain. The tragic incident in 1990 prompted Formula One to use better protective methods, allowing the cars to absorb violent impact. Quick accident response Immediate medical attention from skilled and trained track marshals is invaluable to injured racers on the track. The importance of providing timely assistance was fully realised after Roger Williamson was trapped under his car that flipped at the British Grand Prix in 1973. A similar incident occurred at the Italian Grand Prix in 1978 when Ronnie Peterson’s car crashed into a barrier and eventually caught fire. Kill switch At a practice session at the NASCAR Series in 2000, Adam Petty suffered a severe skull fracture, dying immediately after a head on collision with a wall. A few months later, Kenny Irwin Jr. suffered a similar fate, dying of the same injury as Earnhardt and Petty. NASCAR then implemented the kill switch to immediately switch off the engine in emergencies like mechanical failures and loss of control. Limited use of fuel In 1964, Dave McDonald hit the tracks with a newly designed vehicle that ended up causing chaos at the Indianapolis 500. Spinning out of control, the car hit a wall and burst into flames and continued to damage other cars after a violent roll back. Driver Eddie Sachs was caught in the explosion and died immediately while McDonald passed a few hours later. This caused the US Auto Club to place restrictions on the amount of fuel carried at a time. Modified pit and grandstand Probably one of the biggest disasters in the history of motorsports, the horrifying accident in 1955 resulted in a modified safer design for the grandstand and the pit crew. To avoid hurting the pit crew, Mike Hawthorn slammed on the brakes, accidently hitting them at over 150 mph! This accident cost the lives of 83 people.

8,How to reduce Driver Detention?,autos-trucks," Driver detention refers to extra time a driver has to spend while goods are being loaded or unloaded, over the allowed 2-hour limit. The delay could guide to several problems such as: Running out of legal 14-hour driving limit, affecting the delivery time. Driver can be pressurized to speed up to make up for lost time, leading to magnified chances of accidents and other safety challenges. Any subsequent appointment for loading or unloading of goods will be delayed, and can result in loss of work. Driver detention is a large problem in the trucking and fleet management industry, and it requires coordinated efforts from everyone involved. Here are a few tips to help minimize driver detention: Communicate: It is always better to be in contact with the shippers and receivers, and inform them of the scheduled appointment and prescribed time. Also sending timely alerts of the trucks position will help them to keep everything for the truck’s approach. Planning: If a truck has to pick up goods from two or more different locations, make sure that the appointments are scheduled to allow for any unforeseen delays. Appropriate labor and tools: Using additional labor and forklifts can eliminate the chances of delay. Moreover the expenses for extra labor will always be less than the operational losses causing due to detention. Accountability: Most of the delay happens at loading and unloading point. If the shippers and receivers are made answerable for the delay, and are required to pay for the same, detention time will drastically reduce. Make them aware that if there is a delay in shipping, there will be a delay in delivery and will also have a negative impact on their business. Compensation: Having a proper detention compensation plan will decrease the chances of rash driving or speeding, and ensure the safety of the driver, assets, as well as the truck. There is no technology available yet that can help eliminate or minimize driver detention. However, by using fleet management applications and ELD, safety of the driver and assets can be enhanced. Modern day trucks are equipped with GPS tracking, and in more immediate times, with ELD devices that are useful in tracking the movement of the truck, in case it is hijacked. There are also access control devices like access cards, key fobs or keypads, definitely designed to cater to the trucking industry. These devices ensure that once the cargo is locked in the trailer, it cannot be accessed by anyone without the card, key, or the password. Having such technology protecting the cargo allows the truck driver to do his job peacefully, without worrying about thieves. Mobile Asset management solution using GPS tracking device is efficiently manage your fleet and to monitor driver activities in real time to prevent any vehicle misuse. Matrack Incorporation has a user-friendly fleet management platform that gives vision into any HOS violations. With this information in hand, a close eye can be kept on driver to spot any safety offense like excessive acceleration or hard braking. Based on the data from the platform, a better safety program for training the drivers can be generated."
9,Transition from AOBRD to ELD,autos-trucks," Prior to ELD mandate, many fleets used an Automatic On-Board Recording Device or AOBRD. These AOBRD are hardware equipments that can be directly connected to the vehicle’s engine, and are used to document a driver’s Hours-of-Service, in compliance with DOT. According to FMCSA’s new instruction, fleets that use AOBRD have to ensure that the devices are updated with certified ELDs by December 2019. The reason why AOBRDs are required to be updated to ELDs is because the latter is more definite and authentic, as there is very less driver intervention in editing the data. Here are some points of differences that AOBRDs and ELDs have: ELD Recording Date and Time Number of Miles Driven Engine Running Status and Hours Location Other datas like duty status, logging status, malfunctions, etc. Location Change in status of Duty Location recorded automatically Period of breaks in during driving Record of yard moves and authorized personal use Accuracy For on duty – 1 mile For personal transport – 10 miles Record of Edits User credentials Time of edit Records cannot be altered, but edited with annotations DOT inspectors can check edit history Duration of driving cannot be edited AOBRD Recording Engine Running hours Time and Date Location Duty Status Duration of Drive Number of miles driven Location Change in Duty status Location can be entered manually Accuracy Record of Edits Driving time can be edited Edit History not available 1Yard Moves: Driving within a customer’s yard, receiver’s facility, rail ramp, maritime terminal, other similar facility or  location. 2 Authorized Personal use: Off-duty time as allowed by company and opted by the driver. The modern ELDs proffer a wide range of data – hard braking, driver behavior on speeding, fuel use, vehicle inspection reports, IFTA automation, and much more. The analysis reports and data generated by the ELD compliant platforms reduce the paperwork, keep fleet manager updated of the driver’s and the vehicle’s location in real time, allows for planning of a better route, and increases overall operational efficiency. In light of the changes in ELD instruction, Matrack Incorporation has laid out a breakthrough piece of technology – MA3000. It is FMSCA approved electronic logging equipment, with Bluetooth technology for uninterrupted connectivity. Some of its brilliant features include: Voice activated status change Violation Notification Low fuel alerts HOS logs Real time and Idle Time tracking Accident reporting Maintenance Check alerts If your fleet is currently using AOBRD, it is high time to update to ELD. You will require time to train your employees for successful transition, making sure that all the devices and applications are fully operational. It is mandate that AOBRDs should  be updated to ELDs is because the latter is more accurate and authentic, as there is very less driver intervention in editing the data. Also, the sooner you have adopted ELD, the better chances are of you diverting noncompliance or any other regulatory issue."
10,The Truck Drivers of the Future - Millennials,autos-trucks," Everyone in the trucking industry knows that the demand for drivers is on the constant rise. A 2017 report by the American Trucking Association revealed that the industry wants to hire almost an additional 900,000 more drivers to meet rising demand. Statistics show that a large percentage of current truck drivers are over 50 years old or more. The matter is that older, more qualified truck drivers are retiring without adequate replacements. Here are the 3 best ways to hire millennial drivers: Use of social media to reach out to millennials Many fleets depend heavily on printed magazines as a way to recruit new drivers and spread the news about the industry. While this is very effective for older and more experienced drivers, if fleet managers want to demand to young new prospects they will have to reach out to them where they are; social media. 3.48 billion people currently use social media. Around half of the US social media users are between the ages of 18 to 34. So make sure your fleet company gets active on social media to make connections and hire millennials through your social media networks. Provide free CDL training for proposed drivers Many skilled and qualified young men and women may be turned off from truck driving simply because of the large training fees required to receive their Commercial Drivers License. Charge for learning truck driving can cost up to $8000. For those who are just entering the work world and looking for their first job, this may be a big preemption. Fleet companies can help increase their chances of recruiting new young employees by providing free CDL training to worthy truck driving candidates. Understanding  the generation gap While truckers of the past may have been fine with living in beat up cabins and eating fast food on the go, today’s younger generations are more focused on an overall physical and mental well-being than past generations.Millennials accept to eat less junk food and more fresh, less processed food with fewer artificial ingredients. Installing mini ergonomic kitchens in trailers may provide a way for drivers to cook their own healthy food. Another thing that is essential to millennials is owning a pet. In an article published by Pet Product News, they noted that Packaged Facts, a division of MarketResearch.com, claims, ""Millennials now account for 31 percent of all pet owners, boasting 43 million pet holders in the 18- to 34-year-old age group."" Truck companies should ensure that their workers have space to bring their fury friends along with them, thereby making the job more demanding to millennials. Recruiting potential millennial truck drivers would significantly help the driver crisis that the country is facing. Trucking companies should get active on social media to reach out to millennials and promote their job openings. Providing free CDL training is a great motivation to encourage youth just entering the work world to join your fleet. Also understanding what means most to millennials and making necessary changes and renovations to driver cabins will satisfy the interest of millennials in the trucking industry and help increase the number of truck drivers in the business."
11,How Really does Head Up Display Work?,autos-trucks," Let's begin with a small history: Almost any carmaker's advertising department can inform you that its cars are given birth to from jets. But the heads-up display is the the majority of prominent option that in fact comes from the aviation globe. First trademarked by the Royal Air flow Force during Globe Battle II, it enabled the de Havilland Mosquito to take a flight quicker and easier at night time. As jets evolved, therefore do advancements in instruments, flight computer systems, and assistance systems. HUDs possess become important to flying. In a fighter plane, with the foe on your tail and Purpose-9 Sidewinders at the prepared, having all that details right up front could imply lifestyle and loss of life. How really does it function? Your windscreen serves as a large display screen, and a projector inlayed in the dashboard sends a clear image onto it. The image leaves the projector and bounces off a series of mirrors, magnifying and flipping the picture so that the data comes out right-side up and legible. Press a toggle change by the dashboard and you can adjust where the screen is usually on your windshield-something achieved with a rotating reflection. Some car companies like Mazda project their heads-up data onto a little plastic material window that flips up, known as a combiner. This creates a standard image no matter how the windshield's designed. It also decreases the amount of decorative mirrors required to send out the picture onto the windshield obviously. And a great deal of aftermarket displays use this kind of a combiner therefore you can set up it in almost any vehicle you make sure you. What may you discover? There's your acceleration, sure-that's the many essential one. And turn-by-turn routing, complete with ghostly arrows all suspended correct atop your lane. The Corvette provides experienced an HUD system since 1998, and it shows overall performance data like engine swiftness, g-forces, equipment placement, and essential oil temperature, additional reinforcing that fighter-pilot cachet. And on some high-end vehicles, there's also the choice of evening eyesight: projecting pictures used from behind the grille onto the windscreen, it may conserve you from working into pets. Further upon straight down the collection, producers aren't simply calling it a mere Heads-Up Screen. Rather, it's full-on increased reality-arrows and pathways overlaid on the street ahead, offering foolproof navigation, and the capability to find how fast that vehicle is heading in front side of you, and if there's anything behind it you might miss. Businesses like Continental and Harman are functioning on this right now. So the takeaway? If you think your car is definitely too old or plebeian for HUD, understand that the cheapest HUD program on Amazon correct now can be a simple $29.99. (""Modernizes your automobile!"" says one five-star reviewer.) These systems connect into your car's on-board diagnostics, and my own it for every little bit of data you might require: quickness, fuel intake, distance, engine errors, everything except routing. It's simpler than you believe to retrofit your trip."
12,Combating Cargo Theft,autos-trucks," One of the biggest challenges that even practiced truck drivers come across is theft of cargo. When on the road, they are under continuous threat from burglars and armed robbers. Most cargo thefts occur during pit stops and breaks, where a passerby might make use of the opportunity for some quick bucks. The truck drivers have to be extremely careful and vigilant to safeguard their trucks as well as the cargo they are carrying. Although there is no handbook that can precisely lay down the guidelines to avoid cargo theft, there are some tricks and tips that truck drivers can utilize to keep their cargo safe. Type of Cargo: According to research, certain types of cargo are targeted more by thieves, either because of their size or because of their market value. Electronic items like laptops  and mobiles fetch a good amount in the black market and are also easy to carry. Other goods that are more frequently stolen are pharmaceutical drugs, food, clothing and accessories. Truck drivers need to be extra cautious during breaks and rests, and up their security when transporting such type of cargo. Planning ahead Seasoned truck drivers who have been on the job for long know the areas to avoid during their travel. Often many organizations also publish reports and surveys about places and roads, called as ‘hot spots’ that are more likely to be targeted by robbers and hijackers. Researching and studying many reports can assist truck drivers in planning for the tour and breaks before they start. Employer Protocols Most trucking companies have their own security protocols that every truck driver is trained in and is required to follow constantly. The trucking companies also have a ‘red zone’ and ‘hot spots’ where they do not permit their drivers to take a break. The red zone is normally the first 200 miles or 4 hours of travel. This may differ according to the standards of the company. Hot spots are the areas that are liable to theft and hijacking. By adhering to these rules, and avoiding to stop in threatening areas, truck drivers can keep their cargo safe. Pit stops and breaks Possibilities of cargo thefts increases when the truck is not moving. But when the travelling hours are long, truck drivers need to stop and take a rest. This is the opportunity that the robbers wait for. It is advisable that drivers do not leave their trailer unattended for a longer period of time. However, if the situation arises, parking the truck in a well-lit area with its back up against a wall will make it difficult for thieves to get inside the trailer. If the driver is taking a rest inside the truck, keeping all the doors locked will ensure that no harm comes to them and the cargo. Make the best of Technology Modern day trucks are equipped with GPS tracking, and in more immediate times, with ELD devices that are useful in tracking the movement of the truck, in case it is hijacked. There are also access control devices like access cards, key fobs or keypads, definitely designed to cater to the trucking industry. These devices ensure that once the cargo is locked in the trailer, it cannot be accessed by anyone without the card, key, or the password. Having such technology protecting the cargo allows the truck driver to do his job peacefully, without worrying about thieves. As said earlier, there is no specific guide to combat cargo theft. However, by being attentive to the surroundings, reporting any suspicious activity, and not leaving the truck unguarded, drivers can greatly avoid the chances of a theft.

Anything more than around 40 minutes puts you at a vulnerable state especially given the fact that you could potentially be either on a busy or even secluded road. Finally pay attention to the cost. Though the price for breakdown services can range and vary greatly, it is crucial to opt for a service provider that isn't focused on trying to acquire customers based on price alone, thus quoting low prices but ultimately failing to deliver a reliable and quality service. If you ever happen to be in an unfortunate situation as described above and find yourself looking for a reliable London breakdown recovery service or London car transport company then look no further; we pride ourselves with our prompt and reliable service to save you money and save the day!"

17,How To Use Tire Inflator ?,autos-trucks," All tire manufacturers are taking extra efforts for developing products that increase tire life, improve fuel economy, and reducing tailpipe emissions from automobiles. Thus, consumers are getting all types of different and technologically advanced tires like silica-based tires, low-rolling resistance tires, etc. Nevertheless, as an end user, you will not get the maximum benefits from these technologies unless you maintain correct tire pressure. Thus, you must be aware of how to use tire inflator correctly. It is highly important to check the level of tire pressure of your vehicle once in every fortnight. Most people follow this rule without fail, but some are not. A majority of motorists is not even bothered about checking air pressure regularly because they need to visit a tire shop or a gas station specifically for doing this task. But, you can do it very easily if you purchase a portable, electronic tire inflator. It is easy to operate a portable digital tire inflator. If you use this device, you can avoid unexpected incidents of a flat tire or an underinflated tire. Steps to Make use of Tire Inflator? As a preliminary step, you should connect the air inflator to a power socket. Most air inflators come with an extendable power cord, which is helpful for taking it close to the individual wheel. While using a tire inflator, you should keep the engine of the vehicle running, which is effective for avoiding draining of the car battery. You should examine the condition of the tire before doing the task. If you find a large puncture, do not inflate the tire. In such cases, you can swap it with a spare wheel. You can also call for getting better assistance. You can use the tire inflator if the tires are a little low on air or it has a slow leak. To inflate tires, you need to connect the nozzle of the compressor to the valve stem of the tire properly. Before turning on the compression pump, you should make sure that all connections are proper Now, it is time to switch on the air flow inflator, which allows compressed atmosphere to enter inside the tire. This process should be done with proper care. If you hear any hissing sound, you should switch off the inflator. It makes a hissing audio because of improper connection. So, you can re-tighten the valve-stem connection and nozzle properly. An improper connection will lead to an surroundings leakage in the system. You should stop and verify the air pressure periodically by using a pressure gauge, which prevents over-inflation. You should also check the recommended air pressure for your automobile. You can find it in the owner manual of your vehicle or on a placard on the driver door jamb. It requires around 2-3 minutes inflating a fully flat tire. But, if the tire is slightly under-inflated, that you can do the job in 40-50 seconds. You should discharge the compressor nozzle safely after inflating the tire. You should loosen the connection only after switching off the inflator."
18,What is the Safest Colour for Your Subaru XV?,autos-trucks," The Subaru XV price offers a fantastic value proposition, and this popular SUV is available in a wide palette of attractive colours. We’re used to looking at colours to convey certain emotions, such as red for excitement and green for feeling calm. However, many drivers are aware that this principle can apply to their cars in other interesting ways. It may come as a surprise, but some car colours are actually safer than others. So, if your main focus is safety for your family, perhaps you should pay closer attention to the colour of your Subaru XV purchase based on the colour descriptions shown below. We’ve mentioned this in the introduction, red is often regarded as the fastest colour, but it isn’t the safest. When you drive a red car the colour of your finish can easily be swallowed up by other colours on the street, such as brake lights on other cars, red traffic signals and warning signs. The risk that you run driving a red car is that your paint finish will blend into these other background colours and this could make your vehicle less visible to other road users. Many of the principles that we explored with red cars could be equally applicable to green cars as well. If you really think about it, there are a lot of green road signs and lights on our roads, and it may be too easy to blend in with them. Another key problem is the amount of greenery around our towns and cities. Everyone enjoys more trees, shrubs, and grass, but they do make a green car far less visible on the road. A blue car would not make a very good colour choice if you're interested in safety. After all, the sky is blue, and a polished blue car finish would be somewhat like looking at the sky in a mirror. Also, during the night or low light conditions blue can blend in with black tarmac surfaces and that will reduce the cars visibility. This is especially true if the car has a darker shade of blue that’s quite close to black on the colour spectrum. Many taxis all over the world are covered in some sort of yellow paint job or at least a certain amount of yellow livery to make them stand out. This is not an accident; safety experts are well aware that a yellow car is highly visible in all types of lighting conditions, such as dawn, dusk, fog, rain, sunshine, and overcast. Yellow really stands out against the black of tarmac and the grey of pedestrian walkways making it a very safe choice. The colour yellow is excellent for safety because it provides such a dramatic contrast to any other colour seen around it and visibility is key when looking at road safety."
19,Do You Really Need a Regular Car Service?,autos-trucks," Many drivers ask this question; the primary reason for skipping a car service is to save a little money. However, this is a short term way of thinking, it may be possible to save a little money, but the cost could be much more in the medium to long term. Modern new cars can go for around three years before they need a service, but for every other car even those with a lower mileage a regular service is a must. Let’s take a look at why regular car service is essential for hassle-free safe driving. Why Does a Car Need a Service? If you’re already thinking about a car service in Perth, it’s likely that you have some concerns about how your car is performing. A regular car service is the only real method to determine if your vehicle is still operating as it should be. Perhaps you have lower fluid levels, or the oil hasn’t been changed in a while, and this can affect how your car behaves. When a vehicle isn’t maintained well, the performance will be compromised, components will fail prematurely, and the car will be less safe on the roads. Drivers may start to notice strange sounds, odd behaviour and a plethora of warning lights scattered across their dashboard. When these issues are ignored, the problem only gets worse over time, and it may cost far more to fix it later rather than sooner. How Will Your Car Benefit from a Regular Service? A car is a complex piece of machinery; it has electronic, electrical and mechanical moving parts that need to work in harmony. When one or more of these components fail, it can have a knock-on effect on the other parts in your car. However, regular servicing can detect many minor issues before they can develop into more extensive problems. Smaller issues are usually easier and cheaper to fix, and there are considerable perks to regular servicing. A well maintained and serviced car will handle better, the braking will be improved, the engine will run smoothly, and the fuel efficiency will be improved. It’s also worth mentioning that regular servicing will protect the value of your car in the future. If you can present a complete service history for your car when it comes time to sell you it will be easier to sell, and you’re more likely to get a buyer that will meet your price. Regular servicing demonstrates to a potential buyer that the car has been well looked after by you and this will improve their confidence to buy your car. How Can You Get Your Car Serviced? The car servicing that you need will depend on the servicing intervals and the mileage that’s been put on the car since the last service. A car should be serviced at least once per year or every 10-12k miles whichever comes first."
20,Car Sound System: How to Get Better Sound Quality Without Replacing It,autos-trucks," Even if a car sound system is a good investment for any vehicle, this device itself is not totally responsible for the audio quality you're gonna get. Learn more about it next. Having your own car is a dream coming true to many people. In these cases, they don't save any efforts - or money - to have the vehicle of their dreams. This doesn't apply only to the vehicle itself: putting a serious amount of cash into add ons it isn't rare at all. The thing is that even the world's best car sound system can't do anything alone. As a matter of fact, it's always going to depend on some add ons that play a huge role on the final audio quality you're gonna get. But that's not bad news at all: this also means that you can get a considerably advanced upgrade on your music quality without replacing your car sound system, and, therefore, without spending a three-digit (our even four-digit) amount. Learn all about everything that you can change and how it works next. How to improve my car sound system audio quality? As we said before, your car sound system doesn't work alone. As a matter of fact, this device itself has the three following sections: Source: where the music is coming from. Might be the radio, a CD, your cell phone's bluetooth connectivity, etc. Preamp: this section makes all the sound adjustments, such as volume, fading, balance and others. Amplifier: as the name says, this component amplifies the low voltage audio signal that comes from the preamp into a high voltage system, that goes out throughout the speakers. Therefore, you can see that the car sound system quality doesn't come from a single factor: it's a product from the interaction between them. Learn what you can change to improve it: Speakers Many people would love to have a car sound system so robust it would make DJs and sound professionals jealous. The problem is that such devices are expensive, and most people simply can't afford them. The good news is that you can find a pair of pretty good speakers for around $50, are just by replacing them you're gonna notice an impressive quality improvement - especially considering that factory ones are almost never good. If you're going down this road, keep in mind the not all speakers are the same. They are usually separated in two groups. If money it's not a problem, then the component models are the way to go: they are pricier, but are also known for top notch sound quality and how easy it is to have them installed. If you're going the budget-minded way or don't mind having a full range level sound quality, then the coaxial models will get the job done just fine. Amplifiers Even if most people tend to pay more attention to the speakers, since they are more visible, they would be too helpful without amplifiers - after all, if the sound isn't amplified correctly, even the world's greatest amplifier won't be able to deliver your music cleary. Just like the speakers, replacing an amplifier tends to be a lot cheaper than getting a whole new car sound system. Therefore, that's another great option for people who are in a tight budget, but expect to have top notch sound when driving. Subwoofer For some people, music is all about the bass. But even them don't know there's a component in every car sound system that's responsible for generating this kind of sound: it's called subwoofer, and can be installed in your vehicle whenever you add more speakers to your system. You could also opt for a powered one, but you'd lose the flexibility that comes with the speaker. The source of your music While this might come as a surprise to many people, all the pros that deal with car sound systems for a living know that your source - or, in other words, where your music comes from - play a major role in the final sound quality you're gonna get. The good news is that, since nowadays pretty much everyone abandoned CD's and just streams their music, many manufacturers are putting digital focused models in the market. In other words, this devices work with the particularities of digital models, in other to get the best sound possible out of them. If you mainly listen to music from your phone, you should definitely see them as a possibility. Your car itself As much as you love your vehicle, it might as well be making it harder for you to enjoy top quality music when driving. After all, even the world's finest car sound system won't surpass a noisy engine or bad acoustics. If that's your case, maybe it's time to abandon the DIY route and get a specialist to check your vehicle out. He might be able to come up with solutions to deal with whatever the problem is, allowing you to enjoy your music at any time."

1,A Brief 2018 Mazda 2 Sedan Review,autos-trucks," It’s been a while since the release of the Mazda 2 Neo sedan, and it’s time for some reflection with a review after extended use. The Mazda 2 sedan is a more practical choice over the hatch due to the extra boot space. But, many drivers may be wondering if the entry level Neo hits the sweet spot for features and value in the range. Let’s take a closer look at what the Mazda 2 Neo sedan has to offer the bargain conscious buyer. At a Glance The pricing is extremely competitive for a car with this feature set. The boot space is quite large for a smaller car and certainly bigger than it’s hatch stablemate. The look is smart and clean, and Mazda has taken steps to improve the road noise level. Some drivers may not like the lack of an infotainment system, and the rear seating area is very basic in terms of creature comforts. Going Deeper The 2018 Mazda 2 Neo sedan is the same price as the hatch variant, and yet it’s more practical thanks to the larger boot area. This entry level model is powered by a naturally aspirated 1.5L petrol engine that’s paired with a six speed automatic transmission. The claimed fuel economy is 5.5L/100km combined. A recent update added autonomous emergency braking (AEB) and rear parking sensors. If you want to upgrade there is some optional equipment available, such as satellite navigation, front parking sensors, and a rearview camera. As a Mazda, it should come as no surprise that the Neo sedan has a 5 star ANCAP safety rating. In the Cabin As we mentioned, there is no MZD touchscreen on this entry level model. Instead, you get a small black and white display that shows the current radio station tuning and the time. If you want infotainment, you will need to go for the next model up in the range, which is the Mazda 2 Maxx sedan. There is no centre armrest, but this is available as an option for a modest price. There is a manual handbrake, no enclosed storage, and a manual AC/heater unit. One nice touch at this price point is a compartment to house your phone along with USB, AUX and a 12v connector. Aesthetic Appeal The exterior has a clean design that could be described as a mixture of smart and cute at the same time. The wheel covers are functional, but they are an acquired taste, and we can see many drivers replacing them with aftermarket covers. If you want some nicer wheels, the Mazda 2 Maxx sedan and hatch are the models to go for. The trim level inside is on the basic side, with plenty of plastic and harder rubber. The materials fit well together, so the build quality is good, but make no mistake this is an entry level model trim level."
2,Why Auto Insurance Providers Care About Your Past Claims,autos-trucks," How your cases history influences your collision protection rates.

4,"Insurance, Blockchain & Oracles",autos-trucks," Here at Microinsurance we continue to explore blockchain, the world of ""a smart contracts"". It is our current belief that ‘smart contracts’ will be the core insurance uses-case for blockchain. Why is this? Because the MAIN thing that people buy when they take out insurance is a contract. Nothing more – insurance is a contract to pay if a set of events occur in the future and is within the bounds of said contract. Today, there is nothing wrong with the contracts that insurance companies use, well they are wordy and fully of small print, allow for ambiguity and generally need lawyers and administrators to navigate the many escape routes that are built in. So to introduce 'smart contracts' into the process takes tech and investment - two things that the insurance industry is slow to do. Insurance contracts should, on the face of it, be very simple. They should ensure that each party is dealt with fairly and each party receives and gives what they thought when it was signed. There are many instances where insurance companies fight claims and slow down payments. This is where smart contracts can fulfill a need. Welcome to the world of smart contracts, these contracts don’t leave the chance for interpretations. For insurance they enable so many benefits. The use of these contracts are now linked to the rise of blockchain and a change in technology and process that is still very young for many companies and, in many cases, at a pre-Proof of Concept (POC) stage in insurance companies. The use of blockchain in insurance is the tech game changer that is needed within the industry to bring straight through processing advantages to insurers and brokers. Smart contracts will, eventually, be used for sharing economy, gig economy, IoT and platform insurance. Making the process very transactional. The main idea behind the use of ‘smart’ in smart contracts is to use tech coding to determine the relations and obligations between parties and automatically administer these clauses and relationships. The contracts make possible to exchange money, property, shares, or basically anything of value in a transparent and non-conflicting way. Basically, the smart contracts have the trust built in. Add this to the idea of a decentralized blockchain network and you can start to see the power of these contacts within the insurance industry, especially around parametric and transactional insurance. The conflict of ambiguity is removed. The power of speed and volume enhanced. The term ""smart contract"" is widely associated with Ethereum or IBM. Currently the Ethereum smart contracts are the most popular. However, it is possible to create smart contracts on other Blockchain platforms. In 2018, a US Senate report said: ""While smart contracts might sound new, the concept is rooted in basic contract law. Usually, the judicial system adjudicates contractual disputes and enforces terms, but it is also common to have another arbitration method, especially for international transactions. With smart contracts, a program enforces the contract built into the code."" Other forms of smart contracts are Ricardian contracts. This form of contract maybe more relevant to the insurance industry. A definition, from its creator, says a Ricardian contract is ""a digital contract that deﬁnes the terms and conditions of an interaction, between two or more peers, that is cryptographically signed and veriﬁed. Importantly it is both human and machine readable and digitally signed"". This definition makes it very usable for insurance where both parties may want to use the contract from time to time. A Ricardian contract registers a legally valid and digitally connected document to a certain object or value. A Ricardian contract places all information from the legal document in a format that can be executed by software. In this way it is both a legal agreement between parties and a protocol that integrates an agreement offering a high level of security because of cryptographic identification. With a smart contract, a person could, for instance, have a hurricane insurance policy contract that is encoded in the block chain in the form of a set of rules. In case of the hurricane coming, the smart contract could then automatically transfer the claim money to the beneficiary. The Insurer may provide additional constraints, such as enabling the transfer only when the hurricane reaches certain intensity and tracks to a location within certain parameters etc. Since smart contracts’ conditions are based on data stored in the blockchain, they need only to rely on external services, which take data from the ""real"" world (e.g., from hurricane tracking and location tech) and push them to the blockchain (or vice versa). These services are referred to as ""oracles"". By considering this example, an oracle could inspect the presence of a hurricane’s track and intensity to identify whether the person/company (Insured) is eligible for a pay-out. This eligibility could also test against claims materials instantly read on the blockchain such as invoices or other records. This would then trigger an instant, automatic, payment."
5,Car DVD player installation: learn how to do it in a heartbeat!,autos-trucks," A car DVD player is the perfect device to keep everyone entertained, especially during long rides. Check out a few tips to install it correctly and get the most out of it. A lot of people seriously dread long drives. For them, there's one sole reason that makes them unbearable: boredom. As much as playing road games and chatting with other people is helpful, it can still be hard to watch the clock, feel like it's not moving and just hope to get to your destination. Good news is that, thanks to technology, there are plenty of devices to keep you, your family and friends entertained during trips. One of the most popular among them is the car DVD player: as the name says, it allows you to watch your favorite DVDs, in order for time to just fly. As useful as it can be, this device won't be that helpful if it's installed incorrectly. Fortunately, this task is far from being impossible: all you need to do is to follow the right steps. Check them out next: Pick the best car DVD player The first step in order to enjoy the most of your car DVD player is to pick the right model. The main difference between all the varieties in the market is the place where it gets installed in the vehicle: the overhead one, for example, is installed in the car's ceiling, between the two front seats. Among those who have kids, the headrest DVD is the most popular one. Instead of being placed in the vehicle's overhead, it's simply put on the back of the front seat headrests. This means they only those seated on the back get to watch it. This being said, it's essential to study all the models within your price range and think about which one will best satisfy your needs. Then, you can move on to the next step. Make sure to get a top notch car DVD player Just like car stereos, there are plenty of car DVD player manufacturers in the market, but that doesn't mean they're all reliable. Consequently, you'll also need to do your research about the best ones. Fortunately, there are plenty of car gear household names that are also players in the industry. Boss, for example, is not only know for the quality of their stereos, but also for their top notch car DVD players. The same goes for Pioneer, Sony, JBL and numerous others. It must be noted that, at times, buying a device from such brands might be more expensive that getting a product from a less known one. But the extra investment is totally worth it: the chances of you getting a defectuous item and having a hard time to have it repaired or exchanged drop dramatically. Decide the car DVD player's exact position If you pick and overhead car DVD player, you need to decide the exact area where you want your device to be. It's important to test and simulate numerous positions in order to find the best one, since once you pick it, there's no turning back. In order to do that, you can test making discrete marks with pencil or something else you can erase later. If it's an overhead device, drop the car's headline If you're getting and overhead car DVD player, you'll need to remove some of your vehicle's roof on the exact position where your device is going to be. This is necessary in order to install it with precision and do all the wiring. This, however, doesn't mean you'll just leave that hole in there. Right after you do it, you should place the bracket that came with your DVD player exactly where it is, which means some measuring will be necessary in order to avoid both a shortage or an excess of space. If it's a headrest model, plug it into an energy source If you're not exactly into the idea of having a portion of your vehicle cut out or doing all the wiring, there's an alternative: a clip on and clip off model. As the name says, all you need to do is position it in the way you want it and connect the cable to a source of energy, such as your cigarette lighter or USB port.  Apart from steering clear from all the mess and the hard work, these models have the advantage of allowing to to put it on multiple positions. If you don't mind keeping up with the task, the headrest model will require a procedure similar to the overhead one: you'll have to remove this part and put some holes in it. Connect the wires according to the manufacturer's instructions After preparing the area, you can start off the wiring. Keep in mind this has to be done according to the manufacturer's instructions: if not, you'll face image and sound troubles, which will be a total bummer to your experience. If you want to avoid that, it's recommended that you leave it for professionals from a car repair shop that you trust. If you choose to do so, all you need to do is enjoy your brand new car DVD player!"
6,A Brief 2019 Mazda CX-3 Review,autos-trucks," The Mazda CX-3 price offers a fantastic value proposition, and this popular model is getting a new release for 2019. Mazda knows their market, and they have their recipe for success here in Australia. So, there are no wholesale changes to report, but this small SUV still has a lot to offer. Let’s take a closer look at the latest Mazda CX-3 so that you can make an informed purchasing choice when it arrives in showrooms later this year. At a Glance Although there are no dramatic changes; subtle, incremental improvements have been made. There is still an eye catching style to enjoy, and the reverse camera is now a standard feature on every variant model. Speaking of different models, there is a wide selection of variant and engines available to choose from. Some drivers, may not enjoy the road noise that needs some improvement and there is still no smartphone mirroring. Trickle Down Technology In recent years, Mazda has taken significant steps to democratize their technology and make it far more available across their entire stable. Any new tech or safety equipment becomes available it will get rolled out across the entire range. Now in itself there is no real problem, every driver likes to gain access to the latest kit, but it can make a range of cars seem samey. The updated Mazda CX-3 suffers from this phenomenon to a certain extent as this is a mid range refresh and not an entirely new car. So, instead of a grand revamp that delivers an enormous impact, you get something far more subtle that needs to be examined carefully. There are many new features, such as a new grille insert, new LED tail-lights and new alloy wheels at the premium end of the range. However, if you blink, you would miss these changes and there even more subtle changes. The SkyActiv Engine The SkyActiv petrol engine in the Mazda CX-3 has been tweaked to generate 110 kW of power and 195 Nm of torque. This isn’t a massive change, but there has been a reduction in mechanical friction and the thermal management profile. There is a new piston profile, a set of new fuel injectors and a host of other changes under the bonnet that most of us would never notice. Mazda has stated that these changes have been made to increase the available torque across the entire revving range and also reduce the particulate emission figures. There is also a turbo diesel variant power plant that is only likely to account for 1% of the sales here in Australia. This engine has been increased from 1.5L to 1.8L with a new power figure of 85kW and an unchanged 270 Nm of available torque. A new rapid multi-stage fuel injection system and other changes will reduce noise pollution and fuel consumption."
7,3 Tips for the Best Used Carsales: Perth Wa Dealer Advice,autos-trucks," When they are thinking about the best carsales, Perth Wa based drivers will inevitably consider buying a used car. This is understandable; a used car will not depreciate in value like a newer model, it has a lot of recent technology and some of the latest safety features on board. However, buying a used car can be a challenge, and it’s easy to end up buying a car that you don’t really want or need. This can lead to buyers remorse, and the purchaser may end up regretting their choice. In this article, we will look at three top tips to ensure that you get the best used car buying experience.

Consider factors, such as manual or automatic, the fuel type, how many seats you need, fuel economy and anything else that’s important to you. Try to evaluate your needs now and what they may be in the near future and then the car will be able to grow with you over a few years. Once you know what you want, set a budget by adding up your income and deducting your outgoings. Don’t forget to factor in money for entertainment or you will regret buying the car.

However, this doesn’t tell the whole story, a Subaru car dealership will carry out checks to make sure that all the cars that they sell are roadworthy and safe to drive. If something does go wrong, there are more protections in place with a car dealer than a private seller. Also, you may be able to trade your existing car in towards the purchasing price, and there could be other incentives, such as insurance deals, extra equipment, and servicing, that could add considerable value. Once you have your needs assessed, your budget worked out, and you’ve chosen your preferred seller it’s time to narrow your search. It’s not necessary to have a single choice, but it’s a great idea to have a small pool of cars that you’re interested in. This will help you to find your car easily, but pay attention to the model, even within a car range there could be key differences between related cars."
8,5 Significant Factors You Should Consider Before Renting a Vehicle,autos-trucks," There are many reasons why people need to rent a huge truck or a van.

Many people overestimate or overlook the amount of space they need for transporting important goods or heavy equipment. Usually, most car rental companies provide you with a van or truck based on the items you are transporting and the amount of space needed to fit all your belongings.

Price The price of renting a van or a truck basically depends on the size of the vehicle, the distance it will be covering and the weather conditions are also taken into account. Most truck or van rental companies charge daily which is calculated how much distance it has covered per mile. The rates also vary based on the day, week and the time of a year. It is always recommended to rent a vehicle in the middle of the week rather than at the weekend as the prices are affordable at that time. In addition to all this, you may have to pay additional fees if you return the vehicle with an empty fuel tank. Insurance Although your house and car insurance policies may be able to offer some coverage, it is also advised to check with your car rental company to know whether they are providing anything extra. There may be some more rules, terms and conditions based on the kind of vehicle you have hired. Most car rental companies offer convenient insurance options like warranties for damage, insurance against liability, different kinds of cargo policies and auto tow protection which will take care of the maintenance related hassles. Packing and Unpacking There are many things you should keep in mind after renting a vehicle. You should pack the van or the truck without squeezing the items together. It is advised to load the heavy appliances and items at the front portion of the vehicle first. You should also choose the boxes carefully and packing cases of same sizes and weights are recommended so that they can be stacked on top of each other. The heavy and the largest items should be placed at the bottom, medium-weight items in the middle and the lighter items on the top. If possible, you should also bring a few extra cars to fit the extra items. Book in Advance It is not wise to wait till until the last minute to book a van or a truck. The quicker you reserve a car the greater the chances of getting a high-quality vehicle. No wonder, most people prefer to book the vehicle they are going to hire, a month or at least a week in advance. There are particular times in a year, especially in the hot summer months; it gets exceptionally difficult to rent a car as more people will be renting cars in advance."

Take care of your tyres Check your tyre pressure at regular intervals and keep them inflated to the recommended pressure specified in your user manual. Another thing to look out for is uneven wear. If you have properly maintained the tyre pressure, then uneven wear might suggest that it is time for wheel realignment. Uneven wear also suggests worn-out brakes or shock absorbers, a bent wheel or internal tyre damage. Also have your wheel alignment checked every 50,000 km. Improper wheel alignment shortens the life of your tyres as well as causes steering problems. See if your steering is stiffer than usual or if your car pulls to one side. If it does, you need to have your wheel alignment checked. Clean your car engine Wash your engine at least every year. A clean engine runs cooler than a dirty one. A clean engine also enables you to easily spot leaks and service its components. You may have your engine professionally steam cleaned or you may opt to do it yourself. In this case, make sure you protect sensitive engine components including the air intake, distributor and electrical parts with plastic bags before getting started. You may use a grease-cutting detergent and a bristle brush to scrub the engine. Make sure to rinse thoroughly once done. Change spark plugs Many manufacturers recommend changing spark plugs every 50, 000 km. This ensures good fuel mileage and high engine performance. Maintain your car battery It does not matter if the manufacturer claims that the battery is maintenance-free, you still have to regularly check your car battery to extend its life. Start by keeping your battery terminals clean. You may wipe it with a damp rag with some detergent if needed. Also check the battery case for any sign of damage. Cracks or bulges are signs that your car battery needs to be replaced. Select a reliable car insurer No matter how careful you are, accidents or damages are inevitable. In this case, you need to have a car insurer you can trust. Choose a car insurer who replaces damaged parts only with original parts from the manufacturer and who can give you guarantees on repairs."
10,Let's Make Your Old Car New Again,autos-trucks," The wear and tear of seemingly ordinary, day to day driving can take its toll on even the most cautious of drivers. Nicks, scratches, dents, chips, and the like, can etch the surface of your car like an acid, marring the pristine finish it had when you drove it off the lot. These unwanted (and yet inevitable) scars are the proud automobile owner’s nightmare, but can be easily remedied by way of the talents of a professional auto detailer. Those long bouts of highway driving we are all subjected to from time to time, can be as frustrating for the drone of the open road as much as they are for the caked layer of insects which inevitably grace the hood, bumpers, windshields, and grills of a once clean car. It’s an annoyance most easily absolved through a thorough automobile detailing. A good auto detailer can polish, buff, and wax your car back into the condition you remember it, and the condition you deserve it to be in. Of course, you might say, professional automotive detailing is not a necessity, I can scrub and polish my own car, thank you very much."" But this can be a dangerous misconception. Using the wrong equipment, or using improper techniques, or unqualified persons to work on your car can actually do more harm than good. Cheap shampoos, soaps, scrub brushes and such, can wear down the quality of your automobile’s paint job, leaving it more spotted, tarnished, and lusterless.

In the hands of a good detailer, your car can gain back the brilliance it once had, and had subsequently lost through the trials and tribulations of everyday use.

We can all recall that new car smell, that fresh-off-the-lot fragrance that has burned its way into all car drivers’ memories; it’s one of the saddest truths about regular car use that this smell represents cleanliness, and whose only hope of recovery can be through cleanliness. automotive detailing is your best bet to improving the look and feel of your car is by utilizing the efforts of a good detailer. A full auto detailing will appease that nagging guilt you feel whenever the sun comes out and all the blemishes of a once fine automobile are exposed for every prying eye to see. His expertise can do what the rest of us folk have neither the time nor the equipment to accomplish – and he might just have you, if not enjoying, at the very least, dreading that unavoidable rush-hour just a little bit less."
11,Some Thief Stole My Tools From My Van! Here’s what I did about it.,autos-trucks," I’m not a tradesman. I don’t make my living in construction or home remodeling but I do like to fix things and occasionally I tackle a larger job like building a shed. Last summer I gathered up my assortment of tools – cordless drill & circular saw, tool box of assorted screw drivers & wrenches, carpenter’s level, etc. and put them in my van. On the way to the property where I was building my shed I stopped off at my local big-box home improvement store for some joist hangers and nails. When I got back to my van I put my key in the lock as usual and climbed inside. The very first thing I noticed upon entering the cab was the distinct stench of heavy body odor and stale cigarette smoke lingering in the air. I thought this was odd as no one but myself had been in my van for several weeks. I quickly looked around and noticed that my glove box was ajar. Then it hit me. Someone had been inside my van just minutes ago! When I looked in the back of my van all of my tools were gone! I was pissed! I looked around the parking lot and saw nothing suspicious. The thief was long gone. I suspect the thief just grabbed what he could quickly grab and then made his get-a-way. I looked at my door locks and they showed no signs of having been tampered with. Had I simply forgotten to lock my door or did the thief somehow jimmy the lock open without damaging it? I don’t know. Worthless Security Cameras I went back into the store and asked to speak to someone from ""security."" The clerk called a Loss Prevention Agent and after I explained that my tools were just stolen from my van he agreed to search the store’s security surveillance video to see if we could spot the person or persons who broke into my van. You would think that a major nationwide retailer would have security camera coverage of their entire parking lot, but I was surprised to see that their security cameras only captured video of the entrance and did not extend very far out into the parking lot where I had parked. I had just lost around a thousand dollars of tools and had zero suspect info. I was crestfallen. Millions & millions of dollars Lost No one knows for sure but each year in the United States millions and millions of dollars worth of tools – maybe even a BILLION DOLLARS worth of tools, are stolen from vehicles and job sites. Many of these thefts are not reported as there is often no real suspect information and the loss is not covered by insurance. According to the National Crime Information Bureau (NCIB), as much as $1 billion a year is lost nationwide due to theft of construction equipment and tools–and the recovery rate is less than 20 percent. PREVENT – DETER – APPREHEND It cost over $2,000 to replace my stolen tools and I vowed to never to be a victim again. I wanted to prevent and deter any future theft and if someone was brazen enough to steal my tools again, I wanted a fighting chance of catching the thief. Here’s what I did: I bought an engraver and engraved my name and phone number in several places on every tool. I engraved: ""This tool belongs to Howard F. Jeb phone XXXXXXXXXX. If you are about to buy this tool, it is stolen."" Now, my tools might look weird with all this etching on them, but they function just fine and it won’t be easy for a crook to sell them. Hopefully, a crook will leave them alone once he sees the very prominent engravings. I looked into placing a small GPS tracking device on my more valuable tools but found that there are currently no reasonably priced tracking devices available. I looked at the Milwaukee ""Tick"" tracker and learned that it is really just a Bluetooth tracker intended to aid in finding misplaced tools. It is not small enough to hide on the tool and will not track the tool if it is moved beyond a 100-300 yard range. Even with all the advancements in GPS tracking no one has yet discovered how to squeeze a radio receiver, a microprocessor, a transmitter and a battery to run it, into a small enough size so you can hide a GPS tracker on or in a $250. circular saw. I installed a metal divider behind my van’s driver’s seat and locked it with a sturdy padlock. Now, even if  someone gets into the cab they will have to use tools to break into the cargo area. I installed after market locks on all my van doors and security mesh on the back and side windows. This should act as a deterrent and cause the crook to move onto an easier target. I also bought a little motion sensitive alarm online for $49.99 that synced to my smart phone. I attached this alarm on the inside of the driver’s door. When the door is opened, the alarm senses motion and instantly sends me an ""alert"" letting me know that motion has been detected. I now almost instantly know if someone opens my door. I will then rush out to my van and use all reasonable force necessary to subdue and detain the thief for authorities. Some of my theft prevention efforts like the steel divider, fortified door locks, and window mesh cost me some money but the engraver and motion sensing alarm were relatively inexpensive. Overall, the cost of everything was worth it. I never again want to feel the sinking feeling of knowing that some creep invaded my vehicle and stole the tools that I bought with my hard earned money."

13,Exploring the 2018 Mazda CX-9 Active Safety Features,autos-trucks," The Mazda CX-9 price offers a tremendous value proposition for drivers. However, one area that some people ignore is the number of active safety features on board to help as we drive. In fact, many car manufacturers are now fitting active safety equipment to their cars, and these systems are becoming more technologically advanced and easier to use. In this article, we will take a closer look at active safety features on the 2018 Mazda CX-9 to help you make a smart purchasing decision. Active Radar Cruise Control On other cars, this is often known as adaptive cruise control, and it’s a system of linked radar-based sensors and cameras that will help you maintain a safe speed. The system will calculate the cruising speed based on the car in front, and a safe distance can be easily maintained. The minimum operating speed is 30 km/hr, so this is best used on open roads and highways. This sort of system is less useful in fog or heavy rainfall as those environmental conditions can affect how the sensors operate. Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) Every modern car that you consider buying should have AEB installed as standard. This is an extremely useful active safety feature that every driver should have access to. Essentially, a radar or camera-based system will judge the speeds between moving vehicles and work to apply brakes automatically if the driver does not respond quickly enough. There are four main types of AEB systems in common use, they are: Low Speed: This will detect other vehicles in front of the car in the city to prevent crashes at lower speeds. Highway Speed: This will scan up to 200m in front to mitigate or prevent a higher speed collision. Pedestrian Braking System: As the name would suggest, this system detects the presence of pedestrians and cyclist and then brakes automatically to avoid colliding with them. Reversing AEB: This AEB works in reverse at lower speeds to avoid hitting a person or obstacle. Advanced Blind Spot Monitoring This is a radar based detection system that will keep a blind spot under constant surveillance. It will detect the approach of a vehicle that is coming up on your shoulder and then displays a light to warn you of the approach. A more advanced system on the CX-9 will even issue an audible warning to the driver if they attempt to make a lane change into the path of the vehicle located in the blind spot. In fact, in many more advanced cars, an unsafe maneuver of this type would be blocked entirely. In the future, as these systems become even more advanced, the detection distances may be increased, and this will give the driver even more options to avoid a collision."
14,Custom RV Skirting,autos-trucks," RV skirting isn’t a new invention, but it’s not one that many RV owners use. Before learning about skirting, RV owners often question whether or not it’s of any value or real benefit. However, after learning about the surprising benefits of skirting, it doesn’t take RV owners long to recognize its worth. Below are the top benefits of putting a custom skirt on an RV. Lower Energy Costs RVs are also called motorhomes with good reason; they are a home away from home. Unfortunately, RVs also come with energy bills the same as any house. Custom RV skirting reduces energy bills significantly by increasing insulation. The bottom of every RV is several inches or feet above the ground. The empty space between an RV and the ground is a space in which heat and coolness leave an RV; custom skirting prevents that from happening. Increased Storage Space The empty space under a parked RV is usually also wasted space. Typically, exposure to the elements makes the space below a motorhome unusable. Custom skirting turns the empty, exposed space into one that’s protected from both the elements and small animals. With the space beneath an RV protected, it’s easily used to store camping gear and other items. RV Protection Not only is the space below an RV protected with custom skirting, but the RV itself is also protected. This benefit, in particular, applies to long term storage of a motorhome. When RVs sit parked in one spot for a season, particularly winter, they’re exposed to the elements of rain, snow, ice, and sun. Over time, exposure to the elements causes lasting damage to the undercarriage of an RV. Custom skirting provides RVs with an added layer of protection during long term storage. Year Round Use Winter sees the greatest decrease in motorhome use. Freezing temperatures and difficulty maintaining RV warmth are the primary reasons why RVs are stored during the winter. Looking back at the first benefit, custom skirting makes it more affordable to keep an RV warm during the winter. In fact, when used properly, RV skirting reduces heat loss by as much as 25% which means motorhomes stay much warmer during winter use. Not sold on the four benefits above? How about the fact that RV skirts are the latest in motor home fashion? RV skirting provides more benefits than those discussed here; many of them you’ll discover for yourself."

16,Can You Still Buy a Subaru Forester Diesel from Car Dealers? Perth Expert Advice,autos-trucks," When they visit their Subaru car dealer Perth drivers looking for a diesel variant may be surprised to discover that they are not available. If you’ve been out of the car market for a while, this could come as a shock, but it’s part of a general trend that we’ve seen across the entire car industry. Let’s take a closer look at the issue involved and how the situation could develop further in the future. The Subaru Shift from Diesel This may come as a surprise, but Subaru has been gradually moving away from diesel-powered vehicles for almost a decade now. Every year we’ve seen a decreasing number of diesels released, and this is part of a wider trend. Subaru has been looking more toward a future where increase emission demands would significantly affect how their diesel engines can compete. It seems that Subaru (and every other car manufacturer) will now be moving across to hybrid vehicles as we move into the future. The Subaru Casualties The first recent casualty in this shift to a new powertrain was the Subaru Forester 2.0L diesel. This car was discontinued earlier this year when the next generation Forester was released here in Australia during Q3. However, this was only the beginning, and other fan favourites soon followed. Both the 2.0L petrol and 2.5L turbo petrol Foresters were also discontinued shortly after. In fact, there is now a single 2.5L turbocharged engine choice left amongst the 2019 Foresters four variant range. Transmission Changes For those lamenting the loss of diesel and certain petrol power plants that’s not where the changed actually end. We have also seen the discontinuation of an increasing number of manual transmission variants for the Forester. In fact, the entire new generation Forester range is only available with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Is This a Permanent Change? Subaru has not ruled out a return of any engine type for a future Forester release here in Australia or elsewhere. We may see the return of the popular EE20 diesel ""boxer"" style engine somewhere else in the Subaru lineup. This engine is currently available on a pair of the Outback variants where is generates 110kW of power and 350 Nm as you would expect. However, any return or use of this diesel engine should probably be regarded as a last hurrah before we see a more widespread adoption of hybrid. Subaru has already stated that all development on their diesel engine has now ceased and we are not likely to see and future refinements. A Brighter Future The Forester is set to have a bright future with a hybrid drivetrain developed during a partnership with Toyota. We can expect plug-in hybrid variants in the future that should be a good indicator of the company health as we move forward."

18,A Brief 2019 Subaru Forester Review,autos-trucks," The Subaru Forester price represents a fantastic value proposition for those drivers that want a great SUV that offers something extra. This model looks very similar to the outgoing Forester, and this isn’t entirely surprising when you consider its popularity with the Aussie SUV buying public. However, a car manufacturer must continue to maintain forward progress to stay competitive. So, have Subaru changed just enough to entice potential buyers to make a purchase? Let’s find out. A Quick Overview As one would expect from a Subaru car, we have a wealth of safety features on board that more that justify the 5 star ANCAP safety rating. Also, as a Subaru, we have a full all wheel drive system in place that is tried and tested. The passenger door aperture is extra wide, and the four cylinder petrol engine is extremely fuel efficient for the segment at 7.4L/100km combined. Some people may not like the three year warranty and 12,500 km servicing intervals. The Subaru Global Platform The 2019 Subaru Forester is now underpinned by the Subaru Global Platform for the very first time. At a first visual glance, the changes are extremely subtle, but they are there if you’re at familiar with the outgoing model. The main benefit of using this platform has been the ability to use a wider range of configurations and yet still use the same powertrains. This is not particularly noticeable by the buyer, but in real terms, it has given us a Forester that’s both safer and larger. The older turbocharged petrol and diesel engines are now officially gone, and they have been replaced with a naturally aspirated powertrain instead. Examining the New Forester Design The pricing has been increased for the new Forester lineup, but to be fair to Subaru, there has been a quantum leap forward in terms of specification and design. At the front end, we now find C-shaped LED daytime running lights and LED headlights across the entire range. Better specified models get a matrix LED set of lights instead. The bonnet and front guards are now made from alloy to reduce weight without compromising strength. The lower fog light cluster is different, and the tail light now has a C-shaped hooped design complete with an LED cluster. The 2.5i and 2.5i-L both have 17"" alloys wheels, and the 2.5i Premium and 2.5i-S are shod with 18"" alloy wheels that have a larger sized brake rotor. This is a bigger Forester, the length is now 4,625mm (up by 15mm), the width is now 1,815mm (up by 20mm), and the wheelbase is now 2,770mm (up by 30mm). Given the larger size, one could be forgiven for thinking that the new Forester would be hard to maneuver. In fact, the turning circle is only 10.8m, which is impressive for an all wheel drive SUV."
19,Do You Need a Truck Rack?,autos-trucks," Your truck is a very reliable and useful vehicle for transporting a good number of tools, equipment, and hardware, but the inside of your truck is limited for space. Large equipment such as ladders, or hardware such as lumber won't always fit in the back of your vehicle, making a truck rack an invaluable asset for these sort of awkward to move items. When a truck rack is purchased and installed well, it becomes a utility that you wish you'd invested into a long time ago. At first glance you would think that a truck rack only has one purpose, and that being of course, to move big objects around effectively. There are more tangible benefits to having a truck rack, some of which are outlined below. Truck racks provide the ability to elevate the value of your truck's transportation element, move things around safer and more secure, save time by making less trips between starting and end points, and actually improve the look of your vehicle."
20,Recall for 2018 Subaru Outback and Liberty,autos-trucks," Sadly, around 5,000 crossover wagons and sedan cars have been recalled recently for a potential fault involving the driving range readings. Subaru Australia has issued the recall specifically for the 2018 Subaru Outback and Liberty models. Why has this happened and how could this affect you? Let’s delve a little deeper and find out what’s going on. The Combination Meter Display (CMD) Subaru has reported that the Outback and Liberty models could have a programming error. This faulty code is located in the CMD, and this can cause the driving range indicator to be less accurate. The CMD is vital to get an accurate distance for refuelling purposes, and a bad reading could leave a driver stranded with no fuel. However, Subaru is keen to point out that the low fuel warning light still illuminates if the level of fuel drops to a critically low point. This May Affect Certain Drivers More Many drivers of modern cars that are replete with all manner of visual feedback devices can quickly begin to rely on them. This is also the case with the CMD and those drivers paying attention to the low fuel warning light will not get caught out. Having said that, the CMD is a useful piece of equipment and Subaru understand that the error needs to be corrected. After all, if the car does run out of fuel when you least expect it you the engine may well stall and it cannot be restarted. Under certain conditions, this could be a safety issue for the vehicle occupants and other road users. The Scale of the Problem Subaru has recalled 4,096 Outback and 1,187 Liberty models so far, and a VIN list of affected vehicles can be easily found online. The affected build dates are the beginning of the MY18 production cycle up until the 1st August this year. The owners have been contacted and advised to not rely on their CMD for an accurate driving range figure. The necessary CMD reprogramming will not be available until February 2019 at the earliest. Subaru Australia has made it clear that they will be contacting the owners of the affected cars again once the systems are in place to fix the problem. Of course, this work will be carried out free of charge, and every effort will be made to get the problem fixed quickly. What Happens Next? At the moment it’s going to be a waiting game until the reprogramming can begin sometime in February next year. Until that time, drivers of affected Outback and Liberty models will have to be careful in how the fill and use their cars. Relying on the CMD at this moment is obvious a bad idea, and it will be necessary to check the low fuel warning light more often. Keeping your fuel topped off will also be an effective strategy to avoid becoming stranded."

2,Top Four Large Scale Model Cars,autos-trucks," Scales and Models The particular production of model vehicles are done within varying dimensions and that implies a reduction in the specific measurement of Large model cars.

The shape and also styles for brand vehicle products and solutions consistently can vary. They are generally 1:8 scale brand automobile products, 1:72 scale devices, a 1:48 scale, 1:35 scale military services devices, and many others. All these scales will allow you to get puzzled, but finding out how they operate is definitely effortless. Precisely how Modelers Use Scales • 1:35 scale is mainly utilized for army automobiles plus comes along with a huge selection of machines and pieces that happens to be created by different vendors. 1:35 scale military models could be traced back to earlier motor-driven tanks which sets were made of plastic. The manufacturers some time past uncovered that range as being fantastic simply because it made it possible to the devices to accommodate the gearboxes along with the electric powered motors. • 1:48 scale models are used by a lot of firms meant for die-cast production due to its popularity in the construction of plastic-type material products. The 1:48 scale could also be implemented to make diecast military automobiles. This scale is as well used for the manufacturing of gadgets meant for brand trains. All these devices had been regularly used simply by modelers of an airplane over a long period of time till that started to be a brand new scale that was put into practice by modelers of military services vehicles. • Model trains can be accomplished in an array of scales. They might be created in 1:80 scale devices and as much as 1:45 scale varieties.

The majority of modelers nowadays still prefer to make use of the 1:35 military brand scale. They attribute the preference on the indisputable fact that the 1:35 scale is good for capturing specifics which often is an excellent fit in for the products. Models which are usually developed making use of the 1:35 scale usually tend to show a considerable amount of specifics free of taking up much space when positioned on the display screen stand."

4,A Brief Guide to Cyber Liability Insurance,autos-trucks," Today, even conventional businesses rely on the internet to conduct their activities. However, this does increase the risk of security issues and create a need for cyber insurance. If you’re still unsure about whether your business needs cyber liability insurance, we’ll explore this topic a little further here. The Cyber Liability Insurance Basics Cyber insurance is designed to provide businesses with protection against Internet-based risks. It can also be used to cover risk relating to IT activities and infrastructure. This type of cover can be used to limit the damage that is caused by successful attempts to access your data. So, if you’re concerned about having your social media account hacked or someone stealing your client’s data, you may need to consider cyber insurance. Does Your Business Need Cyber Liability Insurance? Australia based business owners may wonder if cyber insurance should be added to their overall package. In simple terms, if you need to handle sensitive customer information such as names, addresses and bank details, or you rely on computer systems for your business operation, you need to ensure that your business is not compromised in the event of security breaches. Some business owners feel their operation is too small to necessitate cyber insurance, but cybercrime is on the increase. Most policies can be tailored to suit your specific business needs to provide protection against loss suffered if personal identifiable information is stolen, leaked or lost. What Does it Cover? Cyber insurance can provide cover for a range of security breaches including data breaches resulting from employee theft, breaches from equipment loss, denial of service attacks, breaches caused by hacking, or cyber business interruption. Reducing Cyber Security Risk When determining whether you should invest in cyber insurance, you need to consider the potential risks for your business and if there are any ways to reduce them. Even a large company with a dedicated IT security department can be at risk of a data breach, but there can be ways to reduce the threat. Measures can include: ●	Regular Staff Training: Hacking techniques are continually developing, so it is vital that your team are up to date with all the latest threats. ●	Portable Device Security: You can limit the chances of laptops, mobile devices, and data storage being lost in public and increasing the risk of hacking, by keeping devices at work. Although it may not be possible to always keep your business devices at your work premises, it is worth considering. ●	Data Encryption: This is a different technique compared to passwords. It involves scrambling hard disk data, so it is only possible to access it using a decryption key. This is considered to be far safer compared to standard password protection. A data loss or leak can be a massive problem for any business, from a shut down of servers preventing your business from operating to PR problems caused by a loss of consumer confidence. This can be negated by cyber insurance. If you would like to find out more about cyber liability insurance, Australia based GSK is here to help. Our team would be delighted to answer any queries you may have to help you find the ideal cyber liability insurance for your unique business needs."
5,"Smart Questions for Your Insurance Broker, Perth Business Owners Should Ask",autos-trucks," When considering insurance brokers, Perth business owners often think that every broker offers the same service. Unfortunately, this is not the case, and you need to ensure that you choose the right broker for your business. So, here are some smart questions business owners should be asking their insurance broker Perth, to ensure that they’re protected. Can You Provide Services for My Business? This may seem like a very generic question, but it should be asked of any insurance broker. Perth business owners need to appreciate that their business is unique, so their broker should take the time to understand the full extent of their business activities. A great broker will find the best description for your business activities to ensure that you have full coverage. What Will be Covered by Public Liability Insurance? You’re likely to be aware that your business needs public liability cover. This can include property damage and personal injury cover for non-employees. However, what is and is not covered by public liability will depend on your policy and business circumstances. A good insurance broker will be able to provide you with specific answers to provide you with a better illustration of your risk profile. What Will I Need to Supplement my Public Liability Policy? Each insurance policy is different, and there will be exclusions not covered by your public liability insurance policy. There are some risks that insurers do not cover with standard public liability. This can include issues relating to poor workmanship, fraud or contractual liability. The best insurance brokers in Perth will help you to understand where your coverage is lacking and whether or not you need additional protection. Your broker should assess your risk profile, business type, business size, and overall affordability to determine what other policies are needed to protect your business. While it is not always possible or practical to cover all business risks, the best brokers will provide guidance as to which are the most important priorities. This could include income protection, commercial property insurance, cyber insurance, product liability, indemnity insurance, commercial vehicle insurance, and workers compensation. How Much Public Liability Insurance is Enough? Depending on the size of your business and the risks faced, your broker will be able to guide you through the typical cover levels for public liability insurance. The most common cover limits for Australian small businesses are $5 million, $10 million and $20 million, but this may not be appropriate for your business. In fact, the best brokers will break down the costs and benefits of each cover level, so you can enjoy maximum protection. For example, it is often quite inexpensive to increase your cover from 5 million to 10 million, which could benefit your business risk profile. Can You Package Public Liability with Other Policies? One of the main advantages of using a great insurance broker is that your broker can package your insurance policies together. In certain occupations, it is possible to combine public liability with professional indemnity insurance in addition to other policies. However, some brokers can’t seem to appreciate how beneficial this can be for business owners. If you’re considering insurance brokers, Perth-based GSK is here to help.

6,Looking at the Subaru Outback: Crossovers Explained,autos-trucks," When they are looking for a Subaru Outback for sale, drivers may encounter some terms that they are not familiar with. In the old days, we only had Utes and SUVs to consider, but now we have more options to choose from. In recent years, we have seen the rise of a new type of vehicle; the crossover and this car type is growing in popularity. Is a crossover a small SUV, a four wheel drive car or a high riding wagon? Let’s take a closer look at the crossover concept so that you can make an informed buying decision. The Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) Origins The SUV is the vehicle that first introduced the crossover moniker into the car industry. The Subaru Outback and Volvo Cross Country vehicles were the first cars that were regarded as crossing over from one category into a different one. This is because these cars were four wheel drive variants on two wheel drive wagons. Since then, things have progressed, and now the crossover term is even more defined. Now in the US market, it’s used to distinguish between off road wagons (SUVs) and high riding wagons based on cars, which are now known as crossover utility vehicles (SUVs). The Australian Angle Here in Australian, the car industry officially labels SUVs as off road vehicles. However, wagons that are based on full ladder frames as SUVs, for example, the Toyota LandCruiser, are referred to as 4WDs. A wagon that is based on a unibody or monocoque chassis, for example, the Toyota Kluger (based on the Camry), are considered to be crossovers. To complicate matters further, the market has fragmented, and car manufacturers are continually developing new vehicle niches to keep us guessing. One recent development has been a number of SUVs or crossovers that only come in front wheel drive at the entry level. The Crossover Evolution There are now even more variants becoming available to the car buying public. Recently we have seen SUV coupe crossover cars that have a coupe body combined with a higher riding height and all wheel drive capability, such as the Mercedes GLC and GLE and the BMW X2, X4 and X6 series. Some of these vehicles are powered with high output AMG and M series engines, making them into crossovers with high performance aspirations. A recent release from Range Rover is the Evoque Convertible, which takes an SUV and develops it into a Cabrio style cruiser with real off road credentials. In Australia, perhaps the most pertinent example of this trend would be the new breed of utes that combine premium five seater family cars with 4WD capability or smaller 1 tonne utes that are now three way crossovers. Industry insiders have tried to predict where this will lead, but this is hard to do, and we are seeing new developments all the time."
7,The 2018 Mazda 2 GT Automatic Reviewed,autos-trucks," When they think about the Mazda 2, Perth based drivers can be forgiven for dismissing the GT moniker. After all, the Mazda 2 is a well respected and popular small car, but it’s hardly a grand touring machine. In this case, the GT variant has more to do with providing a premium grade feature set in the small car segment. As such, the Mazda 2 sedan and hatch with the GT badging offer more for a small jump in price. Let's’ take a look at what this car has to offer so that you can make the right purchasing choices. A Look at the Basics This latest Mazda 2 GT reviewed here is the automatic version that sits above the Genki at the top of the range. This makes it the flagship of the range; it has a smart interior, great tech on board and a comprehensive feature set. The car is fun to drive, it has precise, agile handling, and the engine is well matched to the auto gearbox. Apart from the Soul Red colour, the metallic paint is offered as standard, and there is a five year warranty in place. Some drivers may not like the limited rear, and the tyre noise could be less pronounced at higher speeds. The Specification Levels The Mazda 2 Genki has plenty of equipment that also appears on the GT variant, such as: LED headlights, LED fog lamps, daytime running lights, satellite navigation, a heads up display, keyless start, blind spot monitoring with a rear cross traffic alert, electric folding side mirrors, rear sensors, rain sensors, front and rear autonomous emergency braking, a 7"" MZD Connect infotainment touchscreen and 16"" alloy wheels. The Mazda GT Additions There is no extra equipment fitted to the GT, but it does have some interesting features that place it firmly in the premium category. The inclusion of metallic paint as standard is a rare occurrence in any car segment and only the Soul Red option costs extra. The upholstery has also been upgraded to a two tone mix black leather and suede (sedan models) or white leather and black cloth (hatch models). The soft touch materials have white stitching that is evenly applied across the passenger side dashboard, front door armrest, and centre console area. The gear lever, handbrake and steering wheel are all covered in leather similar to that found on the Mazda 6 and CX-5. The cabin certainly has a more premium feel compared to the Mazda Genki and the competition. Under the Bonnet Despite having the same 1.5L four cylinder petrol engine found under the bonnet of every car in the Mazda 2 range, there are some changes to enjoy. The Mazda 2 GT has been tuned to be slightly more powerful than its siblings. The engine now generates 81kW of power and has 141 Nm of torque available. This is the same tuning found on the Mazda MX-5 roadster, and it helps give the Mazda 2 GT a spritely and agile level of performance. This is enhanced even further with a Sport Mode that is useful when travelling at high speeds at the expense of some of the refinement."

Keep in mind that CAI is an aftermarket association of parts that will help the engine to make the pulled air cooled or dense. After that it allows the air to get mixed with the fuel that in return will produce more power. Another way to pump up the power of the engine is to reduce the weight of the vehicle. As you might have noticed that light weight cars will actually more much lighter. And for this you should prefer to replace the heavier counterparts of the vehicle. So prefer to change the engine block and opt for the lighter components. Other than that you should try to get rid of the extra seats, and simply throw out extra and unused things out of the vehicle.

Next tip that will help you to optimize the overall mileage of your vehicle is to treat the accelerator pedal and brake pedals with lots of respect. And try to be smooth while driving the vehicle. It will help you to optimize the overall mileage. The next thing that you should prefer to do to pump up the power of the vehicle is to attach the cat back performance exhaust systems for cars. Keep in mind that when you will combine a high-flow cat converter along with exhaust setup. Then it will automatically increase the airflow supply or torque of the vehicle to improve its horsepower. Actually, you should know that it works simply by pushing the gases out of the exhaust much faster, and then making more space for air/fuel. Next fact about which most people really don’t know about is that they can simply increase the efficiency of fuel by keeping their windows up and turning on the air conditioner. Actually the fuel efficiency of vehicles will decrease when the air will circulate within the vehicle. So that’s why you should know that open windows of cars, especially at high speeds could have a great impact on overall fuel efficiency and it will drain out the tank much quicker due to amplified drag."

To help our customers get the most out of their Nissan X-Trail, we have three top tips for driving on sand. 1, Tyre Pressures are Important When you drive on sand, the pressure in your tyres is arguably the most crucial factor. It will determine the successful negotiation of the terrain. The pressure should be set to take into account your particular model; it’s weight and the tyre sizes you are using. Remember that sand as a terrain feature is quite different because it is always moving under your tyres. As you near the water's edge the sand will be much firmer and easier to drive on and up in the dunes, it could be very soft indeed. Experimentation may be necessary, but as a rule of thumb try setting your tyre pressures at the 20psi mark. You can go lower, but going below 16psi could increase the chances of rolling the tyre off the rim entirely. Always remember to take your tyres back up to a safe pressure before returning to a regular road surface. When you soft road on sand it’s inevitable that sooner or later you will get stuck. This happens to the best off road drivers, it’s nothing to be ashamed, and it’s a common price to pay for driving on sand. When this happens you will know; stop trying to drive out of it because that will only dig you in deeper. You could try to reverse out, and this may work if you’re lucky and your tyres have created a ramp in the sand. If you are really bogged in you will need to get your shovel and dig your way out. Dig a shallow ramp, take your time, drive slowly and you will escape. Every off road recovery kit should contain some traction aids to help if you get really stuck on the beach. Once you’ve dug a ramp with your shovel, you can place these traction aids in front of the wheels to give you some much needed help. They should be negotiated using gentle and even acceleration to break free and move forward to a safe stopping point. Then you can recover the traction aids and shovel in case you get stuck again later.

11,Nissan Finance Advice: Examining Different Car Financing Options,autos-trucks," Buying a new car or even a pre-owned model can be an exhilarating and nerve wracking experience at the same time. Here at Perth City Nissan, we understand that a car is a major purchase and financing will usually be necessary. Nissan finance is available is a variety of different forms in order to give our customers a product that will suit their needs bests. Let’s take a closer look at some of the usual methods that are used to finance the purchase of a car. A Car Loan This could also be a personal loan, depending upon the lender and the best available rates. This is a simple financial product to understand, and many people have had a bank loan at some point in their lives. Depending upon your particular circumstances a load could be offered as secured or even unsecured. A secured loan will be closely tied to the product that you’re buying, in this case, a car and if the payments are not made the bank can take the car in lieu of payment. A lender will often offer a lower interest rate for this type of loan, and they may be able to lend more if you have security. An unsecured loan will require less paperwork, and it’s often much easier to get. This comes at a price, these types of loans will have a higher interest rate to cover the extra risk. The amounts available on these types of loans are usually lower, and this could affect your car buying choices. Typically car loans can be obtained from banks or other financial institutions. A car loan can be obtained for a new vehicle and for cars up to seven years old in certain cases. It’s vital to consider the fees that could be payable up front and may need to be paid periodically after. There may even be a large balloon payment payable at the end of the loan and look out for early loan payment penalties for paying the car loan of faster. Leasing and Other Financing Options It may be a better idea to look at leasing or other types of loans to finance your car purchase. It’s important to understand the differences between a lease and a loan before you sign any agreement. If you have a lease, a financial institution purchases the car and owns it on your behalf. You are effectively paying a monthly fee to use the car, and at the end of the lease, you will have an option to buy the car for a pre-agreed price. If you have a car loan, you will borrow some money to purchase the car you want and then pay it back slowly over a fixed period of time. If you’re looking to buy a new, demo or pre-owned Nissan car contact us here at Perth City Nissan. We have a vast selection of cars available to suit a wide variety of budgets, and we offer competitive financing through our Nissan financial services. We invite you to join us for a no obligation test drive at your earliest convenience. If you need financing, you will discover that Nissan finance offers favourable rates and the repayments are tailored to suit your circumstances.

12,Car air conditioning problems? How to fix it,autos-trucks," With summer literally just around the corner, having car air conditioning problems can be a real hot mess. Fact is, cars naturally retain more heat than the outside temperature which means that you’re sitting there stuck in a stuffy confined area, sweating it all out, and begging for a nice breeze to pass by through the windows. And as much as the air conditioner in your car helps you feel better during the hot days, having air conditioning problems that are not attended to could lead to potentially dangerous situations where a heat wave strikes inside your car to dangerous temperature levels. So if your car’s air conditioner just doesn’t seem to be doing its job and is simply just spurting out hot air, it’s time to get it fixed. Here are 5 of the most common car air conditioning problems and how to fix them. Unfortunately, a refrigerant leak can happen at any point in a car’s air conditioning process which means that it can prove to be challenging to find out exactly where the leak is. Some of the most common places for refrigerant leaks are at the air conditioning unit hose connections. Where you notice any accumulation of oily substances around the hose connection, you may have found the source of the leak. Once you’ve found the source of the leak, your or your technician can use an air conditioning sealant to close it. A blocked condenser is unable to properly facilitate a good airflow to cool your car’s hot refrigerant which then leads to overheating causing the air conditioning unit to expel only hot air. As a car’s condenser is usually found at the front of the car, it is relatively easy to identify where the blockage is. Once you identify the blockage, simply remove the problem from the grill and the issue of your air conditioning problem should be resolved. Where there isn’t any apparent blockage in your condenser, there is a possibility that the condenser is broken altogether. The cause of a broken condenser may be from punctures made by road debris working through the grill of your car. Should you notice any punctures in the condenser, you will most likely need to replace the condenser or have a technician do it for you. Diagnosing an electrical problem relating to your air conditioning unit is perhaps the most challenging task due to having to undergo deductive reasoning. To begin, you will need to conduct a visual inspection of the wiring to see if the wires are frayed or broken. If you find any damaged wires, you will need to mend them with electrical tape where the problem is not too big, or otherwise replace them altogether. Where you aren’t able to locate any electrical issues, it is best to consult an experienced technician for a thorough diagnosis of your air conditioning problems. If your fans don’t function properly, it is more than likely that you condenser isn’t receiving the proper cooling it needs which then results in your car releasing only hot air out of the air con vents. To check for fault in the cooling fans, give it a look and see if you can notice any cracks or misalignments. Where there is a crack in the cooling fan, you will have to replace them. Other cooling fan issues include blown fuses as well as other electrical problems. To address these problems efficiently and effectively, you will most likely need to consult a professional car technician unless you are experienced in electrical work. Air conditioning problems are a hassle and vary in difficulty of fixing. At times it may be a quick fix that will take no more than a couple of minutes, in others you will need to replace a part entirely. Nevertheless, it’s often better to stay safe than sorry by consulting a professional technician to help fix the issue than trying to work your way around with guesswork."
13,What Can We Expect from the 2nd Generation Nissan Juke Crossover?,autos-trucks," The Nissan Juke 2018 has been a moderate success here in Australia, where the market has a real hunger for SUV and crossover vehicles. This is a hotly contested segment with a great deal of competition for sales. The Juke is a great crossover, but it has failed to make the inroads that Nissan would have expected here. Nissan has decided to change this with a second generation Nissan Juke model. Let’s take a closer look at what this latest Juke incarnation has to offer the crossover buyer. Different Yet Distinctive The global head of Nissan design is Alfonso Albaisa, and he is quite clear that the second generation Juke will look quite different, yet it will still be distinctive. Brand recognition is important, and a design ethos needs consider that vehicles need to be recognisable. In a recent interview with industry insiders, Mr. Albaise said ""it (the new Juke) doesn't look too much like the current one"", he went on to say ""it doesn't look like the IMx or the new Leaf, either"" and he then stated that ""It's an urban meteor with a nasty attitude"". When he was asked about the design process for the next Juke Mr. Albaise said: ""Our job was easier with the first one; there was nothing else like it."" He then added ""that car’s success was huge even given how polarising it looked,"" he then continued ""The second one couldn’t be derivative or evolutionary and still be a Juke"" he finished by saying ""we’d almost have to change its name to ‘Nancy,’ otherwise."" So, it seems to be clear that this will be recognisable as a Juke, but we can expect some new styling touches and innovations. The Next Generation Juke The second generation Juke is certainly set for a release soon, this could even be only a few months away, and that would mean that we can expect a reveal soon. Logically, this would occur at the Paris Motor Show that is held in October, with a European launch likely by early 2019 at the latest. The new Juke will probably be based on the Renault Nissan Mitsubishi Alliance 'V' platform, and this already underpins the Nissan Micra and Renault Captur. It’s expected that naturally aspirated engines will be dropped with diesel and turbo petrol being the way forward for now. If they are looking for a Nissan Juke for sale, Perth based drivers should get in touch with us at Perth City Nissan. We offer a large selection of new, and pre-owned cars available including the latest Nissan Juke models. We invite you to join us for a no obligation test drive, and you can try out the Juke for yourself. If you need finance for your new Nissan purchase, you will discover that our rates are competitive with repayments scheduled to suit your lifestyle. Our sales staff is standing by to advise you on our latest hot deals, and they will be happy to answer any further questions that you may have."
14,Should You Keep Your Original Nissan Qashqai Tyres?,autos-trucks," The new Nissan Qashqai is an excellent SUV crossover that is at home on the road and off it. The tyres on any car are the only points of contact with the surface being driven across. As such, they need to be carefully selected to match the vehicle that they are used on. Of course, the tyres fitted to the Qashqai are designed to match the vehicle at the design stage. However, eventually those tyres will wear out, and they will need to be replaced. So, should you stick to your original tyres or choose a different tyre for your Qashqai? Original Equipment (OE) is the Best Choice In most cases, OE is always the best choice for your vehicle because that equipment was designed for your particular car. This is the case for all types of parts, but it’s equally applicable to your choice of tyres. After a couple of years of regular use, you may notice that your tyres have worn and they need to be replaced. A trip to the local tyre shop is unlikely to get you the exact same tyres that were fitted to your car at the factory. It’s more likely that you may have to make certain compromises to get a good set of tyres. Choosing a New Set of Tyres So, if you cannot get the exact same tyres for your car, what tyres should you choose to replace your worn rubber? Another factor that many people consider is the price of OE tyres, they tend to be more expensive, but they are better than a cheaper option. Of course, a new set of average tyres will be better than a worn out set of OE tyres. However, there are some key factors that you need to consider before you make a final choice, they are the amount of traction, the durability, the comfort characteristics, and the cost. It’s extremely unlikely that a cheap set of tyres will satisfy all of these criteria. The only way to ensure that you’re purchasing a good set of tyres is to get the same type that was fitted at the factory or as close as possible. Considering Fuel Economy When you change your tyres, it can have a dramatic effect on the amount of rolling resistance that your car has. A set of OE tyres will be designed to meet the fuel economy figures for your car, and a cheaper set of tyres could compromise your fuel efficiency. Over time this could really add up, and the cost of cheaper tyres is unlikely to be an economical choice in the medium to long term. If you have any further questions or are considering a new Nissan Qashqai, you should visit us. As an authorised Nissan dealership, we have a large selection of models including the Nissan Qashqai 2018 range. The Perth City Nissan team is also on hand to answer any queries, discuss finance options or arrange your test drive."
15,What Does the Engine Check Light on Your Peugeot 308 Mean?,autos-trucks," The Peugeot 308 is a well designed and engineered car that you will be confident to drive. However, modern cars are very technical, and they contain mechanical, electrical and electronic components that must work in harmony. Like a piece of complex equipment, issues can arise from time to time, and that’s why we encourage our customers to have regularly scheduled servicing. This will detect minor issues early and avoid a more expensive repair bill later. One of the first indications that there may be a problem is the engine check light, but what does it mean? The Engine Check Light This is a very misunderstood dashboard warning light, if you’re not mechanically inclined, the illumination of this light can quickly cause alarm. However, it’s important not to overreact and this not necessarily an indication that there is a serious problem. In fact, the engine warning check light can even light in different ways to highlight particular problems. Understanding how your warning light works will give you some clues and put your mind at ease whilst driving. The engine warning check light will remain constant or blink on and off for different reasons. The Steady Light When the light is steady is means that the issue isn’t very serious and if there are no other warning lights or strange engine noise you can keep driving for a short while. Take a look at the engine temperature and if it seems fine, schedule a checkup when you get the next opportunity. A steady warning light is a good sign that your engine isn’t burning fuel properly. There are three main reasons that this may be happening: => The Oxygen sensor is faulty. => The fuel cap is loose. => The spark plugs need changing. The Blinking Light This is a far more serious warning, there could be unburnt fuel being dumped into the exhaust, and this can damage the catalytic converter. If the engine check warning light is flashing, you need to reduce your power and carefully drive home or to the nearest garage. The car will need to be checked out immediately, and it isn’t safe to drive in the interim. A mechanic will check the engine with a diagnostic scanner to ascertain what’s wrong and engage in some troubleshooting. If they are looking for a Peugeot 308, Perth based drivers should get in touch with us here at Perth City Peugeot. We have a large selection of new, demo and used cars for sale including the latest Peugeot 308 models. We invite you to join us for a no obligation test drive, and you can try out your favourite Peugeot models for yourself.

16,A Brief Comparison Review: The Peugeot 5008 vs. The Skoda Kodiaq,autos-trucks," The Peugeot 5008 is a welcome addition to the SUV market segment here in Australia. The rich feature set, European styling and extensive equipment fitted as standard have garnered the brand a host of Australian fans in a short period of time. However, in order to gain more significant market share, the French car maker will have to win sales from other brands. Another up and coming brand here is Skoda, and they have also been making inroads into a market dominated by Japanese and Korean vehicles until recently. Let’s take a closer look at what these two vehicles have to offer and how well they stack up against each other. The Peugeot 5008 The Peugeot 5008 2018 edition has a 2.0 litre engine that powers the front wheels only. However, this SUV is extremely light, and the clever engineering has coaxed an impressive amount of performance from the engine. The available torque is 400 Nm (the same as the Kodiaq), and the power output is 133kW. This is an amazing power to weight ratio that you will not find elsewhere in the class. The 5008 has a city friendly profile with a firm focus on driving dynamics that offers a very different driving experience compared to its rivals. The 5008 is so poised that it’s sometimes hard to remember that you’re driving a seven seater SUV. There is a top spec GT variant with a panoramic sunroof and heated Nappa leather seat for extra comfort. The Skoda Kodiaq This is a great SUV that has petrol and diesel versions that are well worth your time. The Sportline variant is probably the best value proposition with an extensive list of options available. The engine is a 2.0 litre unit that produces 140 kW of power and 400 Nm of torque. Pearl effect paint is offered as an option along with Luxury and Tech packs. These options add a great deal, but the premium paid may be too much for those lacking deep pockets. All in all, it’s a solid offering from Skoda that’s sure to build their brand reputation even further. In Summary The Skoda Kodiaq is a solid SUV, but you need to buy a lot of extras to match the equipment fitted as standard on the Peugeot 5008. The 5008 drives better and it offers more for the discerning SUV driver that wants something different. If you’re looking for a new Peugeot 5008 for sale, get in touch with us here at Perth City Peugeot. We have an extensive selection of new, ex-demo and pre-owned car available for sale including the latest Peugeot 5008 models.

17,Understanding Your Mazda 3: What is EBD?,autos-trucks," When you purchase a Mazda 3 hatch or sedan, it can be very easy to become overwhelmed with the sheer number of three letter acronyms. There seem to be a lot of them, and most people have no idea what they all mean. In this particular instance, we will be looking at Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD). As the name would suggest, this is a technology that will help the driver to break more effectively. Let’s take a closer look at EBD, to learn how it works to enhance your driving experience and help you to make a more informed purchasing decision. Electronic Brake Force Distribution (EBD) First, it’s important to note that you may hear the terms Electronic Brake Force Distribution (EBD) and Electronic Brake Force Limitation (EBL). Both EBD and EBL are the same names for the exact same technology. Mazda uses the term EBD, so in order to avoid confusion, we will use that acronym as we go forward in this article. What is EBD? Essentially, EBD is a combined system of hydraulic and electronic technology that will safely apply pressure to the brakes at each corner of the vehicle. This provides stronger and more even braking in the event of an emergency situation. A set of EBD brakes is considered to be active safety equipment that will help to minimise the effect of a collision or even assist the driver in avoiding it entirely. How Does EBD Work? It’s better to consider EBD as a crucial part of an overall active safety system. As such, the EBD brakes would be part of the Electronic Stability Control (ESC) and anti-lock brakes (ABS) systems. The ESC uses a complex algorithm to analyse sensor data, and it will know when too little or too much yaw is present related to the steering input. This will help the driver to avoid under and oversteering, which are critical factors in many collisions. When the ESC detects that the car is going out of control, it will use the EBD system to provide braking to individual wheels to get the car back under control. As all this is going on the ABS will also be working hard to ensure that the wheels don’t lock up. Although EBD has been around for years now, the improvements in sensory technology and processing speed have made them more effective than ever. The EBD system can react faster to a road situation than a driver ever could, and this is why this technology is a vital part of the Mazda safety suite, included to enhance your driving experience.

You’ll also find that our sales team members are available to answer any queries, discuss finance options or arrange your test drive, so you can experience the fantastic Mazda 3 for yourself."
18,Peugeot 2008 Tyre Advice: Should You Stick with OE Equipment?,autos-trucks," The Peugeot 2008 is a fantastic SUV in the city and out on the highway. The 2008 comes with a set of tyres that have been carefully matched to the specification of the car. In every case, Peugeot recommends that replacements are as close as possible to the original equipment (OE). This is a common practice for every car manufacturer, and it’s intended to keep the car as close as possible to the manufacturer's tolerances. However, Peugeot doesn’t manufacture tyres, so what happens when your factory fitted set eventually need to be replaced? OE is Always Best The best option would be to buy a new set of tyres that are exactly the same as the worn ones that you need to replace. Sadly, it’s unlikely that you will be able to walk into a tyre shop and purchase the exact same tyres off the rack. There are so many tyre manufacturers and specification available that you can quickly become lost. If you cannot source the exact same tyres you will need to get a set that closely matches them. This will ensure that you get the best possible tyre performance to match certain criteria, such as durability, ride comfort, traction and of course the cost. Don’t Forget Fuel Economy Choosing a cheaper set of tyres could have a huge impact on the amount of rolling resistance that your car has. If your Peugeot car has OE tyres that are designed for low rolling resistance, then these tyres would have a detrimental effect on your fuel economy. So, buying a set of cheap tyres could save you money in the short term, but in the medium to long term, you may end up paying more for your fuel. Essentially, cheaper tyres are a false economy in terms of fuel efficiency, and the costs can really add up over time. The Lifespan of Tyres Another aspect that could affect your finances is the durability of your tyres. Replacing OE tyres with similar rubber will most likely give you a set that will last a similar distance. Cheaper tyres will wear more quickly. There is a treadwear rating that is a three digit number located on the tyre sidewall. The higher the number, the longer the tyre should last, but this can only be treated as a rough guide. Broadly speaking a cheaper tire will need to be replaced more often and this may cost more in the medium to long term.

19,Understanding the Mazda CX-5: What is EBA?,autos-trucks," When they consider the Mazda CX-5, Perth based drivers can easily become overwhelmed by the amount of three letter acronyms. This is true of all modern car manufacturers; there is so much technology onboard modern cars it can be hard to understand what half of this stuff actually does. In this article, we will take a closer look at Emergency Brake Assist (EBA) that is now fitted to Mazda cars and how it can enhance your driving experience. What is EBA? Almost all cars built during the last decade have been equipped with some form of EBA technology. Many drivers may have had to brake extremely quickly to avoid a pedestrian or other traffic swerving into their path, and this is where EBA can help. These systems are specifically designed to gauge when the driver is trying to carry out a stop during an emergency. In the car industry, this is sometimes referred to as an emergency or panic stop. The concept began back in 1992 when Mercedes Benz found that almost all drivers didn’t apply enough force to their brakes during a panic stop. Over time, they developed a system that could detect the speed and force applied to a brake pedal. This would allow the system to recognise an emergency stop situation and apply extra force until the ABS system kicks in. This is important because the last thing that you need in a panic stop is for the wheels to lock up. Is EBA Related to AEB? For obvious reasons, many drivers do get these two terms mixed up, and this can lead to considerable confusion. Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) is not related to EBA in any meaningful way. It should be noted that EBA is not really a collision avoidance system like AEB is. To a large extent, EBA relies on driver input to begin the collision sensing procedure and the appropriate braking assistance response. On the other hand, AEB is an automated braking system that uses technology to sense when it’s required to avoid or minimise the effects of a collision. EBA Proliferation Mercedes Benz first brought the EBA system to market in 1996 on their S-Class sedan series and the SL Roadster. By 1998, they had added the technology to their entire range, and over time other car manufacturers followed suit. In fact, by 2009 every vehicle sold in Europe was required to have EBA systems fitted as part of their standard equipment. With the technological progression of EBA and its widespread use all over the world, our cars have never been safer for emergency braking.

20,All You Should Know About Product Liability Insurance,autos-trucks," With the evolution of the gig economy and more people looking to create a business from home, there has never been more need for product liability insurance. If you provide any products to customers, it is vital that you protect your business against any claims of injury or damage that could arise. While many business owners are aware that they need public liability insurance to protect against injuries at their physical premises, you may not be aware that you need product liability to manage your risks. So, here we’ll explore all you need to know about product liability, so you can make an informed decision about your coverage. The Product Liability Insurance Basics Product liability or as it is sometimes known, general liability can be included in your public liability insurance package. This coverage is designed to protect professionals who are supplying products to members of the public or customers. Product liability provides protection against any claims of property damage or personal injury caused by the products that are supplied or sold through your business. This type of policy is designed to help you to protect your business by ensuring that in the event of an issue, you won’t need to pay legal or court costs. Do You Need Product Liability? Product liability is highly recommended for businesses that supply products. Even if your product appears to be wholly safe, there is always a potential for an error to occur; something can always go wrong, and an accident can happen. A claim for property damage or personal injury that arises from a product failure can be an incredibly costly process and even if you are not at fault, defending yourself can incur considerable legal costs. Product liability provides a safeguard for your business, providing cover against any such claims, including legal defense fees. This means that you can go about your business activities confident in the knowledge that if something goes wrong, you’re protected. Cover For All the Essentials It is vital that you choose a product liability policy that will provide protection for your business. You need to be confident that if a product you supply fails, malfunctions or causes any harm, you’re protected. Product liability can provide protection in a variety of scenarios including damage caused by your software, illness caused by beverages, food or supplements, or injuries caused by any tools or equipment. Choosing the Right Policy If you feel that your business would benefit from product liability cover, it is a good idea to speak to a professional broker. An experienced broker can assess your risks and liability to ensure that you have adequate coverage. If you are interested in product or public liability insurance Perth based GSK Insurance is here to help. We offer access to a wide variety of insurance products including product liability insurance. A member of our team would be delighted to discuss your requirements and recommend the best insurance package for your specific circumstances to ensure that your business is fully protected."

1,Tips to Make Your Business Insurance Renewal Easier,autos-trucks," Operating a business can be a challenge, and when you’re concentrating on building your core business, vital tasks such as renewing your business insurance can fall into the cracks. This can be disastrous as your business is then left vulnerable in the event of theft, property damage or even injuries. While the best solution is to use business insurance brokers, Perth business owners can also use these tips to make the entire process easier. Collate Accurate Information Early A lot can change in a year, and whether you’ve acquired new assets or some items have dropped off your balance sheet, you need to reflect these changes in your new policy. As your renewal date approaches, it is vital to collate your information early and ensure that it is as accurate as possible. Inaccurate information not only increases the likelihood of claim issues, but it could mean that you are paying more than necessary. Understand Your Risk Risk assessment is one of the most challenging aspects of business insurance. A professional broker can help you to clearly articulate your risks. If you’re going it alone, you will need to demonstrate that you understand your risks and have developed a strategy to manage these. Failing to correctly understand your risks could lead to you being underinsured or in a worst case invalidating your coverage in the event of a claim. Have a Good Claims History While this may seem difficult to accomplish it is vital for making renewal easier. Some insurers have limitations or restrictions for clients with certain issues in their claims history. For example, some companies will not provide coverage for those with two or more claims in the last three years. This can make renewal even more challenging as insurers have greater confidence in risks where they can see the past performance. If you have made claims, you should be able to provide explanations or comments to mitigate this risk moving forward. Adopt a Collaborative and Open Approach As we touched on above, insurers prefer to have a clear picture of your risk profile to properly assess your needs. Working together to provide the relevant information and develop a clear objective and new strategies to manage your renewal will make the process easier. Consult a Professional Broker Insurers look to favour a quality policyholder as they reduce their exposure to those companies who are perceived to be high risk. A professional insurance broker can help you to mitigate your risks, minimising the financial impact on your business. While it may be tempting to go it alone, a professional broker can guide you through the renewal process to leave you to concentrate on your core business. If you’re in need of business insurance, you should speak to us. We are experienced business insurance brokers, Perth business owners can rely on. We offer access to a variety of insurance products, which can be tailored to cover your specific needs.

2,Mazda Dealers Report: Top After Sales Service Satisfaction Performance,autos-trucks," The Mazda dealer network has worked extremely hard in recent years to give customers the very best service. This has certainly paid off, according to the latest study by JD Power, Mazda has the top spot in their Customer Satisfaction Survey. This is an impressive achievement, but it should be noted that this success is the third time in a row for Mazda! Here in Australia, Mazda has edged out both Toyota and Nissan to take this crown yet again. Let’s take a closer look at how Mazda has achieved this success. An Enhanced Customer Experience There are a few key trends that seem to repeat themselves throughout the entire JD Power survey. It’s notable that the transparency and ease of booking the service seemed to be a key factor for customers. Around 19% of customers reported watching their car being serviced and they were more satisfied than those owners that couldn’t. Also, customers that could book their servicing appointment online were generally more happy that those that had to arrange the service on the phone. Online Engagement is Key The Australian manager at JD Power is Bruce Chellingworth, and after the latest survey, he said: ""brands with a strong online platform have the added advantage of engagement with their customers before they even walk into the dealership."" He then added "" they are offering an enhanced customer experience early on,"" it seems to be key then that brands engage with their client online. Later, Mr. Chellingworth stated ""Brands should not only actively communicate and promote the usage of the online channel, but also complement their outreach by using offline tools"" he then added, ""this will provide a smoother transition to the online platform and ensure a cohesive customer experience."" How Did Mazda Score? In total, Mazda scored 789 out of a maximum score of 1,000 in a survey of 4,586 car owners. Mazda edged out Toyota with a score of 783 and Nissan came third with a score of 779. It’s the little things that make a big difference to customers, regularly washed and vacuumed cars say a great deal about a car dealership. Customers had more satisfaction when they were walked back to their cars after a servicing appointment. It seems that Mazda knows how to treat their customers, but there is always room for improvement, and perhaps they will hit four times in a row on the next JD Power survey.

3,Overcoming Driving Anxiety in the Mazda 3,autos-trucks," The Mazda 3 is an excellent family car that’s equally at home in the city or out on the open highway. However, many drivers suffer from driving anxiety at some point during their driving career. This may occur after an accident or near miss collision, or it could be part of a larger phobia, such as a fear of tunnels or driving at higher speeds. Whatever the trigger or cause, driving anxiety can seriously affect your capabilities behind the wheel. In this article, we will take a closer look at driving anxiety and explore some simple strategies that may help. First a Quick Disclaimer This article is not intended to replace psychological or medical advice that you would receive from a trained professional. The tips mentioned here may work for you, but if you have deeply ingrained anxiety surrounding driving, there may be broader issues that you need to address. Hopefully, this advice will help you to enjoy your driving again. Identify Your Specific Fear Some people, become anxious when they have to drive across a bridge or through a tunnel. Others may become frightened when they have to merge on a highway at speed. There is usually a specific trigger that will set the anxiety off, and it may grow more severe over time. This could turn a simple commute into a nerve wracking experience, and that’s the last thing any driver wants at the start of any journey. Gain Back Your Confidence Some drivers overcome their fears by taking some refresher classes in driving. Having a driving instructor in the car can be a very calming influence for some drivers. However, it takes a special type of driving instructor to be as patient as you need them to be. Before you book an instructor, explain your situation and find out if they can help you with your anxiety issues. Sometimes, simply getting some extra teaching can really help, perhaps there is a skill like parking that you’re nervous about because you don’t perform the maneuver very often. Taking Matters Into Your Own Hands Some drivers find a passenger or driving instructor a distraction and they would prefer to work through the problem themselves. This is possible, but you have to be very patient with yourself and honest about your particular issue. Once you understand the source of your driving anxiety, you can start to deal with it. Take the car out when the roads are quiet and practice your skills over and over until you can deal with the anxiety. Gradually over time go out at slightly busier times and keep at it until you can handle the situation on any road at any time of the day.

4,Explaining Stamp Duty for the Mazda 2,autos-trucks," The Mazda 2 is an excellent family car that is very reasonably priced for the features and the driving experience that it offers. However, like any car, it will be subject to certain additional fees before you can drive your new or used car off the lot. One fee that every car generates is stamp duty and if you’ve never purchased a car or it’s been a while since you upgraded this can be hard to understand. In this article, we will take a closer look at what stamp duty is and how much it will cost. A Brief Primer on Stamp Duty Whenever you buy a car, it will be necessary to pay stamp duty before you can drive it away. Stamp duty is a tax that is levied by your state government as an official document. Usually, this is paid whenever a new motor vehicle is purchased, and a good way to look at it is that it’s a one off tax that is paid when ownership is transferred. This is equally applicable when you are buying a new or used car from a dealer or from a private seller, The rate of stamp duty can differ a great deal depending upon which Australian state or territory the transaction takes place in. In this particular article, we will focus on the sales in Western Australia, and the stamp duty costs there only. Western Australia Stamp Duty Charges In Western Australia, the stamp duty paid is based upon the dutiable value of the vehicle being purchased. This could be either the manufacturer list price for a new vehicle or the reasonable market value for a used car. Below we will look at an example to illustrate it in an easy to understand way with real dollar values. The three ranges or bands of prices and the corresponding stamp duty payments are as follows: On a new car, the stamp duty would be 2.75% of the listed price On a second hand car, the stamp duty would also be 2.75% of the reasonable market value. This stamp duty is a little more complex, and the percentage of the stamp duty is based on the equation of 2.75 + (dutiable value -25000 / 6666.66). For example: on a new vehicle with a value of $30,000, the rate of stamp duty would be 2.75 - (30000-25000/6666.66), which works out at 3.5% or $1,050. On a new car, the stamp duty would be 6.5% of the listed price On a second hand car, the stamp duty would also be 6.5% of the reasonable market value.

5,3 Tips to Get Your Peugeot 2008 Ready for Winter,autos-trucks," The Peugeot 2008 is an excellent car for driving in the city and out on the open highway. Like many modern cars, it has active safety features that could help to avoid a collision, and it’s safer for the occupants than an older car would be. Despite this, any car can be affected by colder weather conditions particularly snow. Getting your car ready for the winter will go a long way in keeping you safe in colder conditions, especially if you're tackling winter sports. Here are three tips that will make sure that you’re prepared for driving during the winter months. Any kind of cold weather has a real knack for starting electrical and mechanical issues with your car. This can cause you to get stuck, slide off the road and it may be necessary to get yourself out of trouble. It makes good sense to be prepared for the worst, and a good way to start is to put together a car snow kit for your boot. The kit will be handy to free yourself at it should include items, such as de-icer, a basic tool kit, road flares, a reflective warning triangle, a tow rope and a shovel. Seasoned snow drivers often carry a bag of cat litter too; this is great for putting under a tyre to improve traction. It’s also a good idea to take wheel chocks because a handbrake can fail or freeze up in the snow. Snow chains may be compulsory in certain alpine areas, and if you’re directed to fit them, they will need to be installed. There may be snow chain fitting bays in the area. If there isn’t a bay available, you need to find a safe spot to park with excellent visibility. If you have an all wheel drive vehicle, you may not need to fit snow chains in certain areas. However, it may be a good idea to take snow chains anyway in case you need them later. In an emergency, you may find that you’re stranded in cold temperatures. Having an emergency kit can really help you to survive this situation and get some help. You will need a bag that you can throw in your car boot and that you can take with you in an emergency. The bag should be packed with useful items, such as a multi tool, a first aid kit, a torch, spare batteries for all your devices, a reflective emergency black, some food and water supplies, a battery powered radio and something to start a fire. If they are looking to buy a Peugeot 2008, Perth based drivers should get in touch with us here at Perth City Peugeot. We have a fantastic selection of new, demo and used cars available including the latest Peugeot 2008 models. We would love to invite you to join us for a no obligation test drive, and you can evaluate the 2008 for yourself.

6,Mazda Dealers Perth Advisory: The Warranty Period Has Been Extended,autos-trucks," As your local Mazda dealership, we try to keep all of our customers up to date on all the latest news. Often this is advice on new or upcoming Mazda cars and tips to keep your car working as intended by Mazda in all driving and weather conditions. This article is a little different; we will be taking at some recent changes that Mazda has made to their car warranties. The 3 Year Manufacturers Warranty It was once standard here in Australia and in other parts of the world for car manufacturers to offer a three year warranty to their customers. Mazda was no different in this regard, but things have started to change. Many car manufacturers globally offer a longer warranty period, and this is often five years. The 5 Year Manufacturers Warranty Mazda is the latest car manufacturer to increase their warranty period from three to five years. From now on, all brand new Mazda vehicles sold here in Australia will have a five year unlimited kilometre warranty applied to their purchase as standard. This brings Mazda into line with other manufacturers, such as; Skoda, Renault, Mitsubishi, Isuzu, Holden, Citroen, and Peugeot. The Pressures of Competition A case could be made for the implementation of this new Mazda warranty policy to stay competitive. The Australian car market is extremely buoyant at this time, and there is plenty of competition in every single segment for vital sales. However, this move to a longer warranty period has been developing globally over the last few years. It’s fair to say that modern cars are typically far better made than cars from even a decade ago. They are far safer and more reliable on average than their predecessors and as such it seems fair for car manufacturers to increase the warranty period. As well as an inducement to buy this also proves to the customer that the manufacturer has real confidence in their cars. The Mazda Market Share In Australia, Mazda is a market leader, and they are the second most popular car manufacturer here. This is driven by the stellar reputation for quality and reliability and the fair pricing structure across the entire range. This move to a five year warranty will surely build even more confidence in the brand and perhaps allow Mazda to compete with Toyota for pole position. If they are looking for a Mazda for sale, Perth based drivers should get in touch with us at Mandurah Mazda. We offer a large selection of new, demo and used cars for sale including all the latest models. We are your local Mazda dealers, Perth motorists are invited to join us for a no obligation test drive at their earliest convenience to try out their favourite Mazda cars.

7,What is High Mileage Oil & Is it Right for Your Car?,autos-trucks," We’re gonna assume that you don’t spend your free time thinking about motor oil. Yet still, you’ve probably found yourself in a Canadian Tire aisle, staring at shelves full of differently-sized bottles each with differently-coloured labels. If you can relate to this, you’ll agree how important motor oil is for your car and why you need to pay attention to it. After all, if you choose the right motor oil, it will help your engine, but choose the wrong one and it will cause damage. Your choice of motor oil matters even more important if you’re driving an older car, which has led some to believe that high mileage oil is the ideal choice for aged vehicles. But is this really so? Before you spend a penny on your next bottle of oil (or oil change), it’s worth knowing what high mileage oil is and how it differs from regular motor oil. What is High Mileage Oil Exactly? High mileage oil is designed to protect engines from leaks as they age. High mileage oil, as its name suggests, protects engines that have passed their warranties and/or have 75,000-150,000+ clicks on them. The use of these oils are also recommended if you or a mechanic happens to notice a leak, or if you hear your engine making one of those nerve-wracking, rattling noises. The likelihood of leaks and noises increases as an engine ages (more on this later) and reaches higher mileage ranges. They often occur when your car’s engine starts to shed thin, invisible layers of metal from their bearings and rubber from their seals. Eventually, these components wear out, the gaps between them grow bigger and some oil may seep through (leak) or burn in engine cylinders. The makers of motor oil have created and sold plenty of products labelled as ""high mileage oil"", which act as protective layers to prevent oil from leaking through. A Not-So Scientific Breakdown of High Mileage Oil Motor oils exist on a spectrum. On the far right sits conventional oil, on the far left sits synthetic oil and high mileage sits smack in the middle. Conventional oil (or regular oil) is basically mineral-grade oil made from crude oil extracted from the ground. Synthetic oil is also made from crude oil, but is highly processed and has all the impurities removed from it. High mileage oil is not as pure as synthetic oil but more ""refined"" than regular oil, and some experts refer to it as high-grade mineral oil. But what really makes high mileage oil special are the additives that go into it. For example, they contain antioxidants (yep your car needs them too, not just you) and detergents to clean your engine and conditioners to prevent your seals from leaking. High mileage oil also has what’s known as a high viscosity – a fancy term for being very thick, which is what they need to be to protect your engine seals. Regular and synthetic oils may have similar features and mixtures, but not as much as high mileage oils do. Buyer Beware Now, here’s the big question that still needs an answer: should you buy high mileage oil for your car? The answer is yes, BUT, only if your vehicle falls into the category that needs it the most. So if you hear some folks say high mileage oil is a waste, while others talk about it as a godsend, understand that they both may have a point. When High Mileage Oil is Not For You Your car has less than 75,000 klicks (mileage) Your car has no signs of burning or leaking oil You already use an oil type that’s proven to work well for your engine When High Mileage Oil is Right For You Your car has very high mileage (75,000 – 100,000 or more) Oil smoke, engine blow-by, sludge and other signs of excess oil consumption You hear rattling or other unsettling noises while driving In some cases, you may still reach a wall where you’re at loss for an answer. In those cases, you’ll have to make a judgement call. But one thing we always recommend when you’re not sure of what to do for a specific car repair job, is to read your manual. It will give you the best oil to use for your car and more. Why High Mileage Oil Can be Good for Used Cars A high mileage oil can have benefits for used cars. For some of you, a high mileage oil will have some undeniable benefits for your vehicle. This is certainly true if your car has 75,000 klicks or more, or if it’s showing signs of excess oil use or leaks. You’ll definitely notice ""symptoms"" of this at some point if your car has this problem. Signs High Mileage Oil Could Benefit Your Car Excessive engine blow-by: Hot exhaust gases that get past piston rings; indicates engine wear, oil leaks and damaged rings. Oil smoke: Blue smoke that comes out of the exhaust pipe, the cause of which can range from oil leaks to worn engine seals. Sludge buildup in engine: Thick, tar-like deposits of hardened oil found in engine components, which can occur due to the use of poor quality fuels or oils. If any of the above-mentioned issues are a constant battle for you, then it wouldn’t hurt to give high mileage oil a try. Just make sure to keep in mind that these oils may cost more than your usual choices, due to the added chemicals that go into them. And of course, make sure to visit your mechanic if you’re still having difficulty deciding what oil to use or if certain car problems persist. High Mileage Oil: Hope or Hype? So what’s our final verdict on high mileage oil? It’s this – give it a try ONLY if your car shows signs of oil leaks, sludge buildup or engine wear-and-tear. Lots of mileage on your car alone may not be a strong enough reason to spend on these oils. Keep in mind too, that many high mileage oils are made and marketed by brands who are eager to increase their profits. Some of these products do have benefits, but they’re not always the right answer. So go ahead and buy, but do so judiciously.

8,The 2018 Peugeot 308 Review,autos-trucks," The Peugeot 308 is the latest in a hot streak of excellent cars that we have seen from the French car manufacturer in recent years. The switch to a new Australian importer and a change in company management has kickstarted a bright new era for Peugeot. Both the 3008 and 5008 SUV crossovers have been well received, and Peugeot is hoping to repeat this success with smaller cars. As such, the 308 needs to be a solid offering that delivers first class European styling and engineering. Let’s take a look at what’s on offer for the Aussie driver looking for something genuinely different. The 308 At a Glance This is an update for 2018, there is some new safety kit on board, and the ownership program has been overhauled. The Aussie driving public will most likely approve of the super cool interior that is stylish and yet still well laid out and practical. The entire look and feel of the car are certainly at the more premium end of the scale. Some may balk at the pricing, but it’s important to remember that we generally don’t get entry level cars here because it’s not economical to import them. The Peugeot 308 Touring At its core, this car is beautifully designed, but as a family tourer, it has to be practical to use for everyday tasks. The 308 is 4,585mm long and 2,043 mm wide, making it small enough to park even in the city. The next most useful feature for a family is the boot space, and with the rear seats in place, the 308 has 625L for storage. If you need more room, the 2nd row of seats can be dropped, and the available storage space rises to a whopping 1,740L. This should be more than enough space for flat pack furniture if you can forgo the rear passengers. In the Cabin We’ve already touched on the fantastic design, it’s minimal and logical, a real benchmark for modern car design. There is smartphone mirroring, USB and AUX connections and cup/bottle holders in each door. There are two rear ISOFIX points and a pull down rear seat divider. There is plenty of space up front, but in the rear, the 308 feels more like a hatchback in terms of leg space. Under the Bonnet The 308 Touring has a 2.0L turbocharged diesel engine that generates 110kW of power. This is transferred to the front wheels, and there is plenty of low down power delivery. The engine is paired with a six speed auto transmission, and there is 370 Nm of torque available at 2,000rpm. This gives the 308 Touring a 0-100km/hr time of 10 seconds and a top speed of 209 km/hr. If they are looking for a Peugeot 308, Perth based drivers should call in and visit us at Perth City Peugeot. We have an impressive selection of new, ex demo and pre-owned cars available, including the latest Peugeot 308 models. We invite you to join us for a no obligation test drive, and you can try out the 308 for yourself. If you need car financing, you will discover that our rates are competitive and the repayments will be scheduled to suit your needs. Our sales team is poised and ready to advise you on the latest Peugeot 308 price, and they will be happy to answer any further questions that you may have."
9,"When They Consider the Mazda CX-3 Price, Perth Drivers Need to Remember Insurance",autos-trucks," When They Consider the Mazda CX-3 Price, Perth Drivers Need to Remember Insurance The Mazda CX-3 is a fantastic car, but like every vehicle on the road, it will need to be insured. This is a legal requirement, and it will also offer you some legal and financial protection in the event of an accident. However, not all insurance policies and providers are equal, and it’s vital to understand what you’re signing before you put pen to paper. Here are some key factors that you will need to consider carefully when you choose your next car insurance policy. What Type of Insurance Do You Need? In order to figure out the type of car insurance that you need you will need to understand the type of cover that you require and price that you can afford. As a quick example: if your car isn’t worth much or you don’t have a lot to spend, you may just want third party cover to protect you from any damage that you could cause to another person's property. If you have more to spend and you want more insurance cover for theft and damage to your car, you will need a comprehensive insurance policy. What Aspects Are Covered by the Policy? There are many drivers on the roads that mistakenly believe that they are covered for a wide variety of liabilities and damages. This may not be the case because some of these drivers have not read their policy documents prior to signing them. This can lead to these drivers getting tripped up later when they assume that they have adequate levels of coverage. Never sign a policy document if you’re not sure about the details and don’t be afraid to ask questions. Are There any Discounts Available? When you buy car insurance, there will be a renewal date each year to ensure that your coverage continues. At this time there may be discounts available that could lower your premium significantly. One of the best know discounts is the no claims bonus that will reward you with a discount for every year that you don’t make an insurance claim. There is usually a five year cap on this discount, but double check with your insurance provider as this can vary depending upon the insurer. There may also be a multi-policy discount for drivers that are consolidating a number of insurance policies with a single insurance provider. This doesn’t necessarily have to be car insurance either; you may be able to bundle home insurance or other types of policies with your car insurance. If they are looking to buy a Mazda CX-3, Perth based drivers should get in touch with us here at Mandurah Mazda. We have a large selection of new, ex-demo and pre-owned cars available for sale, including the latest CX-3 models. We would like to invite you to arrange a no obligation test drive with us, and you can drive the Mazda CX-3. Perth residents that need car financing will discover that our rates are extremely competitive and your repayments will be tailored to suit your lifestyle.

10,Ensure That Your Nissan 370z Coupe Maintains its Value,autos-trucks," The Nissan 370z coupe is an excellent performance car that is a great deal of fun to drive. Buying any car, especially a more expensive model represents a significant investment, and it’s a good idea to protect it. There are a lot of used cars for sale and when it comes time to sell your car it’s a great idea to have the one in the best condition. When the vehicle has been looked after, the value is maintained and you can command the best price to recoup the maximum amount of money. Let’s take a closer look at some practical methods that you can use to keep you 370z in the best possible condition. Take Care of the Surfaces When you’re selling an expensive performance car, first impressions really count. If you have paint and bodywork that is dented, chipped or faded, it will affect the sale price. The best way to keep your surfaces immaculate is to carry out regular preventative maintenance. Ideally, you would garage your car, but if this is not possible you will have to wash your car more regularly. It’s vital to be especially vigilant with substances, such as bird droppings, bug stains, and tree sap. These materials can have acidic properties that can damage the paint and they need to be carefully washed away as soon as possible. Your paint surfaces should also be protected with a good quality car wax. Pay Attention to the Cabin If you have a scrappy interior, the whole internal appearance will be compromised. Buyers of prestige cars are looking for an attractive, tidy cabin that will be a nice place to drive the car. The plastics used in car interiors are usually durable, and they may just need a thorough clean. The carpets, mats and other fabrics should be vacuumed regularly so that dirt cannot be ground into the surfaces, which will cause damage. Carry Out Regular Servicing A regular service is an absolute requirement to prevent your car from turning into a money pit. The servicing should be carried out by qualified mechanics, and genuine parts should always be used. Showing a comprehensive service history will really impress potential buyers and build trust in your car. If they are looking for a Nissan 370z coupe for sale, Perth based should get in touch with us at Perth City Nissan. We have a large selection of new, ex-demo and pre-owned cars available for sale including the Nissan 370z coupe. We would love to invite you to schedule a no obligation test drive with us online, and you can try out the 370z for yourself. If you need to finance your new Nissan purchase, you will discover that our rates are extremely competitive and the repayments will be structured to suit your lifestyle. Our sales team is standing by to advise you on the latest Nissan 370z coupe price, and they will be happy to answer any further questions that you may have."
11,The New Subaru Impreza 2.0i-S Review,autos-trucks," The 2018 new Subaru Impreza 2.0i-S is the latest version of this Australian favourite, and a lot has changed compared to the outgoing models. We now have a fresh platform underpinning the car and a host of new technology to explore. The Impreza 2.0i-S is the top specification model, and as such it’s a great car to evaluate to gauge the new range. Let’s take a closer look at what the Subaru Impreza 2.0i-S has to offer so that you can make a more informed purchasing decision. At a Quick Glance Perth drivers are sure to enjoy all the brand new onboard technology, and the suspension is now tuned to provide an even better ride. As one would expect from a Subaru, there is an excellent all wheel drive that feels sure footed in virtually any driving conditions. Some drivers may not enjoy the new styling for the Impreza range, and the engine could be more powerful. The Subaru Impreza 2.0i-S It’s important to understand that the new Impreza isn’t simply a refreshed model with a few tweaks here and there to justify a new model and price point. In fact, this Impreza range has been built on an entirely new global platform that will be used for other Subaru models. However, if you look closely, you can still see that this is an Impreza with some old school touches that Aussie drivers have come to know and indeed love. Under the bonnet, you'll find a naturally aspirated four cylinder 2.0 litre ""boxer"" power plant that evenly provides power to the all wheel drive system. In all driving conditions, 60% of the torque is supplied to the front wheels, and the remaining 40% goes to the rear wheels. This is the system that gives the Impreza and other Subaru models that famous surefooted reputation. Other Impressions The new Impreza looks like a Subaru with slashes and streaks down the flanks. There are hawkish headlight clusters and downturned L-shaped rear lights that are unmistakably Subaru. It’s a step up from the outgoing model, but sadly the styling doesn’t quite reach the heights of the Viziv concept car that it’s based on. Only 5% of the outgoing Impreza has remained, and the design is over 70% stiffer to improve crash absorption by an impressive 40%. The centre of gravity is also lower to improve handling even further. If they are looking for Subaru Impreza dealers, Perth based drivers should get in touch with us here at City Subaru. We have a massive selection of new, demo and used cars available for sale including the new Subaru Impreza models. We would like to invite you to join us for a no obligation test drive, and you can try out the Impreza for yourself. If you need car financing, our rates are very competitive, and the repayments will be scheduled to suit your lifestyle. Our sales team members are poised to advise you on the latest Subaru Impreza for sale price, and they will be delighted to answer any further questions you may have."
12,Self-Driven Vehicles Testing Guidelines Tightened,autos-trucks," The different advancements in technology have not spared the auto world. We have witnessed several inventions that have made driving more safe and convenient. Vehicles are being fitted with ultra-modern devices that alert drivers when they sense an object or any form of collisions. Other devices can also help fleet managers track vehicles and also monitor driving habits. EyeRide has some of these devices that aid in fleet management and improve road safety. We have also witnessed the introduction of self-driven vehicles that do not need any human assistance or operation. Commonly referred to as autonomous cars, they are fitted with maps and sensors which aid their movement through the different roads. They can sense all forms of objects within their surroundings and stop to reduce the chances of a collision. This kind of feature will help increase road safety. It will also reduce the chances of getting stuck in traffic because they can monitor the situation on different roads and direct one to alternative routes. Self-driven vehicles do not use your regular fuel with most of them being electrically powered. This helps reduce the pollution of the environment. These cars have been tested and put into operation in a few countries. They will dominate our roads in a few years’ time. One place where autonomous vehicles are being tested is the state of Pennsylvania in the United States. The transportation department in that area has put up strict guidelines that autonomous vehicle testers should follow. The new rules are meant to improve road safety within that state. They include: Use of a Second Engineer The Pennsylvania transport department wants every autonomous car tester to have a second person or engineer in the vehicle when doing their test. They insist that every tester should follow this especially if they are driving at speeds of more than 40 km/h. Companies are permitted to conduct their tests with a single driver only if he or she has top-level experience. Notice of Testing Companies are also required to achieve a notice of testing which gives out clear information about them, the vehicle they want to test, location for testing, and the details of the driver. This is another rule introduced by the transport authorities in Pennsylvania that autonomous car testers should follow. Safety Plan Self-driven vehicle testers are also required to give out their safety plan to the Pennsylvania transport authorities. They should submit the different measures they have in place to ensure the safety of the driver and other people within that area. In addition, they should also present information like the number of miles or kilometers covered and job opportunities that may arise as a result of their testing activities. The new guidelines that were put into effect on August 1st, 2018 were meant to improve the level of safety within that state. Testing self-driven cars in the real world can expose a lot of people to a number of dangers. There have been reports of people who got knocked and injured by these cars during their testing stage. The revised guidelines will help prevent all this."
13,4 Things Your Car Really Needs: Subaru Dealers Advice,autos-trucks," Here at City Subaru, we are your local Subaru dealership; Perth drivers often ask us for advice about a variety of car related matters. Whether you’re shopping for a new or used Subaru car, there are always features that you would like to have. This is not the focus of this particular article; instead we are going to look at four things that we believe you need in your next car. Obviously, there is a caveat here that you are a person that owns and uses an Apple device. When you have Apple CarPlay support, you can keep your hands firmly on the steering wheel and still have a ton of functionality. A CarPlay supported car will allow you to use your infotainment display as a virtual version of the Siri assistant. This will give you access to features, such as messaging, phone calls, podcasts and music playback. The iPhone will be far easier to use whilst driving once connected via a USB port and navigation will be a breeze. A car with heated front and/or rear seats used to be a feature that you would only find in a premium or luxury car. Now, heated seats are far more common, and this will make driving in cold weather far more pleasurable. The best heated seats will heat up quickly and then back the heat off to avoid the occupant from feeling uncomfortably hot. Autonomous Emergency Brakes (AEB) are a fantastic safety technology that can really make your journey safer. An AEB system will use a series of sensors to give full time attention that a human simply cannot have. The system can make a decision if it feels that a collision is likely and apply braking as required. This is particularly useful to avoid an accident entirely, or in extreme cases, it may mitigate the impact. This equipment is fast becoming a standard feature on a wide variety of vehicle types. This feature may be available on older cars for used car buyers, and it’s worth getting if you can find it. Radio as an in car entertainment option has come along in leaps and bounds in recent years. Digital radio (DAB+) is super clear, and over 1.42m vehicles sold in Australia have had this technology fitted as standard. There are loads of stations available covering a wide variety of different tastes and this is a perfect way to enjoy your commute. If they are looking for reputable local Subaru dealers, Perth based drivers should get in touch with us here at City Subaru.

14,Car Service Perth Advice: Home Maintenance Can Really Help,autos-trucks," Regular car servicing on a schedule is the very best way to keep your car working as the manufacturer intended. However, not every maintenance task necessarily requires the skills of a factory trained technician. In fact, there are many simple little maintenance tasks that even an inexperienced amateur can carry out themselves. The jobs are easy to do, and they can really help you to keep your car in the best condition and ready to drive. Check Your Tyres Many drivers, spend a lot of money every month on fuel, on average Australians fork out $2000 every year to keep their cars running. Over time, a tyre will gradually lose its pressure, and when a tyre is underinflated, it will increase fuel use. This will make the car more expensive to fuel over the same distance, and it will also make the car less safe to drive. The tyres on your car should be visually checked weekly for any signs of bulging, cuts and excessive wear. The tyre pressures should be checked to make sure that they are kept in line with those found in your owner's manual. Tyres in good condition inflated to the correct pressure will give your car more grip and save you money at the same time. Check Your Oil Levels It’s a good idea to think of the oil in your car as the blood that circulates through the system. When your oil quality is compromised, this will be reflected in how well the car performs. Every car consumes oil over time, some could even use almost a litre between two oil changes, and if your car has a sudden change in oil consumption, it’s a cause for concern. If your oil has a milky or creamy appearance, this is a strong indicator that your car has serious mechanical issues. Keep your oil topped up is a simple way to quickly examine your oil quality and keep your system working efficiently. Keep Other Fluids Topped Up Apart from oil, there are other essential fluids that you can keep topped up to ensure that your engine is getting everything it needs. Some of the most important fluids include transmission fluid, power steering fluid, engine coolant and brake fluid. Over time some of these systems will consume fluid, and it’s a good idea to check them periodically. Keeping these fluids topped up will make your car easier to drive and safer on the road. If they are looking for a high quality local Subaru car service, Perth based drivers should get in touch with us at City Subaru. We offer a comprehensive Subaru service, Perth motorists can be assured that our technicians are factory trained to work on their cars.

15,A Mazda Dealers Review: The 2018 Mazda BT-50 GT Dual Cab,autos-trucks," When they look at their local Mazda dealers, Perth based drivers will notice that SUVs and crossover vehicles are extremely popular. This has been true for a few years now, and these types of cars have driven Australian car sales to new heights. However, we are now starting to see a new trend, high spec dual cab Utes that can be used for heavy duty work during the week and as a family friendly SUV alternative at the weekend. One of the best examples of this is the Mazda BT-50 GT Dual Cab, let’s take a closer look at what this latest version has to offer. A Brief Overview The Mazda BT-50 GT Dual Cab is more basic than many SUVs on the market, but it has plenty of features to satisfy most family needs. There is plenty of torque available to pull a work trailer during the week and a boat trailer or caravan at the weekend. The BT-50 GT now has longer distance service intervals for added convenience. Some people, may not like the truck like looks and the infotainment system can be fiddly to use until you get used to it. The 2018 Mazda BT-50 GT Dual Cab Has a few new cosmetic features to freshen up the looks, chief amongst these is a new front bumper and grille insert to soften the appearance a little. Of course, there is a wide range of aftermarket bull bars available for those drivers that want to add bulk to the front end. Mazda has also added Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity to their feature set. There is an 8"" infotainment screen that has a DAB+ digital radio and Satellite Navigation functionality. There is plenty of kit featured as standard, such as a powered driving seat, leather seating trim, cruise control, dual zone climate control, dusk sensing headlights and 17"" alloy wheels. Under the Bonnet The Mazda BT-50 GT Dual Cab has a five cylinder turbo diesel powerplant that generates 147 kW of power and 470 Nm of torque in the 1750-2500 rpm range. This engine is paired with a six speed automatic or manual transmission. The 4x4 system is electronically engaged, it has a low range and locking rear differential giving it all the grunt needed for off road driving. The unladen ground clearance is 232mm, but it should be noted that the new front bumper is 2mm lower than the outgoing model. Despite the power on offer, the noise levels and refinement are comparable to the competition. However, if you really stomp down you will get a satisfying roar that is lacking amongst the Mazda BT-50 GT Dual Cab rivals.

16,7 things to consider when selling your car privately,autos-trucks," Planning to buy a new car can be exciting, but as you consider your next big purchase, you must also think about what you're going to do with your old car. There are many opportunities like trading in your vehicle with your dealership, or more lucrative options such as selling the vehicle privately to an individual. What you need to know before selling your car privately While selling your used car privately can fetch you a better price, the task of finding a buyer can be daunting. The selling process can also take more time than you expect and so you must be willing to exercise patience. If you are planning to sell your vehicle without involving a dealership, here are seven things you must consider. Your used car must be in decent shape if you are serious about attracting buyers. Ensure that the vehicle is well serviced and if possible, have its interior cleaned and the exterior washed and polished by a professional. The better the state of the vehicle, the more likely it is to fetch a higher price. It is essential that you carefully consider where you will advertise your vehicle and how you will do it. There are so many websites in Australia where you can list your used car for sale to attract serious potential buyers. A straightforward and well-detailed description of your vehicle will appeal to potential buyers, and you're also more likely to capture your customers' attention with clear, correct, and concise ads. Getting a professional dealer to write your ad is an excellent idea, as they can help you with complex details such as odometer readings, engine or transmission details, and a description of the vehicle's history. A professional can also help you select great photos for your ad. It is crucial that you put a reasonable asking price in your ad because if you put an unrealistically high price, you might end up with no buyers. On the other hand, don't ask for too little to attract a quick sale or you will be left with regrets after the car changes hands. Think about all the documents you need for a smooth sale like the vehicle's logbook, service records, and your owner's manual and ensure they are ready for inspection by potential buyers. Also, remember to honestly inform buyers about any amount of registration remaining if they ask. Consider where you'll meet buyers for vehicle inspections. If you plan on giving out your address, are you willing to have strangers flocking to your home? It is advisable that you pick a random location where you can meet buyers with your car, and you can always ask a friend or family member to accompany you if you have security concerns. If you've landed a serious buyer and you're looking forward to closing the deal, it is essential that you prepare a receipt to state that you're selling the car as seen. Also, consider the mode of payment, like a cheque, and the amount of time they take to clear - don't hand over your car keys unless the buyer has paid you in full."
17,Take You Ride Into the Future,autos-trucks," You can add safety and convenience to nearly any vehicle. Today's cars are full of safety features, but before you've had the chance to break in the vehicle you own, there is a new one being made with more gadgets than the last. Don't get me wrong, I love finding out what's next cool gadget being added, but they come at a cost. Some of you have the ability to choose the right vehicle for you, like my father, and drive them until the wheels fall off so to speak. You can put a couple hundred thousand miles on a vehicle and be just as happy with it as the day you bought it. You see new a vehicle driving down the road and you know the price they are paying for that new ride and it makes you happy just knowing the money you are saving. You are seriously considering it, but why? You really don't need a smartphone to connect the Bluetooth, most of the Android radios today will connect to any device that is Bluetooth ready, but let's say with the money you are saving you bought a smartphone and now you would like to make the best of the Bluetooth with the hands-free calling option that everyone else has. Then you find that you can download a playlist of your favorite songs to your phone. Now you want a radio that can play your songs while you are in your vehicle. And to top it all off, your new smartphone has GPS navigation, but it uses your data. Even with all of these features, you still don't have a backup camera. How do you get all of these features in your vehicle without trading up or spending a small fortune on an upgraded radio, with an affordable aftermarket radio? There is a wide range of radios on the market. There are some that are less than the average car payment and then there are some that are as much as the average mortgage payment. We opted for the reasonably affordable kind. You will have to get a touch screen radio if you're looking for the built-in navigation or a backup camera. Don't be afraid, if you can operate a smartphone, you can operate a touch screen radio. What came with our new ride? We own a 2016 year model vehicle that came from the factory with a touch screen radio, Bluetooth, and a backup camera. It does not have the navigation because that would have required an added badge to the truck put the cost of the vehicle out of our price range. With that being said, we recently upgraded the radio in our 2002 year model vehicle with a radio that has all the bells and whistles, including GPS navigation, and we are seriously debating whether or not we should upgrade the newer truck. The aftermarket radio has more options, a larger screen, and it looks really cool. Why did we choose ours? Our teen drives the 2002 model vehicle. The primary reason for adding every safety feature a radio has to offer. We wanted Bluetooth for hands-free calling and streaming music wirelessly, GPS navigation, WIFI, a DVR dash cam(yeah a Dash Cam), and a backup camera without filling the dash full of devices. Their music is downloaded to the phone or through an app. With the built-in Bluetooth, the radio automatically connects to the phone, giving them access to their music. No more flipping through CD's just to find that one song you want to listen to. It was nothing short of a miracle all those years of flipping through CD's while driving down the road and keeping it between the ditches. Talk about distractions! In conclusion. It's ok to take that small leap into the future. You will probably appreciate answering phone calls without reaching for the phone. Use the backup camera to hook up to the camper or any other trailer and get it right the first time. Navigate to a destination without having an extra device hanging from the dash. And last but not least, our radio has a built-in DVR dash cam. I don't even have to explain the importance of that feature."
18,Advice For Driving Your New Subaru Levorg While Pregnant,autos-trucks," If you’re expecting a new addition to your family, you may be looking at a new Subaru Levorg for sale. This is a great family vehicle and is perfectly suited to the demands of day to day life. However, before you get behind the wheel, you need to know the best way to drive while pregnant, so you and your unborn baby can be comfortable and safe. The Dilemma of Comfort vs. Safety Once you reach 30 weeks, driving can be a real challenge. As your belly expands, reaching the controls can be a problem, particularly if you are a little on the shorter side. While it may be tempting to skip the seatbelt and this is permissible in several countries including Japan, Greece, and Italy, expert research and advice suggest that it is much safer to stay restrained. In the event of a crash, you and your child will be safer if you’re wearing a seatbelt compared to if you collide with the steering wheel. Providing your seatbelt is worn correctly, it will certainly be helpful, but if it is improperly adjusted it could be dangerous. The lap belt should be placed below your bump to ensure that the baby’s own natural protection bubble is not damaged in the event of an accident. If you find the sash belt uncomfortable, you should avoid tucking it under an arm, and wear it diagonally across over one shoulder, pulled to the side of your baby bump. Dealing With the Airbag Airbags are compulsory on all the new cars sold in Australia. Remember that the passenger airbag is far larger than the driver’s airbag, so you’ll need to sit further back. In the driver’s seat, try to have a minimum of 20 centimetres between the rim of the steering wheel and your body. You should also tilt the steering wheel away from your body and toward your face. Coping With Long Journeys While long journeys are best avoided when you’re pregnant, if this is not possible, there are some ways to cope. To stay comfortable, you should adjust the position of your seat regularly, checking that the lumbar settings are supporting your spine and the headrest is behind your neck and head. For increased support, bring a back cushion from home to stay comfortable. You should also take regular breaks to allow you to stretch your legs and prevent further swelling in your feet ankles. If you are thinking about a Subaru Levorg, Perth drivers should visit us. We have a fantastic choice of models including the new Subaru Levorg. The City Subaru sales staff is also on hand to answer any questions, discuss finance and insurance options, and arrange your test drive."

20,How to Wash Your New Peugeot 2008,autos-trucks," Investing in a new Peugeot 2008 is a significant cash outlay for many of us. Many people will already know that for most people a car is only the second biggest purchase after a home. As such, it’s a good idea to protect that investment as much as possible with regular servicing and timely repairs. However, one area that some people neglect is the cleanliness and care of their vehicles bodywork. Car paint can easily be damaged,, and thousands of dollars can be lost from the book value. One of the best ways to keep your car paint in tip top condition is to wash your car correctly. Before You Start Firstly, you will need a flat area to work in the shade with more than enough room to open your car doors whilst cleaning your car. A hose with a variable nozzle will be handy, a pair of buckets, some microfibre cloths, a wheel brush, good car wash formula and an auto towel or two for drying. For the car windows, a roll of kitchen paper, some window cleaner and a pack of electrostatic cloths are handy. For the interior you will need an extension cord, a vacuum cleaner with a hose attachment and many people like to wear rubber gloves to keep their hands clean and dry. Clean the Wheels The wheels are usually the dirtiest and cleaning them first will prevent the transmission of brake dust to other cleaned parts of your car. Scrub your wheels with a wheel brush and soapy water using a separate microfibre cloth for detail work and drying. If the wheel is particularly dirty a spray on wheel cleaner formula can be used to break up the black dust. Wash the Car Always wash your car in a shady spot to prevent spotting as the detergent and water dries in the sun. Start with a thorough hosing down to prevent working loose dirt and grime into your paintwork that will scratch the surface. Prepare a bucket of soapy detergent as instructed on the product label and wash the car thoroughly. Clean from the roof down and treat each panel as a separate piece moving on as it’s completed. Don’t forget to clean in the hinges and door jambs and allow the soap to soak the surface for a few minutes. Rinse the car with a higher pressure hose setting until it is free from soap and grimy water. Then carefully dry with the microfibre cloths, if the car still looks dirty repeat the process until clean and consider adding a wax for additional protection.

1,The Skoda Vision X Concept Highlights Potential for the Skoda New Model 2018 and Beyond,autos-trucks," The Vision X concept has been officially unveiled by Skoda in Geneva, and it looks set to have a massive influence on new Skoda models in the years to come. This concept features a company first hybrid system that includes petrol, electric and natural gas power. The Looks The exterior of the Vision X has a distinct familial resemblance to the new Skoda models. The Vision X looks like a new take on the Kodiaq and Karoq design language. This is obviously intentional, as the concept is a preview of a production SUV that will sit below these two models. The Vision X measures 1807 millimetres wide and 4255 millimetres long, making it the same proportions of the VW T-Roc. Skoda has stated that the model features compact proportions and ""crystalline elements,"" but what is obvious is the Skoda grille and badge that are backlit and a fashionable split headlight design. At the back, the Vision X has edgy LED tail lights and a rugged diffuser with sweeping indicators that have an Audi look. Under the Bonnet What lies under the bonnet is more impressive than the stunning looks of the Vision X. The concept features a hybrid system that includes two electric motors, compressed natural gas tanks, and a 1.5 litre conventional combustion engine. The combustion engine has been tuned for CNG and sends 96 kW power and 200 Nm torque to the Vision X’s front wheels. Skoda claims that this emits up to 25 percent less CO2 compared to conventional petrol powered cars and also provides a similar reduction in harmful particulates. Running this Skoda on sustainably sourced fuel will help to cut the well to wheel emissions even further. This could create a situation where the vehicle will be 100 percent carbon neutral in the right conditions. There is an electric motor attached to the rear axle that is capable of providing power for up to two kilometres without emissions. This provides 1000 Nm of torque to the rear wheels, and there is a second starter generator that can offer an additional 70 Nm for the front axle if needed under heavy acceleration. This system has been designed to provide greater traction and offers a zero to 100 kilometre rate of 9.3 seconds, with a top speed of 200 km/h. Skoda claims that the Vision X has a 650 kilometre driving range. The Vision X is an exciting new concept and provides fantastic insight into potential new Skoda models in the future. If you would like to learn more about Skoda new models, 2018 releases, and the current line up, you should call in and see us. Our sales staff would be delighted to answer any queries about anything Skoda, model cars specifications and current deals."
2,New Skoda Accessories: The Differences Between Standard and Performance Air Filters,autos-trucks," The air intake system on your Skoda has been designed to remove any potentially harmful debris or dirt and prevent it causing damage to the engine. This is achieved using an air filter that is in a box on the left or right side of the engine bay. Air filters have a limited lifespan, so when you start shopping for a replacement, you need to consider whether you need a standard or performance filter. The Types of Performance Filters Generally, there are two types of air filters. These are often marketed as ""High flow"" or ""High Performance"" that are said to increase fuel economy and power. Unfortunately, these are rarely Skoda genuine accessories and are strictly aftermarket options. You will typically have a choice of cotton mesh or dry paper filters. The primary difference between these types of filters is related to the material used for construction. Dry paper filters are designed to fit the air box of your Skoda to reduce airflow restriction. They are easy to fit, but they tend to need to be replaced more often compared to standard filters. Cotton mesh filters have been in use since the 1960s and use fine layers of cotton sandwiched between gauze to allow better engine airflow. To ensure proper filtration, the filter is coated with a thin layer of special oil to capture the smaller particles travelling through the filter. These filters are designed to have a longer lifespan, as they can be washed to remove trapped particles and refitted to the vehicle after the application of a small amount of oil. Unfortunately, if you add too much oil, it can become dislodged and be pulled down the intake, leading to possible contamination of other engine components including the Air Flow Meters or throttle plate. So, Do You Need a Performance Filter? If you need to replace your air filter, you may be tempted to opt for a performance filter, but it is important to appreciate that most performance filters are sold as aftermarket non branded accessories. It is always best to opt for genuine new Skoda accessories that have been specifically designed for your vehicle. Genuine Skoda parts have been produced to the same manufacturer standards, so you have a reassurance of quality and lifespan. In fact, you may compromise your warranty if you choose to install non Skoda parts. So, before you think about installing a performance filter, it is always a good idea to check with your Skoda service technician who can help you to determine the best parts for the safety and performance of your vehicle. If you would like to learn more about new Skoda accessories and parts, you should speak to us. We have a full after sales team who is on hand to answer any queries about Skoda merchandise and can advise you on the best Skoda genuine accessories for your vehicle."
3,Tips for Driving an Auto Skoda Fabia Wagon,autos-trucks," Automatics have become the most popular choice in the Australian car market, but when you’re considering that auto Skoda Fabia wagon for sale, you may not be aware that incorrect use could cause costly damage. While automatic transmissions have evolved a great deal in recent years, it can still be expensive to repair, so here are some top tips to help you drive an auto correctly. Come to a Complete Stop Before Selecting Park There is nothing quite as damaging to the automatic transmission of your Skoda Fabia wagon than putting it into Park before you’ve come to a complete stop. This is where you need to use your brakes, as using the parking pawl of your transmission to try to stop a moving vehicle can cause it to break from the mechanism, allowing broken fragments to circulate through the transmission causing untold damage. Instead, you should use the foot brake to stop the vehicle, set the handbrake and then select Park on the transmission. Park Isn’t a Parking Brake There is a reason why your vehicle is equipped with a handbrake. This will stop the wheels from turning and prevent your Fabia from rolling. Your transmission parking pawl is not designed for this stress; it would be like trying to rest the weight of your car on your finger. Your vehicle is equipped with powerful brakes, so use them. Don’t Change Direction Before You Completely Stop You should only shift between Drive and Reverse after coming to a complete stop. Relying on your transmission to use an opposing ratio can cause damage to the clutches and bands, creating costly damage. Always use your brakes to stop completely and then select the new ratio, or you could risk disabling your car. Don’t Shift to Neutral at Lights If your approaching lights, there really is no reason to shift to neutral. Your torque converter will halt the engine drive, so there is no need to do it manually. Leaving your car in drive also creates less pressure and force to activate the torque converter when you want to move off. Additionally, avoid coasting in Neutral. Some drivers attempt this to save fuel, but it can be highly dangerous. It removes the ability to quickly speed up and may even cause brake fade. Feed Your Throttle When you’re moving from a standstill, you should use light throttle pressure to get your Fabia rolling. Avoid applying sudden pressure as it can cause damage. Don’t rev the engine in Neutral, instead select Drive and feed the throttle for steady and safe progress. If you’re thinking about a Skoda Fabia Wagon for sale in Perth, you should visit us. We have an impressive choice of new and quality pre-owned models including the Skoda Fabia Wagon. Our sales team would be delighted to answer any queries or arrange a test drive of the new Skoda Fabia Wagon for sale."

6,Things You Need to Do When Buying New Skoda Cars for Sale 2018,autos-trucks," Whether you’ve bought a new car before or are a novice to that intoxicating new car smell, you may not be aware that there are some things every new car owner should do. Many of these things are simple tasks or habits, but they can help to improve the performance and lifespan of Skoda cars for sale. 2018 may be your year to buy a new car, so here are the things you need to be prepared to do. Look After Your Tyres When it comes to car sales, Skoda takes pride in equipping models properly, and this includes great tyres. However, even the best tyres still need some care and attention to ensure proper performance. Tyres are more than just something for your car to roll on. Tyre condition makes a massive difference to how the vehicle turns, handles and stops in both dry and wet conditions. Incorrectly inflated tyres also increase fuel use, so it can end up hitting you hard in the wallet. So, familiarise yourself with the recommended tyre pressures and form a habit of checking your tyres regularly. Use the Air Conditioning Air conditioning is fairly standard throughout the Skoda range in Australia, but there are some things that you need to bear in mind about air conditioning in cars. The most important thing about car AC is that you need to use it or it can be damaged. Leaving your air conditioning unused for months can lead to costly repairs. So, be sure to run the AC periodically for at least a few minutes. Remember that air conditioning can also be used to clear a misted windscreen, so you can use it throughout winter and improve visibility. Keep Your Wipers in Good Condition Australia is generally a dry climate, and this can create massive problems for your wipers. This can mean that when a deluge of rain does arrive, it can compromise our vision of the road ahead. So, it is vitally important to keep your wipers in good condition and always ensure that your washer bottle is filled. Good condition wipers mean that you can minimise the risk of a streaky windscreen causing vision problems on the road. Develop Smooth Driving Habits New cars can take a little while for components to wear in and start operating as intended. So, it is important that you keep your driving smooth at least for the first few weeks of driving. Try to avoid harsh braking or acceleration as this can put the car under increased strain. While smooth driving habits are important for a new car, it is worth considering that they will also improve your fuel economy, so they are good lifetime habits. If you are interested in new Skoda cars for sale, you should call in and see us. We have an impressive range of vehicles including the latest Skoda models. Our sales staff is also on hand to answer any queries about car sales, Skoda models or finance deals."
7,How To Know When Not To Buy A Used Car,autos-trucks," If you are looking to save money by buying a used car, it can be a very viable tactic. However, even though you are on a tight budget, buying a used car should not be immediately decided upon and should take a lot of consideration. Why? This is to avoid throwing your hard earned money away. Below are some pointers that may help you decide when to buy or not to buy a used car: If the reason why you choose to purchase a used car is because of your budget, then it should be the same reason why you should be careful and meticulous in choosing a used car. Thus, if the car needs a lot of maintenance, repairs, and other modifications, it is best not to buy that used car (or else you lose the benefits of buying a used car). This could mean a lot of negative things and you are the only one who will be at the losing end. Documents are crucial especially if the car is second hand. It is the only solid guarantee that you can get hold of when buying used cars. If this is the case, then, you might as well not pursue the deal. There are instances wherein some people tend to opt for used cars because of the model of the car being sold. It is their dream car and there is no other way they can purchase them but to buy them second hand. However, if you are not comfortable with the car after test-driving it, then it would be better not to pursue the deal, even if it means the world to you to have that car. The bottom line is that buying used cars should never be your sole alternative if you cannot afford to buy new ones. This means that you should value the process of choosing a used car like what you would do when buying a new car. In the end, it is your money that will be put to risk. Thus, it is extremely important to consider all the factors in order to have the best buy ever. Happy hunting!"

11,The white van: then and now,autos-trucks," The white van man has always been recognised in society – but what are the origins of this stereotype? Originally, white vans were chosen for practical reasons. They were often chosen to transport food from location to location because they were the most efficient at keeping the produce cool before fridges were available in vans. However, now, more companies are choosing different colour vans, or having their vehicle wrapped to advertise their business and ensure they stand out on the road against competitors. Retailers of commercial vans, Van Monster, take a look over the history of the white van to establish how they have evolved over time to what they are today. The story of the white van The first recorded use of the white van stereotype in the press was in 1997, by The Sunday Times in an article titled ‘Number is up for the White Van Man’. Originally a British stereotype, the white van man was a term constructed for the driver of a small commercial van. Closer to present day, the term was used in road safety campaigns ran by Freight Transport Association in 2010. White vans first became the most popular van colour when van drivers recognised white as the most efficient coloured van to keep produce cool inside. This is because the light colour of the vehicle is able to reflect more sunlight away from the vehicle. White, silver, and other light colours are coolest, reflecting about 60% of sunlight. The term white van man once referred collectively to all van drivers, and it was not necessarily a positive stereotype. However, the modern day stereotype has evolved. A new study reveals that ‘white van drivers’ are now considered as diligent and hard working with average yearly earnings of £21,000. Dispelling the clichés, they therefore contribute over £35 billion annually to the UK economy and have an estimated turnover of £215 billion per year. What colour is most popular van colour? White has reigned top for quite some time now. In 2014, white still remained the most popular colour for vans, with 57% of new vans registered in white. However, some industry professionals believed this could have been down to cost rather than anything else. White light goods vehicle still seemed to dominate the roads, however, 2014 also experienced an influx in sales for silver vans – up 8% in the past decade. The silver medal coincidentally goes to silver vans, taking second plan behind white vans for the most popular colour, followed by blue in third and red in fourth. Whilst white still reigns supreme in the world of vans, an increase in other colours shows that fleet managers are willing to step out their comfort zone and inject some colour into the fleet. However, for vehicle wrapping and customisation, white vans provide fleet managers with a blank canvas to market their business – another reason why white vans could have stuck at the top spot. The rise is vehicle wrapping Arbitron's In-Car Study claims UK drivers can spend an average of 20 hours on the roads every week (a 31% increase from the 2003) which equates to 1,040 hours a year, or a month and a half, for every driver. The Department of Transport revealed there were 35.6 million registered vehicles on the road in the UK. That is a lot of potential customers that you could reach through vehicle wrapping! The investment return has great potential. According to experts, more than 70% of motorists are influenced positively by the products and companies that they see advertised on other vehicles. And if that isn’t enough to convince you, 98% of people on the roads said they noticed truck ads, with 35% of them actually studying these advertisements closely. On average, a busy vehicle can be seen by more than 3,000 people every hour, meaning just one car wrap could generate between 30,000 and 70,000 views per day! Vehicle wrapping is a cost-effective way to advertise your business that can generate significant results fast."
12,How to avoid a car crash,autos-trucks," Car crashes are an unfortunate reality of driving, but they don’t have to be yours. Here are a few things to think about to prevent an accident, and on-road considerations. Scenarios to help you avoid a crash while driving: Avoiding a crash when you’re stationary If you’re stationary and turning from a main road onto another road, always have your wheels straight. This prevents you from turning into oncoming traffic if you’re nudged from behind, or you suddenly accelerate by mistake. If you’re stationary in heavy traffic, always stay alert by using your mirrors to see what’s happening behind you. If others aren’t concentrating you can use your mirrors to avoid them if they start to edge forwards or backwards. Avoiding a crash when you’re moving Swerving suddenly to avoid something on the road such as a lost animal is a common cause of crashes and accidents, especially at speed. Sadly, hitting that sweet Peter Rabbit may be the only way to prevent yourself being in a serious accident. Even if you’re an animal lover you have to think; him or me? Keeping both hands on the wheel is a good way to help avoid a crash while moving, as it ensures you’re already prepared to manoeuvre in traffic. While you may feel dorky keeping your hands at the ’10 and 2’ positions on the wheel, that posture is invented for a reason as it’s the ‘ready’ position for driving. Avoiding injury when a crash is imminent Sometimes heavy vehicles with trailers or caravans aren’t used to managing the extra weight and end up out of control even in heavy traffic. If someone behind you is getting too close and they’re honking and can’t stop but you’re stuck in traffic, turn your wheels so your car is on an angle to get out of the way as much as possible. You’ll still get a ding in your car, but the slow speed and the new angle will help minimise the damage. Always wear a seatbelt properly. This sounds so basic, but many people thread their arm over the diagonal belt as it’s more comfortable, which makes the belt useless. If an accident is about to happen and you can see it coming, wearing your seatbelt properly reduces your risk of serious injury by up to 50%. Prevent a car crash by: Speed is the most important aspect of driving when staying safe. It’s not only about sticking to the speed limit either, the speed you drive should also depend on conditions. Even if you’re driving in a 60km/hr zone, if it’s very wet or foggy, you can adjust your speed so you feel comfortable and safe. Driving when tired has a huge impact on your ability to think quickly, and is one of the main causes of fatalities on the road in Victoria, Australia. Did you know: Uber has become so popular, there’s no reason why you need to drive when you’re exhausted. Heavy rain, snow, ice and fog make your risk of being in a car accident much higher. As soon as the outside conditions are different to what you’re used to, you’ll need to concentrate much harder to complete your journey. Staying home may be a better option, or use Uber of course. Smart phones are one of the best modern inventions, but they are also dangerous when paired with driving. Using your phone while driving is illegal, but many people still attempt to text and drive in slow traffic. Commenting on that cute Instagram post can wait. You’re a good driver, but it’s easy to get complacent. Try the tips above to steer out of harms way and stay safe when driving."

15,Winter Driving Tips,autos-trucks," Access Rent A Car is now providing vehicles equipped with winter tires for any of your Canadian winter travels.  When it comes to the winter, it’s just not enough to prepare your own self for the cold, but to prepare your vehicle as well. If you are planning to rent a car, know that these preparations have already been implemented to ensure your safety. However, driving on winter roads can be a challenge so here is some pieces of advice on how to drive in the winter. Before you head outside, always check the weather conditions and the road conditions. Pay special attention to any of the warnings that might be displayed on the top of the weather website or news channel. If you are travelling in a place that is not familiar to you, ask the locals. They know the roads better than you do and how perilous it might be. If they say that it is a bad idea to drive, trust them, they are likely right. A GPS is great for navigating! But not so great in factoring in the different seasons and the unpredictable weather conditions. If you encounter a road that is closed, it really is closed. There is a reason why the road is closed whether the pavement is too icy, or it is known to cause some accidents in the winter time. When driving, keep the gas tank at least half full to avoid any gas line freeze up. Now driving in the winter is one thing if it’s only the cold weather that you’re dealing with. Driving in the snow is another matter. Tips for Driving in Snow Accelerate and decelerate slowly. Applying the gas slowly is good for regaining traction and to avoid skidding. Also, make sure to take the time when braking; it takes longer to slow down on icy roads. When driving behind cars, keep more distance than usual between you and them in case of any sudden stops – again, everything is slower when driving in icy and snowy conditions. Stopping will take much longer on snowy and icy roads than on dry pavement. Don’t attempt to power up any hills. Applying that extra gas on snow covered roads will just get your wheels spinning. The best way to go up the hill is to get some speed before making the ascent. Brake slowly before making turns. This will reduce the speed before you enter and minimize any chance of slipping and sliding. Do NOT cruise control if there is snow and ice on the roads, because if your car ends up hydroplaning, it will try to accelerate causing you to lose control. Don’t ‘pump’ the brakes, especially if the vehicle is equipped with an anti-locking braking system. Access Rent A Car highly values their customer’s safety and ensures a part of it by installing quality winter tires on all the vehicles they provide."
16,A Car Buyers Guide to Making Sure You Don’t Purchase a Lemon,autos-trucks," Buying a used vehicle is a frightening task for many people. There are so many factors to consider when making the choice, especially if it will be your first time buying a car. Before you sit down to sign the dotted line we recommend you look into some of these details about the car you are purchasing. The Car’s appearance: For this step you can typically walk around the car checking the paint for scratches, dents, and any spots that have begun to rust. Ask the salesperson if they paint is, so you’ll know if there is anything possibly hiding underneath. There are two easy ways to check if the car has been repainted recently. First, you can look at the sides of the car from end-on to see if there is any waviness. Second, run your finger along the edges of the joints between panels to check for roughness. If you feel any roughness this can indicate masking tape was used while repainting the vehicle. While the car is at ground level you will want to inspect the tires for damage and wear and tear. Tires should all match and should be worn evenly. If the tread on the tires is uneven this can be a sign the car has bad alignment. It’s also a good idea to look at the car from a few steps back to ensure it is sitting correctly and the tires are not flat or sagging. Always ask for the previous history of the vehicle before buying. Most dealerships will offer a free Carfax or similar report. This will make you aware of any accidents, maintenance, repairs, and damage that may have occurred previously. It is also wise to check the interior and exterior of the vehicle for any damage caused by rain, hail, flooding, or other natural disasters. You don’t need to be an expert mechanic to visually see if an engine will need work. Pop the hood of the car and inspect the engine area for any signs of rust, grease, spilled fluid, or burnt oil. These are signs that something internally is malfunctioning and will need to be repaired. Finally, you should never buy a used vehicle without first taking it for a test drive. While on the test drive listen for any sounds that may indicate engine or other problems with the vehicle. There shouldn’t be any whining, squealing, or clunking. Check to make sure the steering is straight, the gears shift smoothly and the brakes are able to stop the car smoothly. It’s also a good idea to have a mechanic check the car out during your test drive if possible. Stick to these tips and you’re sure to find a winner out there. Good luck!"
17,How to Make Sure the Used Car You Are Buying Won't Be a Lemon,autos-trucks," Purchasing a car can be a daunting task. There are so many things to consider when making that big purchase, especially if it is your first car. So, before you sign on the dotted line, you may want to look into the following: The overall appearance: This is where you can simply walk around the car to check the paint job for any scratches, dents, or rust spots. Try to see if the paint job is new and possibly hiding issues underneath it. There are two ways to check if the car has been repainted. First, look at the sides of the car from end-on to see if there is any waviness. Second, run your finger along the edges of the joints between panels for roughness. The roughness can indicate masking tape. Tires: Make sure the car is ground-level before doing this next check. Once, the car is ground-level you will want to inspect the tires. The tires should all match and look to be worn evenly. Look at the surface of the tire for features to determine if the car has bad alignment. Lastly, take a step back and look at the car as a whole to view if the car is sitting on the tires correctly and not sagging. Damage: You should always ask for the previous history of the vehicle before purchasing. This history will let you know of any wrecks that have happened. Its great to know about the previous accidents, but it is not the only thing you should be concerned about. You will also want to check for flood damage. Flood damage can be determined by simply checking the headlight and taillight lenses for any sign of moisture or condensation inside, lift the carpet to look for any muddy, moldy, or mildew smell and inspect the trunk for any rust. Test drive: Never buy a car without test driving it first. When you take the car for a test drive, listen for sounds that may indicate engine problems. There should never be any whining, thrumming, or squeals. Make sure the steering stays straight, the transmission shifts okay from high to low, and that the brakes stop the car smoothly and soundless. Engine appearance: You do not need to be a mechanic to tell if any engine may need work. Pop the hood and check the engine for rust, burnt oil, or grease. You want to make sure the engine is dry with only a dark grey residue if any. Hopefully, after following these simple inspections, you will find a peach and not a lemon. Good luck!"

Topex here can share a few car wiper speed adjustment tips, hoping to help you better use the car wiper. Car wiper basic knowledge Car wiper: generally by the fast, slow two-speed sustained file, intermittent file and a single gear. In the next heavy rain, fast, slow two sustained files will often be used, and in the light rain, intermittent file convenience is reflected. In general: ① wipers in the continuous low-speed operating frequency of about 20-45 times / min (the fastest 3 seconds to complete a job). ② wiper in the high-speed file can even reach more than 45 times / minute frequency. ③ Intermittent wiper work time is generally the same with the continued low gear, but will increase the intermittent about 2-12 seconds. When driving, the owner can judge the use of the appropriate frequency according to the weather. Now a lot of cars, wipers are provided an intermittent gear. In fact, not every trip will encounter the case of heavy rain, if the wipers are only using fast, slow two sustained files, then it is easy to cause visual dizziness.

Dial a gear is intermittent file, and then dial up a gear for the slow sustained file, the last file for the fast continuous file. In addition：you can trigger the wiper work once by turning the lever down. There is also a knob on the wiper's lever, which is the wiper's intermittent speed control knob. Speed control knobs generally have several gears, when the wiper in the gap file, through the knob to adjust the wiper frequency (speed) is gradually change. In this way, it is easy to find the appropriate intermittent frequency when dealing with different rainfall conditions. Adjustable speed intermittent wipers are equipped with many models, you can observe the car under the wiper, the operating steps are basically the same. In some models only provide non-adjustable speed intermittent file, if living in more rain areas, then the need to consider when the car. In addition, some models used in conjunction with the speed of the wiper intermittent file, and some models are used rain sensor and wiper gap file speed linkage mechanism, such models are generally no adjustable wiper intermittent file (is automatic) Driving the owners need to pay more attention.

20,Troubling Trends in New Car Ownership,autos-trucks," According to a new study by Autolist there could be troubling trends on the horizon for new car ownership. The study helps illustrate how auto makers are being impacted by younger buyers increasingly wanting to purchase used vehicles. Are new trends in vehicle ownership a sign of struggles to come for car makers? According to a new study by San Francisco tech start-up Autolist, there are some troubling trends on the horizon in the Auto industry. Autolist recently surveyed 9,315 individuals from September 2016 to May 2017 and found that buyers increasingly prefer used cars over new cars. Overall, only 34% of buyers would purchase a new vehicle while 38% of buyers would purchase a used vehicle. According to the results the demographic most likely to opt for an older car are younger buyers. 53.7% of people under the age of 40 would purchase a used vehicle. Not only are they more likely to seek out used cars over new cars, they also plan to own their vehicles for a shorter amount of time. 60% of Centennials and 47.4% of Millennials plan on owning their next car for under 5 years. This is a significant difference compared to just the 39.2% of Boomers who plan on owning their next car for under 5 years. So what does this data mean for auto makers? Cadillac and Audi are lucky, with over 3/4 of buyers wanting to buy new again within 5 years. 77.1% of Cadillac owners and 75% of Audi owners estimate they will purchase another car within five years. Others, like Subaru, can hope owners come back sometime after 5 years. 73.6% of Subaru owners will be keeping their car for more than 5 years. This could mean that people who are interested in purchasing luxury type vehicles have more disposable income and are less interested in making a vehicle last as a long term investment. How do you think this trend will impact the auto industry?  Methodology: Autolist surveyed 9,315 individuals from September 2016 to May 2017. Responses were aggregated to ensure representation of all 50 states. The data sample is accurate within a 95% confidence interval with a margin of error of +/- 2%. Centennials were defined as individuals ages 16-24 in 2017, Millennials as individuals 25 - 39, Gen X as individuals 40 - 54, Boomers as individuals 55 - 69, and Traditionalists as individuals 70+. Calculations (averages, differences, etc.) were performed according to traditional statistical methodology."

Paul from Corona, CA has this to say about our Easy-Run Engine Test Stand. ""One day I came home and sitting in the driveway was a used F-150 my brother had bought hours earlier. The price for the truck was super cheap, but it didn’t come running. It was in dire need of an engine repair. My grandfather - who for over 3 decades worked as a taxi driver and did maintenance on his own car - came down to look at the truck. On the first day he went into the garage and hours later came inside covered in grime and oil. He had climbed inside the cab of the truck to do engine repairs inside. This was backbreaking work for a man his age, so I told him to hold off on the repairs. I found Easy-Run online, they were the first to show up for engine test stands. Reading up on what the engine test stand was and its benefits, I decided upon the Professional Series. It took only a couple of days before UPS came with the engine test stand in a box. With quick assembly, we put together the stand and as a family we unhooked the engine, brought it out and mounted it on the Easy-Run engine test stand. Honestly, my grandfather wishes he had one of these growing up. The Easy-Run engine test stand is truly capable of everything it says it does, and really speeds up repair time and testing it before it even goes back in. Within a day of taking out the engine, it was ready to go back in. The look on my brother’s face as he saw his new F-150 come to life made this well worth it. I have an extensive family, and many of us have cars that need work under the hood. Fortunately, our Easy-Run engine test stand will make life a whole lot easier for my grandfather, who now has a backorder of family jobs to do.""

4,Simple and Easy DIY Tips for Removing Dents from Your Car,autos-trucks," One of the most common problems that you are going to face with your car is not the electrical or mechanical kind. Instead, the most common issue is that of dents. In fact, you are likely to get dents in your car no matter where you drive and how careful you are. After all, there are innumerable ways that a car can be dented. Since you cannot avoid them all the time, it is a good idea to learn the various ways of removing dents from a car. However, keep in mind that these tricks can only be used if the damage is not severe. Compressed Air and Hair Dryer This method is suitable when the dent has occurred on the plastic such as the bumpers. It is quite popular as well. In order to remove the dent, you need a can of compressed air and a hair dryer. Choose the highest temperature setting on the hair dryer. Aim it on the dent. This expands the plastic. As soon as the plastic becomes hot enough, use the compressed air and spray the area. The cold air from the can makes the plastic contract. This results in the dent popping out. Plunger This is another very common method for getting rid of dents. A plunger can actually be quite effective for small dents. Here, you should first apply some water on the dent as well as the plunger. Place the plunger on the top of the dent and start operating it. With a few pushes and pulls, the dent should pop out. You should ensure that you are using a cup type plunger that is used for sinks. Avoid the flange plungers that are typically used for toilets. Boiling Water In spite of being made out of plastic, bumpers are incredibly stiff. Of course, they need to be. However, this is also a problem when they get dented. To get around the stiffness, you need to soften the plastic first. This can be easily done with some boiling water. After pouring the boiling hot water, hit the dent from the opposite side to make it pop back out. You need to remember that the plastic is not going to remain hot for long. Therefore, you need to be quick in your movements. If required, you can ask someone to help you out. Additionally, ensure proper precautions are taken as the boiling water can be dangerous. You can repeat the process as many times as required to get the dent out completely. Dry Ice It is easy to get dry ice as it is commonly utilised as a cooling agent. It can also be a nifty way to eliminate small dents from the cars. However, while handling dry ice, wear protective gloves. Your safety is important at all times. Take a piece of dry ice and place it on the top of the dent. Rub the dry ice around the dent. It may take some time but the dent should eventually pop. It is possible that the dry ice may need to be reapplied a few times before the dent pops back out. If it does not seem to be working, you should get a hair dryer. Blow hot air onto the dent with the hair dryer first before applying dry ice. When to Hire a Professional Company? Keep in mind that the above techniques are mostly suitable for shallow dents. If the dents are too deep, hire a professional company to sort it out for you. You should also do the same if you do not see any results with the above tricks. After all, you do not want to end up damaging your car further simply to get rid of a dent. A professional company will have trained staff and specialist tools on hand. As a result, they are more likely to ensure proper dent removal."
5,Blower motor resistor replacement,autos-trucks," The heater blower motor reduces or increases the amount of air blowing through the dashboard vents based on the fan speed selected or, in an automatic climate control system, the interior temperature and other factors. But resistors, small electronic parts tucked out of sight, are what actually control the fan speed by reducing the amount of electrical current going to the blower motor. When everything is working properly, setting the fan speed at its lowest setting, for example, will tell the resistor to restrict the amount of current to a low level. But if the resistor burns out or wears out from corrosion, there is nothing to reduce the amount of voltage going to the blower motor for the lowest fan speed, so it will most likely get the maximum current and run at full speed. How often do heater blower motor resistors need to be replaced? Blower motors resistors tend to fail frequently in high mileage vehicles, but their failure does not depend on mileage. Age can be a factor as the plastic can become brittle over time, or heat may cause electronic failure. The amount of use a blower motor receives may also be a factor. SA1473 Heater Blower Motor Resistor used in A/C unit vent to adjust the outlet temperature. Plug and play, much easier to be connected than the original one. Built-in circuit protection device, so that quality is improved to ensure an extended serve life. An extremely wide range of application for Citroen / Peugeot / Renault / Nissan. And inexpensive wholesale price at SACER. What to look out for when dealing with heater blower motor resistor issues? If the blower motor is making a grinding or rattling noise, the blower motor resistor is typically not at fault. When some of the fan speed settings stop functioning, it is considered safe to use on the remaining settings, as those circuits have not suffered failure. Until the vehicle is repaired, further use should not complicate the issue. When all fan speeds are not functioning, the blower motor will be suspected, and the blower motor resistor may be tested in the process.  What SACER Ltd offers to customers SACER strives to provide a truly qualified products and professional service with great attention to detail to our customers, mainly in European and North American auto repair shops and factories. to provide an affordable repair alternative that not only restores your part to like new condition, but in many cases improve on the reliability and longevity.

6,Stepper Motor replacement for Nissan Tida / Livina /Teana,autos-trucks," What is a stepper? Stepper Motor is basically a synchronous Motor which is rotating with pulse frequency at some angles. When you need position or motion control Stepper motor is used. To control Stepper two signal are required one is pulse frequency and second is direction. In stepper motor there is no brushes. This motor does not rotate continuously, instead it rotates in form of pluses or in discrete steps. That’s why it is called stepper motor. There are different types of motors available on the basis of steps per rotation, for example- 12 steps per rotation, 24 steps per rotation etc. We can control or operate Stepper motor with the feedback or without any feedback. How does a stepper motor work? To make the motor shaft turn, first one electromagnet is given power, which makes the gear’s teeth magnetically attracted to the electromagnet’s teeth. The point when the gear’s teeth are thus aligned to the first electromagnet, they are slightly offset from the next electromagnet. So when the next electromagnet is turned ON and the first is turned OFF, the gear rotates slightly to align with the next one and from there the process is repeated. Each of those slight rotations is called a step, with an integer number of steps making a full rotation. In that way, the motor can be turned by a precise. Stepper motor doesn’t rotate continuously, they rotate in steps.

7,COG LCD display Replacement,autos-trucks," LCDs are often supplied as LCD modules which have built-in driver circuitry that simplifies installation and improves reliability. However, the addition of packaged driver circuitry in Instrument Clusters LCD modules also results in a number of disadvantages because it: Increases the thickness of the display Raises the costs Creates greater vulnerability for failures of the modules All of these drawbacks are important considerations when it comes to displays for industrial, automotive and portable equipment. That’s why designers in these areas should strongly consider using Chip-on-Glass (COG) LCD modules. Chip-on-Glass (COG) LCD modules offer a very thin profile, enhanced reliability, and a reasonable price. In comparison, COG modules have the LCD driver mounted directly on an overlapping edge of one of the glass plates that make up the LCD. The resulting module is an integrated display, less than 3 mm thick, with all connections from the LCD driver to the LCD completely isolated from the environment. With COG modules, each connection requires only one bond, which ensures optimal reliability of the module. As the pioneers of chip-on-glass LCD technology, we have worked closely with leading manufacturers for years to lower costs, simplify PCB layouts, and improve the upgradeability, flexibility and reliability of their LCD displays using COG designs.

8,Don't Make the $500 Mistake,autos-trucks," Your ride is dependent of a healthy engine, and what better way to keep that engine healthy then by utilizing an engine test stand. Engine test stands are the easy way to get things in the garage done. Not only do you avoid the cycle of installing your engine to find problems, you save yourself a lot of time, energy and money. Making your own engine test stand can be more of a pain than repairing your engine. Calculating dimensions, purchasing parts, building the assembly, fine tuning, test running, and finding ways to store your DIY engine test stand is a tall task. There are a few flimsy designs on the internet, however these stands are usually one time ordeals and can’t support anything bigger than a small-block engine. Some of the better DIY designs out start around $1500, but for the price they are you may as well save yourself time, energy and headaches by looking at professional grade universal engine test stands. Figuring out a design on your own through trial and error can turn expensive, with final costs that can exceed the price of the best professional engine test stands on the market. For many car junkies, testing an engine out on the garage floor or on a resting tire is the easy way out. However, if you look at yours or other people’s engines on a daily basis, you may want to upgrade that tire to a professional engine run stand. Professional engine test stands come with the tools you need to safely, efficiently test and diagnose problems with an engine and get it running properly before re-installation with little to no trouble. If you own or work in an automotive repair shop, you deal with engines on a constant basis. When it comes to identifying engine problems and fixing them, there’s no better way than on an engine test stand. More than likely, you want or need multiple engine test stands to take on your orders and get them back under their hoods in a timely fashion. Building your own test stands can be handy, but can you need a lot of the right equipment to build one yourself, and even harder to design one that is universal and works for all engine types that come through your shop. Invest in a quality engine test stand, and get your engine roaring in no time at all."
9,ACC Unit LCD Display For Seat Leon / Toledo,autos-trucks," An instrument cluster is the collection of gauges, dials and lights right above the steering wheel that tell you what’s going on in your vehicle. Generally, your car’s instrument cluster will last the lifetime of the car and you’ll never have a problem with any of them.  However, when one of them fail, you’ll have a problem that ranges from mildly annoying (the engine lights up and doesn’t turn off) to inconvenient (the gas gauge doesn’t register) to dangerous (the oil indicator doesn’t work). Some of the more common failures include: Erratic or non-functional gauges & inaccurate readings.

10,Window Regulator For Renault,autos-trucks," The mechanism that moves the window up and down is called the window regulator. In cars with power windows, the window regulator is powered by an electric motor, called the window motor. In some cars, the window motor comes with the window regulator as one unit; in others, the window motor can be replaced separately. There are two basic types of window regulators: the gear-drive type (in the photo) and the cable type (see photo below). In a typical sedan, there are four window regulators; one inside each door. In some convertibles, a separate window regulator can be installed inside the rear quarter panel. A window regulator doesn't need any maintenance or adjustment. If it fails, the failed part or the whole unit must be replaced. Window regulator problems Problems with window regulators are common. A broken window regulator cable can cause the window to jam or fall down inside the door. See this example, where the cable broke and the power window stopped working. In cold temperatures, the window can freeze in closed position. When the window switch is operated down, the window can separate from the window regulator. If this happens, in some cars, the window can be re-secured without replacing parts, in others the window regulator might need to be replaced.

11,A Quality Engine Test Stand Starts Here,autos-trucks," ""Measure twice, cut once."" That’s a quote many of us have heard, and a lot of us can use every day. We all know how strenuous it can be to constantly take out an engine, and some of us dread engine work for that very reason. When it comes to repairing an automotive engine, you want it to run right, the first time. Now you can! Today we take a clear look at engine test stands, and how one can help you diagnose issues much quicker, saving you time and heartaches. Engine test stands are pieces of equipment any garage geek or automotive technician can use in their workspace. One of them is exactly what you need to diagnose, tune, and repair an engine block. An engine test stand comes in super handy and you’ll never want to do another engine project without one. If you’re looking at an engine test stand, there is one that beats out all the others with flying marks. Let’s take a look today at what makes a quality engine test stand. A Quality Engine Test Stand Starts Here Engine test stands are built specifically for one reason, to mount an engine on so you can test it outside of your car. An engine test stand is different than the rest for many reasons. Ease of access should be one of the top qualities you expect out of an engine test stand. There’s little room for a stand that obscures parts of your engine, parts that may need fixing. engine test stands make it easy to diagnose and repair any part of your engine, thanks to its unique design that provides great ground clearance. Each model has a base frame, 54"" or 66"" in length that has a cross member in the middle with a cradle mount to support the engine block. The radiator, tool tray, dash panel and rear mount system are all easily removable, so when those aren’t being used you can take them off and have even more room to work on your engine. Safety is yet another quality that many engine test stands lack but the engine test stand does not. The fuel tank and battery are kept separate from each other, one in the front and other in the rear, with the exhaust staying inside the frame rails. There is a Master Switch on the dash panel, in case of an emergency. The radiator can be moved up and down to limit the formation of air pockets inside the engine. It’s easy to remove the Bellhousing to inspect any R/Main and/or O/Pan leaks. Above all, the stand is extremely stable, even when a high output engine is mounted. Mobility is a bonus for an engine test stand. engine test stand comes with 6"" casters (8"" casters are optional) that provide easy rotation of a stand, room to slide underneath the stand to work on the base of an engine, and make transport a lot easier. Besides casters, you want your engine test stand to be storable. Most stands turn into dusty rag bars in the corner of your workshop when not in use. That’s not what an engine test stand is for! Find a stand that, when not in use, can be easily broken down back into its packaging and tucked away appropriately until used again."

13,Insider Tips to Safe Driving in Highways,autos-trucks," Watch your speed. With so many vehicles on the road, it’s smart to be considerate to other drivers and be alert with all traffic laws. For a safe driving in highway, be sure that you travel at the posted speed limit and adjust it when the going is getting rough. Consider factors that may indicate you to slow down including rain, snow, bumper-to-bumper traffic, and construction. Keep distance. This one may seem like a no-brainer, but no one wants being tailgated. Besides, if the motorist in front of you comes to a quick stop, driving too closely can be dangerous. Hence, it is always wise to keep a safe distance from the vehicle ahead of you. However, you may increase your distance to the vehicle ahead if it’s a motorcycle. Also, you may need to do the same thing when it’s snowing or raining. Keep right. On the majority of highways, the left lane is the passing lane, so be sure to always keep right except when you overtake. Some interstates post signs to implement this road ruled. When you get caught camping out on the left, then you could be pulled over or ticketed. Increase your visibility. The trick to maximizing your visibility is to have a good view from the driver’s seat. Also, it is very essential to make sure that the other motorists can clearly see you. To ensure your safety, turn the headlights on when you use your windshield wipers or when the sun sets. Furthermore, it’s wise to make sure that your exterior lights, windows, and windshields are all clean. Consider enrolling in driving lessons in West London to learn more skills. Be focused, alert and well-rested. A safe driving on the road starts with good driving manners. Don’t be distracted by anything, and give your undivided attention to the highway. For instance, put down your smartphones when driving. Cellphone use can impair your ability to focus and react on-road situations. So before you even buckle up, silence your smartphone to prevent a text, email or call to distract you while driving. Be sure that you are well-rested, too. You may stretch every after a couple of hours to avoid drowsiness during driving. Check your mirrors. Even before ta motorist drives on a highway, he must adjust the side mirrors and rearview. Car mirrors are extremely useful when changing lanes especially when there could be up to four car lanes aiming to get ahead of the pack. Every car side mirror should be positioned in a way that you can clearly see along the whole side of the car without even craning your neck. You should have an easy view of what’s behind you through the rearview mirror. Before you hop on to the highway, be sure to check the mirrors, turn the signal on, and know what’s behind your car. Look ahead. Sometimes, motorists get involved in road accidents because they don’t keep looking ahead. Keep in mind that highways are usually busier than common roads and you can cover a great distance with just one sneeze. Be sure that you are mindful of what’s going on ahead. Accelerate fast. When you enter an expressway, be sure to giving a signal. Look for a gap on the road where you can briskly accelerate upon entering the expressway in order to match your vehicle’s speed with the other drivers. This way, you won’t block other motorists’ way. These safety tips will keep you safe and less stressed when driving on busy highways. If you want to learn driving, you can hire a driving instructor Ealing to help you gain confidence in driving on highways. As a bonus precaution, know how to check oil, change tyres and do other routine maintenance for your vehicle."
14,Car Shipping from Texas to New York,autos-trucks," ‘I am soon shipping my car from Texas to New York. What should I expect?’ For most first-time car shippers, this is a common question. People rarely transport their cars so it is not strange feeling confused when it comes to auto transportation issues. It is always important to have in mind what to expect during an auto shipping process. With such information, you will have peace of mind and increase your chances of ending up with great auto shipping services. What aspects should you keep in mind, then?

16,Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Systems,autos-trucks," What Is EGR System? Due to high temperatures inside the combustion chamber, often in excess of 2,500 degrees F, Nitrogen (N2) and Oxygen (O2) combine to form oxides of Nitrogen (NOx).  NOx is a harmful gas which in the presence of sunlight reacts with hydrocarbons in the atmosphere to form Ozone (O3). Exhaust gases are generated by the combustion chamber once the air-fuel mixture is burnt during the Power Stroke.   These exhaust gases are ""thrown out"" of the combustion chamber during the Exhaust Stroke.  The exhaust gases, including NOx, pass through the Exhaust Valve, the Exhaust Passages and eventually to the atmosphere through the Exhaust System. The EGR system routes some of the exhaust gases (6 – 10%) through the EGR valve, back in to the Intake System, and eventually inside the combustion chamber.  The exhaust gases are inert i.e. they do not burn in the combustion chamber; also, the exhaust gases take up some of the space which would otherwise be taken by the intake air.  This reduces the amount of intake air available for the combustion process during each Power Stroke; which in turn reduces the peak combustion temperatures.  This results in lower NOx emissions. An ancillary benefit to using the EGR system is that it reduces Detonation, by allowing advance Timing. Key components within the EGR system: a)	Exhaust gas passages b)	EGR valve c)	Sensors – position, feedback d)	EGR passages In Inline engines, the exhaust passages are connected to the intake manifold through an external tube.  In V-type engines, there are cast passages within the exhaust and intake manifolds. Overview of Essay a.	Back Pressure i.	Positive pressure ii.	Negative pressure (Vacuum) b.	Computer Controlled i.	1-Solenoid ii.	2-Solenoids iii.	3-Solenoids iv.	Linear EGR a.	EGR Valve Position Sensor (EVP) b.	Pressure Feedback EGR Sensor (PFE) a.	O2 Sensor b.	Delta Pressure Feedback EGR Sensor (DPFE) c.	MAP Sensor a.	Vacuum Pump & Gauge b.	Universal DTCs Types of EGR Valves – Backpressure Reference Schematic above – when the valve is open, exhaust gases (2) pass through to the intake manifold (3).  Note, in some cases the exhaust gases mix with the intake air before the throttle body.  The EGR valve can be either positive backpressure i.e. the pressure from the exhaust gases ""pushes"" the valve open; or it can be negative backpressure i.e. vacuum applied through the vacuum port (4) ""pulls"" the valve open. Types of EGR Valves – Computer Controlled In these types of EGRs, the PCM controls the on/off for the vacuum source to the EGR (1-Solenoid).  In 2-Solenoids, the second solenoid controls the amount of vacuum to be applied. 3-Solenoid design – there are 3 holes, small-medium-large, each solenoid controls the opening and closing of the respective hole.  This results in 7 different flow rates, in addition to complete shut-off. Linear EGR design uses a pulse-width modulated solenoid to precisely control the exhaust gas flow rate. Types of Position Sensors Most, if not all, OBDII systems have a feedback loop to the actual EGR valve position. EGR Valve Position Sensor (EVP) – sits on top of the EGR valve.  This sensor is simply a potentiometer that relays a signal to the PCM depending on the open/close position of the EGR valve. Pressure Feedback EGR Sensor (PFE) – sits on the exhaust side of the EGR valve.  If the EGR valve is open; the pressure on the exhaust side will be higher than if the valve were closed.  The PFE converts this pressure data in to a voltage signal, and transmits it to the PCM. OBDII Monitoring Strategies All OBDII systems perform a diagnostic test to ensure proper functioning of the EGR valve.  All 3 outlined methods/sensors use changes in local dynamics, whether Oxygen levels or Pressure, to signal to the PCM proper function of the EGR valve. O2 Sensor – When the EGR valve is open, Oxygen levels detected by the O2 sensor should drop. DPFE Sensor – A metered orifice is placed on the intake side of the EGR valve.  If the EGR valve is open, the pressure at this orifice should be lower compared to when the EGR valve is closed.  The reason is that the orifice is exposed to some of the vacuum when the EGR valve is open.  DPFE sensor measures this pressure difference and relays it to the PCM. MAP Sensor – If the EGR valve is open, exhaust gases flow to the intake manifold.  This changes the vacuum levels and fuel trim of the charge in the intake manifold.  MAP Sensor ""notices"" this change, and if the change falls within acceptable, pre-calculated levels, gives a ""thumbs-up"" to the EGR functioning. Diagnosis There are a few things that could go wrong with the EGR system.  If the EGR valve is stuck closed, or exhaust gas flow is restricted i.e. rendering the EGR system non-functioning, NOx levels increase and Detonation could occur.  If the EGR valve is stuck open, rough idle and stalling conditions could occur in addition to engine power issues at low speed. EGR system functioning can be checked using a vacuum pump and gauge combination.  California Smog Check program requires EGR functional test to be performed on TSI – 1995 and older vehicles.  Basically, 2 items are looked at a) whether the EGR valve is able to hold vacuum and b) whether the engine stalls on application of vacuum, as it should.  If the vehicle is unable to hold vacuum – the EGR valve or the EGR passages have a problem.  If the engine does not stall – the exhaust passages have a problem. The PCM itself sets universal DTCs if it notices a problem with the EGR system.  P0400/P0401/P0402.

17,Tailgate Theft: Who Would’ve Thunk?,autos-trucks," Back in 1993 I bought a new Ford F250 PU truck. At the time I was working the graveyard shift as a police officer in downtown Portland Oregon and I parked my truck on the street right next to City Hall. In the morning when my shift ended I walked a few blocks and just got into my truck and started driving home. After several blocks I happened to glance in my rear view mirror and could not see my tailgate. I thought that my tailgate must be in the down position so I stopped when I could and walked to the back of truck. To my shock I discovered that my tailgate was gone! Someone stole my tailgate! Needless to say, I was shocked and angry. Who the heck steals tailgates? I ended up buying a new tailgate and found out just how expensive aftermarket tailgates cost. I think it cost me somewhere around $800.00 for a new tailgate and then I had to pay more to paint it so it matched my truck. Today a similar replacement tailgate would cost much more. To prevent this from ever happening again I did some drilling and devised a way to ""pin"" the tailgate to my canopy with a padlock so that it would be extremely hard for anyone to ever steal my tailgate again. That was that and I did not give tailgate theft anymore thought . . . until recently. As a private investigator and security consultant here in Portland Oregon I get asked to investigate all kinds of thefts. Theft investigation and consulting on security measures to prevent thefts are a big part of what I do. When I got a call from the sales manager of a car lot who wanted me to investigate thefts of tailgates from his lot, my ears perked up. Are thieves still stealing tailgates? Yes they are. And maybe more so now than ever! Thieves all across the country have been having a real tailgate party in recent years. Tailgate Thefts are BIG BUSINESS for Crooks No one knows for sure how many truck tailgates are stolen each year because many owners do not report the theft to police or insurance companies. When mine was stolen, for example, I reported it to the police but did not make an insurance claim because doing so would have likely increased my premiums. I just ""sucked-it-up"" and paid for a replacement tailgate out of pocket. But the best statistics available are from The National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB). They keep track of insurance claims and report that claims related to pickup tailgate thefts have increased in recent years. As accurate as their statistics are, the NICB recognized that there may be far more tailgates stolen than they will ever know about. In a report on tailgate thefts the NICB said ""It is important to note that the numbers in this report reflect insurance claims and are not representative of the actual theft activity. Moreover, due to the methodology used to identify tailgate thefts it is possible that some thefts may have been missed. Also, for many reasons tailgate theft victims choose not to submit an insurance claim. Many victims may not be insured against theft while some feel that filing a claim may impact their future premium. Others may have a deductible that is higher than the replacement cost."" TAILGATE THEFTS cost Victims Big Money! With most replacement tailgates costing more than $2,000.00 (a lot more if your truck has a custom paint job) tailgate theft is an expensive crime and it is complicated by the fact that most tailgates are designed for easy removal. Some newer trucks have factory installed tailgates locks that keep the tailgate from simply being lifted off the truck, but many do not. Literally, an unsophisticated crook can remove a tailgate from your truck and be off with it in less than a minute! WHERE DO MOST THEFTS OCCUR? Tailgate thefts occur all across the United States – no area is immune. Even smaller cities like Shawnee Kansas and Milwaukie Oregon, have seen an up spike in tailgate thefts. But according to the NICB the top states (in ranked order) are: Texas California Arizona Florida Nevada The top tailgate theft cities in these states are Houston TX, followed by San Antonio TX, Dallas TX, Phoenix AZ, and Fresno CA. In Denver Colorado and some other cities, tailgate thefts have increased so much that police published tips on how to make it harder for a thief to steal your tailgate. PREVENTION Measures are Effective There is a big after market in used tailgates. As long as it is easy for thieves to steal tailgates the thefts will continue. Fortunately, preventative measures are simple, effective, and relatively in expensive but they are useless unless they are always actually used. They include: LOCK IT. If your truck comes with an integrated tailgate lock – USE IT. If your truck did not come with a tailgate lock, buy one. There are several different varieties available online or at auto product stores. PARK IT. If you can park your truck inside a garage do so – EVERY TIME. If that is not possible, when practicable, consider parking with the back of the truck as close to a wall as possible. His will make it harder for a thief to maneuver around the back of the truck and remove the tailgate. ETCH IT. Engrave the truck’s vehicle identification number (VIN) into the tailgate; this will aid in its recovery and may prevent its theft in the first place. If you don’t own a truck you might think that all this information does not apply to you. You are right, except thefts of tailgates drives up the cost of insurance for everyone. Even if you will never own a truck everyone should keep their eyes open. If you see someone taking a tailgate off of a truck, take a second look. Maybe . . . you are witnessing a crime in progress."
18,Tesla is the Newest Member of America’s Big 3 Automakers,autos-trucks," Tesla shares surpassed $300 for the first time last Tuesday, valuing the electric car manufacturer higher than Ford Motor Company and is now the most valuable automaker in America after surpassing GM with a market value of $50.79 billion. Tesla edged out GM’s $50.79 billion value despite North American auto sales cooling after a period of record sales. Wall Street financiers see tremendous room for Tesla to grow, especially in China where the automaker is backstopped by Asia’s largest Internet company – Tencent. The Chinese tech giant recently purchased $1.8 billion in Tesla stock, giving them 5 percent ownership. Tesla’s gains come after the automaker saw a record quarterly total for vehicle deliveries. Investors were skeptical of Tesla’s prospects because they need to produce 500,000 units to justify their valuation, according to CNBC’s Jim Cramer. However, the global push towards green energy is continuing to trend upwards. So despite Detroit’s ""Big Three"" automakers holding steady, a spreadsheet is no match for Tesla’s innovative tech setup. The initial jump in Tesla stock price was set off by a brief news release on Sunday that the automaker had delivered more than 25,000 cars in the first quarter, 2,000 more than what Goldman Sachs analysts had predicted. (Photo via New York Times) The Future is ‘Green’ ""This is where the future is going. All these metrics don't work. All these metrics would have been true a year or two ago, but Tesla has fought the shorts every way,"" said Eddy Elfenbein from the blog Crossing Wall Street. ""Tesla was burning through tremendous amounts of cash; now they have one of the largest companies in the world, the most valuable company in China backstopping them and giving them a foothold into the Chinese market. Tesla's an excellent buy right now,"" Elfenbein said. American automakers have bounced back well from the 2008 recession and are now in a position for sustained growth, that’s why Tesla’s stock soaring by more than 7 percent, while GM and Ford posting a 3.4 and 1.7 decrease respectively, came as a surprise to many. The Big Three’s gains have largely come from increased consumer demand for pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, however GM received a head start over Tesla with a $49 billion government bankruptcy bailout. This makes Tesla’s success all that more impressive after bleeding money for years, is now finally paying off by leading the push towards the societal shift to electric vehicles. Still Have Work to Do Despite Tesla now having a market cap of about $50 billion, they are still well behind the global sales of Japan-based Toyota, worth $177 billion – three times more than Tesla. Luckily for Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk, several other automakers reported declines, these include Fiat Chrysler and Hyundai. Investors are optimistic about Tesla’s upcoming Model 3, which will sell at $35,000 USD in order to be more appealing to middle-class consumers.

19,Driver Buddy The Latest Technology in Driver Management.,autos-trucks," What is Driver Buddy Are you looking for a way to ensure your safe driving plan is applied by your drivers? MyFleet has a brand new affordable and environmentally friendly solution for your company! Our newest product, the Driver Buddy guarantees that your chain of responsibility control measures make it out of the manuals and into the front seats of your vehicles, where they will improve fleet safety and efficiency of travel, and advance your ability to track your fleet and ensure your company's policies are enforced. Driver Buddy is a smartphone application, easily downloadable to either Android or Apple devices. This means it is accessible on a phone, a mobile tablet, or via an industrial display mounted in the cabins of your vehicles. The Driver Buddy application interacts with both the driver and supervisor during trips, reinforcing the key points of the Safe Driving Plan for the route they are driving. It also updates managers with information such as how many hours a driver has left to complete a shift, as well as whether they are driving in an unsafe or erratic manner. Managers have real time monitoring and two-way communication to correct bad driving behaviour, making it easier to ensure their entire operations are safe. The application also assists drivers to self-manage their driving style and perform at their best. The two-way communication feature allows both drivers and managers to address issues that may arise on the road. With specialised features ranging from mandatory pre-travel safety inspections to updated information about the safest and most convenient rest stops available, the Driver Buddy is your most reliable assurance that your fleet operates the way you want. It’s easy as 1,2,3 Step One Drivers log in to the Driver Buddy application on a device of your choice, and complete a basic check of the vehicle to confirm roadworthiness, as well as a fit for duty declaration confirming their ability to perform the work to the standard required by your business rules. Tailored checklists will consist of customised requirements designed by you, determined by the specific values, vehicle types, and work classification of your organisation. The completed checks form an official binding acknowledgement of the fitness of the driver and vehicle for work, and can be legally enforced where necessary. This procedure ensures that any issues are detected as early as possible to increase the safety of your drivers and your organisation Step Two The Driver Buddy is equipped with an alert system that can be used by your drivers if anything goes wrong on the road. The alert advises your supervisors by email or SMS of the issue. The system interacts with drivers in the field to bring to their attention potential hazards, dangerous road zones and changing driving conditions. It will also monitor driving performance to ensure your drivers know when they are required to take a break or make changes to their driving. The system is designed to ensure a real-time response to and resolution of any problems the driver may encounter, and thus improves the efficiency and safety of your fleet. Step Three GPS tracking in the Driver Buddy application enables you to monitor the progress of your drivers, fatigue patterns, and dangerous behaviours in their driving. supervisors will be able to access the tracking data and insert additional mandatory rest stops, with an automatic alert in the circumstance that your drivers depart from expected protocol by speeding, harsh braking, idling or neglecting scheduled rest breaks. This chain of responsibility control measure enables you to ensure drivers complete trips safely and efficiently, without breaching the privacy of employees, who are aware of the capability of the system and are therefore able to work comfortably within it Why Is Driver Buddy the Smartest Way to Implement Safe Driving Plans? Driver Buddy is a more effective method of distributing safe driving plans than the alternative paper print out for several reasons. Creating a smartphone application that acts as a chain of responsibility control measure is the surest way to ensure that it will not be lost or left behind, as most people tend to keep their mobile phone in their possession at all times. In contrast to standard safety driving plans, which are typically distributed in easily disregarded printed manuals, Driver Buddy is much harder to ignore or misplace. Safe driving plans in a hard copy format are not only easily misplaced, but also have the potential to become a hazard in themselves, as drivers can easily become distracted trying to locate the manual in the truck while they drive, looking at the location of their next rest stop, or checking the plan for hazards ahead. In comparison, Driver Buddy can be mounted on the windscreen for easy visibility, or can be set up with GPS audio that dictates instructions, updates and warnings, and provides drivers with information without them having to take their eyes from the road, or forcing them to pull or over to check their plan. Installed on their mobile, unlike a hard copy, the plan will always be on hand. The digital format of the Driver Buddy enables updates to be pushed to the device as required, thus adapting far more rapidly to changing conditions than other chain of responsibility control measures. The ability to calculate factors arising on the road enables additional rest stops to be added to the trip plan if, for example, harsh braking incidents and speeding suggest the driver is tiring and driving quality is deteriorating. The two-way communication feature of Driver Buddy facilitates the vital driver/manager relationship. Driver Buddy is an undoubted asset for both parties, as drivers can complete their work safely and efficiently, and managers can rest easy knowing that if an issue arises they can make contact quickly and reduce delays. How Can Driver Buddy Help Manage Driver Fatigue? Driver Buddy's fatigue management technology has been developed to accommodate your company's needs. The specialised settings not only ensure that drivers take regular breaks, but provides constant and accurate updates on the safest, most suitable and convenient rest stops, and can analyse whether additional breaks are required based on the driving pattern of each individual driver. Since under Australian fatigue law drivers are required to take breaks at specified intervals throughout journeys, breaches of this requirement by even the smallest margin may result in fines and loss of credibility for the company. Driver Buddy responds to this reality by enabling drivers to be aware of how much time they have before their next break, with constant user friendly updates and alerts which, unlike a printed driving plan, facilitate rapid compliance. Driver Buddy monitors driving hours throughout the driver's shift, and specifies when and where the next break should be taken. Such certainty is ideal for both drivers and supervisors, as in the event of a driver exceeding permitted hours an immediate alert is provided to managers via email or SMS. In addition to scheduled breaks, Driver Buddy has the unprecedented ability to automatically calculate where additional breaks may be required, based on the driver's performance during the trip. The driver is provided with live feedback on technique, highlighting incidents such as speeding events or harsh braking, as is the supervisor, and where such oversight suggests erratic or tired driving, the driver will be notified and instructed to take an additional break. With the inevitable variance between factors such as vehicle size and value of transported goods, some rest stops may be more suitable for your vehicles than others. Driver Buddy has this covered too! With all the latest information about rest stops on your routes, as well as any unique requirements of your specific vehicles, the system calculates the most appropriate stops, and passes this information in real-time to your drivers as they travel. This ensures that your fleet and your drivers remain safe and can take their breaks efficiently and in compliance with regulations. How Can Driver Buddy Ensure Your Drivers Enforce Your Values on The Road? The real-time feedback system of Driver Buddy enables close analysis of your drivers conduct and driving behaviours as they drive, with notifications provided to both the driver and supervisors for potentially dangerous incidents such as harsh braking, speeding, and idling. A real-time alert is projected on the drivers display screen, allowing them to rectify bad driving performance. If issues persist, an additional break alert will be issued, requiring the driver to pull over at the next safe stop. Driver Buddy features a specialised ranking system to analyse the habits and safety of your drivers, based off their driving incidents. Drivers who incur numerous or reoccurring infringements receiving a lower rank than others, and vice versa. This enables you to identify drivers that need further training, and improves fuel efficiency. The automated driver performance reports provided by Driver Buddy allow managers to enjoy an unprecedented level of understanding of what is happening in their fleet. These reports also help your drivers to self-improve in the areas that matter to you, as a low ranking is undesirable, and will inspire greater compliance with your policies to achieve better results. How Can Driver Buddy Prevent Accidents? Not only does the application keep drivers updated on when their next scheduled break is, but guides them to the safest and most convenient rest stops on their route. These recommendations are determined by constantly updating information analysed by the program. In addition to scheduled breaks in the safe driving plan, the application can detect tired or erratic driving via several indicators outlines below, and will notify the driver that an additional break is required. If a driver exceeds their driving hours or skips a scheduled or recommended break, an email or SMS alert is immediately sent to the driver's supervisor, notifying them of the breach. Indicators which may suggest a driver needs an additional break are all actions generally resulting from fatigue and lack of focus. The Driver Buddy analyses incidents of speeding, idle, and harsh braking to determine the driver's concentration level. Notifications are provided for drivers in the event of any of these occurring, allowing them to rectify their bad driving performance. Reoccurrence of any of these issues suggests the driver is unfocused and needs an additional break. The Driver Buddy is constantly gathering updated information to ensure all hazards are brought to the driver's attention as early as possible. This includes traffic congestion and alternate routes, sharp corners, black spots, exclusion zones and changing weather conditions. The two-way communication feature of the Driver Buddy enables supervisors to maintain constant contact with drivers throughout the trip, giving instructions, warning of hazards, and correcting erratic driving. This ensures that all issues arising are dealt with efficiently and promptly, and allows for company policies to be upheld to a high standard. All data gathered by the Driver Buddy is compiled into a report on the performance of the driver, and they are ranked based off their driving behaviour. This is to ensure that any drivers who require additional training are identified as early as possible. These features of the Buddy System application ensure that drivers can enjoy complete awareness of their surroundings and potential issues on the road. Driver safety and reduction of accident risk are two of the core priorities of fleet management. MyFleet has simplified this responsibility markedly by creating the first and only integrated safe driving plan which actively works to uphold these values and increase driver safety: the Driver Buddy. In addition to scheduled breaks, Driver Buddy has the unprecedented ability to automatically calculate where additional breaks may be required, based on the driver's performance during the trip. The driver is provided with live feedback on technique, highlighting incidents such as speeding events or harsh braking, as is the supervisor, and where such oversight suggests erratic or tired driving, the driver will be notified and instructed to take an additional break. With the inevitable variance between factors such as vehicle size and value of transported goods, some rest stops may be more suitable for your vehicles than others. Driver Buddy has this covered too! With all the latest information about rest stops on your routes, as well as any unique requirements of your specific vehicles, the system calculates the most appropriate stops, and passes this information in real-time to your drivers as they travel. This ensures that your fleet and your drivers remain safe and can take their breaks efficiently and in compliance with regulations."
20,5 Reasons to Begin a Career as a Truck Driver,autos-trucks," Have you recently finished high school and are debating your future career prospects with no luck? If continuing your education in college or university isn’t your thing, there are still many viable career paths that can lead to financial success in the future. One of these career paths is truck driving, which is a highly in-demand job in an industry that isn’t going to disappear anytime soon. Here are 5 reasons that pursuing a career in the transport industry as a truck drive is worth considering. #1 Salary Let’s be honest: money is often the greatest motivator for our choice of career path, especially with the unpredictability of today’s economy. If having a great starting salary is something that interests you, you’re in luck! Starting truck drivers can make upwards of $40,000 to $50,000 in their first year. This is well beyond the entry-level salaries offered to most college graduates. As you gain more experience, you can expect your income to grow substantially as well. Truck transport can certainly be a very lucrative endeavor when pursued full-time. #2 Dependability People and companies need things delivered to them. For this reason, truck driving tends to remain in high demand regardless of the state of the economy. If stable employment is something you value, you’ll be happy to learn that truck drivers have some of the best job security in any industry. Additionally, demand for truckers tends to be higher than supply which means you won’t have a hard time breaking into the industry if you work towards it. #3 Great Benefits On top of high salary and reliability, the transport industry is known to offer fantastic benefits for its employees. This often not only includes retirement options, medical and dental insurance, but also gym memberships, paid vacation and good bonuses. Some companies offer these benefits from the start of your first day while others have a few months probationary waiting period. Either way, having great benefits at your job is something strongly worth considering. #4 Travel As a truck driver, never again will you have to toss and turn in an uncomfortable office chair for while getting lightheaded from staring at your computer screen for 8 or more hours a day. Not only will you avoid the monotony of office work but you will get to visit new locations and experience beautiful scenery on a daily basis. Not only that, but you get to pick the radio station that plays all day! If you have a sense of adventure and love road trips, truck driving is perfect for you! #5 Fast Training One final compelling reason to begin your career as a truck driver is the amount of time it takes to be trained. This process often takes about 8-10 weeks from the moment you start training to your first day of employment. That surely beats doing a four-year degree and accumulating high amounts of debt at university, doesn’t it? Conclusion If you want a career that offers a great starting salary, strong job security, benefits and the ability to travel all the time, truck driving is absolutely worth considering."

1,Commercial Tire Sales,autos-trucks," Discussions about Donald Trump and his policies have been dominating our televisions, radios, and newspapers for what seems to be years. Sometimes the noise gets loud, but the reality is the Trump administration’s policies will have real impact on the trucking industry. What has Happened Already President Trump has already ordered a freeze on federal regulations. This isn’t uncommon for new presidents, but President Trump has made it clear that he is against the creation of new and potentially burdensome regulations. The new administration is using the freeze as an opportunity to allow department heads, appointed by Trump, to review all of these pending regulations and make sure they have merit. What does this mean for the trucking industry? Don’t expect any new changes any time soon, as this review process could take a while and may result in some regulations being scrapped. Reducing Current Regulations While new and pending regulations were officially halted on January 20, it appears that the new administration is also serious about reducing the number of existing regulations. In the, ""A Message from President-Elect Donald J. Trump"" video from the 2017 Transition YouTube site, Trump claimed, ""I will formulate a rule which says that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated."" He has since followed through with that promise by signing an executive order that requires just that. The Department of Transportation and Environmental Protection Agency could see the most regulatory cuts that would directly affect truckers and the trucking industry. A Promise of New and Improved Infrastructure President Trump has made some major promises about infrastructure. During his victory speech he claimed, ""We’re going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none."" He specifically mentioned highways, bridges, and tunnels during that portion of the speech. For truckers, that means more goods to be hauled and more construction zones to be navigated, with the hope of future trips taking less time on safer and less congested roadways. What will the Future Hold? It certainly sounds like there could be a great deal of good news ahead for truckers and trucking companies. Improved roads, reduced regulations, and a stronger economy all sound wonderful, but the truth is a lot remains to be seen and nothing in government happens smoothly or quickly. Congress will have its own ideas on how to proceed and there is sure to be some conflict there. Significant change is certainly possible, but for now all we can do is pay close attention to potential changes and make our voices heard so these changes have a positive impact on our industry. While government officials iron all this out, truckers will still be there maintaining the supply chains that keep this country running. Everyone should agree with that."

3,A Caring Friend in the Car Business,autos-trucks," Are you in the market for a new car? Do you feel like most car dealerships are only interested in making sales and don’t seem to care about what you really need or want? That is a complaint we often hear when customers are talking about many car dealerships. But at Roy Nichols Motors, we take a different approach. We believe that you deserve a caring friend in the car business, Carey Miller at Roy Nichols Motors has built his reputation on this.  Someone who takes the time to get to know you on a personal level. When your car dealer understands you, they are more likely to find the kind of vehicle you really need. They don’t base their recommendations on what happens to be the highest price vehicle or the vehicle that they can’t seem to move off the lot. Because when you have a caring friend in the car business like Roy Nichols Motors, we know it’s not about us. How Having the Right Dealer Makes the Difference When you have the right car dealer who truly cares about your needs, you can tell. They ask questions about you and you get the idea that they really want to know you. This makes you feel important and you know that it is genuine. It’s nice to know that you can find a dealer who cares about your needs. When you have a car dealer who cares, you truly have a caring friend in the car business. They get to know your preferences and the things that matter most to you. And this can lead to a better outcome for both of you! Consider the following two scenarios and see if you can see the difference. Scenario I (It’s All About the Sale) You drive up to a car dealership and immediately five car salesmen emerge to approach you like a pack of hungry wolves. They seem to be literally fighting over your attention and salivating at the mouth. They all have their notebooks and sales manuals out and they start spouting out what kind of numbers they can run to get you the best deal. Oh, and did I mention that they want you to buy the highest priced vehicle on the lot. You step back a minute to get a breath from the onslaught, waiting for the moment when one of them will ask you what you are looking for. But that moment never comes. Instead, they tell you what a great deal the car on the front row is. When you ask them how long the car has been on their lot, they say ""for over a year."" Then it all becomes clear. They don’t care about you or what you want. They just want to move seemingly immovable inventory! The other car sales people motion to a few other cars which gives you some hope but then you realize they are steering you toward their highest priced vehicles only! Enough of this! Scenario II (It’s All About the Customer) In this scenario, you have a different experience. You drive up in a similar manner to the second car dealership and start walking out to the lot when you are approached by a friendly (but calm) sales person. They ask your name, shake your hand, and even offer you a soda! While you wait for them to make a huge sales pitch about the highest price car, you are relieved to find that the sales person is silent. They are letting you look around yourself. You feel so comfortable with this innovative approach, that you decide to ask a question. With great delight and surprise, the car dealer answers your question in a way that seems honest and transparent. What a refreshing change from the other dealership! The salesperson starts talking to you about your job, your lifestyle, your family, and your car needs. You ask more questions and then you ask for their recommendation based on your needs. The car dealer recommends a nice Chevy Equinox. And what do you know? It isn’t even the most expensive car on the lot! It’s a car that you could love. In fact, it’s perfect. Everyone is Different When it comes to purchasing a car, everyone is different. We all purchase a vehicle for different reasons. Maybe it’s a new family vehicle you need. Perhaps we’re in the market for a new Chevy Silverado or Colorado Truck. Perhaps a beautiful Chevy Malibu is on your ""wish list."" There are many reasons that people look for a vehicle and we know that those reasons can be as diverse as the individual who is shopping for the car. Whatever the case, talk to your dealer at Roy Nichols Motors and we’ll be glad to help! You’ve Got a Friend As James Taylor once said, ""you’ve got a friend."" At Roy Nichols Motors, we take the approach that everyone deserves a caring friend in the car business who truly cares about your needs. You don’t want fancy sales pitches. You don’t want fancy talk. And you don’t want to buy the highest price car on the lot (unless it is truly the one you want). You just wanted someone like Carey Miller to listen to you. That’s what we do. We have a full lot of beautiful vehicles to choose from where you’ll find at least one to meet your needs. At Chevrolet we have redesigned 40% of our models that are on the lot right now and many of them have unique features that you have to see to believe. But don’t take our word for it. Come into Roy Nichols Motors and see for yourself. Be sure to add us on Facebook and Twitter and follow us to see what deals we offer and come back often to see what we can do for you. We’re your caring friend in the car business. We know that if we listen to our customers, everyone will win."
4,How to Find the Best Car for Your Needs,autos-trucks," That special day has arrived. Your daughter is getting married. You knew the day would arrive. You can’t say that you are happy about it in some ways. You remember carrying her in your arms up to your room so many times, drying her tears when she fell and scraped her knee, and so many other occasions that you shared. You will have to get used to her being out of the house. You can’t remember the last time that happened since she was small except for the time she went to Junior College. But she always came back. This time, she won’t be coming back except to visit as she finds the time. Despite your angst at losing your daughter to a man you hardly know but must now call ""son,"" your main concern is how the wedding day will go. Will you have enough food for all the guests? Will the photographer do a good job with the photography? Will the dress get back in time from the seamstress? There is so much to remember when it comes to hosting a wedding! As you feel the perspiration start to gather on your brow, you realize that you’ve forgotten about the getaway car. The getaway car is one of the most important aspects of a bride’s special day! How could you forget this essential element? With haste, you call your husband who is still finishing his day at the office and ask him to come home immediately. Fearing a family crisis, he does and arrives in his Silverado pickup like some superhero out of a Batman movie. You are happy that he was able to fight the traffic and get home so soon and you tell him about the getaway car and how you failed to remember this important detail. He complains that you got him out of an important meeting on company stocks for a minute detail that could have been arranged later. But you insist that it’s too important to put off. He tells you not to worry and that he has a solution. You wait, staring out the kitchen window until you see him pull up a few minutes later in a white Camaro, looking like one of the royal steed of the English palace. You proclaim how perfect it is and how wonderful he is for thinking of it. It was the car you bought your other daughter for her twenty-first birthday before she left home for good. It brings back memories of the first send-off of a child from your household and you cry. But then you remember how special the day will be because you have everything in place. The getaway car is ready. Everything is in place. The seamstress calls to confirm that you can pick up the dress in an hour. This is really going to happen. It was a car fit for a princess.

Then you will probably want to look at our truck line to see what fits your needs. The versatility and durability of a truck will help you enjoy your love of the outdoors even more. If you are a business person who wants to make an impression, you will want to look at the cars that help you define your image as a serious business person.

Buying a car for that all-important business position is important and you’ll want to find a vehicle that helps your image in the business world. Consider the Purpose Along with the functionality of the vehicle you choose, you’ll want to keep the purpose in mind, too. What will you usually be using your vehicle for? Will you use it primarily for business trips, hunting excursions, or outings with the family? Think about how you will use your car most of the time and base your decision on that. Consider the Price You want your vehicle to reflect who you are, but you don’t want the reflection to blind you. In other words, you should try to live within your means. Finding the perfect vehicle involves more than just locating a car that fits your personality or your purpose. You should consider the cost of ownership. Chevy has been rewarded with multiple J.D Power Awards for initial quality and durability.  By shopping and comparing the wide array of vehicles we have available, you will find a car that fit your needs."

You can generally expect anything from 30 to 90 days. So ask, before you agree on a price. Beware the liquid overhaul Weather it be a coat of jam, or a liquid overhaul. You need to be careful and look pass the visual condition of the forklift and make sure its is mechanically sound. If need be get a mechanical inspection done, most small 1 x man subcontractors, are wiling to do this type of work, It might cost you a $100 or so, but it can save you thousands in the future.

This is our top 5 tips for buying a forklift (new or used). Make sure you get the value you want."
6,What you need to know about Auto Insurance,autos-trucks," Accidents are one of the most common scenarios on the streets with over 10 million accidents happening each year. It is, therefore, mandatory for everyone to have an insurance policy which is guaranteed to keep you and your vehicle safe on the road. When going into insurance, it is advisable that you consider a policy which would suit you best by compensating you when you get involved in an accident and that is why it is not a good approach to get insurance online without professional advice because you might not be fully covered by the insurance. It is also good to consider your budget while picking out an insurance policy. Insurance agents can help you pick insurance policies which would be in your best interest, which would not cost much and also help you get discounts. Insurance agents can, therefore, assist you in the following ways: Help you pick a quality auto insurance policy which would be in accordance with the laws of your state. They team up with multiple carriers to get a quality auto insurance which would be at an affordable price. The agent will help you pick out an auto insurance policy which would be in line with your needs and not just any auto insurance policy. When you review an auto insurance policy with your insurance agent, you get a wide range of auto insurance companies to pick from. You are permitted to keep checking till you find a policy which suits you best, and you can not be forced to pick the insurance policy from just one company. To know which insurance will suit your needs certain things will be considered such a the age of members of your family and number of the people who can drive. Also, your agent will try to combine your home and auto insurance policy or bundle your vehicle together under one insurance policy to help you benefit more from the insurance company. Furthermore, your insurance agent can help check insurance policy choices, coverage limits, deductibles and pricing to ensure that you pick an insurance policy which would cover all your needs. In every state, drivers are expected to have auto liability insurance such as limited insurance. The requirements for auto insurance varies based on each state, with the inclusion of bodily injury cost per person and per accident and also a minimum liability for property damage. For instance, when you are liable for an accident, the liability coverage in auto insurance pays for the costs up to the limit in your insurance policy. To protect your vehicle in accidents you need the collision coverage to protect you from losing your vehicle. For people who have more needs than others, you can opt for the comprehensive coverage insurance policy. The combination of both collision and comprehensive auto insurance policy would keep you covered in instances such as accidents, theft, vandalism and so on. The three primary types of auto insurance policy are Liability Insurance, Collision Insurance, and Comprehensive insurance. Liability insurance covers the costs for injuries and property damage in an accident which a person is liable for. Collision insurance covers the cost of repairs to your vehicle after an accident. Comprehensive insurance also known as 'other than collision insurance' covers damages to your vehicle from natural disaster or theft. The following are also auto insurance policies which might be available to you based on the laws of your state. Medical payments; this auto insurance covers costs of injuries inflicted on you and the passengers in your car during the accident regardless of who was liable for the accident. Personal Injury Protection (PIP); this is similar to the medical payment auto insurance policy and the PIP auto insurance covers the medical bills from an accident regardless of liability. The PIP also covers lost wages. Rental reimbursement; this auto insurance policy covers the payment of rental cars while your vehicle is being repaired at a mechanic workshop. Towing and roadside service; this auto insurance policy covers the costs of towing your car to a mechanic workshop and also emergency roadside services. There's also the online method of getting an auto insurance policy for your vehicle, but it comes with risks and drawbacks. The most notable drawback is the fact that the online insurance policy might not match your need because it is extremely difficult to know the online insurance offers the right protection or comes at an affordable cost. When you buy an online insurance policy such as a buying a no-frills basic cat insurance policy, which would only meet the requirements of the state and might not provide compensation after an accident."
7,Texting While Driving Can Be Deadlier than DUI,autos-trucks," Texting while driving takes the driver’s attention away from the road or traffic around them. These actions can lead to an accident, as part of which severe injuries can result from the driver’s negligence. Although texting is a simple daily activity, all senses are impaired during the act, making texting behind the steering wheel of a moving car worse than driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. When a driver is texting, his or her full focus and attention are invested in the phone. This attention is diverted while traffic, pedestrians and objects continue to move past the vehicle on the road. Research has proven that texting does not just take the driver’s attention while they are engaged in the act, but also seriously impairs their ability to manage their vehicle for several seconds afterward while their attention must be refocused back on the road. Time lost during texting and when readjusting to driving can lead to serious accidents, injuries and death. Texting is an immersive activity used throughout the day to communicate with others. But when texting is a constant focus, it can be difficult for the driver to leave the phone alone while operating their vehicle. Such individuals know it is safer to pull to the side of the road if they must use their phone or text. Instead, they continue driving, pick up the phone and even text while they are supposed to be paying attention to traffic and the road in front of them. Even when the driver only reads texts and does not type a response, the momentary loss of focus on driving is long enough to cause a traffic accident. Lapses like these are the same as lapses when the driver has been drinking or using drugs. Impairment from texting is at its most basic level the same as other impaired driving, but may be worse than DUI in many instances. Law enforcement personnel frequently note the same erratic behaviors and mistakes made by texting drivers, as they do those made by drivers under the influence of drugs or alcohol. --- Continually Increasing Texting Accidents in the U.S. --- Texting accidents are replacing DUI accidents as more common and deadly in the U.S. Although the blood alcohol content of someone who has been drinking cannot exceed 0.08 percent BAC before they are considered illegal for driving and legally drunk, texting while driving has been criminalized by many states. Texting is provided with a zero tolerance status, with any texting behind the wheel being an offense in states with these laws. This is much more progressive toward accident prevention than DUI laws that allow a minimal tolerance to some drinking before driving. Texting is criminalized in some states because it only takes a moment of distraction to cause a catastrophic collision. When looking at a phone, a driver loses many such moments and gains many opportunities to cause damage, injuries and even death. Although DUI violations continue to increase, texting while driving has been pushed to lawmakers’ forefront in many states. The National Safety Council revealed in its recent reports that accidents caused by texting drivers number over 1.6 million wrecks per year. More than ten teenagers or passengers in their vehicles die each day from texting while driving in the U.S. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that a person must consume four beers and drive, before being as dangerous as someone texting while driving. A texting driver is six times more likely to cause an accident than someone who drives while intoxicated. Educating Drivers about Dangers of Texting While Driving Many groups and associated programs have been developed to increase awareness of the public regarding dangers of texting while driving. Unfortunately, there is not yet a group as powerfully driven to educate the public about texting and driving as the 1980s-developed Mothers Against Drunk Driving. MADD has extensive support, resources and political power compared to any anti-texting campaign, program or agency in America. It will take time for anti-texting programs to develop and gain the power of those associated with DUI prevention. Although DUI campaigns have often caused differences in opinion and even controversy regarding methods of educating the public, efforts by anti-DUI groups have led to criminalization of DUI offenses. These actions have indeed saved lives through education of the public, political influence, resulting legislation and law enforcement. A big question is whether the same type of laws could be effective in prevention of texting while driving accidents. Some agencies questions whether consequences and criminal outcomes should be harsher for these types of offenses. --- When You Are Injured in a Texting While Driving Accident --- If you or someone you love have been injured or suffered serious damages in a texting while driving accident, you can seek compensation for your injuries through a personal injury claim. With the expert help of a well-established personal injury and auto accident attorney, your case may lead to compensatory and even punitive damages.

8,Citroën's design future innovation and simplicity,autos-trucks," We believe that cars are becoming overcomplicated and overdesigned. The Cactus M is all about the spirit of simplicity. All the best old Citroën have a romantic feeling to them: the 2CV, the Méhari, the DS, the car dvd, the android car GPS. That’s what we’re trying to recapture here. Cars are becoming more complicated yes, but don’t assume everyone wants more gadgets. My young designers in their 20s are buying ‘young-timers’ in their spare time - ’80s and ’90s cars like Porsche 944s. They appreciate simple pleasures. If we do add technology like safety features to our range, they should operate by car dvd player seamlessly in the background. We’ve designed the Cactus M around the surfer lifestyle: we spoke to real surfers and they loved icons like the VW Combi and our old Méhari beach buggy. But why shouldn’t modern cars slot into people’s lifestyles too? I hope in future we can offer gm navigation for more niches, so customers don’t have to go to aftermarket suppliers like Thule to carry their surfboards and bicycles. We should be providing for our customers’ needs. Airbump is an example of design and engineering working hand in hand. The styling team came up with the concept originally and had no idea how it might work in production. It could have been inflatable or a special material – but the engineers went away and made it work. People either love Airbump or hate it. We will continue to develop the technology include android car gps, but it won’t feature on every new Citroën moving forwards. It divides opinion too much. We love pushing our designs to the limits, but we have to be constrained by economic reality. Headlamps are a case in point: we can do amazing things with LED lights, but one LED costs more than six bulbs. There’s no point designing something that’s going to add €500 to the retail price if it puts the car out of reach of its typical customers. Innovation is what Citroën is all about. The DS famously pushed the boundaries and so did the Traction Avant – one of the first cars with a monocoque chassis. It made it 200-300kg lighter than the competition. That’s true innovation. Citroën can do luxury cars with top class android car stereo still – it’s just a different expression. It can be relaxing, like yachting. That’s the French meaning of luxury – it’ll be very different from the German premium way of doing it.Depending on the project we’re working on, we occasionally ask the Citroën heritage team to bring up one of the old models which come with car dvd player from our back catalogue. We can’t drive them, but they do spend time in our studio. There’s no greater inspiration.’"
9,Can Buick LaCrosse tempt young buyers,autos-trucks," Buick says its current LaCrosse customer base has an average age of around 60. Survey data from research firms AutoPacific Inc. and Strategic Vision put the average at around 70. Either way, Buick hopes to persuade some younger people to take a look at its stylish redesigned sedan when the car begins arriving in showrooms this month, with loads of connectivity, built-in car dvd player, android car stereo and a sporty ride for a large sedan. The stakes aren't as high as they might have been a few years ago, when the LaCrosse routinely was Buick's top-volume nameplate. That distinction now goes to the Encore subcompact crossover, which outsold the big sedan nearly 3-to-1 over the first seven months of the year, an example of how consumers' tastes are gravitating to the versatile, SUV-like body style or intelligent android car GPS . Still, owners of the current-generation LaCrosse, on sale since 2009, ""love large sedans"". They are committed to that segment,"" Molly Peck, Buick's marketing director, told reporters last month at a LaCrosse media drive. Peck said Buick hopes to retain the 350,000 people who now own a current-generation LaCrosse, as well as turn the heads of owners of other large sedans, including the Toyota Avalon, Chrysler 300, Lexus ES 350 and Lincoln MKS which all come with car dvd player and gm navigation Buick is betting on interior refinement and sophistication. Ron Arnesen, GM executive chief engineer, calls the redesigned LaCrosse the ""quietest Buick ever."" It also features a raised, ""floating"" console with electronic gear shifter that frees up storage below and massaging seats on the highest trim level. Connectivity features include 4G LTE wireless Internet and Apple car dvd and android car GPS, which enables features such as Google Maps and hands-free texting. Arnesen, who oversees several of GM's midsize and large sedan programs, believes big-sedan sales will ""stabilize"" and could even rebound if gasoline prices rise. If the segment stays sluggish, though, rivals could decide to abandon it. Arnesen said the LaCrosse was engineered to be more fun to drive than most large sedans. A five-link rear suspension and gm navigation is standard. A high-performance strut front suspension system on higher trims reduces torque steer.""If they get out,"" he said, ""our plan is to have the best car left with best car dvd."""
10,The Battle for Automotive Brand Loyalty in China,autos-trucks," For the better part of two decades, China has been the global automobile industry’s greatest growth market. Since 2000, sales of passenger, light commercial vehicles, car dvd and android car GPS have increased about tenfold—to more than 20 million units a year—surpassing sales even in the U.S. and representing compound annual growth of about 20 percent. Now that this golden era of super-fast growth is winding down, the vast Chinese car market is entering a new pivotal stage. Instead of only racing to win over first-time buyers, domestic and foreign automakers alike must secure the loyalty of existing customers. Based on research by The Boston Consulting Group’s Center for Consumer and Customer Insight in China, at least three-quarters of Chinese car owners—representing a massive installed base of more than 90 million vehicles—are planning to switch brands when they purchase their next vehicle or installation of android car stereo. We call this impending shift the ""great brand migration."" The reasons for this customer disloyalty vary. A large portion of China’s increasingly affluent consumers want to trade up to higher-quality or more prestigious brands now that they can afford to do so. Millions of others, however, intend to switch to a different car brand within the same segment. Why? When many of these consumers bought their first cars bring with car dvd player, they turned by default to brands they knew. Now, however, they are better informed about their options, and a high number of Chinese drivers are dissatisfied with various aspects of the cars they own. The findings of BCG interviews with 2,400 car owners in China indicate that Chinese drivers are far more eager to switch brands than average consumers in developed economies. This sentiment, moreover, resounded among owners in every segment—from those driving basic domestic models to owners of pricey luxury vehicles and gm navigation. Some findings suggest that the next great battle in China’s car market will be waged over customer loyalty. To be sure, China is likely to remain one of the world’s hottest markets for first-time car buyers for the rest of this decade. But success in China will increasingly depend more on automakers’ ability to keep existing customers and to lure customers away from competitors. For companies with a portfolio of car brands across a full range of price points, the ultimate goal should be to build sufficient loyalty in order to win customers and hold on to them as they migrate from lower-priced vehicles to the luxury end—rather than to have to capture these same customers over and over again. For the handful of automakers that enjoy rock-solid reputations and consumer loyalty in China, the great brand migration of android car GPS is an enormous opportunity to increase share in a still-growing market. Most other car companies, however, must raise their game considerably in order to win the intensifying battle for loyalty. Domestic brands are under particular pressure as many have been losing market share in China. They must improve their reputations for quality and performance—a daunting task given China’s intense price competition for economy vehicles. But not even multinationals can take their success for granted. The advantages that foreign brands enjoyed among first-time Chinese car buyers are starting to fade as attractive alternatives emerge. Chinese consumers are maturing as car buyers, and they clearly expect better quality, service, performance, car dvd player and android car stereo for their money. For car companies that meet consumer expectations and position their brands correctly, the prize to be won in China is immense."
11,Why the Aston Martin Red Bull AM-RB 001 could be the car that defines a decade,autos-trucks," In an industry as innovative as ours, there’s a regular roll-out of brilliant cars for us to marvel at; a new Ferrari or a world-beating hot hatch will have us scrambling for details and itching for a drive. But these cars appear a couple of times every year. What we really get excited about are the cars with superior android car dvd player or android 2 din car stereo that come along once a decade. These cars are disruptive, expensive, rare and unthinkably fast as android car gps. They define a moment in automotive history; they become the automatic poster hero for a generation. The AM-RB 001 is one of those cars – I can tell already. In fact, I could have guessed when we first broke the story in March. A joint collaboration between F1 whiz Adrian Newey and iconic carmaker, Aston Martin – a dream tie-up if ever there was one. The McLaren F1 was borne of a similar relationship in the ‘90s, and with its central driving position and long-standing production car speed record, it’s still regarded as one of the finest supercars ever built. Then came the Bugatti Veyron in the noughties, with its exotic and massively complicated 8.0-litre quad-turbo W16 engine and android car dvd. The production car speed record had a new holder, and a whole new generation of car enthusiasts had their new hero. And now, along comes the AM-RB 001. From what I’ve seen today, and what the engineers have told me, this will be the car that defines the 2010s, not – as some may argue – the Bugatti Chiron. Track times normally reserved for those in the rarefied air of Formula One are now within reach of 123 lucky car enthusiasts who are mad about vauxhall sat nav, and those sitting in their passenger seats. Aston Martin promises that the track version of the RB 001 will be able to keep up with a modern F1 car around Silverstone, and the roadgoing version surely won’t be far off. Aston Martin has always been considered the pinnacle of British car design with its understated sports cars, while Newey has consistently blown the F1 world away with his incredible ability to design fast cars around draconian restrictions. Looking at this car in the installation of android 2 din car stereo today, the marriage of both these parties has produced something utterly spectacular. In the AM RB 001, Aston and Newey have managed to take well-recognised sophisticated Aston design cues and evolved them into something which has the wow factor of more ostentatious brands such as Ferrari. This is the coolest – and classiest – hypercar on the planet. But maybe I’m being too generous; after all, we haven’t driven it . Still, what are the chances of a car created along with android car GPS and Opel navi by Aston and Newey, being anything but phenomenal behind the wheel? I’d argue, none."
12,"Self-Driving Vehicles, Robo-Taxis, and the Urban Mobility Revolution",autos-trucks," It promises to be the most far-reaching advance in mobility since the invention of the automobile itself, but its biggest impact won’t be felt on the highway. Cities are where self-driving vehicles (SDVs, which are also known as autonomous vehicles) are most likely to fundamentally change—for the better—how people live, work, and, of course, get around. Far fewer accidents and much lower costs, as well as higher traffic efficiency, improved productivity, and lower pollution are just some of the anticipated benefits. Our research indicates, for example, that widespread urban adoption of SDVs and ""robo-taxis"" (and, especially, shared self-driving taxis) which are installed with android car dvd player and android car GPS, could result in a 60% drop in the number of cars on city streets, an 80% or greater decrease in tailpipe emissions, and 90% fewer road accidents. The impact of SDVs in cities will be outsize, because cities are both our biggest and our fastest-growing population centers. Half of humanity—3.5 billion people—live in urban areas today, and by 2030, two-thirds of the global population will reside in urban locations. Cities account for 60% to 80% of energy consumption and 70% of worldwide greenhouse-gas emissions. But there is also broad recognition, in the words of the United Nations, that ""the high density of cities can bring efficiency gains and technological innovation while reducing resource and energy consumption."" Goal number 11 of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals: 17 Goals to Transform Our World is to ""make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable."" SDVs, along with other technology-enabled advances, such as intelligent traffic management, precise  android car gps or vauxhall sat nav, are essential. As BCG reported in April 2015, it is no longer a question of if but when SDVs will hit the road. (See Revolution in the Driver’s Seat: The Road to Autonomous Vehicles, BCG report, April 2015.) Multiple parties are already at work developing autonomous-driving technologies, and the trend toward putting SDVs on the road is rapidly gaining momentum across a broad front that encompasses OEMs, suppliers, mobility providers, technology companies, academic institutions, governments, and regulatory bodies. At international auto and consumer technology shows, increasing numbers of automakers and technology companies are showing off their SDV visions, and the number of players working on autonomous driving which apply to android car dvd is rising rapidly. (See, for example, ""Connected Trends: CES 2016 Observations and Questions from the Floor,"" BCG article, January 2016.) New experiments, trials, and goals are announced almost daily. Dubai, for example, recently stated its ambition to have 25% of all trips driverless by 2030. While technological development continues apace, SDV stakeholders are also addressing the societal, legal, and regulatory issues that will arise as these vehicles come to market. Urbanites—policymakers, planners, companies, and ordinary residents who have a stake in the world’s cities—will want to be involved as the city of the future, which might be very different from the cities we know now, takes shape around SDV technology and other advances in mobility. Many public policymakers are already focusing their attention on autonomous transportation and on understanding its potential impact. The US Department of Transportation mounted a Smart City Challenge, funding up to $40 million to ""one mid-sized city that puts forward bold, data-driven ideas to improve lives by making transportation safer, easier, and more reliable."" Sweden’s government has launched Drive Sweden, a ""strategic innovation program"" that focuses on new mobility models, including automated transportation and the accessories of android 2 din car stereo. Modifications to Swedish legislation, if enacted, will make SDV testing easier. Germany has already loosened legal barriers to SDV testing, so long as the driver can override autonomous control. In Finland, the Ministry of Transport and Communications is preparing a legal framework for SDV testing and has named a working group to prepare the necessary actions. Many other jurisdictions—including Austria, France, the Netherlands, the UK, and the US—are also in the process of adopting SDV legislation or have already done so. This report is the result of a collaboration between BCG and the World Economic Forum. The terms self-driving, autonomous, and SDV, which adapt to android 2 din car stereo or Opel navi we use interchangeably, refer to fully self-driving vehicles unless stated otherwise. The term robo-taxi means a sequentially or simultaneously shared SDV with any number of occupants."
13,Racing Video Games Have Become the New Bedroom Car Posters,autos-trucks," When Gran Turismo Sport is released in November, aficionados of Sony PlayStation's flagship driving game will have a new skill to master: the art of automotive photography. Scapes, the next generation of the game's Photo Mode, will enable players to drop photo-realistic images of their favorite personalized race cars with built-in android car dvd and android 2 din car stereo onto landscapes, snapped by the car industry's leading photographers, while toying with the angles, lighting, and shutter speeds as if they were in the field. From there, those images can be downloaded and turned into wallpapers for phones, used as avatars, and even shared on Snapchat. For gearheads of bygone eras, magazine cut-outs of Lamborghinis taped inside high school lockers or that ""flying Porsche"" poster hung on a bedroom wall used to be the closest teenagers could get to their dream car which is perfect with android car gps. But these days, highly realistic racing games have taken car lust to a much higher level, allowing kids to delve deep into a vehicle's history and construction, customize its livery, and test its mettle on a track—all from the comfort of their couch. What these same kids might not realize, however, is that they are being influenced in ways that no poster can compete with. Research has shown that the brain releases the same neurotransmitters and hormones during driving games as they would during a physical race, says Alexander Edwards, president of brand consulting firm Strategic Visions. With 1:1 vehicle replicas and technically accurate tracks, the virtual world is so realistic that players start responding to the games on a chemical basis as if they were actually there. In fact, the experiences have become so life-like that if players clock enough hours in Gran Turismo they can get their FIA license valid for amateur racing by Opel navi in some countries. According to Edwards, such intense emotions imprinted over hundreds of hours of playing these racing games can end up having a huge effect on kids. They can mold their identities, influence their automotive aspirations, and even guide their vehicle and android car dvd player purchases. ""Video games have an incredible impact on our self perception,"" Edwards says. For the most avid players, games enable them to become that ideal version of themselves, and as a result, the cars they play are the ones they aspire to own. As an example, Edwards hosted a focus group of males between the ages of 11 to 16 and found that for those participants Fords and Chevrolets were the vehicles they were most interested in because those were the cars they ""drove"" in video games. ""They're saying, 'I can't drive yet, but when I drive I want to drive the one I have a good experience with in a video game,'"" he says. Although it's not clear if video games drive the desire to buy certain brands, or if brand affiliation influences the cars and the inner installations of android car GPS or vauxhall sat nav a person selects in a game, the link is too clear to ignore—brands that have the highest percentage of young buyers, such as Kia, Mazda, and Scion, also have the largest portion of players."
14,The DeLorean Story Like You've Never Heard It Before,autos-trucks," John DeLorean started his time in the auto industry at Packard, but his time there was short lived as the company entered its downward spiral. So, he moved on to Pontiac, where he soon turned Chrysler's muscle car idea into a very loud reality with the advent of the GTO. That was one of the achievements that helped him move over to Chevrolet. The way was clear all the way to the top of GM, but instead of marching there, he decided to go even bigger by building his own vision, the car with modern android car dvd or android car GPS of the future. Getting ￡80 million from the Labour government and convincing Colin Chapman that the car his team would develop won't compete with the Lotus Esprit was quite an achievement on its own. But being the down-to-earth nutter that he was, DeLorean continued by setting up a car factory in Northern Ireland for android 2 din car stereo, a part of the world where many never had any sort of job to start with, let alone one in the car business. No wonder the piece of land he secured was a swamp. No matter! After removing a few feet of mud and making a mountain smaller by filling up the place with rocks, the wheels for DeLorean's car of the future were set in motion. DeLorean wanted an ethical sports car, one that is installed with special android car dvd and vauxhall sat nav, would last forever and look like nothing else. Since the DMC-12 was the Tesla of its day, the best engineers in the world got involved, and although none of them recommended using a stainless steel body, gullwing doors and a gutless Peugeot/Renault/Volvo V6 mounted at the back that wasn't even certified for the US market, DeLorean insisted on the first two and had already signed a deal on the third. The timeframe was impossibly tight. Officially, they had 18 months to complete the car, unofficially, it took 24 months, and the DMC-12 got certified in 28, a record that could stand forever. 375 employees worked 24/7 to achieve that, putting aside politics, religion and personal problems to create something truly outstanding. It wasn't simultaneous engineering, but simultaneous everything. After driving what wasn't even a prototype but rather Lotus's almost empty show car, the engineering team recommended major changes. Then came the riots and the fire bombs, since Northern Ireland was at war. While the factory was turned into barracks by the army, precious records were lost forever in the fires. And nobody knew what was supposed to keep those heavy gullwing doors open. Nobody thought of that before. Once the first car got off the line, they made 3000 changes to the product. Build quality was improving at a promising pace, but since the demand was so high in the US that the $25,000 car was selling well, the same with android car dvd player and Opel navi , DeLorean introduced another shift, raising production output from 50 to 80 cars a day. That turned out to be a terrible mistake."
15,Drugged Driving Leads to Accidents on American Roadways,autos-trucks," Each day, many motor vehicle accidents occur on American roadways due to driving under the influence. Alcohol is often the source of impairment for these drivers. But many accidents are caused by drug use. --- Drugged Driving Laws--- Both state and federal laws specify how drugged drivers are penalized for their actions and how a claim against such drivers may apply. Each state varies in their own position against drugged driving, with some states being completely intolerant and others offering some leeway. Roughly one third of the nation’s states take a zero tolerance position. The variation from state-to-state causes confusion for many and substantial differences in how drugged driving cases may be pursued, as well as the outcome for victims. In some states today, certain drugs once considered very dangerous have been legalized for medical or recreational use. This confuses the drugged driving liability issue even more. Each person’s body responds uniquely to drugs based on their individual chemistry, history of use, the type of drug, amount used, body size and other factors. States are struggling to find ways to regulate legal limits in balance with changing laws governing use of these drugs. Overall, the goal is to protect citizens on roads, something that may be easier said than done with rapid changes to legal drug use. --- Legalization Issues in Drugged Driving--- As laws are passed to legalize some drugs, fatal accidents from drugged driving increase, according to the Journal of Epidemiology. Results of 23,500 drivers were included in this study. The drivers were provided with a toxicology test no longer than one hour following involvement in a motor vehicle accident between 1999 and 2010. The study indicated 12 percent of fatalities from these auto accidents were related to impaired driving in 1999. By 2010, 28 percent of fatalities were due to impaired driving. Marijuana was the cause of impairment in four percent of these accidents in 1999, with a change to 12 percent in 2012. One of every nine drivers in accidents with fatalities have been found to test positive for use of marijuana, according to the study. During the 11 year study, alcohol impairment rates remained consistent and did not show these marked increases. Studies by other organizations have reflected the same results. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 22 percent of drivers had consumed illegal, prescription or over-the-counter medications. These results did not change from day to night driving. The most aggressive change in behavior of drivers related to the age group of 50 to 59 years, with those drivers increasing illegal drug use from 3.4 percent in 2002 to 7.2 percent in 2010. About one quarter of fatalities due to drugged driving were due to drivers in this age range. One survey revealed that one out of every six collegians drives under the influence of drugs each year, not including alcohol. This study was conducted in the year 2011. --- Drug Statistics--- 46.5 percent of drugged drivers had used prescription medication, according to a nationwide study of fatal crashes in 2010. Among these drugged drivers, almost 37 percent had used marijuana and almost 10 percent used cocaine. Oxycodone, hydrocodone, alprazolam and diazepam were the most commonly used prescription drugs by drivers. Not all of these uses of prescribed drugs were legal. --- Dangers of Drugged Driving--- People who drive while intoxicated with alcohol are 13 times more likely to cause a car accident with fatalities. Mixing alcohol and marijuana leads to a 24 times greater chance of a fatal car accident. Civil lawsuits often result due to loss of lives, serious injuries and the overall impact experienced by families due to these accidents. Drugged driving may also lead to criminal charges against drivers responsible for accidents. Impaired drivers can be fined, arrested, required to provide community service and even imprisoned. --- Preventing Drugged Driving--- Preventing drugged driving starts with not driving when taking medications or illicit drugs. Designated drivers are the easiest means of preventing these terrible accidents. When marijuana is being consumed, passengers should be careful to not expose drivers to second hand smoke. Those taking prescription drugs should discuss with their doctor whether driving is safe while using the medication. Prescription medications should never be used by anyone except those to whom the drugs are prescribed. Alcohol should never be mixed with medications or consumed during the same time period. --- Getting Help When Injuries Are Suffered--- When a drugged driving auto accident occurs, consulting with a personal injury lawyer can help provide direction toward filing a legal claim. Impairment leading to an accident is a possible criminal matter, as well. Anyone who believes their own impaired state may have led to an auto accident should immediately talk to a criminal lawyer."
16,Proving a Defect Car Part Was Responsible for Your Car Accident,autos-trucks," Sometimes car accidents are not the result of driver negligence. There are cases where the liability is with the manufacturer who failed to ensure a vehicle is safe before putting it in the hands of a customer. In such cases, the plaintiff must prove how the manufacturer failed and why they should be held responsible for the resulting accident. --- Automotive Defects Are More Common Than You May Think --- There are three kinds of defects that may affect automobile safety. The first is in design, with the vehicle being flawed even before it was built. Normal usage of a poorly designed vehicle can result in injury. A good example of this type of defect is a car in which the fuel line connections create potential for fire. A second type of defect is in manufacturing. A manufacturing defect occurs when parts are not properly or well made. If the parts on a vehicle are not the right shape or size, they can fail to work or come loose and cause injury to the driver, occupants or other people on the roadways. The third type of defect is a warning defect. This is a failure by the manufacturer to notify customers of a known vehicle danger. An example of this type of defect is when the manufacturer knows that a part has resulted in multiple accidents, injuries or death of customers and yet the manufacturer does not issue a recall of customers with that same type of vehicle known to contain the defect part. --- Overview of Vehicle Defects --- Safe operation of a vehicle can be disrupted by defective auto parts. Such defects may be electronic or mechanical. Even the software designed to keep drivers and passengers safe can be defective. A defective part may lead to accidents. When enough of these types of problems have been found in association with a particular car model, a recall is issued. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration requires manufacturers to issue recalls when parts do not meet safety standards. This is done to ensure future accidents do not occur due to the same known cause. Over 390 million cars and trucks have been recalled to date, with 66 million auto parts and 46 million tires being replaced due to defects. Liability is determined when the defect affects people. Injury and death can result from a vehicle part that breaks, with manufacturers possibly being held liable for the accident damages. --- Damages Due to Defective Parts --- Vehicle defects often destroy cars and trucks from within, where the defects may not be perceptible by drivers. Defects can cause accidents affecting multiple people and property. Each defect can cost thousands of dollars in destruction with injuries to people that include broken bones, abrasions, contusions and minor injuries. --- Liability in Defective Parts --- It is up to the plaintiff in a personal injury case to prove auto defect resulted in an accident. Because these cases can be quite complex, plaintiffs usually enlist the help of an experienced personal injury lawyer. The lawyer may conduct an investigation to gain evidence of the defect that caused the accident. For such a case to be successful in court, the plaintiff must prove that the defect caused or contributed to the accident. For manufacturer liability to be proven, the plaintiff must show that the defect originated from the manufacturing process or otherwise while the vehicle was in the hands of the manufacturer. When a defect is proven to have existed while under the manufacturer’s control, damages to the plaintiff must have occurred for any financial liability on the part of the manufacturer. A personal injury lawyer will review case information, circumstances and documentation to establish proof of damages caused by the defect in whole or in part. --- Working with a Lawyer for a Defect Case --- When buying a vehicle, drivers entrust that the vehicle meets safety standards and that the quality of that vehicle will ensure safety of those using it. When accidents happen due to a defect, injuries may be inflicted on the driver, passengers and others on the road. Lives may even be lost. There are many things that a lawyer may need from the accident victims during a case, such as cooperation in not tampering with the vehicle until an examiner can inspect it. Defective auto part cases are particularly sensitive in this realm because it must be proven that the defect was from the manufacturer and not as a result of tampering after the car was sold to the customer. Documentation that may be required can include vehicle purchase paperwork, service records, records of damage, personal medication lists from the driver, insurance transaction details and traffic analysis. The difficulty of a defect case involves the knowledge and experience of a personal injury attorney. Such an attorney has the right awareness, investigations connections and resources for proving such a case, when a defect exists."
17,Whose Insurance Pays for an Accident in a Rental Car?,autos-trucks," When you are traveling for vacation, personal needs or business, a rental car provides convenience and comfort for getting around on your own schedule. Such travel can be full of thrills like visiting a new place, leaving your office desk for a while, and just getting out and doing new things. But driving a rental car comes with responsibilities and even the best drivers can get into an accident. --- When an accident occurs in a rental car, whose insurance covers the damages? --- Rental car companies usually ask the renter if they want optional insurance. Most renters decline this policy without a second thought, unless the state they are in requires it. After all, if you have a car for only a few days, what are the odds of getting into an accident? Unfortunately the odds are high enough for an accident to occur while in possession of a rental car that many people are confronted with the panic such an accident produces. Their first thought is often, ""I should have gotten the rental insurance."" This supplemental policy is specifically designed to protect consumers when they are in an accident in a rental vehicle. It keeps those consumers from taking on liability through their personal insurance policy. Although you may feel the odds of a rental car accident are slim, you should still opt for rental car insurance coverage at the counter. This insurance usually only costs a few dollars per day but can really provide shelter in the aftermath of an auto accident. While supportive in such cases, do be aware that rental car insurance policies are minimal and have some restrictions, such as when the rental car driver is clearly negligent and caused the wreck. --- Operation of a Rental Car as an Uninsured Motorist --- When you opt out of the rental car insurance policy, your insurance provider is then responsible for damages incurred on that rental vehicle. This is the same coverage as if you were driving your own car at the time of the accident. However, the insurance company can sometimes preclude coverage if the driver is not operating his or her own vehicle. Thankfully, there are only a few states that allow such preclusion. If you are from one of the states that allows insurance policies to only cover drivers operating their own personal vehicles, and you deny the rental car company’s optional insurance policy, what happens if you are in an accident in the uninsured rental vehicle? In essence, you become an uninsured motorist. The other party involved in the accident must then rely on their own policy to cover initial costs as part of uninsured motorist coverage. But this opens you up to being sued for damages from the collision to reimburse what the insurance company covered. --- Using Credit Card Insurance for a Rental Car Accident --- Realizing you were an uninsured motorist in a rental car accident can be terrifying. When this is the case, you still have one other possible avenues of security. That is, many credit card companies insure vehicles rented using their credit cards. This automatic perk may be something you do not realize you have until it is desperately needed. If you paid for the rental car using a credit card like this, you are in luck. Despite waiving the optional insurance at the rental car desk and your own insurance policy rejecting a claim, the credit card company may still provide the coverage you need. When a credit card used for the rental provides no relief, another possible avenue of support is your homeowner’s policy. Sometimes these policy have added benefits that homeowners do not even realize exist. One such benefit may be coverage of rental car accidents. It sounds far-fetched, but your policy could include rental car insurance clause. --- When a Rental Car Accident Happens --- When an accident occurs while you are driving a rental car, follow the same initial steps as you would in any car accident: Ensure you, passengers and the other driver are uninjured, first Call for emergency medical support if that is needed Call the police to ensure you are provided with a police report about the accident based upon law enforcement’s view of the scene Contact your insurance company to inform them of the accident Call the rental car company to tell them you were involved in an accident in one of their vehicles Most rental car companies provide checklists of who to call and what to do on the scene, in the event of a rental car accident. These checklists are often stickers somewhere visible inside the car or in the glove box along with other vehicle documentation. You can also check your rental policy or the rental policy brochure jacket for possible information, customer service telephone numbers and other details you need. When a rental car accident occurs, it may be appropriate to reach out to an attorney. A personal injury attorney can help guide you through the accident reporting phase, insurance claims process and in dealings with the rental car organization. Having an attorney on your side may make the experience easier to bear and provides peace of mind in ensuring your best interests are protected."
18,After an Automobile Accident: What to Do,autos-trucks," Being involved in a car accident would shake anyone up. The accident itself and the following days can be confusing and unnerving. In almost a blink of an eye, your life can change in so many ways, and not usually for the better. Can you put a price on the well-being of yourself or others that are injured in a car accident? There are many questions to answer, documents to fill out and things to be concerned about. Some of those questions and concerns include: What happens to my car after an auto accident? Will my insurance pay for the damages? Will my insurance rates increase because of the accident? Will I or anyone else involved in the collision face criminal charges? Is it possible to be sued because of the accident? What should be done first after the accident? Do I need to follow certain steps or protocols? Who should I call to advise of the accident? After an accident there are certain things you should handle.  The best course of action is to be proactive and start handling these things quickly and efficiently, engaging people with the right experience to help you as needed. Having an experienced lawyer on your side following a car wreck ensures things are much easier, less stressful and thoroughly handled. --- Document the Scene of Your Accident --- When an accident occurs, it can be difficult to remember what to do at the scene. But the most important thing to do while still at the accident site is to document the scene as effectively as possible. If your smartphone or other device is still working after the accident, use it to establish records that will prove helpful in the near future. Do the following: Take photos of the involved vehicles Note or photograph vehicle positions in the wreck Get pictures of any skid marks on the ground Note any property damage Note damage to involved vehicles Document the weather at the time of the accident Take notes of other conditions that may have contributed to the accident Document signage, traffic lights and crosswalks if these are part of the accident cause or scene Get names and contact information, including phone numbers, email addresses and mailing addresses, for accident witnesses Police are usually quite thorough in their reporting of accidents. But this information may be needed before the police report is available to you. You also need to ensure the scene is well documented in case you have a different perspective regarding the occurrences leading to the accident or at the site. Further, sometimes witnesses leave the scene before police even arrive. If you have suffered serious injuries in the accident, you may not be able to document the scene. If you are injured and may be hurt more by moving about, do not risk additional injury or pain. Call 911 for help and do as the paramedics instruct when they arrive. If you are expecting to be transported by ambulance or made to remain still by paramedics, try to call someone you trust to come to the scene and fulfill the documentation duties for you. --- Contact an Experienced Personal Injury Attorney --- The first instinct after leaving the accident scene, or even while awaiting police, is to call your insurance company. But the first call should always be to an experienced personal injury attorney. This is because an attorney can help you in dealing with the insurance companies. Insurance companies are most interested in their own profits as a business. Because they lose money when paying claims, insurance companies will try to serve their own best interests before yours. An attorney can help ensure that the insurance companies are more forthcoming according to your needs and what you deserve after the accident. There will also likely be several insurance companies involved in paying claims for your accident, if more than one vehicle was involved. This multi-driver involvement can lead to some delays in claim payment, as well as diversion from one insurance company to another. If you contact an attorney before the insurance company, the attorney can handle this for you. Having a lawyer on your side will help expedite your claim because personal injury law firms know how to deal with insurance companies and their processes. As a result of working with a lawyer, you will also likely be paid more for your injuries and losses. Most personal injury lawyers work on a contingency fee basis. This means that they are not paid for their time until you receive payments, yourself. The law firm will simply retain the predetermined percentage from your recovery when they gain the amount for you. This works well for most clients, because it is incentive for the law firm to quickly and fully recover amounts for you. --- Participating in the Process with Your Lawyer and Insurance Company --- When working with an attorney, you will still need to be involved in your case. You will likely need to attend doctor’s visits, interviews with the police or other investigators, and dealings with insurance companies. It is very important that you work with your lawyer as they need you to so that the case and your claim recovery will move smoothly. There may be things you do not enjoy doing, such as visiting the doctor. But these steps are important for insuring that you receive the best possible outcome for your case and financial claim. When the insurance companies request documents or items associated with the accident, you will need to communicate with your attorney and follow their guidance regarding how you respond. Although you may feel bothered at times by requests or things you must do, the outcome will prove your time was spent in a worthwhile manner. Every participant in the claim process will need to work together to get things done and return the largest possible amount to you."
19,Increased Fatality Rates Due to Commercial Truck Rollover Accidents,autos-trucks," Rollover car accidents are the most deadly of all types of auto wrecks. A recent article in the Accident Reconstruction Journal reported that one third of all car accident fatalities in America are attributed to rollover crashes. About 50 percent of rollovers in SUVs and passenger trucks involve fatalities. Commercial trucks that rollover during an accident result in fatalities in an overwhelming 60 percent of cases. When a commercial vehicle causes an accident, it is important that victims seek legal assistance from an experienced Arizona personal injury law firm. --- Electronic Stability Control for Prevention of Commercial Truck Rollover Accidents --- The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is working diligently to curb deadly accidents among buses and commercial trucks, the most top-heavy of vehicles. Safety standards proposed for federal law by the NHTSA include electronic stability control mechanisms for large commercial vehicles. Similar regulations were already enacted for passenger vehicles like SUVs and pickups. That law went into effect in 2012. It is the firm belief of the NHTSA that the law is already positively affecting the number of accidents resulting in rollovers and rollover fatalities. The NHTSA also estimates that up to 56 percent of large commercial vehicle rollovers could be prevented through electronic stability control. The organization believes that it would also reduce loss-of-control accidents of these vehicles by 14 percent. Up to 2329 crashes each year could be prevented with 858 fewer injuries and 60 fewer fatalities for every 12 months. Electronic stability control systems monitor vehicle movement and steering. If ESC senses a problem in stability, the system can help the driver keep the vehicle under control by braking or self-correcting the car’s steering. If a law is enacted for electronic stability control on commercial vehicles, the production rule would apply to automakers two to four years after adoption. Many vehicles already have this technology in place and would not need to be changed to meet the law’s requirements. The NHTSA rules would take effect two or four years after they are adopted, depending on the type of vehicle. The technology is already available and used in various vehicles on the road today. --- Causes of Rollover Crashes of Commercial Trucks --- Clearly, design of commercial trucks is a factor in rollover accidents. The high center of gravity of high-profile vehicles such as these cause overturning during maneuvers on sharp turns, curves, on ramps and off ramps. This is because the vehicle is maneuvered but inertia keeps the load going its original direction, the direction of the truck before its last maneuver. The vehicle then rolls, often exacerbated through driver errors such as misjudgments in speed, load height and heaviness, failure to secure the load, or simple driver distraction. Truck drivers often drive while drowsy. Another contributing factor of commercial truck rollover accidents is that of errors made by the driver when controlling the vehicle. Steering, acceleration and braking are common driver errors. One cause of truck rollovers that many people are unaware of is lack of visual search. This means that the driver is not adequately aware of surroundings, other vehicles and obstacles in the roadway. Most of these accidents occur in traffic. Regardless of root cause, most rollover accidents of commercial trucks come down to how the driver was operating the vehicle. --- Prevention of Commercial Truck Rollover Accidents --- To prevent rollovers of commercial trucks, experts are studying the specific causes of these crashes. Some changes to the vehicles can be made, like that of electronic stability control. Roadways can also be changed by design to prevent rollover accidents. An example of this is through inclusion of signs at freeway exits that require trucks to reduce speed limit. Another example is for devices in vehicles to make drivers aware of dangerous conditions for load-bearing vehicles. But these are expensive changes that would take years upon years to gain real benefit from, in reduction of truck rollovers. Prevention through driver training programs is a clearer route to reduction of these deadly accidents. Because this training is not presently a requirement, even commercial driver training programs that have entire chapters of text on the subject rarely delve into prevention to an adequate degree. According to Aaron Crane of Cantor Crane, ""The truth is that most of these commercial truck rollover accidents are proven to be the fault of the driver. Through personal injury cases from these accidents, drivers’ trucking companies are forced to pay large sums of money to those injured. Through the ‘pain’ in these settlements for the trucking companies, it is hoped that they will start exercising stricter controls of prevention and training for their drivers."" Simply through prevention programs, these trucking companies could save themselves large sums of money."
20,Car Accident or Car Crash: What is the Difference?,autos-trucks," Is it an accident or a car crash? Most people consider the terminology interchangeable and the results the same; vehicles collide, and people are injured or killed. While both events may result in damaged or destroyed property and humans that are hurt or killed, an accident and a crash are not the same thing. --- An Accident vs. a Crash --- An accident, according the dictionary, is an unplanned and unintended event that happens suddenly and by chance and results in injury or damage. A crash, according to the dictionary, is to hit something with enough force to cause damage or destruction. These definitions seem similar, but the dictionary implies that accidents are nobody’s fault. Softening the language of the event does not lessen the harsh reality of it, especially when someone dies. --- Crash Statistics --- The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) tracks crashes each year by using FARS, the Fatality Analysis Reporting System. The most recent statistics available show the following. 32,675 people died in vehicle crashes in 2014 Victims include vehicle drivers, passengers, motorcyclists and pedestrians One third of deaths resulted from drunk driving crashes Distracted driving caused 10 percent of fatal crashes Drowsy driving caused 2.6 percent of crash fatalities The National Safety Council also keeps track of vehicle crashes and show even more dramatic statistics. 35,400 crash fatalities in 2014 Alcohol caused 30.8 percent of these fatalities Speeding caused 30 percent of crash fatalities Distracted driving caused 26 percent of crash fatalities --- Historical Context --- Using the word accident to refer to incidents involving damage, injury and death was popularized by big businesses in the early 1900s. Because the word accident implies that no one is at fault, companies used it as a way to avoid accepting blame when employees were injured on the job. Later, the word became associated with negligent drivers who claimed their vehicle collision was an accident, implying they were not at fault. ""When you use the word ‘accident’ it is like, ‘God made it happen,’"" says Mark Rosekind, head of the NHTSA. Safety advocates believe saying accident instead of crash trivializes the human error that is most often the cause of the crash. Another problem is when the victim dies and cannot tell their side of the story. Only the survivor gets to be heard and they may be the one who caused the crash. According to Amy Cohen, co-founder of Families for Safe Streets, children who die in crashes, including her 12-year-old son, do not die in accidents. She says, ""An ‘accident’ implies that nothing could have been done to prevent their deaths."" --- Swapping Words --- Transportation and safety advocates are pushing to eliminate the word accident and use crash exclusively. Using the stronger, more accurate word, they believe, will help drivers grasp the seriousness of reckless and negligent behavior while driving. With the change, motorists are expected to realize and admit that vehicle collisions are preventable most of the time. Advocates believe this will make drivers less likely to drive under the influence or drive while distracted. They also hope the word change leads to policy changes that can help reduce traffic crashes, injuries and deaths. The NHTSA changed its terminology in 1997. Others are finally catching on. On January 1, 2016, Nevada swapped ""accident"" for ""crash"" in many state legal documents and laws. By doing so, those involved in crashes are no longer afforded the presumption that no one is to blame after a collision. Departments of Transportation in 28 states officially use the word crash, including Arizona. Many cities also changed the words. New York City made a policy change in 2014 that mandated they must not look at traffic crashes as accidents. --- The Reality of What Happens --- When two or more vehicles collide, resulting in the destruction of property and loss of life, how did it happen? Something triggered the events that led to the collision, meaning something, or someone, is at fault. In a small percentage of cases, the crash is caused by non-driver actions, such as vehicle design defects, a tire blow-out, animals crossing a street, poorly maintained roadways or certain weather conditions. However, most of the time, human error causes vehicle collisions, and in those cases, it is definitely not an accident. --- Human Error --- As expected, human error makes up for the majority of reasons why car accidents happen. Over the years, more people are focusing their eyes on other things when they should be focusing on the road. Other elements of human error caused car accidents are as follow: Driving under the influence Distracted driving (talking on a cell phone, texting, not paying attention) Reckless driving (speeding, tailgating, changing lanes too quickly) Running red lights and stop signs Improper turns Road rage Drowsy driving --- New Word, Same Ending --- So, what happens now? The word ""accident"" is replaced with ""crash"" but someone’s car is still totaled, someone is injured and someone is dead. Just because the person who caused the collision calls it an accident does not make it so. Did that person choose to drive and text or drive after taking medicine? Someone did something or made a choice that led to the crash. That someone should be held responsible for their actions. If you are injured in a crash or had a loved one die from a collision, talk to a car accident lawyer who understands how important it is to use the right words. Saying it was an accident could allow the person responsible to be held to a lower standard of accountability. You deserve to be compensated for any loss of property, medical bills and lost wages. Get a lawyer who understands accidents do not just happen and who will fight to level the playing field so that you recover everything you lost."

2,Train Air Horns Sound,autos-trucks," Since I was a young boy, I recall loving the whistles of the train that used to run on the tracks near my house. Even Paul Simon sings, ""Everyone loves the sound of a train in the distance.""  Now that I am an adult, well maybe not according to my wife, I find that I still love that sound but I want it louder. So, what used to be an infatuation of die cast trucks and cars as a kid, I now relate to my pick up truck. There's nothing I love more than finding a new accessory or neat new thing that will beef up my F-150 and give it the custom look that I feel reflects my personality. Aftermarket parts and accessories give the owner a great opportunity to dress up their truck or SUV in style, or to add on brighter LED lights for safety and to get noticed. Pickup truck buying today, gives you expensive sticker prices, and not many factory options for the bells and whistles you envy when you see other truck owners drive down the road with them. You can get some things added, but now the price is really up there and totally escalated. I'm the kind of guy who likes to add a few things over time with easy installation items. As the truck add-on junkie I had become, I was constantly looking for the newest flashiest and most useful add on. I came across an online video clip of a train sound, that was actually a kit to replace my existing truck horn. There I was in the past recalling that nostalgic sound I had heard countless times. But here I am in the future now and looking for things for my truck. The more I played that video, the more I wanted the past right there in my future. Those gleaming chrome trumpets, to me, gave me the thrill my wife gets looking at diamonds in the jewelry store. Not to mention, a whole lot cheaper too!  Hell yeah! I want that air horn kit. The sound was incredible. Just knowing I could have that on my truck and hear it anytime I chose to made my day.I ordered a kit and I swear, I was like my wife anxiously waiting for the UPS man to deliver the goods I ordered. The day my kit arrived, I had to install it right away. Dinner? No thanks, I was a man on a mission. I ordered a quad chrome trumpet 150 PSI Kit, followed the easy installation directions, and man, I was in heaven the first time I blasted that baby, and every time since! It just goes to prove that boys and their toys never really disappear, they just age like fine wine. And what's wrong with that?"
3,Tire Maintenance For Optimal Tire Life,autos-trucks," The average advertised price to replace 4 tires is $400 to $600 for the top tire size sold. Even $1000 is not out of the question. Insuring that you get the most mileage out of your tires is extremely important. Tires are the link between the vehicle and the road, and are constantly subjected to the forces of acceleration, stopping and turning for a vehicle that weighs an average of over 4000 lbs.! Of course you’re going to see tire wear, but the longer you can make your tires last, the less money you will spend maintaining this part of your automobile. Keeping your tires in good shape requires more than just keeping an eye on tire wear and air pressure. It also means practicing safe driving habits, avoiding bad habits, and maintaining all the components of the steering and suspension systems Proper Tire Maintenance: Tire Pressure: The tires are your main connection to the road, so be sure they are inflated properly. Under-inflated tires provide less traction, can reduce fuel mileage and can wear out prematurely, so check your pressure at least once a month to ensure you are driving on properly inflated tires. As the temperatures drops, so does the pressure in your tires. The proper tire pressure for your car is not necessary the pressure stamped on the tire. Your vehicle should have a sticker located on the driver's side door jamb or on the rear edge of the driver's door that lists the manufacturers recommended tire pressure. Check your tire pressure at least once a month and before every long trip. Rotation: Tires tend to wear unevenly. The front tires tend to wear on the outside edges because the tire leans over when you turn a corner. With the majority of cars having the engine in front, the front tires also typically bear more weight than the rear tires. Front Wheel drive vehicles have the as well as the engine in front, adding to the weight differential. Rotating tires keeps them from wearing unevenly which extends the life of your tires, saving you time and money in the long run. A side benefit is that regular rotation will make your ride smoother and handling safer. During rotation each tire and wheel is removed from your vehicle, and moved to a different position. Your owner's manual will tell you how often to rotate your tires, but as a rule of thumb, it should be done every 5,000 to 8,000 miles. Balancing: Tires and wheels are not perfectly balanced when they are manufactured. When your tires were fitted to the wheels originally, they were measured on a balancing machine. Correction weights are applied to counteract the combined effect of the tire and wheel unbalance, your tires were balanced. The minute you pull away from the tire shop on your new tires, they begin getting out of balance again. Every bump and corner affects balance; so does tire wear, over time, your tires get out of balance again. That's why it's important to have tires balanced regularly. There are some warning signs that your tires have become out of balance. You begin to see uneven wear or a vibration over 40 mph especially if the front tires are out of balance. How often should you have you tires balanced? With typical use every 4,000 to 6,000 miles or every time you have your tires rotated. Safe Driving Habits Help Maintain Your Tires: Watch your Speed: High speeds will generate excessive heat, which increases the rate of tire wear. Avoid High Speed Turns and Curves: Taking turns and curves at high speeds will ultimately wear down your tire’s tread unevenly. Hard cornering transfers the weight of the car to the outside wheels, increasing the load on the shoulders, which can significantly increase wear. Avoid Fast Starts and Panic Stops: Continual acceleration and fierce braking wear away patches from the tire tread, leading to bald spots that can expose a hole in the casing. With tread wearing away from this style of driving, handling is compromised and stopping distance is lengthened. Go easy on the gas and brake, and you'll have more tread on your tire and less on the pavement, lengthening the time between tire replacements. Be Aware Of Rough Road Surfaces: Everything you hit in the road, from potholes to debris, has a direct impact on your tire life. Travel on rock and gravel roads is rough on rubber. It tends to take little chunks out of the tire as the sharp pieces of the road act somewhat like sandpaper on your tires. Avoid Carrying Extra Weight: Overloading your vehicle stresses your tires and can lead to damage. Don’t carry unnecessary stuff in your trunk. Curbs: Hitting a curb is never a good thing. Running over curbs, or striking one with the sidewall of your tire, can cause a blowout. Suspension/Steering System Maintenance: Maintenance of the tires themselves and good driving habits are a good start to optimum tire life, maintaining the suspension and steering system completes the package. The tires are your vehicle’s link to the road and your suspension and steering system is your link to the tires. Getting all the mileage you can from your tires can be accomplished by getting routine Alignment checks before any irregularities in tread wear show up. Many auto repair shops will do an alignment check for free. Or you can wait until you see problems like Wear on one edge but not the other Uneven wear (alternating high and low) on the outer edge, known as ""feathering"" ""cupping"" Alignment is a complex topic covering a number of parts; basically your tires ’t pointing in the right direction and affecting your safety and the durability of your tires and all the parts controlling them. Misalignment can be caused by imperfections in the roadway (potholes, road crown, rocks) and as suspension parts get worn they tend to bend and flex creating stress & strain forcing the car to pull out of alignment. An alignment is a process of loosening bolts adjusting the position on the component and tightening it back up until the wheels are facing the right direction. Alignment checks include a complete inspection of all the components of the steering and suspension systems. Worn parts can be replaced before a problem develops. Regular alignments also satisfy your tire warranty requirements. If your tires carry a warranty or ""lifetime certificate,"" check the fine print. It's likely that it includes the requirement of getting periodic alignments to keep tires from wearing incorrectly. Don't let your warranty be voided by a lack of proper maintenance. We recommend an Alignment Check every 6000 miles. A lot happens over the course of 6000 miles, pot holes, rough stretches of road or worse a curb jumps out in front of you. If your tires are bowed out of alignment by just .017 in., it's the equivalent of dragging your tire sideways for 5 miles for every 1,000 you drive. Depending on how severe the alignment is, you can take an 80,000 mile tire and wear it out in 40,000 miles. Obviously if you have an alignment that is severely out, you can wear the tires out in a couple thousand miles. American Auto Air in Reno uses the latest digital technology to check the alignment on your vehicle and certified technicians to inspect your steering and suspension system components. Proper Maintenance of your tire and suspension system will provide you optimum tire life, better handling, and a safer ride. And in case you don’t maintain your tires American Auto Air & Repair also has a wide selection on tires available to fit your vehicle."
4,Beware Tires Expire,autos-trucks," Do you know someone that only drives a few miles a month and has owned their car over 5 years?   Did you or someone you know recently purchase a used car older than a 2011 model year?  You may be driving on 6 year old tires and Warning Tires Expire! Everyone knows that tires wear out as you drive but did you know that they go bad just like a gallon of milk.  Tires that look good with plenty of tread maybe unsafe to drive on.  Tires are the only link between the vehicle and the road, and they must hold up to the forces of acceleration, braking and turning for a vehicle that weighs a couple of tons.  Older tires are substantially more likely to fail than newer ones. Tires age dangerously because of a chemical process commonly referred to as oxidation, which means that as the tire components are exposed to oxygen, the oxygen particles cause the flexible components of a tire to harden and become brittle. Over time, the tire will simply fall apart under normal stress, just like an old rubber band. Because this process occurs naturally, it does not matter if a tire is being used, stored as a spare, or simply waiting on a store shelf.  Additionally here in Northern Nevada tires are subjected to extreme sunlight, heat, and ice, which can accelerate the breakdown of a tire. Once a tire begins to break down, it becomes more likely to fail in the form of a tread separation. Most tires begin to significantly degrade around five years from the date of manufacture.  Six years from the date of manufacture, most tires are no longer safe for use on a vehicle.  Numerous studies written by or for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration support the finding that tires expire in six years.  Manufacturers have recognized this and have taken small steps to alert consumers about tire aging by placing warnings in the owner’s manual on 2013 and newer vehicles. This warning is from the Owner’s Manual for a 2013 Jeep - Tires and the spare tire should be replaced after six years, regardless of the remaining tread. Failure to follow this warning can result in sudden tire failure. You could lose control and have a collision resulting in serious injury or death. The 2015 Ford Escape Owner’s Manual is not as dire, ""Tires degrade over time depending on many factors such as weather, storage conditions, and conditions of use (load, speed, inflation pressure) the tires experience throughout their lives. In general, tires should be replaced after six years regardless of tread wear. However, heat caused by hot climates or frequent high loading conditions can accelerate the aging process and may require tires to be replaced more frequently.  You should replace your spare tire when you replace the road tires or after six years due to aging even if it has not been used."" If a car that you or someone you know could have 6 year old tires please take the time to check them out. Unfortunately tires don’t have an expiration date stamped on them but they do have a ""born on date"".  When it comes to determining the age of a tire, it is easy to identify when a tire was manufactured by reading its Tire Identification Number.  Tire Identification Numbers are a combination of the letters DOT, followed by ten, eleven or twelve letters and/or numbers that identify the manufacturing location, tire size and manufacturer's code, along with the week and year the tire was manufactured.   Since 2000, the week and year the tire was produced has been provided by the last four digits of the Tire Identification Number with the 2 digits being used to identify the week immediately preceding the 2 digits used to identify the year. Actual Identification - DOT 4B08 4DHR 2910 For example the tire with the identification number shown above was produced during the 29th week of 2010 or the week of July 19th 2010. Let’s make sure that you and your love ones are safe, check the tires and make them aware that Tires Expire and their tires may not be safe to drive on, possibly leaving them stranded on the side of the road."

6,Ocean Harbor Casualty Insurance Company,autos-trucks," Specializing in personal auto insurance with necessary limits, Ocean Harbor Insurance provides a complete range of auto insurance coverage with some add-ons including hit & run protections. Starting in 1994 in Florida, the company negotiates all insurance contracts through its managing general agent, the Pearl Holding Group. It does not sell and underwrite policies online or by direct applications, but through independent agents. For customers, purchasing and negotiating insurance through independent agents are better with regard transparency and product choices. Agents work on behalf of clients, and they do not receive any compensation for every policy they sell. Although coverage options from all insurers appear to be the same, several factors affect the premium and limits. Coverage options by Ocean Harbor Insurance are as follows. Liability Coverage Florida is one of the states in the U.S. to implement no-fault insurance regulation. In the event of an accident, insurance company covers medical bills for treatment and rehabilitation for the clients, regardless of who is at fault. Most states in the country require two different types of liability coverage including Bodily Injury Liability and Property Damage Liability. The former is not mandatory in Florida because the insurer has the responsibility to cover the cost of medical treatments for clients without determining whether the customer is at fault or not. The minimum requirement for liability coverage in the state is, therefore, Property Damage Liability (PDL) with a limit of at least $10,000. PDL from Ocean Harbor Auto Insurance covers the cost of damages that the policyholders cause in an accident, to someone else’s properties such as cars and buildings. Exclusions for this coverage are: Personal Injury Protection No-fault insurance regulation is possible because Florida requires every driver to include Personal Injury Protection (PIP) in the insurance policy. With this coverage, Ocean Harbor Insurance provides financial protections following an event of accidents for medical expenses, loss of income, household replacement services, and death benefit. Medical expenses take the biggest portion of up to 80% of coverage limit while the loss of revenue takes 60%. If there is a remaining amount from the coverage limit after reduction by any or both of those two purposes, the company gives it to the other two services. The only exclusion for PIP is any injury that happens because of auto accident inside any of your family members’ car of which the insurance policy does not specify. Uninsured Motorist Coverage Mandatory coverage in Florida’s auto insurance regulation includes PIP and PDL, but Ocean Harbor Casualty Insurance also offers optional coverage to complete the protection. One of the optional coverage options is Uninsured Motorist, which pays compensations for policyholders’ injuries in the event of an accident with someone who has no auto insurance or insufficient amount of insurance coverage limit. Uninsured Motorist coverage also covers medical expenses due to hit-and-run occurrences. Collision Coverage If PDL covers the cost for damages policyholders cause to others’ properties, Collision Coverage by Ocean Harbor Insurance covers repair or replacement cost for policyholders’ cars. It only applies when damages happen because of an accident with another car. Comprehensive Complementary to Collision, Comprehensive Coverage covers damages because of non-accident reasons for examples fire, theft, vandalism, natural disasters, falling objects, animals, and all other losses of which the policy does not specify. Electronic and sound equipment in the car is exclusions. Both Collision and Comprehensive are available for personal vehicle, not rental or any vehicle that policyholders use as a temporary substitute. Roadside Assistance Apart from the basic mandatory and optional coverage, Ocean Harbor Casualty Insurance offers 24-hour Emergency Roadside Assistance for an additional fee with either annual or 6-month payment option. This dispatch program is available for any vehicle that the insurance policy specifies. Roadside assistance includes one emergency service for every 72 hours. The program covers the following services: ·         Battery Service: a booster battery to help start the vehicle ·         Lockout Service: assistance during lost key or lockout situation ·         Delivery Service: the company delivers an emergency supply of fuels, oils, waste, and all necessities that will be useful for policyholders. Delivery service covers the transportation, meaning policyholders choose the supply and pay for the items. ·         Mechanical Aid: it includes minor adjustments or simple repairs to enable a vehicle. ·         Towing Service: Ocean Harbor Insurance provides free towing service within 25 miles. If outside the distance limit, policyholders must pay for the difference. Auto Rental Reimbursement Ocean Harbor Auto Insurance also provides rental reimbursement option up to $20 for a maximum of ten days. It applies when policyholders’ vehicles are under maintenance or repair due to a collision. Hit & Run and Theft Protection Ocean Harbor Insurance offers $500 rewards for anyone (other than policyholders) who files reports that lead to the arrest and conviction of anyone responsible for hit & run damage or theft. The company gives the rewards to anyone on file with the police."
7,What is a grader?,autos-trucks," At National Plant & Equipment, we always get asked questions like this when clients are after construction machines for hire. A simple answer to this poser would point out that a grader is used to level the ground during the construction process. However, when you’re as passionate about building equipment as we are, let’s look a little deeper. WHAT DO GRADERS DO? Graders, which are also known as road graders, or even motor graders, are to bulldozers and excavators what cufflinks and a whiff of cologne are to a gentleman’s outfit. After the land has been cleared and prepared, a grader (or a maintainer, as others call it) is used to ensure the fine, smooth, level finish required for quality road construction. A long blade, present at the front end of all graders, achieves this finish; this blade can be adjusted and angled, depending on the grading job. In Australia, most graders you’ll find just have the one blade, although in other countries, such as Finland, where snow and ice is prevalent, you’ll find a second blade close to the front axle. HOW DO YOU OPERATE A GRADER? Graders usually have three axles: two at the rear, where the cab and engine are located, and one at the front, where the work is done. Operating a grader is generally seen as one of the toughest jobs on the building site, requiring patience, precision and an eye for detail. However, modern graders make use of GPS technology, which goes some way towards automating the process and lessening the input of the operator. Tasks that graders can be used for include: Road construction – this is the most common usage of graders, which prepare a flat surface for asphalt to be layered on. They can also be angled to give a road camber. Building construction – graders can also be used to ensure foundation is in place and flat prior to building work starting, particularly on larger buildings. Snow removal – in colder areas where snowfall is common, graders function as makeshift snowploughs; similarly, in hot countries, they can be used to create dirt tracks across parched landscapes. NATIONAL PLANT AND EQUIPMENT – CONSTRUCTION MACHINES FOR SALE At National Plant & Equipment we have top-of-the-range graders for sale, including a Caterpillar 16H grader for sale, as well as a number of construction machines available for rent. We operate across Australia, including in Gold Coast and Perth, and are the ones to turn to for all your needs – whether that involves grading, digging or any other heavy equipment use."
8,6 fascinating facts about Caterpillar,autos-trucks," Caterpillar has been one of the biggest names in construction and mining machinery for years, and for good reason. Their equipment is some of the best in the business. Since its inception in 1925, the company has grown from serving one industry to serving 27, and has expanded its reach from one country to 180. The company is celebrating its 90th birthday this year, and in that time it has gone through some changes, as any company does. Today, we'll take a look back and show you six fascinating facts about the Caterpillar Company that you may not know. Believe it or not, Caterpillar didn't begin with big construction vehicles sporting the CAT logo on the side. Caterpillar was originally a farm-equipment company. The company was formed in 1925 by Benjamin Holt and Daniel Best, when Holt Manufacturing Company and Best Tractor Company merged to form the Caterpillar Tractor Co. These two men were considered pioneers of the agricultural industry. Until the 1940s, farm tractors were Caterpillar’s primary product. In 1986 the company changed its name to Caterpillar Inc and in 2002, Caterpillar sold its farm-equipment business to AGCO and the company began its transition to become a leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment. Caterpillar machines and equipment are renowned for their bright yellow colour. While this may be the case today, originally Caterpillar equipment was grey. In 1931, the company decided to change the colour of its machinery to the distinguishable ""highway yellow"" used today. The yellow hue they use now is actually a bit different and is trademarked as ""Caterpillar yellow"". Since its founding in 1925, the Caterpillar company has grown into a strong and well-connected dealership network. In fact, some of the dealers that currently work for Caterpillar have been with Caterpillar since its founding year. Currently the Caterpillar dealership network’s net worth is around $23.4 billion with a dealer employee count of around 161,700. When many people think of engines and constructions, they think of the company Cummins. This was not, however, always the case. Caterpillar has been designing and creating diesel engines since 1931. In fact, for a short while following 1997 (after acquiring Perkins), Caterpillar was regarded as the world’s largest diesel engine manufacturer. Furthermore, the company has also been manufacturing natural-gas engines and generators since 1941. Usually a company is larger than its dealers, but in Caterpillar's case, it's about even. Their dealership network remains very strong. In fact, some of their dealers have been with them since the very beginning, back in 1925. Their present day dealership network has a massive net value of about $23.4 billion. Another surprising statistic is that CAT has 111,247 employees, while their dealerships employ some 161,700 people. Caterpillar is a world-renowned company, but exactly how big is the business overall? The figures might surprise you. Of the 150 top global licensors for 2014, Caterpillar came in at number 26. That's an even higher ranking than other worldwide giants, such as World Wrestling Entertainment, Coca-Cola Company and Sony Pictures. They have 107 different lifestyle stores in various locations, and their sales of retail merchandise reach over $2.1 billion, a very impressive figure. Whether you're looking for Caterpillar machines for sale or just looking to rent some top quality mining equipment for your business, look no further than National Plant & Equipment. We have the right equipment for all your construction and mining needs."
9,World's largest monsters of mining machines,autos-trucks," Mining excavators are undoubtedly the mechanised monsters of the mining world. Mining excavators are larger than dozers, wheel loaders, trucks and many other draglines and mine site vehicles. But in the class of mining excavators, there are a few machines in particular that reign supreme. When it comes to mining, it takes many machines and other minesite vehicles to get the job done. Mining excavators, draglines, dozers and other earthmoving equipment all have a part to play. Many of them are quite large, but there are a few that simply dwarf the competition. Today, we'll have a look at a few of the largest mining machines in the world and what makes them so impressive. THE BUCYRUS RH400 This mechanical behemoth is currently the world's largest excavator. While it was originally released by Terex in Germany in 1997, Bucyrus acquired Terex's mining equipment division in 2010, which was finally acquired by Caterpillar in 2011. This front-shovel excavator weighs a hefty 889 tonnes and its excavating shovel has the capacity to hold 45 m³ of rock. The unit is powered by two 16-cylinder diesel engines, which contribute to a maximum power output of 4,400 horse power. THE HITACHI EX8000-6 This massive machine was released by the Hitachi Construction Machinery in 2012 and is currently ranked as the second largest hydraulic excavator in existence. The Hitachi EX8000-6 weighs an impressive 811 tonnes and can be equipped with either shovel or backhoe attachments. This excavator has a bucket capacity of 45 m³ and a shovel capacity of 40 m³ and is capable of lifting 75 tonnes in a single load. The unit is equipped with two 16-cylinder diesel engines producing 3,880 horse power. THE LIEBHERR R 9800 The Liebherr R 9800 is considered the largest mining excavator in the world. This monstrosity of a machine is designed for large-scale mining operations and is able to excavate any surface or terrain. The Liebherr R 9800 is powered by two 16-cylinder V-engines and is capable of handling even the most challenging mining tasks. The combined output of this machine is a whopping 2,984 kilowatts and has a maximum operating weight of 810,000 kilograms. In order to effectively run and operate the Liebherr R 9800, it must be supplied with 20,000 litres of diesel fuel. THE DEMAG H740 OS This front-shovel excavator has a collective operating weight of 744 tonnes, making it the fourth largest hydraulic excavator in existence. The machine has been in operation since 1999 and was specially designed with a wider car body and track pad than its forerunners. The loading capacity of the front-shovel is 40 m³ and the whole unit is powered by two 16-cylinder diesel engines producing up to 4,000 horse power. THE BAGGER 293 Mining excavators are some of the biggest machines around, and the top dog among them is the Bagger 293. This monster of a machine is a bucket excavator and is the largest land vehicle ever constructed, coming in at some 96 metres in height, 225 metres in length, and an overall mass of 14,200 tonnes. This beast requires five people to handle its operation, and it can handle a massive amount of dirt, chewing through a whopping 240,000 cubic metres in just one day. THE BELAZ 75710 DUMP TRUCK Another staple of the mining site is, of course, the dump truck. The worlds largest belongs to BelAZ. Their model 75710, also known appropriately as the '450', has 25% greater capacity than the model below it. It can carry as much as 450 tonnes of payload, thus the name, and it runs on two big diesel engines, each being 16 cylinders with a four-cycle MTU. It also has eight wheels situated on two axles which enable it to transport its massive cargo around the mining site. Its speed tops out at about 64 kph. THE LETOURNEAU L-2350 WHEEL LOADER The LeTourneau L-2350 holds the record as the world's largest wheel loader, coming in at 234 tonnes (operation weight) and with a max payload of 65 tonnes. Its bucket is a massive 40.52 cubic metres, but it might not be the biggest for long. LeTourneau has been working on a prototype of the L-2350 which will have a larger bucket measuring some 53.52 cubic metres. LeTourneau definitely remains the king of wheel loaders, and it doesn't look like it will be giving up that title any time soon."
10,Eight Types Of Bikes At Motorcycle Dealers,autos-trucks," The first motorized bike was invented in 1867 and powered by steam. In 1894, the first mass-produced model was built. Since 1894, hundreds of millions of choppers, scooters, and off-road motorbikes have been produced and sold by motorcycle dealers throughout the world. In 2013, over 8,400,000 were registered in the United States. California, Florida, and Texas accounted for about a quarter of all registrations. They are very popular in dense cities and developing countries due to their low rates of fuel consumption and relatively inexpensive purchase price. Here are the eight main styles of bikes that you will find at motorcycle dealers. Standard Standard bikes are designed for basic street use. They generally do not have a windshield, and the driver sits in an upright position. Cruisers Cruisers are larger than most other motorbikes, and they offer a more reclined seating position. They have more torque, which allows beginner riders to not shift as much. Cruisers are popular with many motorcycle groups. Dual-Sport Dual-sport motorbikes are, as the name suggests, designed for both street and off-road use. Since they are driven off-road at times, a taller suspension is required, giving the rider a more upright seating position. Sport Sport bikes are designed for high levels of street performance. They are generally the fastest motorcycles on the road. They also offer the best braking and handling. As a result of the emphasis on performance, sport models generally offer lower fuel economy than their counterparts, and a less comfortable riding experience. Since they are designed with minimal air resistance in mind, riders sit leaning over the handlebars. Touring Touring models are built with the comfort of the rider in mind. They are used for longer distance trips, and often allow seating for a second rider. Most types have storage areas on the bike for luggage, and some even offer options such as radio and GPS navigation. Touring types can weigh well over 1,000 pounds when fully loaded. Sport Touring As the name suggests, sport touring bikes are a blend of the two models previously discussed. They are generally smaller and lighter than touring models, but larger and more comfortable than sport models. Due to their combination of comfort and sportiness, these models are one of the most popular. Mopeds and Scooters Scooters and mopeds are the lighter versions of the models discussed above. They have smaller engines, an upright seating position, and they often have an automatic transmission. As a result, they are very easy to drive. The small engine offers excellent gas mileage, as well. Worldwide, mopeds and scooters are the best-selling types of motorbike. Off-Road Off-road models are used exactly how the name suggests. They offer riders a more upright seating position and long suspension travel to deal with bumps and dips. The tires used are generally, specifically designed for their use on dirt, mud, and rocks. In conclusion, motorcycle dealers offer potential riders a lot of options. If you are in the market for a new motorbike, use this list to help pick the model that is right for you."
11,ATV Parts and Accessories,autos-trucks," An all-terrain vehicle (ATV) is also known as a quad, quad bike, three-wheeler, or four-wheeler, or RZR. It is a super cool vehicle that travels on low-pressure tires, with a seat that is straddled by the operator, along with handlebars for steering control. ATV is particularly designed to handle a wider range of terrain unlike most other vehicles. It maybe a street-legal vehicle in a few countries, however, it is not legal within most states and provinces of Australia, the United States or Canada. ATVs are designed for single, but some companies have developed ATVs for the driver and one passenger. These ATVs are known as tandem ATVs. The rider operates ATV like a motorcycle, but with the extra wheels that gives an extra stability at lower speeds. ATVs are equipped with three wheel, four wheels and even six-wheel models for special applications. Engine sizes of ATVs currently on sale ranges from 49 to 1,000 cc (3 to 61 cu in). ATVs are smaller, lightweight vehicles that are perfect for touring areas that normal vehicles can't go. This, however, makes them likely to get banged up easily. The right ATV parts will make sure you're not limited on the extent of adventures you wish to take. The general ATV parts consist of: Axles Axles, Axle Tools, Axle Bearings, Axle Wrenches, Wheel Spacers Bearings A-Arm Bearings, Rear Axle Bearings, Wheel Bearings, Swing Arm Bearings, Shock Bearings, Steering Stem Bearings Body Front and Rear Fenders, Fuel Tanks, Seats, Bumpers, Nerf Bars, Skid Plates, Snow Plows, Wheel Spacers, Grab Bars Brakes Brake Pads, Brake Rotors, Brake Shoes, Brake Fluid, Brake Lines, Brake Accessories Cooling Systems Radiators, Coolant, Hose Kits, Water Coolers, Cooling System Parts Drive Chains, Sprockets, Chain Guides, Chain Lube, Drive Belts, Drive Tools, Chain and Sprocket Kits Electrical Batteries, Spark Plugs, Starters, Ignition Coils and Stators, Lighting, Kill Switches, Hour Meters, Speedometers, Horns, GPS ATV Parts Engine Pistons, Oil Filters, Clutch Kits, Gaskets, Valves, Cylinder Parts, Big Bore Kits, Bearings and Seals, Crankshaft Assemblies ATV Parts Exhaust 4-Stroke Exhaust, 2-Stroke Exhaust, 2-Stroke Silencers, Exhaust Packing, Spark Arrestor, End Caps, Exhaust Accessories ATV Parts Filters Fuel Filters, Air Filters, Oil Filters, Pre Filters ATV Parts Frame-Chassis Skid Plates, Nerf Bars, Bumpers, A-Arms, Tie Rods, Tie Rod Ends, Fuel Tanks, Racks ATV Parts Fuel and Air Intake Systems Air Filters, Fuel Controllers, Fuel Tanks, Carburetor Jets, Fuel Filters, Fuel Lines, Intake Parts, Air Filter Maintenance."
12,The Heart of Your Car’s Ability To Keep You Warm - The Heater Core And it too can suffer from clogged arteries and stop working.,autos-trucks," Like the human heart the heater core is the center of your cars circulatory system with large veins entering and exiting and small vessels inside. The life blood of your heating system is your vehicles coolant. The heater core, which is located in the dashboard of your car, is really a miniaturized radiator.  The heater core is used in heating the cabin of a vehicle. Hot coolant from the vehicle's engine is passed through a winding tube of the core, a type of heat exchanger between coolant and cabin air. Fins attached to the core tubes serve to increase surface for heat transfer to air that is forced past them, by a fan, thereby heating the passenger compartment. What can go wrong with the heater core? The heater core is made up of small piping that has numerous bends. Due to the size of the tube winding through the heater core any dregs in your cooling system will end up clogging your heater core.  Over time, dirt and other contaminants can build up in the coolant, or it may become acidic corroding the cooling system components themselves.  Clogging of the piping may occur if the coolant system is not flushed or if the coolant is not changed regularly. If clogging occurs the heater core will not work properly. Control valves may also clog or get stuck.  Once clogged, the hot coolant can’t pass through the heater core, resulting in no heat for the cabin or defrost for the windshield Another possible problem is a leak in one of the connections to the heater core. Electrolysis can cause excessive corrosion leading to the heater core rupturing. Coolant will spray directly into the passenger compartment followed with white colored smoke, a significant driving hazard. Self-Diagnosis: Engine coolant has a very distinctive sweet/oily smell. If you notice this smell inside your car, check for dampness around the passenger side floor/footwell. If you find wetness, you probably have a leaking heater core. A related symptom is a sticky film coming out of the defroster ducts and settling onto the windshield. This is one of those problems that starts out small and gets worse over time, so the sooner you can get it fixed, the better especially if it's during winter time. Like heart surgery heater core replacement should be left to the specialists The heater core is usually located under the dashboard inside of the vehicle and is enclosed in the ventilation system's ducting, servicing it often requires disassembling a large part of the dashboard.  Removing your dash is not a job you want to leave to just anyone.  Repair Pal estimates the labor cost to replace a heater core to be between $550 to $700 or about 5.5 to 7 hours of an experienced mechanics time.   Find a shop the specializes in replacing heater cores.  For example our shop, American Auto Air, replaced a heater core at least every other day during the last winter season. What to do to prevent a ""heart attack""? If you are not experiencing any symptoms of a damaged heater core now is the time to act to help avoid problem in the future.  Car manufacturers recommend that you change the radiator fluid in your vehicle every 24,000 to 36,000 miles, or every 24 to 36 months. However, your personal driving habits will also determine the frequency of needed radiator fluid changes.  If you drive your vehicle in extremely hot temperatures like we had in Reno last summer, you may want to consider changing the fluid once a year or every 12,000 to 15,000 miles. Also you can unscrew the pressure cap and look at the liquid inside the reservoir or radiator, depending on the type of system you have. Coolant can be green, greenish yellow, orange, red, or blue, but is the liquid clear, or is stuff floating around in it?  Does it look rusty?  If the answer to either question is yes it’s time for a cooling system service. If you are past the recommended mileage or your coolant looks funky you should consider NARSA Recommended Seven Point Cooling System Maintenance Service at a trusted shop in your area.  If you are having any concerns about your cooling system, experiencing any symptoms of a damaged heater core, or just lack of heating like it should take it to your local trusted shop or in the Reno NV area bring it to American Auto Air for a Heating System Diagnostic."

16,Two must-see tips for motorcycle maintenance,autos-trucks," Here we will discuss about some problem which is easy to be ignored in the process of motorcycle maintenance, like circuit, oil, gas or mechanical parts. 1.Minimum ignition speed In general, magneto ignition system has minimum ignition speed and it can ensure that the ignition system can realize high voltage ignition at low engine speed. However, most repairman will usually remove the spark plug on the fault engine and do the arcing tests on high-pressure damping cap when there is a ignition failure. These methods are simple and easy and have been widely adopted by them. But some engine failure like difficult to start, is due to ignition coil and the electronic igniter with a high ignition speed. Such as Honda CH125 water-cooled scooter, its minimum ignition speed is 300 r/min. If the minimum ignition performance reduces, the minimum ignition speed increase, and it sometimes even need to reach more than 400 r/min to ignite. If the repairman still use simple arcing tests as above, then they may be fooled by some false appearance and even mislead. This is because there is no compression resistance in the cylinder when the piston runs up and down without spark plug in the engine; the start speed is above 400 r/min, which is much higher than with speed with the spark plug. Therefore, when using the spark plug or ignition coil to ignite, make sure to install a spark plug in the engine, or it is even better to use electronic tachometer to measure start speed. If using the old battery around 12 V, the start speed is around 300 r/min to 350 r/min, the spark is weak, while using the new battery above 13.5 V, the start speed is more than 400 r/min, the spark is blue and white, then we can get a preliminary conclusion: the minimum ignition speed is too high. Then, you need to test the performance of each electric equipment of ignition system, and replace the ignition coil and electronic igniter for contrast test, which can eliminate the failure. 2.The ignition triggers gap or the air gap The ignition system of motorcycle engine generally adopts the flywheel rotor type, while magnet and flywheel are united into one and form as a part of the engine flywheel, and permanent magnets rotate together with the flywheel and form a magnetic field, then there will be induced current in the fixed coil, at the same time play a role of mechanical energy storage and release. Four-stroke engine use non-contact ignition system, the trigger coil of magneto is at the external of the flywheel rotor, where there is a permanent magnets, with the rotor rotating, trigger coil will induce pulse current and provide trigger signal to electronic ignition device (CDI). In order to ensure that the ignition system has a strong ignition trigger signal, while it will not interfere trigger poles and flywheel rotor, so there is trigger gap around 0.40 mm to 0.80 mm between the trigger pole and the flywheel rotor. In general, the gap can be adjusted by the mounting hole or oval hole on trigger pole. Due to the error at manufacturing, or reassemble after repair, or trigger pole wear and tear, the ignition trigger gap may get bigger, thus affecting engine ignition performance in different degrees. Besides, there is also air gap between cylindrical stator and flywheel magnetic, under normal circumstances, unilateral air gap should be no greater than 0.75 mm, in order to ensure the magneto ignition and charging system work normally. For a 125 type motorcycle, driving more than 43000 kilometers, after the stator component was changed for the magneto fault and then electric start can’t work while the pedal start is normal. Then, repairman will check both static and dynamic of battery voltage, which turns to be normal, overrunning clutch, start circuit and relay are also normal, then check the starter circuit, carbon brush and so on, they are all normal. Remove the spark plug, put it on the high-pressure damping cap and do electric start check, the spark is dark red, and after changing a spark plug, electric start is still not working. Then you need to replace the stator coil, and remove the ventilation cover, check the trigger gap between flywheel and trigger pole, there are unexpectedly about 2.0 mm. Realigns the trigger to standard 0.50 mm, reinstall the parts, then electric start can work successful now. You can be seen from the examples above, repairman didn’t adjust the trigger gap according to the rule when changing the stator component, the ignition trigger gap will be too large. When applying the pedal start, because recoil inertia is big, it can barely achieve start speed; and when electric start, because starter speed is relatively low, the large gap will reduce the pulse signal, the spark is not strong enough to start. And the other motorcycle can’t be started because the air gap is too big between cylindrical stator and the flywheel rotor magnetic cylinder wall, which will seriously affect the ignition performance of magneto. In a word, when maintain the failure of ignition system, don’t ignore the ignition trigger gap and air gap."
17,Analysis of clutch failure,autos-trucks," Here is some analysis on failure models in the process of using the clutch. Skid Clutch can affect a smooth start, transfer power and shift smoothly for the motorcycle and it is an important part to make the motorcycle safe, practical and comfortable. There are many different reasons for this phenomenon: Different material of the clutch friction plate. The wear-resisting performance for those high quality clutch kits are much better than those common clutch under the test of same load and usage time. Of course, the price of high quality clutch is also much higher than the common one. The motorcycle rider can choose high quality or common one according to their needs. Motorcycle overloading will cause abnormal wear of the clutch. With the serious wear, the clutch will suffer skid soon, so it is better for the rider not to overload your lovely motorcycle. Improper maintenance of engine. 3.1 The engine oil has not be changed for a long period, then the oil  will have high viscosity and there will be iron scrap inside, which is the main reason for the wear and tear on the surface of clutch friction plate. 3.2 When the clutch control is loose, and the users don’t adjust it in time, then the clutch will be always in the half clutch for a long time, which is a dangerous running condition. Abnormal noise Change of load or the moment of clutch engagement during the period of driving the motorcycle may cause abnormal noise. There are several reasons: The uneven abrasion between friction plate and steel plate will cause sharp sound at the moment of clutch engagement. The contact surface of center bush and pressure plate is too dry because there is no oil on due to the oil viscosity, and then the friction plate will do dry friction and produce abnormal sound. Locking mechanism or adjusting mechanism is loose in the process of using will cause the clutch lose dynamic balance. After a long period of usage, there will be abnormal sound between the parts. The above three factors which cause clutch noise can be solved by daily maintenance, replacement or adjustment. In addition to the above three reasons, if the flatness of friction plate is terribly bad or the thickness is uneven, then these will also cause abnormal noise. This requires clutch manufacturers be in strict accordance with the standard and control the height difference and flatness, in order to reduce clutch noise. Friction plate burnout The friction material fall off from the friction plate, that is friction plate burnout. The main reasons are as follows: the friction material doesn’t bond firmly. Main phenomenon is that some friction material is left on the plate after burnout. This kind of situation is very rare, because friction plate manufacturer will do an overall test about the adhesive force before they leave the factory. The friction plate can’t carry too much load and then cause the friction burnout. In this situation, the friction material will fall off, charring on the surface and have a burning smell. This kind of phenomenon is caused by many factors, such as overload, poor quality of engine oil, poor friction materials and incorrect clutch operating mode, such as climbing with half clutch or speed up and gear shift when going up the slope. Plate burnout have a large influence on driving safety, and will easily lead to major accidents, thus motorcycle drivers need to enhance their safety consciousness, use your motorcycle in a correct way and do regular and reasonable maintenance for your motorcycle. Hope these will help you know more about your motorcycle. Thanks for your time and attention."

1,Why An FR Is More Expensive Than An FF,autos-trucks," Why is an FR (rear-driven) always more costly than an FF (front-driven)? This is truly an interesting topic. There is quite a possibility that the manufacturers deliberately adopt FR to the high-end cars to make it sporty and high-class. But today let's reveal the technical reasons. To begin with, we should understand the machinery difference between FR and FF. In an FF, the entire transmission system is located in the front, the power generated by the horizontally held engine goes through a compact gearbox and is transmitted to the main reducing gear for deceleration and torsional increase, then directly drive the front wheels. On the contrary, the longitudinal engine generates power to a big gearbox, then uses a long transmission shaft to transfer the power to the main reducing gear at the rear wheels, then output the power and drive the rear wheels. So, because the gearbox and main reducing gear are both small, it does not require high cost, thus decreasing the total cost. But this is not the real factor, and the key is as follows. As described above, all the heavy components of an FF are in the front, so we just need to solder a sub-frame to the front for the entire load-bearing to enhance the mechanical hardness, no need to care about the rear. This really means a lot to the price, because the material for reinforcing the frame is usually steel of ultra-high strength and it's really expensive. In addition, the FF car has cost advantages in the manufacturing. Without the transmission shaft and main reducing gear, the chassis can be made flat, which saves lots of processing costs. Things go differently when it comes to an FR. First, its chassis has to hold the entire power transmission system, not only the front, but the middle and the rear need to be strengthened, so the strength of the chassis is greater than that of an FF. Second, the workpiece processing is more difficult. In addition to accommodating the engine, FR's chassis should also have protuberances for the gearbox, not to mention the intermediate transmission shaft that goes through the car body, as well as the main reducing gear at the rear. All of these components require appropriate channels in the chassis. What's more, the chassis has a higher intensity. As a result, the manufacturing cost is higher than an FF."
2,Knowledge Of Modifying A Car's Suspension System,autos-trucks," A car's suspension system is very complex, with the parts inextricably connected to each other. Regardless of a car's shape and size, just the 4 tires touch the ground, and they undertake the weight of the car itself as well as the people and things the car carries. Let's assume a vehicle (front-engine, front-wheel drive) has a total weight of 1,000 kg. When static, the front and rear tire on each side bears 300 kg and 200 kg respectively, while the weight load has some subtle changes when the car gets started. The dynamic inertia will cause a weight transfer to the car, no matter it is speeding up, slowing down or steering, thus resulting in rapid bear load growth of some individual tires. For example, if there's an emergency brake on the ground, the weight that is originally borne by the rear tires would instantly transfer to the front tires. That is to say, the two former tires, which only bear 600 kg in total, will now undertake perhaps more than 800 kg. What's more, if the car radically turns right when downgrading at a high speed while the driver suddenly loses the throttle, the weight load of the right rear tire would become zero because the car is now up in the air! At this time, weight load of the left front tire would reach as much as 800 kg, while the left rear tire and right front tire will take 80 kg and 120 kg respectively. This phenomenon of severe imbalance would let the left front tire slip because of the heavy load, thus losing the ability of steering. In this situation, if the driver depresses the brake in a hurry, more weight would transfer to the front. As a result, the left rear tier has not enough down force because of little weight load, so the frictional force is not enough to contend with the left lateral force generated by the right bend, thus generating a left traverse. The above is a simplified example, but the basic principle is perhaps clear, and we can come to a conclusion that if we could reduce the weight transfer in a movement, the limit of slip can then be increased, thus resulting in a substantial improvement in the overall handling. And now I'd like to introduce several methods to reduce the weight transfer. The first way is to reduce the car's weight. Once the gross weight is less, the transferred weight is therefore reduced. That is to say, weight load of the tires under the same condition is less, so the limit will certainly increase. Please remember to reduce the useless stuff in the car, especially in the trunk, because they will follow the car's dynamic inertia to transfer, thus affecting the stability. The second way is to lower the vehicle's center of gravity, because the lower the center of gravity is, the less the car swings, meaning the less of weight transferred at the same time. The easiest way to lower a car's center of gravity is to decrease the height of the vehicle. But do not casually cut the original springs to achieve your goal as this would cause some side effects. The third way is to strengthen a car's ability of anti-heeling (roll stiffness), which requires strengthening the body and suspension system to suppress sway amplitude of the car. The most common way of this kind of modification is to install high-strength springs and shock absorbers, and equip the car with front and rear tower bars, as well as anti-roll bars."
3,How Cargo Vans Can Uplift Your Business,autos-trucks," Do you want to start a transportation business? Want to give your company a convenient and brisk fleet? There are numerous transportation companies that are renting, leasing and buying a cargo vans. A big cargo van have cover an area that range in size from 13 to 23 feet in length, and sit on an attached frame, unlike a tractor-trailer, which has two parts. Cargo vans carry goods and service instead of people, and work well to carry a small or big loads even with the time sensitive deliveries. If you are using a rental cargo vans, you can set up the shipping contract in advance, try to rent the van on the day of the scheduled pickup and delivery, and transport the goods from one place to another. The first think that the potential customer will want to look at is size. Is the van is large enough to hold what will be it carrying? Before buying used cargo van take a look at the cargo space. Look at the condition of the interior determine whether the van will be able to serve the necessary purpose. It is also important to compare the van to other use cargo vans that are currently for sale. Compare to those man of the same make, model, year or mileage. Without seeing what else is available, it is impossible to tell if the van is fairly priced. How to choose right Cargo Van Before purchasing a cargo van, always ask about its history or maintenance records. Buyers will need to know how often the van has been serviced and  if certain parts need to be replaced soon. To be a savvy buyer, it is crucial to know as much as about a used van as possible because seller will not always volunteer this information, you have to ask about it. It is better to focus some vital point before crack any deal. Van Class- there are two main categories of cargo vans- compact and full size. Full size van are segmented into three segments 1/2 ton, 3/4 ton or 1 ton. While these term are little to do any more with actual payload capacity, they are still used in industries. Cargo Volume-first make a plan in your mind? How much space you required? Cargo volume measured in cubic feet provides a specific number to measure, it is better to do comparison with others cargo van before making any deal. Load Length- most manufactures offer two length/ wheel base option- regular and extended. So it is totally up to you to choose to choose which is more preferable to you. Load Height- cargo van offers two type of roof- standard and raised. The raised model provides 6-feet, 4-inches of floor to roof clearance, allowing most crew member to stand upright, while accessing the cargo area. These vans are used to transport goods and products from one location to another, due to this they suffer lots of wear and tear than any other vehicle; that is why buyer must be careful while purchasing any cargo van for their business fleet. Pick Up the Right Company If you need a cargo van, you are probably better off renting from an outfit that rents cargo vans, box trucks or moving trucks on a regular basis and the prices will likely be less expensive. If the rental company is good, it will give all the relevant detail about your van has been serviced, if the certain parts need to be replaced soon and if the van has been any accident. Rental company provides all the details. Compare the Prices Calling around different cargo vans rental companies and asking for estimate price would not provide the true idea of the final cost. Make sure you understand everything that is included in the price and prepare some questions in your mind before you buy or rent any cargo van. What kind of insurance is included in the rental? Will your cargo require any special equipment and if so, how much extra it is? Always compare similar prices and estimates to ensure your deal is worth it. Check the Vehicle Carefully Regardless of van you are renting, before you sign a rental agreement, it is better to check the vehicle for inside and out for damage.

You can also see that there are several benefit to purchasing a used cargo, but only if you researched it out thoroughly. Cargo vans are very crucial for business growth, it is now becoming a vital part of your organisation to uplift your company."
4,Car fuel saving tips every driver should know,autos-trucks," The price of petrol & diesel has stopped rising for a bit, but it is still a huge cost when running a car. Here are 10 simple fuel saving tips from Telegraph Cars: Did you know that when you drive a car that has been parked for a few hours, the engine is cold and it uses much more fuel for the first five miles or so? Ideally you'd combine all your daily errands into one big trip. Often that's not possible if you have to pop out during the day to drop off and collect the family, but try not to go out separately to do the supermarket shop or buy a newspaper. There are few worse places to spend your time than stuck in a traffic jam, but it's also a very expensive way of travelling. Every time that you stop and start in traffic, your car needs first gear and a huge amount of fuel to get moving again. Second gear is not much better. The best solution is to not travel during the rush hour. You can also save some fuel by trying to understand what the traffic is doing in front of you, & travelling steadily at a slow speed, rather than accelerating and braking. If you have to travel in rush hour a lot, then you could consider buying a hybrid car, which uses much less fuel in town than a normal petrol or diesel. It's not so much of a problem when you're driving in town (see above), but when you're out of town or on the motorway and moving more quickly, the shape of your car is very important. Car designers call it aerodynamics and make lots of effort to reduce the 'drag' and make the car as sleek as possible. Anything that makes wind noise as your car goes along is actually making your car more expensive to run. You can't do much about the design of your car, but you can avoid making it worse by not leaving the windows and sunroof open. It's better to use the air vents for most of the year, and the air-conditioning when it gets too hot. This is just like leaving the windows open, but worse. Even if the roof rack is empty, it increases drag and makes your car use more fuel, while a big ski box is like having another car strapped to your roof. The latest roof racks and ski boxes are quick and easy to fit and remove, so make the effort to stow them away when you're not using them. Just like your body, your car needs more fuel to move around more weight. So, just as you wouldn't wear a heavy rucksack unless you had to, don't cart stuff around in the boot of your car unless you need it. Ironically, the heavier the item (the usual culprits are golf clubs and trolleys), the less likely you are to bother taking it out of the boot and the greater the effect it will have on your fuel consumption. The perfect way to travel is at a constant speed (ideally around 50mph), and in the highest gear (five or six). So if you're a patient driver, you'll have lower fuel bills - it's as simple as that. It's unrealistic to avoid overtaking, but there's little point accelerating past a car to simply be in front of it at the next set of lights - any instant gratification will appear on your fuel bill the next time you fill up. This one always surprises people. It's not just to do with what gear you're in. You may be in a high gear and travelling at a sensible speed, but if you're pushing the accelerator down a long way to avoid changing into a lower gear (into third from fourth, for example), then you're actually using more fuel not less. Obviously, if your car has an automatic gearbox (you'll know if it does), then it will probably do a better job than you of choosing which gear to be in, so it's not a problem. It's tempting to leave the air-con on the whole year round. It stops the windows misting up in the winter and you don't ever need to think about the temperature inside the car, but it uses quite a bit of fuel, so we'd advise you turn it off when it's not hot (on most cars the button has a snowflake symbol). If you ignored the law, you could shave a bit of time off your journey by travelling above the speed limit, particularly on long motorway trips. But, although you might arrive about 20 minutes early on a 200-mile trip by travelling at 80mph instead of 70mph, it's also a false economy. While the car is running for 20 minutes less, it uses much more fuel when it is travelling. That 20 minutes could cost you up to £7 extra in fuel. The lower the tyre pressure, the more fuel the car needs to move it down the road. We recommend that you take five minutes every fortnight to check the tyres."
5,Tax deductions to drive plant and equipment sales,autos-trucks," Tradies and small business owners appear to be the biggest winners as many flock to the shops to take advantage of the generous tax write-offs announced as part of the 2015 Federal Budget. Sales are already soaring as operators buy up big to replace old or damaged plant and equipment, computers, work vehicles, tools and more.

6,How to avoid truck blind spots,autos-trucks," Most Australians have become accustomed to driving in a congested mix of cars, bikes, trucks and buses. However, this familiarity means that over time many forget or choose to ignore the dangers when travelling close to trucks. Truck drivers do their best to drive safely on our roads, but all motorists have a responsibility to keep clear of truck blind spots and avoid the many other known dangers when driving with trucks. In this article, we give you several driver safety tips and teach you how to spot truck blind spots. Learn the truck blind spots A blind spot is where a driver loses sight of other vehicles. Trucks come in all shapes and sizes, but the one thing they all have is blind spots. Knowing the location and scope of these blind spots or danger zones can help you avoid catastrophe. Truck blind spots are: Directly behind the truck. On each side of the truck. Directly in front of the truck and extending into the left-hand lane. Beside the truck’s left door. The golden rule is: if you can’t see the driver’s face in his side mirrors, move quickly so you can. Don’t linger at the side of a truck Even though the law says to keep left unless overtaking, many motorists on the highway choose to ""sit"" in the middle lane. This practice puts everyone at risk, especially when people ""sit"" beside a truck in its blind spot. If the driver needs to change lanes for any reason, there could be big trouble. So, keep left and pass trucks decisively and safely. Pass safely Trucks need twice as much time and room to stop than cars do. That’s why you should never cut in front of a truck. Remember there’s a blind spot right in front! It’s a good idea to wait until the whole front of the truck is in your rear-view mirror before pulling in front. Avoid tailgating Tailgating is also a big no no. The driver can’t see you and you have no clue what’s happening up ahead. Back off until you can see both left and right side mirrors. Keep clear for wide left turns Truck drivers often need to swing wide to the right to make a left turn. Ignoring a truck’s indicators could see you squeezed between the truck and the curb.  Always pay attention to truck indicators, keep clear and give trucks room to turn. Other safety tips for drivers Here are a few other really useful tips to make sure your next encounter with a truck is a safe one: Always signal well in advance when stopping or turning, to give truck drivers ample time to avoid you. Deactivate cruise control when overtaking a truck. You will want to increase speed to pass and minimise time spent in a truck’s blind spot. Of course, ensure your higher speed is a safe speed. Be observant. Look at the truck’s mirrors to see if the driver sees you. Never cut in front of a truck that’s slowing down. Never walk around or drive around a truck that is reversing. Truck drivers, including those in the heavy haulage industry, do their part to make sure they drive safely. However, it is also the duty of other drivers to be keep clear of blind spots, give trucks room to move and drive safely and predictably.

9,How Power Steering Pump Functions in Your Car,autos-trucks," How Power Steering Pump functions in your Car A Car's Power Steering allows to steer the Car with little effort on the drivers abilities. Power Steerings works when a Car driver inputs a movement on the steering wheel, the hydraulic pump which is driven by the engine provides the wheels the much torque needed  to steer the vehicle easily in the required direction. Most Power Steering Systems rely on a hydraulic system to turn your Car's wheels as it is equipped with  rotary hydraulic pump that is driven by a belt from the main pulley of the engine at about twice the engines speed. This pump circulates highly pressurized Power Steering fluid towards the steering rack located under the vehicle between the front wheel, this fluid is designed to withstand about 1200 lbs of pressure without breaking down. A Power Steering Speed Sensor is attached to the transmission and senses the Car's speed, determining the degree of assistance to be provided by the system, so as speed increases, assistance decreases up-to 35 mph when there is no assistance provided and when speed decreases, the system provides increasing assistance until the Car has completely stopped. A Servotronic system is part hydraulic and part electric as a piston like device is attached to the Car's pinion. If the Servo's piston retracts, it turns the piston and the wheels in one direction so if it extends, it turns them in the other direction vice versa. A direct electrical linkage runs from the steering wheel to the Power Steering Control System which makes the whole process function. The Electrical Power Steering system uses electrically powered machinery to steer the Car's wheels so instead of a hydraulic Servo, an electrical motor is attached to the pinion and the wheel is attached to a Power Steering Control System, which relays the amount of electrical energy required to turn the Car's tires the specified angle and directs to the motor as specified. The entire process runs on Car battery and can cause the batteries to be replaced more often. A Car's Power Steering Pump uses special fluid to perform correctly similar to engine transmission fluid and should be changed on periodic basis. Most Car manufacturers suggest the fluid be changed after 40,000 miles of usage. An Electric Power Steering uses steering sensors to detect the position and rate of turn in the steering wheel. This information is fed to a Power Steering Control System, which in turn moves the steering shaft appropriately. Today's Cars have assisted Power Steering that activated and functions only when your Car is running. In the event of a malfunction in the Power Steering system the vehicle will become difficult to turn around as the much required assistance will be lost. Difficulty in steering may also occur if the Power Steering fluid levels is lower than required. Power Steering is a mechanical device and at times may have defects or failures. Car owners should inspect all hoses, clamps, and fluids on a regular basis for abnormalities. If a Power Steering device has signs of leakage or failure, it should be quickly inspected by a qualified mechanic. A dirty Power Steering fluid could contaminate the Power Steering Pump and cause permanent damage if left neglected for a longer time.

10,Adjustment and maintenance of chain,autos-trucks," Motorcycle chain is one of the most critical motorcycle accessories, it can be divided into sleeve chain, roller chain, O ring chain and silent chain.

The O-shaped sealed ring can protected lubricating grease in the chain isolated from dust and dirt. O ring chain There should have certain lubricating grease inside the bushing so as to reduce the wear out and extend its life. And with sealing O ring, it can protect the chain joint from mud and dust. How to adjust the best motorcycle chain properly? First, adjust the tightness of chain between 15 mm to 20 mm, check the buffer body bearing regularly and fill grease on time, because that bearing is always under bad working environment, once lose the lubrication performance, it will be damaged badly, bearing, once damaged, it will cause the rear sprocket lean, and damage the side face of chain, or even worse make the chain fall off easily. Second, when adjusting the chain, you need to adjust it according to the adjustment scale on the chain and also observe whether front and rear sprocket is aligned with the chain. if the frame or rear wheel fork is damaged and there will be deformation of the frame or rear fork, then adjustment by the scale will be not so correct because the linearity has been inaccurate, so now you need to check it and adjust it without the chain case. Once there is any problem, you need to correct it. Third, it is important to choose a high quality sprocket or chain, which can extend its life.Make sure chain matches the dirt bike sprocket or motorcycle sprocket, and also their concentricity, otherwise, chain will be from tight to loose and get damaged easily. DO not buy those defective product especially motorcycle sprocket, most of them are eccentric and out of round, which will cause the chain from tight to lost and put you in danger. Forth, you need to check frequently the tolerance clearance between buffer cushion of the rear wheel fork and fork shaft. And you need to make sure that the clearance between rear wheel fork and frame is precise enough so that it can move up and down flexibly, only in this way can guarantee the rear fork and frame to be a whole at the same time it won’t affect damping effect of the rear shock. Rear wheel fork is connected with frame through wheel fork shaft equipped with rubber cushion, this rubber cushion will be loose easily after usage for a period, then it will displace when the motorcycle starts or accelerates due to the pull of chain at the rear wheel,the displacement is decided by the extent of damage of the buffer cushion. The rear wheel will have obvious shake when accelerate and decelerate, which will also cause the damage of chain and sprocket and need to be checked regularly and more carefully. Finally, you need to clean chain and sprocket regularly and fill the lubricate in time, especially when it is rain and show or there is muddy road. Maintenance of chain and sprocket will extent its lift."

12,Independent Car Insurance Estimator,autos-trucks," Car insurance estimator is a free tool for you to calculate the average amount of insurance cost based on your personal data. Most major insurance companies provide such tools in their official websites, but you can also use the same tool from independent websites or insurance reviewers. You may think that estimators from independent reviewers are better because there will be no bias or any attempt to persuade you to purchase. It is probably right, but there are still some things you should know about the tool as listed below. • Independent car insurance estimator usually works on certain networks with a number of insurance companies. Each of those companies may provide the latest data about pricing and available discounts (with requirements for eligibilities). Every calculation is performed based on that data to minimize inaccuracy. However, insurers often change the base rate or discounts, and the calculator possibly does not have the most up-to-date information about those. • Good estimators can come up with multiple results from one calculation only. This means you can immediately compare the premium rates of insurance companies included in the network. It is necessary for you to make sure that at least two or three insurers within the network run their businesses in your state. • Every state has its own rules regulating auto insurance. Some companies have hundreds of branch offices spread across the nation in different states, and each branch office makes sure that the provided coverage complies with state’s law of insurance. An online car insurance estimator can provide multiple results for comparison purposes, but it can be useless if the network does not include any insurance company available in your state. • Please put in mind that car insurance estimator does not underwrite your policies. To some extent, such tool does not need to make sure that the calculation results are very accurate. Based on that, you will still need to contact insurance companies to make a purchase, or visit their official websites to get the actual quotes. • Online auto insurance calculator does ask you many questions about your address, types of car you drive, number of people to include in the policy, profession, marital status, age, and more. All those questions are merely basic requirements to determine your rate. When the time comes to make an actual auto insurance purchase, a company may send a representative to walk you through the process. Before everything is finalized, there are probably further questions asked, such as credit card score."

15,The future of Australian mining metals: liquid natural gas,autos-trucks," Of Australia's many natural resources, liquefied natural gas (LNG) has been a significant one. Still, there have been questions about the future of Australian national gas and what to expect as the years go by. David Ledesma of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies released a report last September on this very subject. The report showed that the industry had hit a few speed bumps along the way. For example, employment costs went up due to a shortage of skilled labour, and a number of employees decided to go on strike due to pay and improper working conditions. The report also points out a total of 7 big liquefied natural gas projects that have experienced delays, some over a year, which resulted in additional costs of some AUD$17 billion. Still, it's clear that the country is most definitely looking to take full advantage of its large gas reserves. Current LNG project spending accounts for over one third of Australia's total business investment. This massive investment stems from the discovery of a number of very large LNG reserves back in the mid-1990s. With the demand for natural gas on the rise internationally, energy companies now are rushing to take full advantage of those discoveries. Thus, these 7 new projects were born, and all should be operational sometime within the three years from 2015 to 2018. Among these projects are drilling units, which are needed for extracting the natural gas, and liquefied natural gas production plants, which make it much easier to export the gas to other countries, such as India or China. Once the projects are all up and operational, the contribution of LNG to the economy will dramatically increase. Right now, it's at about $AUD 12 billion, but by 2018 it's anticipated that LNG will contribute as much as $AUD 60 billion to Australia's economy. Though the lack of skilled workers has caused construction delays for some of these plants and drilling units. That has been partially due to the nature of the workers needed. The focus has been on the construction phase, but as 2018 approaches and the projects begin to switch from the construction phase into a more operational phase, the skill and employment needs will change. Thus, there should be a greater demand for operators and engineers. Evidence of this demand will be most clearly seen in the 1800 new engineering jobs that will be coming around over the next several years. There may have been a bit of a rocky start, but the future of LNG looks to be a bright one. Be sure to keep checking back for future articles in this ongoing series about the future of Australian mining metals. Check out our previous articles in the series, about copper, iron ore, and gold  for more information. For natural gas mining machinery that can really help you get the job done while at the same time keeping your returns maximised, contact National Plant and Equipment.

18,Auto Wheel Alignment the most misunderstood auto maintenance item?,autos-trucks," Most of us worry about running out of gas or having a belt or hose fail resulting in a breakdown on the side of the road. That is why we practice preventive maintenance on our vehicles — that and to keep the cost of driving down. But one important part of preventive maintenance that may get overlooked by most motorists is a periodic alignment inspection. Most people don't realize their car is out of alignment and even when the some of the symptoms like, minor uneven tire wear, your car  pulling a little to one side or the steering seems a little loose are evident.   A DMV study where they randomly inspected miscellaneous cars off the road found that 9 out of 10 cars needed a wheel alignment and the drivers weren't even aware of it. Alignment is a complex topic covering a variety of terms and a miscellany of parts. When your wheels are out of alignment, your tires aren't pointing in the right direction. This will affect your steering, brakes and suspension, but more importantly, it could affect your safety and the durability of your tires and all the parts controlling them. Having a car with badly aligned wheels leads to other connected problems. Your braking system does not work to optimal levels. The tendency to pull to one side due to uneven tires causes problems in the steering system. It also leads to uneven braking. Improper wheel alignments  will affect the suspension of your car. The suspension in a car is made up of complicated and delicately balanced parts, and it is important that it should be perfect, not to mention that changing/repairing your suspension could cost an awful lot. Correct alignment is much more than just keeping you tires straight on the road. Technologically advanced vehicles which have the following systems may experience warning lights and/or system shut down if your vehicle is out of proper alignment. (1) Traction Control Systems (2) Stability Control Systems (3) Variable or Dynamic Steering (4) Lane Assist (5) Adaptive Cruise Control It is very important to consider the safety factor too. Have you ever driven a car which pulls itself to one side all the time?  You probably know how difficult it is to drive on a wet or iced road even with perfectly aligned wheels. With badly aligned wheels, you are taking on unnecessary risk. Is it worth having an accident and endangering the lives of loved ones? It doesn't take much, that’s for sure, Alignment angles are measured in tenths and hundredths of degrees or inches. There are many ways for your car to lose its alignment. You’ll be familiar with most of the causes, but what you probably didn't think was that each one could do quite a number on your vehicle’s alignment. Wheel alignment can be thrown off by: (1) Pot holes (2) Hitting the curb (3) Bumping into concrete parking stalls (4) Driving on bumpier roads, such as gravel roads (5) Fair wear and tear  -  as vehicles age,    rubber components start cracking or lose their elasticity and ball and socket joints develop looseness. They start to give a little more, progressively getting slightly worse over time.  Worn control arm bushings, worn out shocks and struts can also be a serious problem with uneven tire wear. Cost of Not Having Your Alignment Checked Vs The Cost Of An Alignment When the wheels of the car are not aligned there is uneven pressure on the tires. They tend to push against each other. When that happens the car faces uneven friction and much more resistance from the road surface. This means that your car has to work that much harder to move forward and more fuel is burned than normal.    Improper alignment can reduce fuel efficiency by as much as 10% - about 29 cents per gallon. In addition, the tires can wear out more quickly.  That is a cost of about $187 per year in extra gas If your tires are bowed out of alignment by just .017 in., it's the equivalent of dragging your tire sideways for 5 miles for every 1,000 you drive. Depending on how severe the alignment is, you can take an 80,000 mile tire and wear it out in 40,000 miles. Obviously if you have an alignment that is severely out, you can wear the tires out in a couple thousand miles.  Cost could be an additional $30.00 per year.  In extreme cases and you go through 2 sets of tires in a single year that's an additional $400 cost you could of avoided by having an $80 alignment. When your wheels are out of alignment, the uncontrolled ride puts a strain on your steering and suspension including the shock absorbers and struts.  The cost to replace both front  Strut/Shock Absorbers is estimated by RepairPal.com to be between $354 and $866 for a 2012 vehicle depending on make and model.  It is recommended that you replace your shocks every 50,000 miles or about 4 years of normal driving.  Reducing the life by 25% due to misaligned wheels cost you on average $152.50.  In addition worn shocks don't just hamper driver comfort; they can harm overall suspension performance and reduce brake efficiency, cornering ability and anti-lock brake system effectiveness. So when shocks go bad, it's out with the old and in with the new. All told the damages (tires, fuel economy, suspension) from running your vehicle with misaligned wheels for a year could be  $369.50 per year or $30.80 per month.  This excludes the impact on latest advanced technology found on today's cars.  Keeping up with your wheel alignment service keeps your car running right. You reduce your risk of breaking down on the side of the road, which keeps you and your passengers safer while driving. The thumb rule is that you should get you wheels aligned once every 6000 miles or 6 months, whichever is earlier.  Your owner's manual to see how often the manufacturer recommends having this service.   You should also get your wheels aligned or at least checked by a professional if you have hit something large enough to cause alignment issues. Many repair shops like American Auto Air & Repair in Reno, NV will do a free alignment check if asked.  These courtesy checks do not include any adjustments but will make you aware of any misalignment issues that need to be addressed. After the initial check American Auto Air & Repair uses state of the art high-definition digital imaging wheel alignment technology and extensive training to insure that all the vehicles we align are brought back to precise manufacturers specifications ."

If the current city has higher crime rate than the previous one, your premium is likely to increase. However, it probably makes you drive less because you also work in an office at nearby area. •	Getting married: as stated above, married couple have fewer road accident records than their single counterparts •	New job: non stressful professions lead to relaxed driving which in turn decreases the likelihood of road accidents and you get less expensive premium rate."

2,12 Road Safety Tips You Probably Wouldn’t Think of,autos-trucks," We all know the basic road safety tips; buckle up, observe road signs, don't speed, watch for wildlife etc. etc., but here are 12 road safety tips that are a bit outside the box and you're not likely to think of. Although you may get a burst of energy from a sugar high, it’s short lived and you’ll feel more tired afterward. Choose a snack such as dried fruit, nuts, or a muesli bar which have a low GI, and drink plenty of water. Your foot is more likely to accidentally slip off the pedal if you’re wearing thongs or high heels. Despite common belief, it’s legal to drive barefoot – if you’re wearing slippery shoes take them off before you drive, or keep a backup pair of shoes in your vehicle that have good grip. Even if you drive a petrol vehicle, diesel pumps are often side by side which means there may be diesel spillage nearby.  Diesel is oilier than unleaded and could leave the soles of your shoes greasy, causing your foot to slip off the pedal. As awful as it is to think about striking and potentially killing an animal with your vehicle, police advise it’s safer to hit an animal than swerving to avoid it, which could easily lead to a serious crash. Consider protecting yourself and your vehicle with a bull or nudge bar. Surprisingly, 20% of drink drivers are caught between 6am and midday.  This could happen quite easily if you have had a heavy night of drinking, went to sleep late and got up early the next day to pick up your vehicle or drive to work.  Ensure you give yourself plenty of time after your last drink for the alcohol to pass through your system. Unfortunately each year there are accidents involving drivers who are hit whilst changing a tyre. Ensure you drive your vehicle slowly off the road, away from traffic, or if you’re on a highway, try to reverse your vehicle behind a safety barrier. Drive with your headlights on at all times to increase your chances of being seen, especially in areas with high pedestrian traffic or long, shady stretches. Don’t take a chance on causing an accident by trying to cut across lanes to make the turn off. Take the next exit or turn and enjoy the scenery. Don’t overload your vehicle’s roof rack – most cars can only handle between 60 to 100kg up there. Any heavier and it could damage the roof rails and start to affect how your car handles corners due to the raised centre of gravity. If your tyres have less than 1.4mm of tread depth you could find yourself in trouble – with the law or on the road. Many people measure tyre tread in the middle of the tyre, but if the edges are worn down further than 1.4mm, the vehicle is considered to be unroadworthy and dangerous. Wheel alignments and maintaining the correct tyre pressure will provide you with better vehicle handling and will increase the lifespan of your tyres.  Consider purchasing an aftermarket tyre pressure monitoring system (TPMS). Likely your trailer or caravan has been sitting in the weather for close to a year.  Get your axles and bearings checked and regreased or replaced – there is a good chance the axles may be rusty or the bearings seized. If you have an Apple iPhone, you can record emergency and health related details using the built-in Health app.  This means if you’re involved in an accident, emergency workers are able to access information about your allergies, blood type, and emergency contacts, even if your phone is locked.  Android users can download this App."

The pictures should give a clear description of the car. If possible, the buyer should be able to make decisions based on the photos which you shall have posted. Some of the most crucial parts you should feature in the advert include: all the exterior sections of the car; the engine section; the driver’s seat area; the stereo systems; the dashboard more so when the car is on; backseat; wheels and any other sections which you feel are important. In other words, you should put yourself in the buyers’ shoes. Assuming you are buying the car, which sections of the car would you like to see to make an informed decision? Price; you should be realistic as you set the price. Factors which should determine the price may include the age of the car and all the problems which you have learned to live with. You can also review other listings just to have a rough idea of the price. Do not be over ambitious when it comes to the amount of returns you expect. You need to decide on the mode of payment you will accept suppose you get a willing buyer."

Visibility of a motorist is impaired and there is intensified intensity of a blowing wind when it is snowing. The roads also become more like a skating rink. Thanks to these factors, the driver's capability to maneuver the automobile's movement is greatly reduced. Snowy roads ultimately end up being wet once the snow melts and consequently the slippery circumstances prevail too. During this time of year, vigilance is needed so as to thwart the injury and fatality rates along with the expenses related to accidents like traffic control, repair work of wrecked vehicles and also sky-rocketing insurance prices. Many auto collisions occur during this time of the year and there certainly are a variety of things that a person should know before setting out on snowy roadways. Ideally, you really should not actually head out anyway in this particular kind of weather. Checking of weather updates may not tend all that important but it is necessary in this sort of weather to prevent going out in a storm. Since the visibility on the road reduces significantly and the street becomes slick, it is a good option to allow even more distance between you and the car or truck ahead. It is without a doubt more difficult and virtually impossible to stop all of a sudden. In the event that the condition should become worse, it is much better to get off the roadway and wait until weather conditions improve.. The vehicle's conditions should also be checked before setting out in this kind of weather since mechanical fallout is an added downside. As a result, a person should take a look at pressure in the the tires once in a while. If the tires should get deflated during the course of a snow storm, then the trouble at hand can only get worse. The brake system must also be checked. Poor brakes and their failure can be disastrous especially on snowy roads since they are slick and slippery. The metal components in the brakes can decay resulting in a leakage. Inspection of the brake fluid is also necessary. Windshield wiper blades are important during a snowy weather condition due to the diminished visibility. Before setting out in the snowy weather condition, checking of the wiper blades to make sure they are still working properly is fundamental. Replacement of windshield wiper blades is necessary after every few months and keeping them clear of debris and ice is also very important. Defrosters are equally as critical to visibility especially when things are frozen. They aid in thawing the windshield by heating the air coming through the ventilation system. A person should also check on lights before setting out on a snowy roadway. This is important since it makes it possible for one to see the other cars. Nevertheless, it is a good idea not to blindly follow another motorist if the headlights should stop working. If the other car should slip into a ditch, the very same fate waits for you. If a collision should happen, you should take your car or truck to a trusted auto body collision service center for a price quote to ascertain whether the damage is repairable or if you should take into consideration getting a new vehicle."
6,The True Cost of Ignoring Vehicle Maintenance,autos-trucks," Cost of ignoring maintenance of your vehicle has its price and that price can be costly.   Let’s look at the cost of not taking care of your car based on The shorten life of your car Repairs caused by skipping routine maintenance Being stranded on the side of the road The unplanned charge to your Visa · Fluids, spark plugs, filters, belts & hoses, brakes and your transmission all need routine maintenance. ""If you don't maintain your car, you're taking a vehicle that might have been driven for 200,000 miles over its life, and you're knocking it down to maybe 150,000 miles,"" says Philip Reed, author of ""Strategies for Smart Car Buyers"" at Edmunds.com.  A National Car Care Month inspection yield the following results 85% of all vehicles inspected needed some repair or maintenance thus U.S. Department of Transportation reports an average car lasts about 13 years and 145,000 miles before its scraped.  In dollars and cents based on Kelly Blue Book Values depreciation for the first 150,000 miles is about $.16 per mile and for the next 50,000 is $.046 per mile.  Or in terms of the resale value you would lose about $231 for all those extra miles if you maintained your car. In terms of money, the cost is over 2 billion dollars each year due to neglect (not performing preventive maintenance). Data collected from National Car Care Month inspections shows the percentage of cars that failed and the reasons why vehicles failed inspection. o   Engine Oil - low level or dirty 30% o   Transmission Fluid - low level/dirty 26% o   Brake Fluid - low level or dirty 23% o   Power Steering Fluid - low level/dirty 21% o   Coolant - contaminated or worn out and needing to be flushed 20% o   Air Filter - dirty and needing replacement 24% o   Belts - damaged, cracked and needing replacement 19% o   Hoses - damaged, cracked and needing replacement 17% What would an inspection of your vehicle show?  If you not had them checked recently don’t be so quick to answer. If you have low or dirty fluids, damaged or cracked belts and hoses what could be the cost?  Let's take a look. Imagine this scenario: You haven’t changed your oil in a while because you didn’t think you could afford it. Your car just dies one day so you get it towed to your mechanic. After inspecting your vehicle, he or she determines that it ran out of oil and the engine has seized. Your only options are to replace your engine or replace your car.  An average sedan driven 100,000 miles as an example, oil changes would cost about  $1,125 overall. If you were to go without an oil change during that period, your engine would likely flood with contaminants and eventually seize. The result, an engine replacement that hovers around $4,000. Brake Maintenance - Cost of skipping: Expensive rotor or drum replacement.  Example: Your car starts creating abnormal sounds, feelings or smells, and you don’t get your brakes fixed, then first you wear down the things squealing that are telling you that your brakes are toast. Then you will be out of brake pad and will only stop by your brake system pressing the metal backing plate on a metal brake rotor. If you continue to ignore the problem, you will continue to burn through your brake rotor down to its ventilating fins. It will sound, feel and perform terribly. When you finally fix the problem, it will cost significantly more since you have destroyed several parts, it will cost you 4 to 5 times as much to fix. If you don't get it fixed you will likely end up in a bad accident making you part of the 5.2% of all motor vehicle accidents that could have been prevented with proper vehicle maintenance. Belts and hoses  – Cost of skipping: The tow to the nearest garage, and cost of replacing the belt/hose plus any additional damage done  when the belt or hose came apart.   Don’t forget the Belt Tensioner, if you hear a squealing noise when the car accelerates and your belts look good it could mean, the belt tensioner is worn and in need of immediate replacement. If the belts can’t be held tight it’s like having no belt at all.  Many vehicles a single serpentine belt and if it breaks that means the water pump quits circulating coolant through the engine, the alternator quits producing amps, the power steering pump ceases to assist steering, and the air conditioner quits cooling. The cost to replace a serpentine belt before it breaks would be around $125.00 depending on the belt. The cost after it breaks time and money, drive belt manufactures recommend that all drive belts be replaced on a four year basis that way the replacement can be done at your convenience rather than on an emergency basis. Spark plugs and filters  - Cost of skipping: Damaged catalytic  converter, failed emissions test, poor performance, engine misfires during acceleration, hard starting and the mother of all undesirables lousy gas mileage.  If you drive 12,000 miles per year and lose 1.5 miles per gallon (a 7.5% loss at 20 MPG) it would cost you over $350.00 in additional fuel cost.   Replacing a catalytic converter upwards of  $800.00.  Replacing a dirty air filter can cost as little as $20, but if you neglect to replace it, this can cause an oxygen-sensor failure that will cost as much as $250 to repair. Replacing Timing Belt at recommended intervals - Cost of skipping: Damaged valves and pistons.  The death of many older or high mileage cars is nothing other than a failure of the timing belt.  With little space between the valves and pistons, a slip or break in the belt can send a piston flying into an open valve. When this happens, it is similar to the engine self-destructing, as it will soon become nothing more than an unusable mess of metal.   This means that your car will suddenly stop running and you will not be able to get it started again.  In all cases, this means calling a tow truck to come pick up your now non-running vehicle.  And again for many the result, an engine replacement that hovers around $4,000. Other Fluids - All the fluids in your vehicle can breakdown over time, change in molecular structure, become less effective because of contaminates and fail to perform as they were intended.   Routine maintenance for some is just inspection while others need to be completely removed (flushed) and replaced. Just draining most fluids leaves a substantial amount of old fluid behind.  The cost for not performing the recommended maintenance is the premature failure and expensive replacement of one or more components of the system the fluid was meant to protect. o   Coolant - Not changing it frequently enough can cause your coolant to ""wear out"" or cause a breakdown of the coolant's chemical properties. Over time rust and scale deposits build up within the radiator and these build ups can cause overheating or even damage your radiator and reduce the life of the water pump from excessive friction and heat. o   Transmission - Transmission fluid is oil, and is therefore subject to viscosity breakdown and the loss of its protective, lubricating, and cooling properties. Operating the transmission on fluid that is worn out results in premature transmission wear and ultimately failure. o   Transfer case or differential  - Without routine inspection you would miss fluid with metal flakes that indicates internal wear or that is black indicating it has been overheated.  The sooner you have the cause diagnosed the lower the cost of repair. o   Power steering – If the power steering fluid is not inspected regularly for evidence of metal flakes, you may miss the signs of internal wear, which could cause the need to replace the steering gear as well as the power steering pump. o   Brake - If the brake fluid is not inspected regularly for changes in color, you could miss an early warning sign of a brake malfunction. You also need to keep a close eye on brake fluid because it is hydroscopic in nature, meaning it absorbs moisture, which reduces the effectiveness of the fluid leading to premature brake failure o   Time: Where will you be headed when the belt/hose blows, (a hot date, to work, pick up your kids or get your mother-in-law to the airport) what will it cost you not to not get to your destination?    What if you're on a driving vacation or business trip you could be stuck for days waiting for the right part to arrive. o   Safety: Where will you be when your car breaks down from a preventable problem? Of all motor vehicle accidents 5.2% can be attributed to mechanical defects due to neglected vehicle maintenance that translates to eleven people injured every hour and one person dies every three hours due to accidents that could have been prevented. o   Being Nagged At:  What will it be like being stuck on the side of the road or when you get the call back for your mechanic and tells you the cost of a preventable repair while your significant other reminds you of what you didn’t do to take care of the car. Bottom Line True Cost – A large unplanned charge to your Visa card.  Where as routine maintenance would have meant - small budgeted expenses.  Research has shown that nearly 20 percent of the vehicles on the road today have a worn belt that needs to be replaced, and nearly 15 percent of vehicles have a hose that needs to be replaced (Auto Pro Workshop). A broken belt is always bad news because when it snaps, all drive power to whatever it turns is lost and the cost of a tow to the nearest garage of at least $75.00 plus the cost of the belt. In the United States, in terms of money, the cost is over 2 billion dollars each year due to neglect (not performing preventive maintenance).   Would you prefer small expenditures over time on your schedule or large costs ($$$$) when your car decides, it’s your choice."
7,The future of Australian mining metals: iron ore,autos-trucks," Iron ore is one of Australia's most abundant resources, as well as being one of the country's most valuable exports. As one of the world's major iron ore producers, Australia boasts the world's largest iron ore EDR at 25%. Considering these facts, there is still huge exploration potential for this metal, which looks set to continue as an important commodity for the country. At National Plant & Equipment, as suppliers of iron ore mining machinery we're naturally interested in the future of iron ore mining. Here we take a look at this resource and the direction it will take in the foreseeable future. OVERVIEW There are three different types of iron ore - hematite, goethite, and magnetite. Most of the iron ore produced in Australia is of the hematite and goethite varieties, which has been good news for the industry as it is these types that are favoured by steel mills, thanks to the high grade iron they contain. Since the 1960s, when an export ban was lifted, iron ore has been a growing industry for Australia. This culminated in the mining construction boom that began in 2010, which has now been tapering off since 2013. MARKET SHIFTS Only a few years ago, iron ore was at the forefront of the mining boom, with the metal overtaking coal as Australia's most valuable export in 2010. However, this prosperity couldn't last, and unfortunately iron ore was also a major factor in the downturn of the mining industry. Through spiralling prices of the metal, investors quickly lost confidence and dragged the rest of the industry down with them. However, things haven't been as bad as expected, and we're now seeing a revival and stabilisation of the market. It's likely that we will now see this sector heading upwards once more, and it's expected that industry revenue will rebound. In fact, over the last financial year, iron ore miners added $65 billion to their value - during a period when it's expected that prices will fall in this sector. INDUSTRY DEMAND The revival of the iron ore mining industry is in most part thanks to increased demand from China, which has always been insatiable for natural resources. The fate of the industry is tied to demands from the country, and will be heavily influenced by steel trends here, as well as by their price negotiations with the Japanese. We're currently seeing an upswing in investment from China at the moment, thanks to their iron ore inventories having been very low for the many months. They're now restocking in record levels, and this purchasing is expected to continue in order to keep their steel mills running. OTHER FACTORS The fact that the Australian dollar is fairly weak at the moment will also have an effect on the iron ore industry, benefiting domestic miners over producers of the metal in other countries. However, it's too soon to be overly optimistic about prices. Despite such positive projections, one setback is the ongoing skills shortage that the country is currently facing. This will continue to push up wage rates, which will naturally shorten the sector's profits. While we can't expect another boom to match that of 2010, the future of iron ore largely looks promising. With ongoing mining exploration within this sector, and an upturn in industry demand, we should begin to see the metal return to some of its former glory as one of Australia's major exports."
8,How to optimize your urban mobility,autos-trucks," As we live in a fast-paced environment, we have to cope with day-to-day strict demands that require impeccable time management. In order to do so and thereby manage our time in a proper manner, effective transportation from one place to another is of the essence. Cars are no longer a reliable alternative, as the time spent in traffic has significantly increased over the years. Public transportation is pretty much the same as it was before, lacking radical positive changes in terms of effectiveness and comfort for passengers. So what can you do in order to be able to reach your destination in a fast, safe and fun fashion without having to waste precious time in never-ending traffic jams? One contemporary and extremely efficacious alternative is the fully portable electric scooter, a vehicle with stunning power consumption, zero emissions, fuel and pollution. But which are the exact features that make the eco-friendly electric scooter an optimal solution to the needs of urban population? First and foremost, it’s the most economical, practical and the lightest way to move around. How? Well, the power consumption of only 6.15 W/km at 20 km/h speed speaks for itself and is an undeniable guarantee of a quality riding experience. Second of all, it is entirely safe and stable, as it displays a magnetic braking system which prevents friction from happening. Moreover, at only 10.5 kg it is the lightest electric scooter ever emerged on the market. So now it’s easier to understand why this electric scooter is the right alternative and the proper mode of transportation that will allow people to take their urban mobility at a higher level. Of course, there are some voices that also include bikes on the list of truly effective means of transportation, but this statement stands when comparing them with cars or buses. In comparison to the electric scooter, bikes rank second due to a wide range of reasons. Let’s just think about the fact that the electric scooter is today fully portable and foldable, allowing the user to fold, carry and store it anytime and anywhere he wants. Thanks to its size and weight and thanks to the revolutionary folding system, users have the opportunity to place the vehicle under the desk of their offices, in a locker and even in their suitcases. And let’s face it, these are things you can’t normally do with a bike. All in all, the electric scooter represents an entirely reliable solution to help commuters, working individuals or strollers optimize their urban mobility. It is fast, it is light and foldable so that people can carry and store it in a truly convenient manner and it is fun to ride. Furthermore, it is equipped with a modern shock absorber that will provide each and every user with a completely safe and worry-free riding experience. The advantages are numerous and at the same time quite alluring, determining more and more purchases from a wide range of buyers."

11,Aluminum Cars,autos-trucks," Multiple vehicle manufacturers incorporate aluminum into their process, sometimes only superficially for exterior parts and panels, while others use it more comprehensively both for the exterior and the internal structure. The reason for aluminum being such a widely used material in the manufacturing industry is due to a few contributing factors; such as its lightweight. The less weight there is attached to a vehicle, the more efficiently it is able to accelerate, and the more fuel efficient it will be as it then requires less energy for the same performance. Aluminum is corrosion resistant, meaning it will weather the elements better. Everyone who has ever owned a car will understand what a huge relief that would be in terms of car maintenance. Aluminum is also very sustainable from a recycling point of view, saving on energy and resources, recycling are a great idea to help promote sustainability and create a better environment for living in. Being rather pliable, aluminum is also easily shaped and formed to various shapes. This makes it great in the manufacturing industry. For a metal with such a light weight, aluminum is fantastically resilient due to its high torsional rigidity, or resistance to twisting which for obvious reasons makes it the perfect solution for vehicles. Also due to its predictability during collision situations which helps vehicle designers to build the car in such a way that the impact is mostly directed around the car and avoids the occupants to a large degree. While aluminum does also present its own disadvantages and challenges these can be overcome.  Painting aluminum is rather challenging, but when you consider that aluminum oxidizes but does not rust, repairing a scratch or dent on your car is far less urgent. Also, when heated I does not produce harmful emissions like PVC does. Aluminum also as an aesthetic appeal and can create a sleek and sophisticated image. It is a slightly more expensive material to use than its competitors but in the long run it may pay off better, if you save on repairs, not to mention that you simply cannot put a price on human life. Using aluminum in the manufacture process can make a vehicle safer while it still remains an easier element to work with due to its flexibility in taking shape. Many car manufacturers refuse to consider aluminum a viable option due to its lightweight. Fuel and oil companies are generally the majority shareholders at vehicle manufactures. Producing a very light car will drop its fuel consumption, and oil companies will not appreciate this. Aluminum is a versatile resource used in many industries for its various advantages over other metals. It is a great metal to incorporate into your home if you are building or renovating too, or if you need some added security, burglar guards and security gates are a great option. Aluminum is also used for shower frames, sliding doors, window bars and frames, all door frames among many others."

13,"Mercedes’ E 220 BlueTEC Delivers Power, Smooth Operation And Fuel Economy",autos-trucks," While the driving dynamics, comfort and pleasure characteristic of the German luxury carmaker are there, the latest E 220 BlueTEC also underscores the environmental credentials of the E-Class, emitting just 128 grams of CO2 per kilometre. The E 220 BlueTEC’s drive system is powered by a 4-cylinder diesel engine with direct injection. Mercedes says the engine combines qualities which were previously considered incompatible - maximum tractive power and smooth operation - while at the same time operating on minimal fuel consumption. Mercedes refers to the E-Class as the ‘efficiency class’, offering superior driving pleasure with fuel economy. It says 4.9 litres of diesel will get the E 220 BlueTEC a distance of 100 kilometres (NEDC combined) and its CO2 emission level of 128 grams per kilometre betters any other vehicle in the segment. As a result, the E 220 BlueTEC already meets the future Euro 6 emissions standard. Among competitors of the E 220 BlueTEC are the 2014 BMW 535d and 2014 Audi A6 TDI Diesel. The BMW features an inline six-cylinder turbocharged 3.0-litre engine that delivers a smooth and quiet ride that can make one forget the vehicle’s a diesel, while the Audi has lag-free power delivery that nicely complements its imperturbable feel and sense of unmatched solidity and makes for satisfying back-road running and easy handling in traffic. Fuel-efficient the E 220 BlueTEC is. Yet it’s also gutsy, generating 177 horsepower and impressive torque of 400 Newton-metres. Acceleration from 0 to 100 kilometres per hour is in 8.4 seconds and top speed is 227 kilometres per hour. The latest model features a 7G-TRONIC PLUS automatic transmission that’s been optimized with respect to driving comfort and consumption, and there’s an ECO start/stop function that ensures the engine is temporarily switched off when the vehicle is at a standstill. The 4-cylinder diesel powerplant with two output levels that sits under the hood of the E 220 BlueTEC is significantly more powerful, frugal and cleaner than comparable predecessors. BlueEFFICIENCY technologies were used to achieve the greatest possible environmental compatibility, says Mercedes. The common-rail diesel technology features up to 2000 bar of increased injection pressure, optimized combustion chambers and fast, precisely switching injectors. Fast-acting ceramic glow plugs help to improve cold-running properties. The high torque available in all engine speed ranges is thanks to the high ignition pressure and two-stage supercharging, while two Lanchester balancer shafts help to guarantee the required smoothness of operation."
14,How the Audi Quattro Changed History,autos-trucks," Even the most bombastic phrases about how the original Audi Quattro, or the Ur-Quattro is a true legend in the world of rallying can’t be considered an overstatement.  This titan surely massively influenced the revolutionizing of the whole industry in its 11 years of production. The world got to see the first Audi Quattro in the 1980 Geneva Motor Show, where the first four-wheel-drive sports car shined like a star with its unprecedented all wheel drive performance of reaching 100 km/h in just 7.1 seconds and its unequalled road-holding. It was in the late 70s when the history of the Quattro began. Jörg Bensinger, Audi’s chassis engineer returned inspired from a trip to Finland, where he saw the impressive performance on snowy roads of the Iltis, Volksagen’s powerful four-wheel-drive truck-like vehicle, developed for forestry and the army in Germany. He got the idea of developing a similar all-wheel drive variant of this for the Audi 80 and proposed it to Walther Treser, the Pre-Development Director of the German automobile manufacturer. Treser was convinced and soon a prototype was created and tested until it finally received VW’s management board approval for production in March 1980. Its price was just as hot as its features: 50,000 DM. That was more than double the price of a Coupe GT, built on the same shell. The differences were, however, uncontestable.  An incredible 200 hp turbocharged engine, two lockable differentials, Audi 200 brakes, permanent all-wheel drive and soldier-like resistance in all conditions set this incredible car apart.  More than 11,000 units were soon sold. When the Quattro entered its first World Rallying Competition, it was certain that the rally world would never be the same. The winning Quattro became a global sensation, while its driver, Michele Mouton marked also her own revolution, becoming the first woman in the world to win a WRC. The victories kept coming and by 1986 Audi Quattro won a total of 23 World Rally Championships. With such an impressive history, no wonder the brand still takes the Quattro to all sorts of motorsports events, promoting its heritage, and celebrating the legacy left behind by the model three decades later.  Indeed, if there is one car that can truly illustrate Audi’s slogan ""Vorsprung durch Technik"", loosely translated as ""progress through technology"", that is the Quattro."

18,Go Auto Insurance - Specific Offers for Specific Needs,autos-trucks," Bundled insurance coverage for house, health, life, and car often gives cost-saving benefit, but some people simply choose to separate their policies because this can often provide better quality of services, for example with auto insurance. Being an insurance company that specifically offers auto insurance policies, Go Auto Insurance does not even sell coverage for motorcycle, boat, or any other type of vehicle. It specializes in providing coverage for all car drivers in Arkansas. Moreover, it is also different from most companies in this industry because it is a family-oriented company which does not publicly trade their shares. Based on those two characteristics, there are plenty of great benefits for customers, including but not limited to the following: One of the biggest benefits of purchasing auto insurance only without bundling it with other policies is the possibility to personalize more options, for example the quotes and payment. Since Go Auto Insurance only sells coverage policies for cars, customers are able to adjust their options without any additional fees. In most cases, there are always less restricting rules about how you pay, or what types of coverage to purchase, and other limitations commonly found in bundled insurance. You may find yourself in a situation where an insurance agent is determined to persuade you to purchase the insurance from a particular company. The main reason is that the agent may earn some commissions for every sale they make. Go Auto Insurance does have agents, but they are non-commissioned, meaning you only pay for what you get without additional fee for the services provided by the agents. As mentioned earlier, Go Auto Insurance only offers coverage policies for cars. This mindset allows the company to easily focus on a specific field so that everything is handled properly without involving any complexity of a bundled insurance. More than that, all processes from asking for quotes, making a purchase, to filing a claim are simple for customers. Bundled insurance, in one way or another, tends to lead customers to give less detailed attentions to every policy they have. Go Auto Insurance does not deal with any other type of policy, allowing you and the company to discuss and handle all matters more specifically which often leads to better results for both parties."
19,What is Geofencing and How is it Used for IVMS?,autos-trucks," Geofencing is a technology that defines a virtual boundary around a real-world geographical area. A geofence can be dynamically generated—as in a radius around a mine site or office, or a geofence can be a predefined set of boundaries (i.e. school zones or neighbourhood boundaries). Geofencing is an integral part of In Vehicle Management System (IVMS) (also known as GPS tracking or Telematics) hardware and software. It allows system users to draw zones around places of work, client sites and high risk, dangerous or secure areas. Geofencing can be a valuable tool. Examples of situations where it may be utilised include: Example: Could be used to ensure employees avoid construction zones or environmentally protected areas. Example: Speed limits can be associated with certain areas such as a school zone or worksite. Example: May be used to verify that driver routes are followed or that certain KPIs are met. Example: Aids employees in avoiding unsafe areas such as a train line or explosive area at a mine site. Example: When a car is parked with the ignition off, it can be programmed to put up a geofence.  Should the vehicle move from that geofence the user or operator will be notified. Notification Integration Options There are many ways that geofence-related notifications can be incorporated into an IVMS system. Events and notifications can be programmed to be automatically sent via email or SMS to multiple parties. Various criteria can be set up (i.e. when an employee enters or exits a certain area a notification is sent to the operations manager, or if a no-go zone is breached, management is notified) IVMS can be connected to trigger an audible or visible warning in-cab to create driver awareness (i.e. if a driver enters a high risk area, they will be warned with a flashing light or buzzer) In high risk areas IVMS can be programmed to report more often for added safety and security Electronic notifications usually includes the time, date and location that the virtual boundary was crossed, allowing for an immediate investigation or response to the situation. Geofencing Benefits Aside from just being a way to track activity within a specific geographical location, geofencing is a powerful tool for: Improving driver safety and awareness Establishing driver accountability Streamlining daily operations Increasing overall company productivity Tracking inventory and high valued assets For more information on IVMS geofencing, please contact a JCA Fleet Services team member at +61 8 6254 3833 or visit our website."
20,Prevent Dangerous Driving with IVMS,autos-trucks," As an employer, it’s not only important to ensure the safety of all employees on the road, but to prevent any unnecessary costs associated with dangerous or careless driving. This is why many are turning to In Vehicle Management Systems, also known as telematics or GPS tracking. IVMS allows users, whether that’s an owner or fleet management, immediate insight into their fleet’s driving activities, therefore enabling real-time identification of dangerous, at risk driving behaviour. At risk driving behaviour can include anything from speeding, excessive engine revving, harsh braking, rapid acceleration, freewheeling or entry of dangerous or high risk geofenced areas. This insight allows users to first and foremost address the risky driving behaviour.  Once employees know their driving is being regularly monitored and at-risk behaviour is being addressed, employees will tend to drive more carefully. In addition, IVMS offers users the ability to: Communicate proactively with drivers by way of an in-cab warning system.  Alerts can be audible (i.e. buzzer) or visual (i.e. flashing light) to inform a driver when they have broken a safe driving rule such as speeding or harsh braking. This system is excellent for promoting driver awareness, and over time, these warnings will improve driving habits and break the bad ones. Report on driving behaviour.  Users can create custom reports or utilise existing templates to visually illustrate risky driving habits such as speeding or unauthorized vehicle use. Notify management if a safety parameter is breached or an accident occurs. IVMS can be programmed to send various parties an automatic email or SMS alert if a driver is, for example, not wearing their seatbelt, is swerving between lanes, or braking harshly. Accident Reconstruction Unfortunately, despite proactive efforts, accidents can still occur. IVMS software allows users to recreate an accident to identify what happened and who was responsible.  Information evaluated includes the vehicle speed versus GPS speed (used to identify wheel spin), RPM, both X and Y axis of the accelerometer (details vehicle’s movements from front to back and side to side), and the driver involved. This valuable information will allow you to respond quickly to the incident, and depending on the outcome, provide 'no-fault' evidence for insurance coverage purposes. There are many In Vehicle Management Systems on the market with varying features and capabilities.  When looking for an IVMS provider, ensure you take the time to identify your core requirements beforehand. This will aid you in selecting the best possible system for your organisation, in order to increase employee safety and better protect your assets."

1,2014 Honda Civic,autos-trucks," 2014 Honda Civic The 2014 Honda Civic is poised to be the most popular compact car of 2014. The 2012 and 2013 Civic models sold exceptionally well despite lacking some of the creature comforts and tech improvements of Honda's competitors. It's impressive that Honda's name can consistently deliver a popular product even when it doesn't match up to what other compact cars can offer. The last two Civic models brought only disappointment to many people. Sure, they delivered on the impressive reliability and efficiency that Honda is known for. The 2012 and 2013 models are sure to be on the road for years. Unfortunately, they lacked the refinements other compact cars were getting at the same time. Honda has finally updated the Civic for the second decade of the 21st century. Styling, interior design, and performance have all improved to levels that match or surpass the competition. The 2014 Honda Civic is going to make many compact car buyers happy. It's the car for you if you are looking for a strong reputation for reliability, safety, and efficient driving—a reputation that boosts resale values. You'll also enjoy the variety of models in the lineup. From a more sport-oriented trim to an ""economy"" model, the Civic can provide it all. If utility is the name of the game, you need to look at a different type of car all together. The 2014 Honda Civic can't match the utility of hatchback style vehicles. It's still a compact car—not the best for cargo space or hauling multiple people. So what exactly is new? The 2014 Civic is new on the outside. The front end is more angular, with a sport-sleek style that yells ""performance,"" even if the economy-minded engine can't deliver. You also get a new touch screen display in the more expensive trim levels (EX and above). There is also a much-improved CVT (Continuously Variable) automatic transmission option, push-button start, and a smart blind-spot watching display. Styling: Interior and Exterior The Civic does offer some utility on the inside. Honda claims ""ample room for 5 passengers,"" however, it will really seat 4 comfortably. Cargo hauling capacity is bolstered by 60/40 split rear seats that help accommodate gear of different shapes and dimensions. You can trust that Honda has compact car interior design mastered—compact car design has been their big draw for years. The 2014 Honda Civic is no different. Every trim level also includes a color multifunction display, rearview camera, and USB connectivity. Honda's new dashboard technology and display is a big upgrade over older models. All important driver information is located just above the dash, a more user-ready feature that provides access to anything you would want to know at a quick glance, a helpful distraction eliminator. If you decide on the EX trim, you'll get a power moon roof, automatic climate control, 16-inch alloy rimmed wheels, Honda's new blind spot monitor, keyless entry, and pushbutton start. The LX trim level includes standard heated leather front seats—an area where Honda is finally catching up and realizing that people want comfort in compact cars. We already mentioned the sporty exterior look—it really stands out. Last year, Honda redesigned the exterior and the results were far from spectacular. The 2014 model has much improved front and rear styling. There is a new grille, larger front bezels for the lights, a lifted trunk lid, and more aggressive wheel design. Performance Notes The 2014 Honda Civic has more power, better fuel economy, and much improved body control. The DX, EX, and LX trim models all come with a 1.8L SOHC i-VTEX 4-cylinder engine that puts out 143 horsepower thanks to a new exhaust system. The impressive CVT transmission is far better than the old 5-speed automatic. CVT is a $1,300 option and the LX and EX models and standard on the Touring model. The DX model only has the 5-speed manual option. Because the CVT increases the gearing ratios and lightens the car compared to the old transmission, fuel economy is pretty good. City numbers aren't impeccable at 7.1 to 6.7 Litres/100km, but highway mileage is more than adequate at 5.0 Litres/100km. The Civic Si, Honda's sport-oriented Civic variant, comes with a more powerful 2.4L, DOHC i-VTEC engine that emits 205 horsepower. The included transmission is a 6 speed manual in the Si model. Handling is excellent. The 2014 Civic has a new suspension design that responds faster and introduces more ""feel"" than previous models. It offers excellent response if you want it while minimizing the bumps you experience along the road. Is the 2014 Civic Your Next Car? If you're in the market for a compact car and you want the proven reliability and resale value that Honda consistently provides, the 2014 Civic might be the best car for you. Honda definitely put some thought into designing a car that can do  more than keep up with the competition. Interior design, comfort features, and technology is ahead of post competitor models. Performance is adequate and cargo space is excellent for a small vehicle. Perhaps most importantly, the price is right. The DX model with 5-speed manual transmission starts at $15,690. It's hard to beat that considering the standard tech features that are included. $18,495 will get you the LX trim level, at which point you can opt for the continuously variable transmission. You'll also find heated seats. The EX starts to creep into mid-size sedan price territory at $20,560. Both the Touring and Civic Si are a touch over $25,000—the Si is the most expensive Civic you can get. The 2014 Honda Civic is a proven, safe, and reliable performer that will likely top the compact car market once again. Year after year the Civic has been one of Canada's best selling cars. The 2014 model really shows us why. After a disappointing 2012 and 2013 model year that left some wondering if Honda could stay at the top, the 2014 model demonstrates Honda's ability to consistently revise their cars to match what drivers expect."
2,Replacing Excavator Components: OEM or Aftermarket Parts?,autos-trucks," When it’s time to replace a major excavator component, there are many options available. From the growing list of dealers who supply excavator parts, to the variety of products to choose from, it’s a challenge to know what’s best. Speaking from experience, OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) parts are the way to go. Buying OEM means a promise of quality and longevity, which is likely to save you money in the long run. True OEM components are, just as the name implies, constructed by the same manufacturer as the part they are intended to replace.  Replacement parts that are OEM are available are in several forms, with widely variable cost to the buyer. The most expensive choice is to buy a brand new part sold by official dealers of the manufacturer. A more economical option is for buying OEM parts are purchasing used or rebuilt OEM parts that have been salvaged from dismantled equipment. Used parts are removed, examined and if in reasonable condition are often sold just as they are. Otherwise, the parts may be rebuilt, which involves more extensive labour and materials and as such, cost more than a used component. However, a component that has been completely rebuilt should be almost or as good as new, and will generally come with a warrantee. Aftermarket excavator parts are not necessarily a bad product. In theory, many aftermarket excavator components are built to meet OEM specifications, but in reality, the quality is inconsistent. This disadvantage is a result of different workmanship and place of origin. As a buyer, it is difficult to attain this background information and so it can be a risk. In particular, low quality materials that wear easily as well as improper workmanship may cause the part to fail prematurely, resulting in the need to replace it again sooner than expected. Saving money today may mean spending more money tomorrow. In the end, buying aftermarket may not be the best long term solution. Often, the label OEM is used in a misleading fashion to market aftermarket parts. For instance, the phrase ""Meets OEM standards"" is a commonly used to market such products, and can be confusing for buyers and provides a false sense of security. The claim that an aftermarket part meets OEM standards may or may not be true, and when the supplier is essentially unknown, how can you trust that what they are marketing is the truth? Companies constructing aftermarket parts have much less accountability than original manufacturing companies, and do not always fully meet these standards as promised. Secondly, adhering to OEM standards does not make the product OEM, nor does it guarantee the same quality in all regards. There’s no doubt that the term OEM is sometimes used to misrepresent aftermarket parts. Many dealers are simply resellers who are misinformed by suppliers. And worse yet, some sellers don’t really care if what they are selling is a true OEM part or not. Worst of all are the dealers who knowingly misrepresent parts as OEM when they are not. So how do you know you are truly getting OEM parts instead of a cheaper imitation? The only way to know for sure is to purchase your trustworthy source. Dealers who dismantle used excavators and/or rebuild components for resale are a safe bet. Such companies keep an inventory of excavator parts that are OEM, without question. This is where to buy true and reliable OEM excavator parts that are built to last. V.I. Equipment is a trusted source of OEM excavator parts. Our industry knowledge and experience is the key to providing customers with OEM excavator parts with proven quality and longevity. We are always dismantling many models of Caterpillar, John Deere and Hitachi excavators and our expert mechanics rebuild our components on-site.

4,What You Need to Know about Contacting Your Provider of Motorbike Insurance When Your Bike Is Stolen,autos-trucks," While no one wants to believe that someone would steal their bike, the fact is that this unfortunate type of event occurs all of the time. Even if you take as many precautions as possible, you can still become the target of a thief who steals your bike, leaving you without a ride. The fact is that vehicles of this type are easy to steal, especially for an established thief. Do You Have Coverage for Theft of Your Bike? In the UK, coverage for theft of your bike is generally included in your insurance plan. You should be able to check your documents (online or in paper format) to determine whether or not you have this type of coverage. Alternatively, you can also contact your provider and find out if you do. Even if you have coverage for bike theft, it is still your responsibility to protect it from the likelihood of being stolen. When Should You Contact Your Provider of Motorbike Insurance When Your Bike Is Stolen It's vital to contact your provider as soon as you realize that your bike has been stolen. Delaying the call can make your claim look less truthful. Your insurer might believe that you are responsible for the loss of your bike and that you were trying to come up with a plausible reason as to why it is missing. Dealing with the Emotional Aspect of Having Your Bike Stolen It's important not to get caught up in the feelings that overwhelm you once you realize that your bike has been taken by a thief. Instead, you should concentrate on taking care of putting in the claim right away. This is important because processing claims often takes weeks if not months to complete. If You Have Motorbike Insurance, Can You Apply for Replacement of Your Bike? You need to check your policy first to determine whether or not you have this type of coverage. If you have purchased full liability, it is likely that you do have protection against theft. As a result, you should be able to receive full compensation for the loss of your bike. However, this actually depends on the terms of your policy, so you need to check with your insurer as to the exact details. What Is the Claims Process for Reporting a Stolen Motorbike? Reporting a claim should take place quickly. In fact, your insurer probably has a pre-determined timeframe during which you must report the claim in order to have it considered for review. Here is a look at what you need to do as well as tips to get you through the process as painlessly as possible. •	As soon as you realize that your bike has been stolen, you should make a police report. Make sure that you provide as many details as possible about the circumstances surrounding the theft as you can when providing the report. You'll need to provide a copy of this to your insurer. •	As soon as you have filed the police report, it is time for you to file your claim with the provider of your motorbike insurance. Provide them with the file number on your police report as well as all of the details requested by them. You will also need your policy information, in particular the account number. •	Find out what your options are for a rental vehicle during the time that you need to wait for your claim to be processed.

5,Using the Internet to Find Lower Cost Motorcycle Insurance,autos-trucks," In an effort to find better coverage options on motorcycle insurance at a lower cost, many riders are turning to the internet. There is a wide range of services available to compare policies and deliver quotes you'll need to protect your bike. Finding the best policy still takes a detailed review of the coverage and the cost of any policy. Find Your Current Policy Before you start any surfing, find a current copy of your policy so you know what your coverage levels are now as well as deductibles and other costs. This policy will help you do a legitimate comparison to any other offers you receive on the web. Sometimes consumers are anxious to settle for the lowest cost and this may be a mistake. Some of these lower cost policies have very high deductibles or offer very poor protection. Often times, spending a little bit more for a policy can buy you a whole lot more coverage. Having your current policy in front of you will allow you to compare your existing coverage to any new quote to understand if the deal you are being offered is really better. This will also help you decide if making adjustments to things like your deductibles makes sense for the savings they provide. Use a Comparison Website Once you have a baseline of what your current policy provides, you can visit one of the many motorcycle insurance websites available. These sites do an incredible job of asking you for a few pieces of information about your bike and your driving habits to deliver a list of policies that may fit your needs. You can quickly compare these various offers to see the different levels of protection and cost they provide. Some sites will show you the average price for the policy and others will require your email address to have the individual companies send you a quote directly. Some consumers aren't comfortable surrendering their email and worry that they will receive unwanted solicitations. If this is a concern, you can still use the site to get a general feel for the cost of a policy that fits your needs and then contact the individual companies directly that offer the policy you like. Request a Digital Quote If you find a company or two with rates that interest you, ask them to send you a quote for the coverage. In years past this would require a trip to an office to assemble the paperwork. In the new digital age, all of this can be done online and you can actually receive your coverage immediately after submitting payment. Even though this may be tempting, take a little time to review the quote these companies send out. You normally have a few days to consider the coverage they are offering and it's always a good idea to seriously consider an offer before making a decision. This will also give you the time you'll need to compare it to your current policy in detail and make sure you're getting the coverage you want. Talk With Your Agent One last step before making a decision online is to speak with your current agent about your policy. When you have this conversation, bring the quote you like most with you to see if they can offer you similar coverage at the same price. In most cases they will appreciate you giving them the opportunity to keep your business and will find a way to make the numbers you have been given online work in one of their policies. They would rather offer you whatever discount was needed, than lose you as a customer. Even if your agent can't actually meet the pricing of the quote you received over the web, they can help you review it and may point out problems with the policy that you missed. This review can be a great way to make sure you're getting what you expect and will help you avoid mistakes with a confusing policy. This is especially true if the price you were quoted was substantially lower than your current policy. This type of dramatic price decrease may indicate problems with the policy that only a trained agent can find. You may discover after reviewing these new quotes with your agent that it's still a better deal for you to pay a little higher premium to have a policy with someone you already know and can trust to protect you."
6,How You Can Benefit from Black Box Insurance,autos-trucks," Most young people know that finding car insurance--and more importantly, finding a way to pay for your car insurance--isn't an easy task. Inexperienced drivers can seem like a liability to insurance providers because you haven't had the chance to prove that you are trustworthy behind the wheel. Often, young motorists have to pay premiums up to four times as expensive as those that experienced drivers are subject to. From the perspective of the insurance company, this bit of age discrimination is fair because they need to protect themselves financially if you were to file a claim. For you, however, these astronomical fees could prevent you from being able to start driving. After years of struggle, insurance providers have found a way to reach a compromise with younger motorists. Black box insurance plans calculate your rates based on how well you actually drive, using complex technology to track your performance behind the wheel. This type of policy could be the godsend you were looking for to finally attain affordable car insurance. Every black box insurance plan is a little different, but they all use a similar piece of equipment. A small, ""black box""--named after the device that tracks airplanes in flight--is installed into your car, and it uses telematics technology to keep track of how you drive. On a basic level, the black box is a GPS tracker, but it also has an accelerometer inside of it--much like the one in your smartphone. The device is able to keep track of a wide array of data, which it reports back to your insurance provider. The information available from the black box includes how often and how far you drive, how well you obey posted speed limits, how smooth your acceleration and braking tend to be, and how well you handle turns and corners. Knowing these details about your driving habits, your insurance company will be able to tailor premiums to fit your performance. The way that your driving affects your rates varies among providers. Some black box insurance policies will give you a base premium that can either go up or down each month depending on whether the telematics device reports positive or negative information about your driving habits. Many insurers will allow you to track how you are doing on their mobile app or website so that you know what you need to improve upon. At the end of each month, you may be rewarded with a certain number of points, which translates to your rates increasing or decreasing. Other plans work a little differently in that the main reason for the black box is to limit how often you are on the road. Studies have shown that the more often you drive, the more likely you are to get into an accident, so some insurance providers limit the number of miles you are allowed to drive each year (and use the black box to make sure you don't go over your allotment). Common limits for these telematics plans are 6,000, 8,000, or 10,000 miles per year, and you will often be allowed to bump up to the next tier if you are about to go over--though your rate will go up when you increase your mileage. Under these plans, young motorists are rewarded for their safe driving with bonus miles that they are given for free. Other insurers will quietly use the device when you are just beginning to drive, without it immediately having a positive or negative effect on your rates. Often, these companies will gather all the data over your first year as a customer and then take that information into consideration when you are renewing your policy. If you have been driving safely, you might see a hefty drop in your premiums--often by as much as 50 percent over the first few years. On the other hand, poor drivers will tend to see their rates increase beyond the already astronomical levels. In this regard, you are taking a bit of a risk by opting for a black box insurance policy, but it's one that will pay off as long as you put the effort into driving responsibly."
7,How Cars Get Classified as Group 1 For Insurance,autos-trucks," In the United Kingdom, every single car manufactured for the market is placed into an insurance group.  There is, however one slight exception to the rule.  Kit cars, converted cars, imported cars, and modified cars that no longer fit the manufacturer's specifications are not allocated into any groups. The groups range from one to 50.  Group 1 is where all the cheapest cars to insure are placed and Group 50 has the most expensive.  As a result, drivers insuring Group 1 cars pay the lowest monthly premiums. The grouping system for car insurance makes people think twice before making purchases.  Other vehicles are grouped the same way, with 20 of them for motorbikes and 20 more for vans or light commercial vehicles.  Most insurance companies follow the grouping system, although they are not obligated to do so. Cars are placed into groups based on three main factors: •	Repair Costs - according to insurers, over half of their payouts in claims end up going into repairs.  The money covers spare parts and manual labour.  One thing that is considered when assigning a car to an insurance group is the vulnerability of the vehicle if it were in an accident.  It is important to assess the damage in terms of the cost of parts and the amount of time it takes to fix the vehicle.  Cars in Group 1 do not require expensive parts and do not take much time to repair.  In truth, it is often the labour costs that make up the bulk of the bill. •	Performance - the faster or more powerful the car, the more expensive it is to insure.  Cars with quick acceleration and have high top speeds are in the higher-numbered groups because they tend to carry larger engines that cost more to repair.  Statistics show that high-performance cars tend to generate more claims.  It stands to reason that people who own high-performance cars exhibit riskier driving behaviors. •	Security - better standard, manufacturer-installed security is cheaper to insure.  Cars in Group 1 have great security devices.  If the vehicle has added security, it is the driver's responsibility to let the insurance company know.  The added security would affect premiums.  Insurers tend to favor Thatcham-approved security features to include immobilisers, alarms, high-spec door locks, glass etching, prominent Vehicle Identification Numbers, and coded audio equipment. Another factor that plays into the cost of insuring a Group 1 car is the model.   Different models of the same make could land in different groups because they may have different performance capabilities and specifications.  The range of groups a car's make can land in can range quite widely, influencing the driver's final decision when trying to find a vehicle. Most of the cars that end up in Group 1 for car insurance are front-wheel drive with 5-speed manual transmissions.  They are typically hatchbacks that seat four rather comfortably.  These petrol- and eco-friendly cars are 999cc or less and do not necessarily house the largest motors.  These modest cars are enough for drivers who simply need to get from Point A to Point B on a regular basis.  They don't live in their vehicles and do not need all the bells and whistles. Cars that are placed in Group 1 insurance tend to appeal to those who do not feel the need to drive fancy vehicles.  Group 1 also targets young drivers who have to pay extremely high premiums because of their lack of experience.  Young males, in particular, tend to make more insurance claims than anybody else. In the end, the wisest thing to do when considering a new car is to research the insurance groups.  When doing so, consider the fact that some car makes fall into multiple groups depending on the model.  The cost of insurance premiums could very well dictate which car makes the most sense to purchase. Cars in Group 1 include, but are not limited to: •	Chevrolet Spark •	Citroën C1 •	Fiat Panda •	Hyundai i10 •	Seat Mii •	Skoda Citigo •	Vauxhall Corsa •	Volkswagens Fox and Up Drivers who want to find out more about which cars are in Group 1, they can visit such websites as thisismoney.co.uk, carpages.co.uk, or uswitch.com.  Lists can be found on these websites that detail the cars covered under Group 1 insurance."
8,5 Ways to Save on Car Insurance for Your Renault,autos-trucks," According to the World Car Market, Renault is one of the top ten car brands in the world today. With such a quality investment, it's important to get the right insurance. Even with the growing number of online comparison sites, it's not always easy to find the right level of cover at an attractive price. Here are some tips that might help you save money on car insurance for your Renault: There are plenty of people who stick with the same insurer for twenty years. Perhaps they're happy with the service they've obtained in the past, or maybe they like the speed with which their insurer processes claims. That's fine - if you're 100% happy with your current insurer, by all means hang on to them. However, if your reason for staying with one company has more to do with apathetic inertia than customer satisfaction, you could be paying too much by not bothering to investigate the competition. The more good drivers that are designated 'named drivers' on your policy, the better the insurer likes it. If the added driver is a female with a long, clean driving history and no previous claims, that's even better. From the insurer's point of view, adding a responsible driver to your cover helps spread the risk. If the risk is reduced, there's a chance the cost of your premium may be too. It doesn't actually matter if this person hardly ever drives your Renault. Always ask for a cheaper price on your premium. If you own a smaller car like a Renault Twingo, your insurance shouldn't be costing you as much as what your neighbour pays for his Hummer. If it is, you need to do some serious negotiating (or find another insurer). Once you've sorted out the fine details and your insurer has provided a price, it's time for some haggling. The trick is not to ask for too much of a reduction (5-10% is reasonable), because you'll probably get an outright refusal. Also, if you try the ever-popular ""Insurer B will insure me for 20% less"" assertion (which you've just made up), the person in front of you will suspect that either (a) you're not a very nice person for lying to them, (b) you are a bit silly for not grabbing that other insurance, or (c) you must have been quoted a very basic, no-frills policy which you'll be very sorry about later. Most car insurers have a pretty good handle on what everyone else in the business is charging, so don't assume you know more on the subject than they do. Even if you only get a premium reduction of 2%, that's better than nothing. Polite haggling has become more socially acceptable, so don't be afraid to try it with the car insurance for your Renault. If you have never had to make a car insurance claim, this is something your insurer should know. If you recently completed an advanced driver safety course, this too may help reduce your premium. Always provide any positive facts that might influence your insurer to view you as a lesser risk. If your car is protected within the confines of a locked garage at night, this will be viewed favourably. If you habitually use a quality steering lock or have installed a car security system, let your insurer know. On the other hand, if you have a propensity for backing up into wooden sign posts, this might be something to keep to yourself... There are now a plethora of insurance comparison websites to choose from, and these are one reason vehicle insurance has become more competitive in the last decade. A quick way to access several sites at once is to go to money.co.uk, where you'll find a list of 'Top Ten Car Insurance Comparison Sites UK'. Over two dozen of the best known insurers are listed here, including gocompare.com, comparethemarket.com, quotezone.co.uk, tescocompare.com and many more. Get a minimum of three quotes and then see if your existing insurer is willing to match the cheapest. Of course, you must understand the full details of what's being offered; check the 'Default Offer' on the site and make sure it includes all the cover you need."
9,Understanding Your Car Insurance: Glossary of Contract Terms,autos-trucks," The best way to understand your car insurance policy is to become familiar with some of the terms used in your contract when signing up for a deal. It can be easy to get lost in insurance jargon and end up confused about some of the stipulations of your policy. The car insurance glossary below lists several terms that you are likely to encounter when reading over your contract. Cancellation Clause/Cooling off Period The cancellation clause is an important part of your contract that gives both you and your insurer the right to cancel the policy within a short period of time after it has gone into effect. This period of time is typically around 14 days, so make sure to cancel within this time if you have any issues with the policy. If cancelled within this period, you will not need to provide any reason for why you wanted out of your policy. Cash Surrender Value This is the amount of money that you could get back if you cancel your insurance before the year has ended. Your contract will determine how much you can be reimbursed. Compulsory Excess A compulsory excess is the amount that you would have to pay if you ever make a claim. Your insurance will cover whatever is left to pay after the compulsory excess. People who are seen as a greater insurance risk will have to pay a higher compulsory excess. Exclusion Exclusion refers to some event that your insurer will not cover. You will not be able to make a claim if you receive any damages as a result of this stipulated event. Geographical/Territorial Limits These are the limits within which your car insurance will be considered valid. The typical geographical limit for your UK insurance will be within the UK. Take a look at your contract to see if you will be covered in any other countries. Indemnity An indemnity simply means that you have been compensated or have received reparation payments. It is when you have returned to the same state that you were in before a loss, after having your damages paid for and repaired. Insured This is simply a contract term that refers to the person who is being covered by the policy. Legal Liability Legal liability means that it is your responsibility to compensate someone after causing damages. Partner ""Partner"" is a term that may be used in your contract to refer to the person you are living with. They do not have to be married to you to be considered your partner. Policyholder This is another term for ""insured."" Proposer ""Proposer"" is another term for both ""insured"" and ""policyholder."" It is the person taking out insurance. Registered Keeper The register keeper of a vehicle has the responsibility of making sure that the car is licensed and for paying any tickets. The registered keeper, however, does not have to be the owner of the car. They just need to be the person who uses it. Settlement The payout that you or somebody else received from an insurance company is referred to as the settlement. Social Domestic and Pleasure (SD & P) When you take out a car insurance policy, your insurer is going to want to know how you intend to use your car. They will ask whether you will be using it to get to and from work, for SD & P purposes, or for both. If you are going to be using your car to do things such as take trips, visit friends, and go shopping, then you are using it for SD & P. Underwriter An underwriter assesses how much of an insurance risk you are likely to present for an insurer, and how much your premiums will be. They take into account factors such as where you live, how old you are, any points on your license, what sort of car you drive, and even where your car will be parked overnight. Voluntary Excess A voluntary excess is how much you can agree to pay on top of your compulsory excess. If you can afford to make a bigger payment in the event of a claim, then you may benefit from lower premiums, as this will guarantee a smaller cost for your insurance company."
10,Understanding Car Insurance Basics,autos-trucks," Most motor vehicle insurance providers usually offer different types of cover. The three most common include Third Party Only, Third Party Fire & Theft and Comprehensive. You might use all of these over the course of your driving career or just one, but in either case, you need to know what sets each type apart so you can select the one suited to your needs. Third Party Only Third Party Only insurance is often confused with Road Traffic Act Only insurance. The latter of these, which is usually not sold anymore, offers the absolute bare minimum you need to meet the requirements of the Road Traffic Act of 1988. Third Party Only insurance provides just a little more, exceeding what the Act requires. It provides liability cover to third parties (others involved in your accident), but that's about it. You can use it to pay for damage or injury to others, their vehicles or other property they own, but it doesn't protect you, your car or your property. Third Party Fire & Theft This type of insurance is more common than Third Party Only. It offers the third party liability cover of Third Party Only, but in addition, as the title insinuates, you also get protection from having your car stolen or damaged in a fire. It still will not cover injury to you or damages to your vehicle or property that result from an accident. Comprehensive Comprehensive covers everything Third Party Fire & Theft does, but you also can make claims for your own injuries, vehicle damage or property loss in accidents. You also might get other perks rolled into this type of cover, too, depending on the insurance provider you're using. For instance, your insurance might cover getting you a rental vehicle free of charge while your own is being repaired. It also could cover things like roadside assistance. Which Type of Insurance Should I Get? Very generally, Third Party Only and Third Party Fire & Theft both are good options if you drive a relatively cheap car that it wouldn't cost too much to fix or replace on your own if written off by the insurance company (totaled). You also might want to consider them if you feel sure you could do a lot of the repair work yourself. The decision of whether to use Third Party Only or Third Party Fire & Theft usually comes down to whether you feel it's worth it to insure yourself, your car or your stuff a little more. Young drivers also can find Third Party Only or Third Party Fire & Theft helpful. Although rates vary and sometimes are higher than what you'd pay for more cover, these options tend to be less expensive overall and, therefore, are attractive to young motorists who don't have as much money to spare. For the same reason, anyone with a tight budget can investigate whether these choices are more economical for their specific circumstances. Another reason you might opt for them is because you want to deter yourself from making claims that could be covered under Comprehensive but which would drive up your rates over time. Comprehensive insurance makes much more sense for people who have more expensive vehicles and property they would like to protect. In fact, some insurance companies require this type of cover on particular vehicles. You might choose it if you think you might enjoy having the perks that sometimes come with this type of cover, as well. It is the policy option to select when you want to be sure that you won't have to pay much out of pocket in a wider range of circumstances. In many instances, it is a more expensive choice because your company is accepting greater risk by covering you under more situations, so it can be harder to get if your budget is tight. Conclusion Part of car insurance basics is getting the right type of cover on your vehicle. You can opt for any of the three main types of vehicle insurance--Third Party Only, Third Party Fire & Theft and Comprehensive--to get on the road. It's always a good idea to reevaluate your circumstances regularly to see if the insurance you have is a good deal and providing the amount of cover you need."
11,How to Get Cheap Car Insurance for your Vauxhall Corsa,autos-trucks," The Vauxhall Corsa is one of the most popular cars on Britain's roads, and it's praised for many of its features. Comfortable, fun to drive and economical to run, a Corsa is a popular choice with all age groups. Young drivers are particularly keen on the Corsa, as it's excellent value for money and falls into low insurance groups. New models offer attractive colours and trims, and the interior of the car is modern and stylish. Car insurance for your Vauxhall Corsa is generally very affordable, but it's still worth taking steps to make sure you're getting the best value for money. If you have had any accidents or convictions, insurance costs can rocket. Younger drivers with little experience on the road can also find premiums are on the high side. There are steps you can take to reduce the cost of car insurance for your Vauxhall Corsa, and the following tips should help you to find the best deals. Insurance comparison sites have changed the way most people shop for and buy home and motor insurance. In a matter of minutes, you can compare hundreds of policies and look for the cover you need. The big brands like AXA and LV offer their car insurance products through comparison sites, and it's a quick and convenient way to buy cover from a company you can trust. Always check the details of a quote before buying a policy from an insurance comparison site, as the cover and terms vary. One of the first things to check is the policy excess. Selecting a higher excess usually results in a premium discount, but remember that you will have to fund the excess amount if you need to make a claim. You should be able to save around fifty to two hundred pounds on the cost of car insurance for your Vauxhall Corsa with a comparison site. Telematics cover, or 'black box insurance,' is becoming increasingly popular in the UK. A telematics device records data about the way a driver uses his vehicle. Insurance underwriters can make an accurate assessment of your driving ability using telematics data, and this often means a premium discount. Black box insurance is particularly good for young drivers, as traditionally they are assumed to be at higher risk of accidents and are charged very high premiums. Fully Comprehensive car insurance offers a broad range of protection, including damage to your vehicle from a collision. If you have an older Corsa, it may not be worth paying for Fully Comprehensive Cover. In some cases, the premium may be higher than the cost of the vehicle. Choosing Third Party, Fire and Theft cover only will dramatically reduce your premium in some cases. The competitive nature of car insurance means that companies are always looking for new ways to make their policies unique and attractive. Benefits including courtesy cars and legal expenses protection are built into some policies as standard. Choosing a basic policy without additional covers is another good way to reduce the cost of car insurance for your Vauxhall Corsa. Convictions for driving offences can mean large increases in premiums, so always stick to the rules of the road. Excessive speeding is one of the most common offences. Driving in a safe and sensible manner means you'll be less likely to have an accident, and also helps to keep fuel consumption down. Using smartphones and mobile phones is another common cause of accidents and convictions. Keep your Corsa well maintained, and book the car in for regular servicing with a qualified mechanic. Low mileage drivers are attractive to insurance underwriters, and they generally benefit from lower car insurance premiums. Drivers who commute long distances on motorways are more likely to be involved in accidents than drivers who use a car for local trips. Many people use a car out of habit, and there are often cheaper ways to travel using public transport. As well as lower insurance costs, you could save hundreds of pounds on fuel a year by reducing your mileage."
12,Haggle Your Way To Better Prices On Car Insurance For Your Vauxhall Zafira,autos-trucks," The Vauxhall Zafira is, according to the manufacturer, a compact family car, although most reviewers describe it as being a spacious Multi-Purpose Vehicle (MPV). It will seat up to seven people, or you can use it to carry a considerable number of items. It is also well equipped inside, and considering its role as an MPV, it is attractive to look at on the outside. There are a number of models available under the Zafira marque and this not only provides access to cars on a wide range budgets, but it also means that you can choose the model that best suits your needs, and the one that costs the least to run. The Vauxhall Zafira The Vauxhall Zafira is comfortable to drive, and equally comfortable for the multitude of passengers that can be squeezed in. While the entry level model is not overflowing with features, there are some great additions to the other cars in the range. If you need the additional seating space, or you have to drive around a lot of gear as well as a handful of people, it is an ideal choice. The amount that you pay for car insurance for your Vauxhall will depend on a number of factors, but you can haggle and shop around to try and get the best available deal. Don't Auto-Renew First and foremost, you should avoid letting your insurance auto-renew. Insurance policies don't go all out to provide the best offer possible for automatic renewals. This means that you are likely to be paying an inflated price if you do simply let your renewal come into force. Try to arrange a new policy as soon as possible, and inform your current insurer so that they do not simply renew your policy on your behalf. Use Your Renewal And Haggle When you receive your renewal from your insurer, contact them straight away. Tell them that you intend to look around for a better price, and that you believe you can do better. Usually, they will make you an improved offer on car insurance for your Vauxhall. The improved offer can prove very useful, because you can use it when contacting other insurers. Any that are interested in winning your business will attempt to beat the price that you have received. Shop Around Take your improved renewal offer and contact other insurers. Some people still prefer to ring around, or use a broker, to try and access the best deals and prices. However, the far more convenient option is to use an online comparison site. An online comparison site works similarly to an insurance broker. You provide your details once, albeit manually online, and then the site will generate offers from dozens or even hundreds of insurers, before compiling the results and providing them to you in order of the cheapest deals first. This can make the whole shopping around process considerably easier, but you do need to ensure that the policies provided offer the same terms so that you can be sure you are comparing on a like-for-like basis. Contact Insurers As Well As Using Comparison Sites Don't overlook the insurers that aren't found on comparison sites. Some of the best known insurance companies cannot be found on any of these comparison services. This means that if you only use a comparison site then you may be missing on a top quality policy that provides everything you require but at a reduced rate. Ring these insurers or consider completing their online forms, because online deals are usually lower because of the reduced overheads associated with winning business online. Go Back To Your Existing Insurer Once you have found the best available deal, you could contact your current insurer. They will have already dealt with the car insurance for your Vauxhall Zafira, and this means that they will often be able to at least match the best price you have found elsewhere. Be prepared, however, to move your insurance away to another company if this is what takes to get the best deal. Whichever insurance company you use, do make sure that you choose a policy that is not only competitively priced but also offers all of the features and terms that you require."
13,Protecting your Land Rover and Your Passengers,autos-trucks," Driving on the road is one of the most dangerous things you can do, yet it is something you do almost everyday. Even if you're a great driver, you can't help how other people drive around you. Keeping yourself safe and protecting your Land Rover Discovery from damage and theft can be a challenge. Use these tips to improve your chances. Safety Features SUVs have a reputation for rolling. This is a dangerous feature that requires not only safety features in the car but careful driving skills. While SUVs are considered one of the safest vehicles on the road, they do roll more than cars and can be more dangerous and damaging to other smaller vehicles on the road. Make sure you buy an SUV with anti-lock brakes, which help you to steer your vehicle even under full braking power. The brakes are quickly pumped keeping the wheel from locking up. They also help you stop quicker on slippery pavement. Anti-skid systems use sensors to detect when a vehicle loses grip on the road. If this happens, the anti-lock brakes kick in to help get the car back on track. Roll stability control is similar, using sensors to help detect if the vehicle could roll. It then activates the anti-skid system and works on flat pavement. The Land Rover has a roll stability control system. Driving Tips •	Keep plenty of space between you and the car in front of you - Tailgating is a dangerous way to drive, especially when you're driving a Land Rover SUV. If the car in front of you slams on the brakes, you might not be able to stop in time if you don't have enough distance between the two cars. •	Slow down around corners - If you're used to driving a sedan or smaller vehicle, you might not think about your speed while taking corners. With an SUV, turn corners at a reasonable speed. •	Drive carefully in snow and rain - This goes for any kind of vehicle, but especially SUVs. SUVs have four-wheel drive, but if you are driving too fast in the snow, you could have trouble stopping. •	If you lose control, don't panic - Instead, move smoothly. Don't overcorrect your movements if you are trying to avoid a deer or another vehicle. Why Anti-Theft Features Benefit you in Multiple Ways Physical safety is important, but so is protection from theft. Install or use as many of these anti-theft features as you can to protect your Land Rover. •	Lock your doors at all times - If you don't lock your doors all the time, you better start. Even if your car is at home in your garage, it can still be stolen or broken into. Locking the doors adds another layer of protection. If you have deadbolt locks on your doors, this will also deter thieves and protect your vehicle. •	Don't leave valuables in your car - If your car is stolen, chances are you won't get any valuables from inside back. Even items that are only important to you, such as files or papers for work, shouldn't be stored in your SUV. •	Tracking devices - If you can install a tracking device on your car you could find your car if it's stolen. This can also help deter thieves from trying to steal your car from the start. •	Immobilisers - There are electronic immobilisers and manual ones. Manual immobilisers are those that keep your car from moving or lock your steering wheel in place. They can be fairly inexpensive but very effective. Electronic ones prevent the engine from running unless the right key is inside the car. These are more common in newer vehicles. •	Alarm systems - Alarm systems can act as a deterrent for thieves. Most of the time if they see an alarm or a sticker on a car that says there is an alarm, they will move onto another car. Even if you can only afford the sticker, it might help you out. Discount Car Insurance Anti-theft security features are also a great way to save on car insurance for your Land Rover Discovery or other vehicle. Many insurance companies offer discounts if you have security features. Some security features are required for insurance coverage. You will pay higher premiums if you don't have these minimum safety and security features."
14,How to Keep Car Insurance for Your Mercedes Affordable,autos-trucks," Just because you've made the decision to drive an expensive car like a Mercedes doesn't mean that you should have to spend the rest of your yearly salary on car insurance. A large number of factors will cause the price of your policy to increase, chief among them the fact that you've chosen to drive a car like a Mercedes in the first place. However, there are a number of tips that you can use to help drive your rates down as low as they will go. Though you will never pay as little for a policy as someone who drives a Chevy Blazer or a comparable entry level car, you can still save as much money as possible with minimal effort. Begin by calling your insurance provider and inquiring about any available discounts or promotions that you may qualify for. While many insurance providers won't automatically give you discounts as they become available, they will inform you about their existence after a basic phone call. The customer service representative on the phone will likely ask you a series of questions, allowing them to determine which of the available discounts are best suited for your account. Use the Internet to research other basic discounts that you may be qualified for. If you are self employed, are not using your vehicle for work purposes or work out of your home or apartment, for example, you qualify for a reduced rate on your insurance with most providers as a result. The theory is that people who work from home spend less time on the road because they don't have to commute back and forth to a job. If you're on the road a significantly smaller amount of time than the average person, you are less likely to get into the types of accidents that happen on a regular basis. As a result, you are considered to be a less risky person to insure and will be rewarded with reduced rates. Another way to keep car insurance for your Mercedes affordable is to increase your deductible as much as you can afford. The deductible is the amount of money you would have to pay out of pocket after an accident before any insurance benefits would go into effect. If you had a £1,000 deductible, for example, you would be required to pay for the first £1,000 of repairs after you got into a car accident. Your insurance provider would cover every pound after that initial £1,000 was taken care of. By increasing your deductible and agreeing to pay more money should the need ever arise, you can greatly reduce your premiums as a result. When deciding to take those steps to reduce your rates, however, consider how expensive a car like a Mercedes can be to afford. A £1,000 deductible on an average car may cover a large portion of all necessary expenses. The same deductible on a car that is already expensive, however, will likely cover much less. As a result, think of an increased deductible as an investment. While you will need to pay a larger amount of money if you ever file a claim, you will be saving money every month by way of decreased premiums. Due to the value of the Mercedes and the cost to repair it, however, you will likely have to raise your deductible by a significant amount to see any real benefit. Note that you can also get lower car insurance rates by maintaining a clean driving record. Mercedes owners already pay higher rates because people with nicer cars are statistically more likely to get speeding tickets and other types of violations. By keeping your driving record clean, you can help drive some of those costs back down as much as you can."
15,Find Cheaper Car Insurance for Your Ford S-Max by Comparing Quotes,autos-trucks," When it's almost time to renew your car insurance for your Ford S-Max, you will receive a renewal notice from your insurance company. If you would like to stay with your current company on your current policy, then you simply need to let your insurer know. But, there are a couple of reasons why you might not choose to renew, and look at switching to a different company instead. This may be because you feel that you may get better customer service somewhere else, because you feel that you could get cheaper premiums somewhere else, or, quite possibly, both. The Ford S-Max is not one of the cheaper cars on the market. Its insurance group, depending on model and version, could be as low as insurance group 14 to as high as 27, considerably pricier than more affordable, group 1-5 cars. There are various steps you can take in order to lower the cost of your premiums. You can take advantage of no-claims discounts, add security features, pass certain driving tests, or even let a black box monitor your driving. But one of the quickest and easiest ways to reduce your premiums will be to sign up for a new policy with a different insurer. The best ways to get quotes and compare car insurance are: You can pull up several quotes online by going to one of the many price comparison sites and inputting some basic information about you and your car. Try not to rely on just one site, as they may have information from different insurers, or have slightly different ways of calculating your expected premiums. Here are a couple of good websites to check out: •	parkerscompare.parkers.co.uk •	switch.com/car-insurance Make sure that the details you provide are as accurate as possible; otherwise you may end up receiving incorrect quotes. Be diligent in making sure that the site is not making assumptions about you, and select any add-ons that you may be interested in, or your quote will come out much cheaper than what you really need. If you find the process confused or are worried that you're not finding the absolute cheapest deals available, then you can choose to use a broker. Brokers are great because they won't try to sell you anything that isn't the best deal for you. They can point out important differences between prospective policies and help you with your decision. Calling several insurance companies to get a quote is likely to be your slowest strategy, and will give you a smaller view of the market as a whole. The one bonus of this strategy is that, by calling insurance companies directly, you may be able to receive cheaper rates than online. It could compel the insurer, who wants you as a customer, to offer attractive deals in order to get you signed up right away. You don't have to limit yourself to just one of these three ways of getting car insurance quotes. If you really need to lower your premiums, then be proactive and try to use them all. Carry out an online comparison and get a broker to double check your findings and offer you their own suggestions. Have them take a closer look at deals that you were seriously considering. You can also find a handful of deals first and then call up each insurer to see if they will actually offer you the online quote based on the details you give them over the telephone, and if you can't perhaps get it for even cheaper. What if you want to cancel your policy before the renewal date? What happens if your renewal date hasn't come along and you are already having a hard time paying your premiums? Should you switch to a better deal even if it would incur a cancellation fee? Chances are that your cancellation fee would negate the savings you might make from switching to a new policy, but it is never a bad idea to take out a calculator and double check. If you already have a policy picked out, then you can calculate how much you could save by switching today. If it is less than the cancellation fee, then you will save money and should switch. But, if it is more, then you should wait until your renewal notice comes around."
16,Car Insurance for Your Ford Galaxy: Will a Higher Deductible Policy Work for You?,autos-trucks," The law here in the UK mandates that everyone who drives a car must be insured by at least the minimum amount of liability coverage. Liability coverage covers any damage that you may do to another driver, his passengers, or his vehicle in the event you are the cause of a motor vehicle accident. However, liability coverage does not cover any damage to your own vehicle. You may also elect to cover your car with comprehensive coverage. Comprehensive coverage is what covers damage to your own vehicle in the event of an accident or theft. As you look for car insurance for your Ford Galaxy, you may want to consider the effect that your deductible has on your premiums. A car insurance premium is the amount you pay for insurance coverage. Premiums can be higher or lower depending on the level of coverage you select, your driving history, the car you own, whether or not you have any extras included in your plan, and the deductible you have included in your coverage. A deductible is your ""share"" of what has to be paid in the event of an accident or other damage to your vehicle and in case of theft. If your Ford Galaxy has to be repaired or replaced, you must pay the deductible and your insurance company will pay the rest. But you may not be aware that you can change the deductible on your policy. Changing the deductible will affect the premium you pay. Let's say that you have a car insurance plan that indicates that you have a deductible of £500.00. Each and every time you make a claim against your insurance policy for damage to or theft of your vehicle, you must pay £500.00. If your car is damaged and the repair bill is £1,500.00, you must pay £500.00, and your insurance company will pay £1,000.00. If your vehicle is damages and the repairs cost £501.00, you must pay £500.00, and your insurance company will pay £1.00. If your car is damaged and the repair bill is £450.00, you must pay the full amount because it is less than the amount of your deductible. By raising the amount of your deductible, you may receive a lower rate on your car insurance premiums. For instance, if you now have a £500.00 deductible, changing  your policy so that your deductible is £1,000.00 would mean that your premium, or the amount you pay for your insurance, would be lower. But it is important to understand that higher premiums come with both benefits and drawbacks. The immediate benefit to a higher deductible is obviously a lower premium. But the higher deductible itself can put you in a financial bind if you are ever involved in an accident or your vehicle is stolen. If you need to make a damage or theft claim against your insurance company, you will be required to pay the £1,000.00 deductible. And if you don't have your £1,000.00 share of the cost of replacement or repairs, you may not be able to complete the repairs or replacement of your vehicle. For this reason, it is very important that you consider the repercussions of a higher deductible insurance plan. If a higher deductible may not be reasonable for your budget, you may want to look into other ways to get cheaper car insurance for your Ford Galaxy. Some other discounts you may qualify for include limited mileage discounts, a discount for no claims, a good driver discount, a Pass Plus course discount, an age-based discount such as an over-50 insurance plan, a security discount for parking in a garage, and more. If your car insurance company is not willing to work with you as far as providing discounts, you can look into eliminating extras from your policy. Many drivers do not really need a roadside assistance or breakdown benefit, nor do most drivers really need a courtesy or rental car option. Removing discounts like these from your car insurance plan can earn you a bit off your overall premium. Compare insurance companies and plans to select the insurance plan that gives you the best coverage for the lowest price."
17,Car Insurance for Your BMW i Series - Introducing Packages from BMW Insurance,autos-trucks," BMWs are often expensive and fairly prestigious vehicles to own, so you will likely want to make sure that you take out a suitable insurance policy to protect your purchase. BMW itself also provides a range of financial services, including insurance products designed specifically with BMWs in mind. While you will likely be able to find cheaper insurance packages elsewhere, particularly if you use the price comparison websites, taking out an insurance policy with BMW itself presents a number of advantages. BMW Insurance currently offers several insurance policies designed exclusively for BMW vehicles. Alternatively, if you want to find the cheapest car insurance for your BMW, you may want to take a look at any of the financial comparison websites to get quotes sent to you online. With any insurer, premiums will vary depending on a number of factors, such as the insurance group of your car, your age and level of experience, where you live and what you use the car for. The following takes a look at the policies specifically tailored to the BMW i range of cars. These include all modern electric cars manufactured under this sub-brand since 2011. BMW provides similar policies for all of its other new cars. BMW FlexiMile Insurance These policies are available exclusively for all electric BMW vehicles. These policies allow you to save a considerable amount of money on your insurance premiums due to the fact that they are based on low annual mileages up to a maximum of 5,000 miles. Using a special device installed for free in your vehicle, your distance travelled will be tracked, and you will be kept up-to-date on your mileage. The policy is completely flexible, so you will not actually need to restrict yourself to driving less. However, any extra miles will mean added costs to your insurance premiums, since you will be charged on a per-mile basis. For those who do not drive very much or plan to use their BMW only as a second car, these policies can save you quite a lot of money. Others may find it more cost-effective to switch to their standard comprehensive insurance policy. 7-Day Complimentary Insurance This policy is a comprehensive one offering coverage for third party liability, theft, fire and damage. This policy is available to any BMW cars of the 'i' series. This policy allows you to get coverage for your car on the day that you buy it. It is primarily available through BMW dealers themselves, and as with all of their insurance policies, it is underwritten by Allianz Insurance. BMW Shortfall Insurance This insurance package provides comprehensive coverage whereby you will be paid the full amount you paid for your car in the first place in the event that it is written off in an accident. BMW Shortfall insurance is the company's premium car insurance package, tailored to minimize the financial risk taken on your part. You can choose your own level of coverage, and the policy will pay any difference between the settlement figure and the invoice price of the vehicle. If you purchased your BMW on finance, the policy will pay the outstanding finance amount instead. Reasons for Getting Car Insurance from BMW Getting insurance through the manufacturer of your car is rarely going to be the cheapest option, but it does provide a number of benefits which make it worth consideration, particularly those with new and expensive vehicles. •	Any repairs done which are covered by your insurance policy will be covered out by trained specialists who deal exclusively with BMW cars. If the vehicle needs any repairs, they will be dealt with only at BMW-approved dealers. •	Any replacement parts will be official BMW parts. No third party components will be used. •	BMW Insurance will provide you with a courtesy car which you will be able to keep while your own car is being repaired. •	The company provides a 24-hour emergency rescue service which will recover your vehicle and organize transport for you so that you don't end up getting stranded. •	If your windshield is damaged, BMW will replace it promptly without your no claims bonus being adversely effected."
18,What Is the Role of the Adjuster When You File a Car Insurance Claim?,autos-trucks," Once you file a car insurance claim, your insurance provider normally assigns it to a specialist known as an adjuster. From there on out, the adjuster is the person who will work on your claim the most, so it's important that you understand exactly what their role is as you wait for the insurance company's final decision. Overview Very generally, the job of an auto insurance adjuster is to make sure that the car insurance claim you filed is valid given the conditions of your policy. People sometimes file with their insurance company without reviewing their agreements, so it's not uncommon for them to want help for something beyond which they are covered. Even if the claim is valid, the adjuster still has to verify that the amount you are asking for is within the policy limits. If it's not, then the adjuster may approve the claim but not at the amount you expected. Initial Contact After you file your claim, the adjuster will have some basic information about your accident. The insurance company needs to make sure that all of this information is accurate, so the adjuster will contact you. Most of the time, he or she does this with a simple phone call. As you talk, the adjuster will go over the facts you gave in your initial claim. These are often fairly clear, but the adjuster will ask questions about what happened if he or she needs to look at your situation more in depth to determine your degree of fault, if any. If needed, the adjuster will request additional documentation from you, or he or she might ask for certain permissions, such as having you release medical records. Auto insurance adjusters try to get the big picture about accidents, so they will not limit their initial contact to just you. They also get in touch with the others involved in the incident to get their side of the story. They also look to witnesses, and if you or anyone else got hurt, they might also contact medical providers to verify the extent of injuries and the value of the medical services received. Field Work In addition to getting on the phone and talking with people directly or indirectly related to the accident, an auto insurance adjuster also has to consider the physical evidence involved in your claim. This isn't necessarily because the adjuster doesn't believe you--it's simply that the insurance company knows that perceptions are not always accurate, especially in the heat of the moment of an accident. He or she often visits the accident scene. The adjuster might take pictures or measurements, or he or she might sketch out what is at the scene in a formal diagram. Another part of the adjuster's field work is to look at the damage done to the vehicles or other property. The adjuster once again takes pictures and documents what he sees. Often, by piecing together this evidence with the layout of the accident scene, the adjuster can make better sense of how the accident happened. Putting It Together Once the insurance adjuster has collected all the data he can about your accident, he takes some time to review it. He looks for discrepancies and tries to determine objectively if the accident might have been avoided. At this point, the work is a lot like putting together the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. The ability to analyze and think critically is extremely important. Decision Alert and Negotiation The last thing an adjuster does is contact you with a decision about your claim. He or she might award you the full amount you asked for, but the adjuster also might decide that you are entitled to only a portion. In the worst case scenario, the adjuster will deny your claim altogether. At any rate, if you are unhappy with what the adjuster offers you, you usually can appeal. This means you go to the adjuster's supervisor or an appeals board to try to have the claim reevaluated. Conclusion At an auto insurance company, the adjuster is essentially a detective. He or she searches for more information and tries to corroborate what everyone has said to get an accurate picture of the accident. It is his or her analysis that determines whether your claim is approved or denied and how much compensation, if any, you get."
19,Car Insurance for Women and Other Common Insurance Myths,autos-trucks," Rumors and hearsay: you can't escape them, but it's essential to get the facts when it affects your pocket. Misinformation is rampant in the car insurance industry due to the complex nature of the product. However, separating fact from fiction when you're purchasing a new policy or changing insurers will help you to make sound decisions and keep more money in your pocket. Get the truth behind these eight common car insurance myths. Myth 1: Older cars always cost less to insure The truth: Not always. Your vehicle's age will determine your rate in some cases. However, insurers take other aspects of your car into consideration as well. So while your car might attract a lower rate if it's popular among thieves or difficult to source parts, the insurer will charge premium rates for your coverage. Myth 2: Red cars cost more to insure The truth: If you want to make a statement with a red car, go ahead and purchase it because the color of your car makes no difference to your insurer. Most insurers only care about the model, make, and mileage on your vehicle - the hue doesn't matter. So, whether you paint your car firehouse red or bright orange, your insurance rate won't budge. Myth 3: Your credit won't affect your car insurance rates The truth: Insurance companies use a credit-based insurance score among themselves to make out your quote for car insurance. They refer to the scores whenever you buy, renew, or modify your policy. It's easy to understand why your scores matter; they directly reflect your fiscal responsibility. So, expect to pay more if you don't have decent credit. Myth 4: Seniors always pay more The truth: Age is a key factor when it comes to determining insurance premiums. However, being older doesn't always mean paying more. For instance, seniors will qualify for discounts if they take a defensive driving course. Seniors can also use their membership in certain motorists clubs to take advantage of member discounts for car insurance. The bottom line is that seniors don't always pay more for car insurance. Myth 5: A rental car is always provided after an accident The truth: You backed out of the driveway the wrong way and your car sustained some damage; no problem, you can use an insurance funded rental car while the damage is repaired, right? Don't count on it. While some insurers will include rental cars as an added perk, the norm is that you must purchase additional coverage for a rental car. Furthermore, if you're at fault, the coverage won't provide a rental while the car is being repaired. If you rely on your only vehicle to get to and from work, you should check with your insurer to find out about additional coverage for rentals. Myth 6: You'll get back what you owe If your car becomes a total write-off after a serious accident, there's no guarantee your insurance will write a check to pay off the bank. Instead, you'll receive the book price based on the current value of the car. If you're overwhelmed by the thought of repaying the bank after a write-off, you should ask your agent about additional coverage to waive the financial consequences of depreciation on your car. This will ensure that your insurer will pick up the check for the amount owed on your bank loan. Myth 7: Male drivers pay higher premiums than female drivers Insurance companies are not gender biased. They calculate rates based on claims made, the drivers profile and record - your sex doesn't matter. A woman might have a lower rate if she's a conscientious driver, but a woman with a terrible record will definitely pay more than a male driver. Myth 8: My insurance agent got me the best deal on car insurance Insurance agents are obligated to the company they work for, so they'll work to get you the best deal within that company. However, you can find a similar coverage for less with another company. When you're comparison shopping, make sure to compare apples to apples. Even though you're on a budget, your goal should always be to get sufficient coverage to keep your family safe on the road."
20,9 Ways to Get Cheaper Car Insurance for Young Drivers: Focus on Rates,autos-trucks," Young drivers are notoriously difficult to insure for a reasonable rate. Why? Because, statistically, young drivers get into more accidents than older, more experienced drivers. But there are things you can do to ensure that your young driver pays less for car insurance. Here are 9 ways to get cheaper car insurance for young drivers. #1: Compare Rates Between Companies Number one on your list when you are looking for a lower car insurance rate for a young driver should be to compare rates between companies. Some insurance companies are young driver ""friendly"" and some are not. Locate the lowest priced car insurance company and switch to that company. #2: Get More Experience It may seem like a bit of a Catch-22, but young drivers who have more experience may be eligible for lower rates on their car insurance. But it is impossible to get more experience without driving for a while on a higher rate plan, right?. Ah, but there is a way to get around the ""more experience"" criteria inherent in just about every car insurance plan. Sign up your young driver for an extra class in driving to get a discounted rate on car insurance. Classes like Pass Plus are a great way to ensure that your young driver gets extra driving instruction and experience. Many insurance companies offer special discounts for young drivers who have completed such a course. #3: Add and Adult Young driver insurance rates are typically higher when there is not an older adult as primary on the insurance plan. Add an older adult - a parent or an older sister or brother - to get cheaper rates on insurance for your young driver. #4: Drive a Base Model Car Anyone who has had car insurance knows that the fancier the car, the more expensive it is to insure that car. Although every young person wants to drive a flashy car, young drivers should stick with only base model cars at least for the first few years of driving; they are simply cheaper to insure. #5: Install a Tracking Device Although as a whole the category of drivers that includes young drivers is viewed as a risky pool of drivers to insurers, not every young driver is a risk. To show insurance companies that they are smart, safe drivers, many young drivers have volunteered to install tracking devices in their cars that give their insurer a picture of their driving habits. In return, the insurer generally offers a discounted rate. #6: Lower the Level of Coverage Older, experienced drivers typically enjoy cheaper rates. For this reason, a comprehensive coverage plan is far more affordable for them. But to insure a younger driver on a full coverage plan can be cost prohibitive. Insure your young driver with a plan that covers only liability to get a cheaper rate. #7: Raise the Deductible of the Plan Consider an insurance plan with a higher deductible for your young driver. Higher deductible plans are, as a rule, less expensive than lower deductible plans. #8: Pick a Plan Designed for Young Drivers Not every car insurance company wants to insure young drivers. But those that do generally offer plans specifically geared toward young drivers. These plans often come with restrictions, so make sure you understand what is in the fine print before signing up your young driver for such a plan. #9: Drive Less Insurance companies assume that the more anyone drives, the more likely it becomes that that person could be involved in an accident. This assumption is highlighted in regard to young drivers. With their lack of experience, the likelihood that a young driver will be involved in an accident is higher. So, to counteract this assumption, some insurance companies offer lower rates to young drivers who agree to drive fewer miles overall. Using these 9 ways to get cheaper car insurance for young drivers may bring car insurance into the affordable realm for you and your young driver. Incorporate all of them or only one or two to get the best deal you can on car insurance for your young driver."

1,5 Tips for Choosing an Insurance-Friendly Car,autos-trucks," In your quest to find the best car insurance for less, you might forget how the type of car you drive will affect the cost of your insurance. When you're out shopping for a new car, you should consider the cost of insurance in order to keep your car on the road. Of course, there are other factors that determine your monthly premiums, but the car itself plays a critical role. For example, insuring a sensible Toyota Aygo 1.0 VVT-i costs about seventy percent less than it costs to insure the Volkswagen Phaeton W12 450 Motion LWB that you're so taken with. That's quite a difference! So if you're on a shoestring budget, start by purchasing an insurance-friendly car. The following five tips should set you on the path to success. Research premiums Before you head out to the car dealership, get online to compare quotes for the year, make, and model you're interested in. The results might force you to change your mind. Although there are ways to cut the costs of your premiums, such as foregoing comprehensive coverage and increasing your excess, you should never sacrifice quality coverage for a flashy new car. Avoid high-performance vehicles Large SUVs, luxury cars, sports models, and other fully loaded vehicles attract premium car insurance rates because they're expensive to repair or replace. The car's safety is another crucial consideration - a small sports car built for speed generally offers limited safety features and attracts more reckless drivers than a modest family sized sedan. The fact that these cars are also gas guzzlers will also increase your costs. So if you're not prepared to pay the extra costs to keep your dream car on the road, you're better off avoiding high-end vehicles. A sensible choice won't wow your friends, but it will be easy on your pockets. Research the average costs for repairs Insurers charge premium rates for cars that are expensive to repair, or if the parts are hard to find. Determine the costs to repair and maintain the vehicle in your area before you purchase the car. There are many resource sites where you'll find the average cost of repairs based on the category. Or you can take a different approach and just search for cars that are cheapest to repair and choose some worthy considerations from that list. This research will cut your insurance costs, but you'll also safeguard your pocket from costly repairs for damages that are not covered with insurance. Know the stolen vehicle statistics You've probably guessed: cars that typically attract thieves are more expensive to insure. You can find out about stolen-car statistics through AVCIS, the Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service or similar organizations. Fortunately, your brand new car will not be a prime target for thieves so your insurer might cut you some slack in this area. Get a less expensive model The extra features that are included as a standard part of high-end cars might be convenient for you, but costly to repair. So your insurer will include your built-in navigation system and sunroof in their rate calculation tool and jack up your premiums. A new car will drain your pockets as it is, so you'll need to do everything possible to cut back on your car insurance. Forego the luxuries, and you'll not only save money on the sale price of the car but also reduce your insurance premium. Final thoughts When it comes to getting the cheapest car insurance quotes, family-friendly four doors are usually a safe bet. The modest but popular Chevrolet Spark is a sensible car that won't hurt your pockets to insure. Other cars you can consider are Ford's Fiesta and Ka, Peugeot's Partner Tepee, and Skoda's Fabia Hatchback and Estate. However, if you're set on purchasing an imported luxury vehicle, then be prepared to pay a hefty insurance premium for all the trappings. Either way, you should do your homework to investigate how your choice of car will affect your insurance premium. A healthy dose of reality before you buy will have an immense impact on what you pay out each month to keep your car on the road."
2,"Rebuilding Antique Vehicles on a Budget - Saving Money on Classic Car Insurance, Parts and Maintenance",autos-trucks," Rebuilding an older vehicle can be very satisfying, but it can also get quite expensive. This problem has forced many car lovers to abandon their projects and their dreams. If you want to rebuild an antique vehicle on a tight budget, you can save a significant amount of money on everything from parts to classic car insurance. You simply need to do your research. Choose an Affordable Antique Vehicle The cost of restoring a car depends greatly on the make and model you decide to buy. For instance, rare cars have the highest value, but they're also the most expensive to repair. This makes common classic cars a better option for car lovers on a budget. These aren't the only options for those who love old-fashioned vehicles, however. If you simply like the look of an older automobile, you can order a classic car kit from a modern manufacturer. They mimic the look and feel of the real thing, but are generally easier to assemble and are far more affordable than an original antique. Alternatively, you can use modern modifications and reproduction parts to turn a collection of parts into a unique vehicle of your own creation. Save Money on Parts Unless you're fortunate enough to inherit an old car in premium condition, you'll discover that buying original parts from a specialty parts dealer can get quite expensive. To save money, you can search boot sales, auctions and farmland for parts and supplies. Some mechanics will also trade car parts with other enthusiasts to get the items they need. Larger parts such as engines, transmissions and starters are often the most expensive to replace. To avoid these high costs, you can have them repaired or rebuilt by an expert rather than looking for a different one. And if you do need to find a different one, parts suppliers will often buy the damaged parts from you in exchange for a discount or shop credit. Modern reproduction parts are a great alternative for thrifty car enthusiasts. They will lower the value of your rebuilt car, but they are easier to find and cost a fraction of the price. Sometimes, they even last longer than the originals. And you can always switch them out for original parts if you change your mind or find a good deal. Find Low-Cost Classic Car Insurance Antique vehicles are quite different from their modern counterparts and your insurance should reflect that. Classic car insurance takes into account numerous details including the year, make and model of the vehicle. Your provider will also consider the condition of the car, the number of original parts, your age, driving history and how often you plan to drive it. You can save even more money on classic car insurance if you shop around. A comparison website, for example, will allow you to get quotes from several providers at once and make it easy for you to find the cheapest classic car insurance. To save even more money, be sure to ask about special discounts if you're over the age of 50 or have a safe driving record. You might also consider insuring multiple vehicles with the same provider to take advantage of discounted package rates. Keep Your Car on the Road With Regular Maintenance When you add up the cost of towing your antique vehicle to a garage, replacement parts and labour, breakdowns can get extremely expensive. However, you can eliminate this problem by being proactive. Regular maintenance and timely repairs, for example, reduce the wear and tear on your vehicle. And if you keep a collection of tools and common parts such as belts and hoses in your classic car, you can do your own emergency repairs instead of having to tow it to a garage. A small budget doesn't mean you can't rebuild a classic antique car. It simply means you have to take extra steps to find the best deals on items such as parts and insurance. It can seem like a lot of extra work and time, but it will all be worth it the first time you drive down the road."
3,How GAP Insurance is the Bee's Knees for Land Rover Owners,autos-trucks," Finding car insurance for your Land Rover or Land Rover Freelander Sport requires planning ahead to ensure that you have adequate coverage should a disaster come calling. One aspect of auto insurance that all Land Rover owners should consider is GAP coverage. First, insurance companies are not required to pay off the retail cost of a Land Rover if it is destroyed in an accident or stolen and cut up for parts. Combined Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP) picks up where your normal insurance drops out. GAP insurance is designed to bridge the difference between the insured value of the Land Rover and what remains of the outstanding balance with the loan company. The idea behind GAP, and it is a good idea, is to make certain that money is paid to the loan company to pay off any balance in a loan agreement. That means that you won't be depleting a personal bank account to pay off the creditor. Here's how it works. Say you bought a Land Rover for £35,000. Three years later a thief steals it and ships it off to a Mafia hit man in France. Now the insurance company tells you that it will pay you only £20,000 for the loss. You still owe the finance company £10,000. GAP insurance will step in and pay you the other £10,000, leaving you free and clear of any debt owed to the lender. GAP also works to make you financially whole again if you paid cash for the Land Rover. If the insurance company only pays £20,000 for a total loss, GAP insurance will step in to bridge the difference between what the insurance company pays and the retail price you paid for the vehicle. That allows you to visit the Land Rover dealer and buy an equitable replacement. Land Rover owners need to be aware that insurance companies depreciate the value of a vehicle as it ages. That £35,000 Land Rover no longer retains that value after a year or more on the road. Consequently, should that vehicle be wrecked or stolen, the insurance company will only pay out the depreciated value of the vehicle. The depreciation payment will leave you holding the bag if you owe more to the lender than what the insurance company paid. GAP insurance steps in to ensure that you don't need to dig into your pocket to pay off a loan. Here are a few reasons to consider GAP insurance: Thieves steal one vehicle every minute in the UK, and one-third are never found. Settlements by insurance companies are always less than what you paid for the Land Rover Freelander Sport. More than 500,000 vehicles are considered a complete loss every year. Depreciation of vehicles is happening at a faster rate. It's a personal financial hardship trying to raise cash to pay off a vehicle loan. GAP insurance comes in various flavors to cover assorted exigencies. Here are the most common GAP policies offered. Vehicle Replacement Insurance (VRI) This is the gold-plated GAP coverage that will replace your vehicle with a similar or better new model. Even if the retail price of the vehicle has increased, and it usually will, this GAP coverage will seat you behind the wheel of a new vehicle. Agreed Value GAP (AVG) This coverage is designed for vehicles bought at auction or from a private seller. Using Glasses Guide Value, this GAP policy insures the value of the vehicle at the time it is bought. This policy is good for three years. Return to Invoice (RTI) This coverage pays you the difference between what the insurance company pays out and the original price paid for the vehicle. Where Can You Find the Best GAP Deal Get involved with Land Rover clubs, and talk to the members. They have real-life experience with insurance companies and will voice their opinions. Be aware that most insurance companies have little or no experience with forward control vehicles and Series 2As and 2s. Most quote only for new vehicles. GAP insurance bridges the difference between the market value of a vehicle and what an insurance company will pay out in a total loss. Insurance companies will typically pay out the depreciated value of a vehicle, leaving the owner with the quandary of paying off the loan balance to a lender. GAP solves that problem."

A Small Price and Affordable Car Insurance for Your Vauxhall Agila Families on a budget love the Vauxhall Agila. Priced lower than many of the larger MPVs, the payments are quite reasonable. But if you negotiate with the dealer, you can lower your monthly payments even more. You should also be on the lookout for manufacturer sales and discounts. After you've made the purchase, you'll find the taxes and servicing are quite affordable as well. Car insurance for your Vauxhall Agila costs less than larger MPVs, but smart shoppers can save a good deal more. If you use a comparison website to compare providers, for example, you can find the best rates in minutes. It's also the perfect opportunity to find a policy that matches your unique needs and lifestyle. Big on the Inside With five adjustable seats and additional storage under the boot floor, you can turn extra seating into storage in seconds. In fact, you can get more than a thousand litres of luggage space without removing the car's headrests or seat bases. And if you have more passengers than packages, five people can sit inside without invading each other's personal space. Your children will argue less and have more room to play. Small on the Outside Despite having so much room inside, this five-door hatchback requires little space to park or turn due to its short nose and upright tail lamps. The compact bonnet does mean less room around the petrol engine, but the car's ability to get into tight spaces and small parking spaces more than makes up for it. Agila's Adequate Engine The smaller 1.0-litre engine tends to struggle and its three cylinders aren't quite as clean as you think. Most drivers prefer the 1.2-litre engine because it takes less effort to overtake a vehicle on the motorway or climb uphill. You will pay for it with lower fuel mileage and a higher CO2 figure, however. That being said, both models are suitable for most city driving. Designed With Visibility and Safety in Mind Because the windscreen rises at a sharper angle, the Agila will give you a much better view of the road ahead. And a test drive makes it easy to see that the headrests on the rear seats don't get in the way like other MPVs. Vauxhall also included an Electronic Stability Programme, air bags, emergency tyre inflation kit, ISOFIX child seat points and several other security features to keep you and your family safe. Fuel Mileage That Makes You Smile If you don't mind having less power, the 1.0-litre engine will give you over 60 miles per gallon and a CO2 number of 109 grams. With fuel mileage at 55 miles for every gallon, the larger 1.2-litre engine will cost a bit more to drive. However, both models are more efficient than larger MPVs and a cheap option for families with a love of the open road. Easy to Keep Clean and Simple Comfort The Vauxhall Agila wasn't built to be luxurious. It was designed for busy families. The seats, dash and carpeting are durable and easy to clean. The simple design minimises the number of nooks and crannies dirt can collect in. And the generous storage compartments provide a convenient space for all your road trip necessities. Families in need of an affordable MPV will love the new economical Vauxhall Agila. They're small, cheap to drive and affordable to maintain. Drivers love that they're small and easy to park, but still have plenty of space for everything your family needs during the week. You will even appreciate how easy it is to keep clean. It's the perfect option for a driver who would rather spend his time and money on his family."
5,Vandalism Car Insurance For Your BMW,autos-trucks," When it comes to the threat of vandalism, it's less a matter of ""if"" than a matter of ""when."" The sad fact is that vandalism is quite rampant in the UK. Although the criminals who cause the damage are more than willing to inflict their pain on vehicle makes and models across the board, they seem to have a particular penchant for damaging a particular kind of automobile. Naturally, you should have automobile cover anyway, but if for no other reason, the portent of vandalism is strong cause to make sure you have sufficient car insurance for your BMW. Statistics Tell the Truth Don't think it will happen to you? Do you believe that, as long as you avoid dodgy areas of town, your prized vehicle will be spared from the humiliating and heart-wrenching experience of spiteful damage? It's a pleasant dream to cling to, that everyone who beheld a machine of beauty would appreciate the art form it reveals in motion. Unfortunately, the reality is that, as the kids say, ""haters gonna hate"" and ill-raised people do express their resentment and bitterness through spiteful attacks on other people's vehicles. For owners of cars boasting precision German engineering, the reports are particularly disheartening. Data gathered over many years demonstrates that the Ultimate Driving Machine is often the Ultimate Target for vandalism. In 2011, four models from the Bavarian Motor Works made the top ten list of the most vandalised types of cars in the UK. That means that of all the cars in Britain that were targeted for damage by criminals, cars specifically from this maker suffered 40% of all the aggregate attacks. In 2012, criminals widened their nets to attack a greater variety of makes, so fewer Bimmer models were prime targets. Yet, two kinds kept honored positions on the Most Vandalised list: the 3 series in slot #10, and the X5 in slot #4. The most recent figures, reflecting findings for 2013, show that this year is no exception to the long-standing trend. However, positions have changed, and in this case, being the most popular is not necessarily good news. Figures have revealed that the X5 has shot up to the top spot, now holding the title of the most vandalised car model in all the UK. And in the number two slot? Its sibling, the 3 series. Luckily for owners of the BMW Z series, that model has fallen off the ""most vandalised"" list since 2011, when it last made the list. Sound the Alarm! Does this mean you should ditch your coveted coupe? Not at all. It does mean, however, that stepping up the vigilance would be a very good idea. Installing an anti-theft device that is also effective against potential hooligans who edge too near your vehicle could prove helpful. But, the proliferation of car alarms has inured many to their noisy calls. These days, when such alarms ring out, neighbors are more likely to angrily demand the car owner snap off the sound, than look about for suspicious behavior in the area. Still, sudden loud noises do tend to scare off those who are about to cause harm to property, so these alarms may prove effective. Car alarm systems can also help get you a discount with your insurance coverage, so if you have such a system installed, be sure to mention it to your cover agent. Find out what requirements your insurance company demands for covering vandalism damage to your car. Could it be proved that you did too little to prevent the vandalism? Do you regularly park your car inside a locked garage or secured area? Do you enclose your vehicle nightly with a car cover to protect it from the elements, including the human elements? What other precautions do you take to responsibly protect it from harm? Whether it's a brand new BMW Z series model or a treasured vintage model, are you doing all you can to keep your car in pristine condition? Keep Your Guard Up The good news is that, overall, the amount of vandalism crime in the UK does appear to be plummeting from where it was before, dropping dramatically six years ago, again four years ago and once again at the close of 2012. Despite that encouraging news, don't let your guard down, because your Bimmer could very well still be on your local vandals' prime hit list. So, contact your carrier and confirm the level of cover you have arranged with your car insurance for your BMW. Then consider how else you might better protect your vehicle from those who would bring it harm, and take whatever steps you can to keep it safe and sound."
6,"Extend the Life of Your New MPV With Quality Maintenance, Care and Car Insurance for Your Ford Galaxy",autos-trucks," From the affordable Zetec to the award-winning Titanium X model, the Ford Galaxy adds a touch of luxury and style to family MPVs. They are rugged enough to take your family almost anywhere and flexible enough to haul most items. If you want to enjoy these benefits for years to come, proper vehicle care and maintenance are of the utmost importance. And when the worst happens, the right car insurance for your Ford Galaxy will provide the support and comfort you need to recover. Maintaining a New Ford Galaxy When you bring a new vehicle home, you have to get familiar with all of its features and options. Start by exploring all of its compartments. Push the buttons and locate all of the lights. This will make the MPV easier to drive, but it's also a great way to learn about the many conveniences and options your new ride has to offer. To extend the life of the MPV and minimise repairs, you have to look after it properly from the beginning. Your family's safety rides on your vehicle's tyres, so they have to in good condition at all times. Start by checking the overall condition and air pressure of each tyre every fortnight and before each long trip. You should also rotate them every 3000 to 6000 miles and have them aligned and balanced every 12,000 miles. Look over the MPV every day before you get in. You should also take a few minutes when refuelling to check the vehicle's engine, brake and washer fluid levels. If it's cold out, it's also a good idea to assess the condition of your tyres and their air pressure levels. Closer inspections of your Galaxy should be done once a month. After testing the horn and air conditioning, give the parking brake a try and make sure the wheel nuts are tight. Top up the power steering and coolant levels and inspect the pipes, hoses and reservoirs for leaks. Your driving habits also affect the vehicle's health. To reduce the number of claims on the car insurance for your Ford Galaxy, try to avoid hitting holes, kerbs and other road hazards. If you do have to mount the kerb, climb it with the wheels at a right angle to reduce the strain on the MPV's undercarriage. Keeping Your MPV Clean Dirt and debris wear away at the vehicle's fabrics, leather and exterior. Once it starts to wear, the metal will start to rust and the whole vehicle will start to take on a ratty appearance. You can't turn back the clock or undo the damage when it starts. The only option is to replace or repair these surfaces and that can get extremely expensive. To keep the paint and clear coat in pristine condition, wash it regularly with a sponge and auto shampoo before rinsing it with pressured water. A vacuum and a soft cloth will take care of most of the dirt inside the vehicle. And once or twice a year, you will have to give the paint a coat of wax and spray the fabric and leather with special protective coatings. Recover From Disasters With the Right Car Insurance for Your Ford Galaxy Driving your vehicle without making the necessary repairs can put added strain on the rest of it and increase your repair costs. So when something does go wrong, you have to get it in for repairs as soon as you can. The right car insurance for your Ford Galaxy can help you get your MPV into the garage and cover the repair costs. You can save money on insurance by using a comparison website, but it's also a great way to compare the various providers and find the best car insurance for your Ford Galaxy. Some options to look for include extra coverage for the windscreen, personal contents, trailers, roof boxes and foreign travel. You've spent hours finding the perfect vehicle for your family and invested a lot of money in it. Now, you need to care and maintain it to extend its lifespan. In return, it will take your family almost anywhere you want to go and provide you with hours of memories that will last forever."
7,Looking for Car Insurance For Your Vauxhall? What Your Policy Must Have,autos-trucks," You have many options when it comes to insuring your Vauxhall. The insurer you choose may depend on where you live, who offers the lowest premium, and the company you already enlist for other insurance policies. While the right company and premium for you is a very personal decision, there are a few things every Vauxhall consumer should know. If you have too limited an insurance policy, you may not get financial assistance when you need it the most, such as after a major collision or when you are the victim of vehicle theft. Guaranteed Repairs Some insurance policies will guarantee all repairs for five years. If a car part that you have replaced as a part of your insurance claim fails within five years, you can get it replaced again at no or limited cost to you. This part of an insurance policy helps both you and your insurer protect your investment. A car with the proper repairs is less likely to get into accidents or fail to work, and guaranteed repairs give you peace of mind when you have work done. Bear in mind that repairs you pay for out of pocket and not as part of a claim may not be protected under this scheme. Complete Replacement Coverage Many accidents result in minor repairs, and if your car is stolen it may be recovered. However, if you are in a major accident your car may be deemed beyond repair. Likewise, if the policy can't find your car within about a month, they will usually recommend that you file a loss claim with your insurance company. Complete replacement coverage is essential because it helps you buy a new car in these circumstances. You may not recover enough money to fully cover the expense of buying a new car, but you will get enough money to cover the current market value of your Vauxhall. Without complete replacement coverage, you can pay a lot more out of pocket when your vehicle can't be fixed. Comprehensive Drivers Coverage Comprehensive insurance has many benefits, not the least of which is that it covers all drivers to whom you give permission to drive your Vauxhall. If you don't have comprehensive coverage over all drivers, only named drivers might be covered in the event of an accident. For instance, you may loan your car to your teenage son; if he gets into an accident but is not named on the vehicle, your insurer could deny the claim if you don't have him named to the car. With a comprehensive policy, you don't need to worry about naming specific additional drivers to your insurance policy. Legal Cover More comprehensive insurance plans also offer legal cover up to a set amount. For instance, many policies will allow for a maximum of £50,000 in legal coverage. This protects you when you are sued after an accident. This is usually only relevant when you caused the accident, but even the safest of drivers can be liable for an accident at least once in his life. Another driver may try to take legal action against you for the costs they incurred after the accident, including the cost of repairs that were not covered by insurance, car replacement costs, or any medical fees that were not paid for by NHS or a private insurer. Legal cover is essential because without it you could be on the hook for thousands of pounds in no time. Getting car insurance for your Vauxhall is not a decision to be made lightly. The right policy will depend on how much coverage you want for your vehicle's modifications, the number of drivers who need to be covered, and whether or not you want to earn a substantial no claims bonus. However, always make sure that insurance covers some basic elements. While paying for a more comprehensive insurance cover costs more money now than choosing a limited insurance policy, it can offer more financial assistance in the long run. Consider hefty insurance an investment in the safety of your Vauxhall and the protection against major legal fees in the future."
8,Are Your Quotes for Car Insurance for Your Vauxhall Astra Too Expensive? Try These Ideas,autos-trucks," Many people do try comparison-shopping when looking for car insurance and benefits. Car insurance is so expensive, though, that the 10% or 15% that you may save this way isn't likely to be enough. Buying car insurance for your Vauxhall Astra, doing comparison-shopping, for instance, may save you only £30 or so. You'll need more ways to save. Here are a few tips. Use a job title tool Many personal finance websites feature something called a car insurance job title tool. These tools help you get a lower rate by taking advantage of a peculiarity seen in the way insurance companies calculate their risk. Insurance companies carry detailed statistics about the number of claims they get from people in different professions. Their records may tell them that while they get 500 claims each year from journalists, they only get 450 from artists. Right away, they may decide to offer artists a slightly cheaper rate than journalists. Insurance companies take their effort categorizing professions based on risk even further. They rank different kinds of journalists and different kinds of artists on the frequency of their insurance claims, too. Since they get more claims from reporters than from journalists, reporters pay 20% more. Professional caterers come in with more claims than cooks or chefs. For this reason, professional caterers pay 8% more than other workers in a restaurant kitchen. When you fill out the job title field on an insurance comparison form, you need to pay attention to the specific variant of your job that you pick. As long as the variant you pick is a reasonably close description of what you do, you can save between 10% and 20% on your premium, experimenting with different job titles (an additional £30 or so, keeping with the Vauxhall Astra example above). Using a third-party job title checking tool can help you quickly come by the right variant to use for the greatest savings. When your insurance expires, never automatically renew with the same provider You may prefer your current insurance provider for a number of good reasons - you may like their friendly help desk or the way they quickly process claims without quibbling. A desire to stay on with your current insurer is no reason to simply click on the auto-renew link in the renewal notice, though. Many insurers try to take advantage of existing customers by offering them expensive renewal rates, while offering new customers much lower rates for the same product. In their experience, sending out high-priced auto-renew letters works out to be more profitable than sending out quotes that are fairly priced. A large proportion of insurance customers click on auto-renew links without thinking. If you wish to remain with your insurer, you should do it in a different way. You should use an online insurance price comparison tool first to find the lowest price on the market with any insurer. When you have a quote in hand, you should save a copy of the screen with the quote and call your current insurer asking for a price match. You can offer to send proof of the quote over email. Often, insurers offer perks and freebies to new customers, but keep them from renewing customers. If this is the case, you can simply approach your insurer as an all-new customer and let your old policy simply expire. Try adding the name of a more experienced driver to your insurance If you are a young and inexperienced driver or if you have points on your license for motoring convictions, you could have a very hard time getting reasonably priced insurance. If this is your problem, you should look for a friend or family member whose name you can add to your insurance policy as a second driver. This move can halve your insurance quote. If getting an experienced driver with a clean record on your policy sends your premium down, it isn't because the insurance companies suddenly have more confidence in your driving abilities. Instead, it just tells the insurance company that it won't be you driving the car all the time. If another person has his name on your car's insurance policy, they assume that he will be driving the car part of the time, too. The less time a person with a poor record drives a car, the cheaper the insurance on his car can be. Other kinds of name-adding can work, too. Adding the name of a boyfriend or girlfriend to a policy can lower prices, too. Insurance companies see romantic relationships as a sign of stability and responsibility. They believe that people in stable relationships wouldn't want to drive carelessly."
9,How to Save More Money on Car Insurance for Your Renault,autos-trucks," Since most Renault models are modest cars to say the least, if you drive one you're probably not interested in paying steep insurance fees. The good news is that you can get insurance for your Renault on a relatively low budget, but know that you may have to do some work to earn the best savings. Rather than just sticking with the same insurer you've always used, or signing up for a company in the first advert you see, do your research. Taking the time now to evaluate the ways you can save money on car insurance for your Renault may pay off big later. Take Advantage of Free Insurance Offers From time to time Renault offers free insurance for a full year on certain models that are purchased new. For example, in 2013 the car manufacturer offered free insurance for a year on all newly purchased Twingo Renaults and certain models of the Clio. You must be between 21 and 70 to take advantage of these insurance offers, and a minimum of three years without claims may be required. Bear in mind that the three years without claims must be immediately preceding the time when you make your purchase. Getting free insurance on your new car not only saves you money for the first year, but it also gives you plenty of time to find a reasonable insurance rate in the future. Build a No Claims Bonus If you don't file a claim for at least a full year with your insurer, you should ask about a no claims bonus. This bonus will be applied to your bill as a discount on your premium. As long as you don't file a claim, you might save at least 50 percent on your bill. Bear in mind that if you file a claim you will lose the bonus and your premiums may increase. Still, as long as you are not filing any claims this bonus is an easy and significant way to save money on your Renault insurance. You may also be able to pay a nominal amount per year to protect the bonus, so you won't lose it as long as you file no more than two claims in three years. Lock Up Your Car If your car is considered more secure when you're not driving it, your insurance company is likely to give you a discount on your policy. When your Renault is not in use, specifically overnight, store it in a locked garage whenever possible. Parking on the street makes your car more vulnerable to theft, and it can also be hit by a car or even a rogue stone or falling tree branch. You can receive a discount for securing your car overnight -- just be sure to notify your insurance company so you can get the appropriate discount. Install a Tracking Device In addition to securing your car overnight, it's important to secure the car itself. Get a tracking device installed to your Renault, and you could be rewarded financially by your insurance company. A tracking device aids the police when your car is stolen, making it far less likely that you will have to file a total loss claim with your insurance company. This saves your insurer a lot of money, so the company is likely to reward you for having a tracking device in your Renault. To get the maximum discount available, consult with your insurance company prior to installing the device so you know which devices are recommended. You can save money on car insurance for your Renault a number of ways. Perhaps most importantly, do a lot of research before you sign up for any insurance policy. By making yourself a savvy consumer, you will learn how to maximize discounts and take advantage of special offers like free insurance through Renault. Once you have a good rate, be diligent about maintaining it. Speeding infractions, accidents for which you are liable, and late payments are all ways that you may see a premium rate increase or lose your insurance. Check in with your insurer once a year to see if there are any new discounts that may be applied to your policy."
10,4 Things to Know About Performance Car Insurance,autos-trucks," Cars with high performance engines and a high price tag are often put into their own category when it comes to car insurance. The quickness with which your car can reach a high speed is both a potential safety hazard and something that makes your car attractive to thieves. Both of these factors are red flags for insurers, who want to insure cars with a low risk of needing a theft claim and low repair costs. You can certainly shop for discounts, but prepare to be held to a high standard. If you're new to the world of performance car ownership, here are some key considerations regarding insuring your valued car. If an insurance company sees your high performance car as an easy target for theft, your insurance premium will almost certainly increase. A performance vehicle is not inexpensive to replace, making security measures an important upgrade if they are not already factory fitted. Features like an immobiliser will give your insurance more peace of mind. An immobiliser makes it impossible to start your car without the key inserted. A chip inside the key is needed to active two of the three essential start up systems, including the fuel system. This means an end to hotwiring your vehicle. To enjoy cheaper premiums, improve the security system of your car. A performance vehicle may be difficult, or at least expensive, to insure because your insurance company knows that repair claims will be expensive. A single part on a high performance car can take time and labour to track down, and the expense of the equipment itself is likely to have a high price tag. With that in mind, your performance car insurance rate will be increased to help your insurer offset any potential future repair costs. If you can prove that your particular model doesn't require particularly expensive repairs, you may be able to get a lower insurance rate. Despite their notoriously higher rates, premium car insurance plans are not ineligible for discounts. If you add a security modification to stave off would-be thieves, for instance, you can often get a discount on your monthly premium costs. Likewise, parking your car in a locked garage overnight will usually allow you to enjoy cheaper premium rates than when you park on the street. Taking a certified safety test can also encourage your insurer to offer you lower premiums, such as the courses offered by Any Driver and PassPlus. Ask your potential insurance company about which modifications or testing it recommends you to take in order to benefit from discounts. While safety modifications will be rewarded by your insurer, some modifications may make you ineligible for coverage or increase your costs. For instance, if you modify your engine to boost your speed, your insurer may increase your costs. Some modifications are allowed and won't necessarily increase your rates, but your insurer won't be willing to replace their value in an accident. When you add an upgrade to your car, then, it's important to notify your insurance company and ask if you need additional insurance. If you get like-for-like insurance on modifications, your insurance provider will replace it when it's damaged in an accident. Otherwise, your insurer is only responsible to repair your car as it was when it left the factory. You could lose hundreds or thousands of pounds of modification expenses because you did not get the upgrades properly insured. Only your insurance company, or the provider who will hopefully provide your coverage, can offer a detailed picture of what you need to do to achieve the least expensive rates. While online insurance rate search engines can offer a big picture, your specific car may have variables that either increase or decrease your rates. Remember that your insurance company will also evaluate you as a driver. Even if your vehicle is very safe, if you have a history of being liable for accidents you will be penalized with higher rates. Also know that not all performance car insurance policies are available in all postcodes."
11,Tips for Getting the Best Car Insurance for Your Mercedes E Class Car,autos-trucks," The cars in the Mercedes E class are some of the most popular luxury cars available to drivers today. The bummer is that getting car insurance for your Mercedes can take a huge bite out of your wallet. These handy tips can reduce your bill and make your vehicle more affordable to have. Be clear with your insurance representative about the safety features in your vehicle. The Mercedes-Benz brand is known for being exceptional not only in luxury, but also safety. With Mercedes E class vehicles specifically, you get features such as the Pre-Safe Technology system that prepares the car for impact, headlights that adjust automatically for optimum visual clarity and cameras to tell if you are weaving between lanes on the road. All of these safety features lower your risk of getting in a crash and often reduce the severity of the damages or injuries that happen when an accident does happen. Your insurance agent can reward you for this reduced risk, but if you're not clear on all the safety features present in your model, you could miss out on a bigger discount. Bundle your insurance. Many insurance providers offer homeowners and other types of insurance in addition to auto insurance. You often can save money on your Mercedes E class insurance (or vehicle insurance in general) by bundling it with other insurance products you're going to buy anyway, although you need to shop around to see what's actually cheapest. Consider lower horsepower. In general, the majority of Mercedes E class vehicles offer 300 horsepower or more. Considering that a typical car offers somewhere in the neighborhood of 200, you're going to get more oomph out of these vehicles. That said, there's a lot of variance in the engines. If you're looking for a sedan, for instance, the 2014 E250 BlueTEC offers a modest 195 hp, while the E63 AMG 4Matic has 550 hp. Insurance companies associate higher horsepower with higher speeds, because statistically, people who drive these types of cars do drive faster and, therefore, are at a higher risk of an accident. If you are buying a Mercedes, think critically about the amount of power you're really going to use and need and you can save on your premiums by toning it down a notch. Install a security system and use your garage. Similar to safety features, security systems on vehicles lower premiums. Installing one in your Mercedes E class vehicle provides a greater deterrent against theft and vandalism, reducing risk for your insurance provider. In the same way, putting your Mercedes in a secured garage lowers risk by reducing the direct access people have to the car. It also lowers the odds that the vehicle will be damaged by natural events such as a tree falling in a storm or hail. Take a class. Most insurance providers now provide a discount on vehicle premiums if you take a defensive or safe driver class. These apply just as well to Mercedes-Benz vehicles as others. More specifically, however, you can look for a course from Mercedez-Benz or another luxury vehicle manufacturer designed specifically for luxury cars. These classes do offer defensive driving strategies, but they focus more on teaching you to handle the horsepower in your car properly, ensuring that you have the right attitude about how and when to use the vehicle. Drive the vehicle less. This one might seem a little counter-intuitive. After all, why buy an awesome car you're not going to drive? The idea here isn't that you need to let your Mercedes E class sit around collecting dust. It's that kilometers driven are a real consideration when it comes to insurance rates--the more you drive, in theory, the higher your accident risk is, simply because you're on the road more. Save the Mercedes for when you can stretch out and enjoy the ride and use a more everyday vehicle for things like grabbing your groceries. Conclusion Mercedes E class vehicles, similar to most other luxury cars, can be pricey to insure, but you can save on your premiums with a few tips. Tricks like insurance bundling, emphasizing the car's safety features and installing security devices all can reduce your costs, as can keeping your kilometers low and taking driving classes. Even though some of these options have a price tag of their own, over the life of your vehicle, you'll usually recoup those expenses and then some, resulting in good savings."
12,"How to Find Affordable Car Insurance for Your Vauxhall, Even If You're Unemployed",autos-trucks," Car insurance for your Vauxhall isn't cheap, regardless of how you look at it. However, if you're unemployed you'll find that your policy will cost you more than if you had a job. In fact, car insurance policies for someone without a job could cost as much as a third more than a policy for a person with full-time employment. Shouldn't the Unemployed Be Paying Less on Car Insurance? You'd think that insurance companies would be a little more understanding and would give someone without a job a discount on their car insurance. Being unemployed may not be your choice, but your car insurance is still mandatory whether you're working or not. I If you have a car, you need insurance. The only time you can get away with not paying insurance premiums is if you've declared that it's off the road via a Statutory off Road Notice (SORN). Without car insurance and a SORN, you could face serious fines or even have your car seized and destroyed. So, whether you have an income or not, you still need to make sure your car is insured. So, on something that is mandatory by law, you'd expect to be given a break if you happen to be out of work. However, reality isn't quite like that. Insurers calculate your premiums based on a number of factors, including how old you are, whether you have any convictions, and whether you have a job. Based on statistics, insurers assume someone who is unemployed poses a greater risk than a person with a job. One factor insurance companies consider when working out your premium is how frequently you drive. They believe that someone who doesn't have a job will use their car more often because they're out looking for work. To an insurer, driving more often means a higher likelihood of ending up in an accident, so they charge higher premiums to offset the risk. Insurers also use general driver profiles when calculating premiums. These profiles show them that a person without a job is likely to be more distracted, which means they might not be as careful while driving. Additionally, unemployed people are more likely to be driving on unfamiliar roads as they head out for job interviews. Again, this means a higher chance of being involved in a crash, which also translates to more expensive premiums. Insurers also seem to believe that someone who doesn't have a job is less likely to have enough money to maintain their car properly. A poorly maintained vehicle might suffer break downs that could cause an accident. On top of everything else, according to their statistics, insurers claim that unemployed people are more likely to file a claim than someone with a job. In fact, people who have been out of work for a long time will not just file more claims, but they're also more likely to file fraudulent claims. While most of these arguments cited by insurers are debatable, it really doesn't matter. Insurance companies use their own statistics to calculate premiums for unemployed people and there's nothing anyone can do about it. It's just the way things are. If you don't have a job your insurance will be more expensive, even if you drive a Vauxhall Vectra, which falls in a car insurance group towards the cheaper end of the scale. Finding Affordable Car Insurance It's unlikely that you'll be able to find car insurance for your Vauxhall at a rate comparable to what you were paying before. However, that doesn't mean you can't find cheaper car insurance options, even if you're unemployed. Firstly, you need to compare car insurance quotes. You can research different quotes from insurance companies online using any of the handy comparison sites available. Furthermore, many insurers will give you a discount if you purchase your policy online, so take advantage of these offers. Money is probably tight and it's likely you're watching every penny, which is why paying for your insurance upfront might sound painful. However, over the long-term paying your annual premium in a lump sum will save you money. Insurers charge interest when you opt for monthly instalments which can increase the amount you pay. Your bank may also charge you for direct debit agreements you have in place to pay your monthly instalments, which adds even more to your costs overall. Another option is to sell your car and buy something that's cheaper to run and to insure. A Vauxhall Vectra, for example, is in car insurance group 15, whereas some Corsa models are in group 1, making it an even cheaper vehicle to insure. Being unemployed can be difficult and insurers certainly help make your financial situation even more challenging. However, a little research and a bit of practicality will help you save money on your car insurance. Don't forget to inform your insurer as soon as you get a job so they can adjust your premiums accordingly."
13,Car vs. Person Breakdown Cover,autos-trucks," Breakdown cover will protect you from having to pay hundreds of pounds when your car becomes disabled while you're out driving. In some cases, this cover may also extend to your car whilst it is in your driveway or parked outside your home. Automatic service will allow you to avoid fees such as towing costs, car for hire, or even hotel charges when you're away from home. Pay and claim service asks you to pay up front and then offers reimbursement. In both cases, you should pay attention to whether you are covering a person or a vehicle. Each option has its benefits and potential pitfalls. Covering a Car When you cover a car with breakdown insurance, every trip that car makes is included in your coverage. You may be asked to list the drivers in your home, and whenever that particular vehicle breaks down with an approved driver it is eligible for a claim. In some cases, it may be covered no matter who is driving. This type of coverage is often less expensive than covering a person. If you rarely switch vehicles, then covering your car should be ample insurance to ensure that you're never stranded without breakdown cover. Covering a Person You can also choose to cover a person. With this type of breakdown insurance, you are covering yourself as a driver. This cover allows you to remain within coverage even when you drive a friend's car, use a car for hire, or switch vehicles with your spouse. This type of breakdown cover even applies when you're a passenger in someone else's car. Basically, any time you are in any vehicle that is disabled, you are able to enjoy your insurance perks. When you merely cover your car, you are unable to call for assistance if you happen to be the passenger in another vehicle or you swap cars with a friend for the day and have engine trouble. Cost Implications Because covering a person is more comprehensive, this type of cover is usually more expensive than covering a car. Each insurance company defines its own policy guidelines and prices, but in general you can expect to pay a bit more if you want to cover a driver. That being said, if you frequently find yourself driving different cars for work or have multiple vehicles in your family -- the extra cost is worth considering. Bear in mind that breakdown cover is relatively inexpensive, so even a slight increase isn't bound to make major dent in your yearly budget. Other Considerations If you only cover yourself as a driver, remember to add a breakdown cover policy for your spouse. If you are the only one covered, anytime your spouse has car issues when you're not together he won't be able to call for assistance. The alternative is to cover each of the cars in your household. Both types of breakdown cover have certain exclusions. Namely, you are likely to be excluded from claiming on the policy if you fail to have a spare tire in your vehicle when you get a flat, file too many claims within a short period of time, or try to file a claim within a day of purchasing your policy. Some policies may also require you to be a minimum distance from your home address in order to call for help. In theory, if you break down just around the corner from your home, you could walk home and the costs the insurance will absorb for a tow aren't worth it to them. Breakdown cover is generally thought to cover a vehicle. As a result, many people may not realize they can also cover themselves. Always read a plan carefully before you purchase cover. If you think you are covering a person but are instead covering a car, or vice versa, you may be in for a rude surprise when you need help the most. If you already have car insurance with a particular company, consider using the same supplier for breakdown cover. You can often get a discount on your insurance for carrying both policies with the same company -- if a discount is offered, ask for it."
14,Buying a Base Model: Car Insurance for Your Ford Mondeo,autos-trucks," Car insurance is required for all cars in the UK -- not carrying a policy can mean hefty fines or even court appearances. Worse, if you're in a car accident you will have to pay for damages out of your own pocket. Your Ford Mondeo won't cost as much to insure as a high-end performance vehicle. Still, the amount of money that you pay in premiums may increase if you have a model with bells and whistles. If you want to save the most money on insurance, purchase a base model Ford Mondeo; these models are known to carry lower insurance costs with most insurers. Car insurance for your Ford Mondeo can be paid monthly, or in one annual payment. What is a Base Model? A base model Ford Mondeo is usually the least expensive model when brand new. The vehicle comes out of the factory with all of the safety features that you need, but no GPS system, upgraded audio system, or other improvements that are nice to have but not necessary. The engine on a base model is usually a bit smaller than other models as well, so you can't reach the maximum speeds afforded by higher specification cars. A base model Mondeo also offers low CO2 emissions. Because your base model won't be as attractive to thieves and it may not drive as fast, your insurer sees it as a lower risk to insure. This translates to lower premium costs for you. What About Insurance Groups? All cars in the UK are assigned to an insurance group between numbers 1 and 50. Determined by the Group Rating Panel, the insurance group reflects how expensive the repairs and replacement are for your particular car. The higher the number, the more expensive to repair the vehicle. While the insurance group assigned by the rating panel is only a recommendation, your insurance company is likely to use it to guide your premium costs. Ford Mondeos are not all placed in the same group, since there are multiple models. Base models tend to be in groups as low as 7 -- even the models with the most amenities are only in group 28. What if I Add Modifications? If you add modifications to your base model Ford Mondeo, your insurance rates could increase. Engine boosters, flashier tyres, and other changes that make you car more likely to be in an accident are bound to make you a bigger risk to an insurance company. Always report your modifications, because your insurance company may decline a future claim if you don't. On the other hand, security modifications like a tracking device may decrease your premium costs, so you should also report these changes as you make them. Can My Rates Increase? Your base model Ford Mondeo rates can increase for more reasons than just adding modifications. The premium assessed by your insurer takes into consideration factors like your driving record, the amount of mileage you put on the car, and where you park it at night. Just because you have a base model, then, doesn't mean you can maintain a low premium. If you submit multiple claims for accidents or you move to a postcode where more accidents occur, you can also see an increase in your insurance costs. For a more complete understanding of what makes your rates increase, contact your insurance company directly. You can also read the terms and services document associated with your policy, which may name specific things which will either increase or decrease your premium rates. A base model car usually offers lower insurance rates. Still, car insurance for your Ford Mondeo will depend on more factors than just the model you purchase. To enjoy the lowest premiums possible, maintain a positive driving history, park your car in a locked garage overnight, and don't take it on long road trips on a regular basis. Your base model may also be a diesel or petrol model, and each have different premium schemes. You are apt to pay more for a diesel engine, even on a Ford that has few amenities above the basics. Bear that in mind as you select the car that you want to purchase and insure."
15,Price Increases on Car Insurance for Women? How to Avoid a Rate Increase,autos-trucks," Until the end of 2012, women across the UK were afforded car insurance premiums which were cheaper on average than the policies sold to their male counterparts. Thanks to statistics that suggest female drivers are involved in less accidents, at least before the age of 40, women were sold more budget friendly insurance. However, with the advent of a ban prohibiting insurance companies from factoring gender into insurance rates, if you are a woman in the UK you probably saw a rate increase. If you've been bemoaning the higher insurance costs on car insurance for women -- here are some ways to bring your rate back down. Add Security Features to Your Car Gender was only just one factor considered in the calculation of a car insurance premium. Other details, like how likely your car is to be stolen are also key to determining if you are a high risk driver. If you want to enjoy lower insurance premiums, consider investing in an immobiliser or tracking device for your vehicle. While you will have to pay for this modification up front, you may be able to negotiate a discount from your insurer. You can also have more peace of mind about your car being recovered if it is the target of a successful car theft. Build a No Claims Bonus You can build a no claims bonus in as little as one year. Essentially, this bonus gives you a discount off of your monthly bill by simply not filing any claims on your policy. Not all insurers offer this bonus automatically, so always inquire about it when you are deciding on a car insurance policy. You can enjoy significant savings on premium costs with a no claims bonus -- as much as 30 percent after a single year. Some insurers will allow you to build your bonus each year, reaching the maximum bonus after five years. Bear in mind that if you do file a claim, you will lose the bonus and your premiums may increase on top of that -- exponentially raising your insurance bills. Lower Your Mileage The less you drive your car, the more inclined an insurer will be to lower your insurance rate. If your insurance rates are too high, consider incorporating more public transport, ride sharing, and walking into your routine. When you report a lower mileage to your insurer, you appear as a lower risk. Drivers who use their cars for a long daily commute are simply in more situations where they can get into an accident and the insurance company notices. If you are asked to estimate your mileage, be honest but don't err on the high side. Bundle with Breakdown Cover If you're a woman who doesn't know her way around changing a flat tyre or inspecting an engine, you may have breakdown cover on your vehicle. This cover steps in when you are stranded on the side of the road in a disabled car and need a technician to attempt roadside repairs or tow your vehicle to a nearby garage. Don't pay for breakdown cover with a different company than the one that holds your car insurance policy. When you bundle breakdown cover with your regular car insurance policy, you can often get a discount on both insurance policies. The next time you need to renew your car insurance policy, be sure to inquire about adding a breakdown cover to it. Then, of course, cancel other breakdown cover that you are already paying for. Car insurance for women used to be widely accepted as a cheaper cover than what men were asked to pay. However, since this is no longer the case it's important to be diligent about seeking out discounts and opportunities to lower monthly bills. By minimizing the use of your car and limiting the number of claims you submit, you can see savings within the year. The next time you're in the market for a new car, pay attention to insurance groups. Cars with a lower group number are considered to be less costly to repair or replace and often have lower premiums attached to them."
16,The Advantages of Diesel,autos-trucks," Diesel engines, like gasolene engines, are both internal combustion engines. Fuel is mixed with air when it goes into the engine and that mixture is compressed internally, within the engine’s cylinders. After a while, the fuel ignites, driving the piston down and turning the shaft, that is connected to the vehicle’s transmission and turns the wheels. The piston then moves up within the cylinder, which pushes the gases out of the engine and out the pipe as exhaust. Then the cycle repeats, many times per second. If the engine has additional cylinders, it tends to run better and therefore build additional power since the combustion events happen terribly close in time. However, the greater the number of cylinders an engine has, the more advanced and inefficient the engine becomes. Depending how the cylinders are organized conjointly incorporates a bearing on performance, vibration and different factors. That’s true for gas and diesel engines. Where diesel and gas engines differ however is the fuel enkindled within the engine. In a gasoline engine, the air and fuel is compressed and at a certain point within the order of the cycle, a plug ignites the gas. However in a diesel motor, there are not any spark plugs. Once diesel oil and air are squeezed enough, the acute compression generates enough heat that the mixture then combusts. This is often called ""compression ignition,"" and it’s the premise of how a diesel motor works. Once an internal-combustion engine has combustion ignition, we usually name it ""knock"" and it will ruin the engine. However diesel engines are engineered to make the most of it. Because diesel motors use compression ignition, which may quickly ruin a gasoline engine, they have to be created terribly robust. And since they are available from a workhorse heritage, they have an inclination to be extremely reliable and want a minimum of care. Each one accustomed means plenty of additional weight, however with trendy producing ways, the load penalty for a diesel motor has been greatly reduced and therefore the engine’s weight is currently usually on par with gas engines. Also, a diesel motor is much more straightforward than a gasoline engine since it's got no spark plugs and therefore the associated electrical system required for them. So now, cars and SUVs will run on diesel and have performance more similar to a gasoline engine, however with the fuel consumption rate and responsibility of a diesel motor. In general, a diesel motor can outlive a gasoline engine in terms of what number of miles or hours it will run before it desires major service, thus repair bills are smaller and usually a lot longer apart for a diesel motor."
17,How to Drive Stick Shift,autos-trucks," These days, it's difficult to find a vehicle with a standard transmission unless you specifically look for one. Most modern cars are automatic. However, knowing how to drive a stick shift is a useful skill to have. You never know if you'll find yourself needing to drive a vehicle with a manual transmission. Here's a short guide to help you get started. Familiarize Yourself Knowing the differences between a standard and an automatic transmission and familiarizing yourself with these differences is the biggest hurdle in learning to drive stick. Give yourself some time to sit in the vehicle without driving and get to know the layout. You'll notice an additional pedal on the left side of the floor. This is the clutch. The clutch is what allows you to shift gears. Also take note of the gear box. Most vehicles have 5 gears, plus reverse. Reverse is pretty self-explanatory. The rest of the gears are ordered in regards to wheel rotations. It's just like a bike: A lower gear has many wheel rotations per a certain energy input, while a higher gear has fewer wheel rotations for that same energy input. In general, you use the higher gears when driving faster or going down a steep hill. Have Someone Help You Find a friend or family member who knows how to drive a stick shift and see if they'll help you learn. First have them start, drive, and park the car with you in it. Have them explain when they shift gears, which gear they shift to, and why. Next, you get in the driver's seat. Have them slowly walk you through starting, driving, and parking. It's best to have someone knowledgeable with you the first few times driving so you don't permanently damage the car, which can easily happen to beginners. Practice, Practice, Practice! The clutch only works when you're aren't accelerating, or using the accelerator pedal. And after you've switched gears, you want to step off the clutch and on to the gas pedal at the same time. Practice stepping on the clutch and off the pedal, moving the gear stick, and disengaging the clutch and accelerating. The quicker you can do it, the better. Memorize where each gear is located on the gear box. Practice shifting and getting to know where each is located by feel. Learn the intricacies of your car and when's the best time to upshift or downshift. With a lot of practice, you'll be able to tell by feel and the sound of your car what gear you should shift to."
18,How can you buy auto body parts online,autos-trucks," If your car or bike has come across any mechanical failure of any kind, you would for sure to take it to any repair shop? There you may have the possibility of buying unfamiliar auto body parts.

19,What is Car Insurance and How Does it Work?,autos-trucks," Car insurance is a policy that is purchased for cars to provide financial protection against physical damage or bodily injury from an accident or against liability that can occur from accidents. It is also known as auto insurance and can be purchased for private cars, trucks, public motor vehicles as well as motorcycles. Most car insurance will cover medical fees for the insured party, physical damage for insured vehicle, theft, fire and damages caused for third party insurance. Some insurance companies also offer to pay the cost to rent a vehicle if yours is damaged and the cost of towing the damaged vehicle to a repair facility. Regulations on Insurance Insurance policies vary in legal regulations in different areas, but for most places, it is compulsory to insure cars before using and getting them on the road as this is normally related to both the car and the driver. The most common known car insurances are: the compulsory third party insurance which mainly covers personal injury and liability, with it is also a comprehensive cover that covers damage to someone else, property, or the vehicle, as well as your own and a third party insurance that seeks to recover damage to other properties or vehicles, but not yours. In addition to this, are other car insurance companies like private car insurance, which is mainly for private cars and commercial car insurance, which is for trucks. Variances in Insurance Policies Usually, for most car insurance policies there are flexible contributions paid each time a car is repaired with charges billed to insurance policy and are referred as excess and payments are done directly to the accident repair when the owner collects the car. One of such excess contribution is the compulsory excess where minimum excess payments are given to the insurer and the voluntary excess which is an extra amount above the compulsory excess to be paid in the event of claim on policy."
20,Top Ten Motoring Offences,autos-trucks," Failing to provide driver information When you commit an offence, you will receive an S172 request. You will receive 6 penalty points for not returning the form. The available defences you can use are S172(4) and s172(7)(b) RTA 1988. A defence is valid if you demonstrate that you have used reasonable diligence to track down who was driving the vehicle at the time of the offence, or that you have never received the request form to provide the necessary information. No insurance The offence of driving without insurance, assumes the drivers guilt in the first instance. If you plead guilty or are convicted, your licence will be endorsed with 6 - 8 points. It is quite common for a policy to be cancelled due to a missing payment, and for the driver to be unaware that they are not legally covered. A special reasons argument can be used if you can show the court that you genuinely and honestly believed that you had insurance in place. Speeding The penalty for speeding offences is 3 - 6 points, a discretionary ban if warranted by your offence, court costs as well as a fine. S89 Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 contains the law on speeding offences. Contesting speeding allegations has become more difficult recently following recent case law, meaning that you now need to provide expert evidence if you are going to be successful. Drink driving The legal drink driving limit is 35mg in breath. Drink driving carries a minimum driving ban of 12 months. The three defences for drink driving are that you were not the driver of the vehicle, you were not driving in a public place, or that you didn't drink alcohol until after you had finished driving. Avoiding a drink driving ban is also possible if you are able to prove that you unwittingly drank the alcohol, that it was an emergency situation or that you only drove a short distance. If you have been stopped for drinking and driving in the London area then you need to speak to specialist drink driving solicitors London who will be able to help you to keep on the road. Drunk in charge of a vehicle To be found guilty, the prosecution need to show that you were above the legal drink drive limit and that you were in charge of the vehicle at that time. A defence for drunk in charge is to show the court that you didn't plan to drive until you were under the drink drive limit. If you are found guilty then you face 10 points and a discretionary driving ban. Mobile phone A mobile phone offence is deemed to have been committed if you are holding & using the phone while driving. Using a mobile can be a grey area and consequently some courts have differing opinions on the offence. Being stationary at traffic lights or in a temporary hold up is still classed as driving. Driving without due care and attention Your driving level needs to be proved to have dropped below the level of a competent and careful driver if you are to be convicted of driving without due care and attention. Motoring offences covered by driving without due care include things such as low speed car park bumps, scrapes and dings, as well as undertaking on a motorway. At the discretion of the police you can be offered a Driver Improvement Course instead of prosecution. Failing to stop/report an accident If following an accident, damage was caused to property, a person or another vehicle, then you are legal under a duty in accordance with S170 RTA 1988 to stop and exchange details. After an accident, you have up to 24 hours to report the accident to the police if you were not able to exchange your details at the time. Carrying 5 - 10 penalty points or a  discretionary ban this is a serious offence. If you don't know damage has been caused, you have a defence if you can show it was reasonable you didn't know that you had been involved in an accident. Dangerous driving To gain a conviction against you, the prosecution needs to establish that at the time of the offence, your driving standard fell far below that required, and also that it was obvious to any competent and careful driver that the driving was dangerous. This is a serious motoring offence and as such carries a minimum 12 months driving licence ban, which includes an extended re-test before you can drive again, as well as a possible prison sentence if your circumstances warrant it. No licence This offence causes confusion. If you are not displaying L plates and have never passed a driving test then this is an example of an endorseable offence. Should the DVLA request that you return your driving licence to them and they suspend your driving entitlement, this would be non-endorseable. It's not the case that your insurance is invalid in the case of 'no insurance' offences, this is a misnomer."

2,"Chip Sealing, to extend the lifetime of Roads",autos-trucks," The Asphalt of roads is very strong, but it still can't hold for ever. When the Asphalt comes loose, the state of the road can be in real trouble and mostly the drivers as well. But there are many techniques available to repair the road, but most of these techniques are not what you would call cheap, unlike the chip sealing, which can be used to repair the road at a lower cost. This is Chip Sealingy Chip Sealing is a way of paving the road with asphalt and chips (crushed stones) to repair the surface of the road. The new layer of asphalt and chips is directly laid on the old surface, before this can be done the roads needs to be roughly repaired so that there aren't any holes left. This new layer is about 5 centimeters thick and therefore very much cheaper than rebuilding the road in complete. The Advantages The main advantage are the lower costs, but that's not all. Also the time the road can be used can be largely extended, which means less work needs to be done and therefore the road will not be closed for a long time. Because the new pavement is a bit rougher it provides more grid for the cars, so every braking maneuver will need less time to stop. Safety is all in all an important factor, not only the braking but also the better conditions when its raining can help to reduce fatal accidents. In hot conditions, like on very warm day in the summer, the road can heal itself because of the asphalt which then melts and closes the cracks by following back together. The Disadvantages The chip sealing can only be used at roads with less than 2500 cars per day and it shouldn't be used at roads mainly made for trucks or other very big vehicles. The Surface will get smoother from time to time and therefore the safety of the road will change, the drivers need to adjust their driving style accordingly. The chip sealing is only an technique to extend the lifetime but earlier or later the road must be rebuild. But other from these disadvantages the chip sealing really is the perfect method so save money, extend the lifetime of the road and ultimately save energy and thereby the environment. There are more information available on this subject at the wikipedia and the whole net."
3,What To Do In The Event of A Car Accident,autos-trucks," As a driver there comes a time in your driving life that through no fault of your own or sometimes perhaps even by an oversight, you will have an accident with your car. The question is, what do you do if you have an accident with a car that you have insured with an insurance company? There is a lot of  information that you should equip yourself with about claiming when you have an accident with your car. Some of these are: You should first check the severity of the damage to your car to see whether it will be better not to claim as this may affect your no claim bonus, because if you lose part or all of your car insurance no claim bonus, this may cost you more. In such a case, it would be better to fix the car with your own money. If you are sure that you need to make a car accident claim after your car is damaged, you will need to phone your insurance company to let them know about the accident as soon as you can. You should remember to ask the company to send you a claim form, and do not forget to note the name of the insurance company staff member you speak to. If you have an accident in which the other person’s car, but not your car,  is damaged you will have to report the accident to your insurance company, because the damaged car’s owner might want to make a claim against you. So it is important that your insurance company knows about this information at the earliest opportunity. After an accident with your car, you should try to have about two estimates for the car repairs. Be aware that the insurance company may want to come around to inspect the extent of the car damage, therefore wait to see what the company intends to do before you start the repairs on your car. Fill in the insurance claim form when it arrives and return it together with the car repair estimates. You should do this even when you are not so sure if you want to make a claim. You can even attach a written note stating that it is only for information purpose and that you may change your mind later and make a claim if the need arises. Make sure whatever format of information you send to the insurance company that you have a copy of your own. The company should be able to get back to you with a confirmation letter within a week of receiving your claim form. If you have not heard from them within this time period, phone them to know what you should do next. If you are told to go ahead with the repairs, make sure you get the name of the person from the insurance company you speak to."
4,Distracted Drivers a Major Factor in Motor Vehicle Accident Rates,autos-trucks," Cell phones, smart phones and navigation systems have revolutionized the way we live.  We can now be available to family and business associates around the clock and get where we need to be using a device that guides us.  However, using these devices while driving distracts us from what we should be focusing on – driving safely.  It’s no secret that distracted drivers are a major contributing factor to motor vehicle accident rates across the United States. Endangering Drivers, Passengers and Bystanders According to research published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, driver inattention plays a role in nearly 80 percent of crashes and 65 percent of near–crashes.  The study identified driver distraction as a contributing factor in 93 percent of rear-end collisions. When drivers are distracted by any activity, whether talking on a cellphone, texting or tuning a radio, their responses to changing traffic conditions are delayed. A delayed reaction leads to a slower braking response, shorter stopping distances, and higher impact collisions because the distracted driver hasn’t applied the brakes in time, according to a 2011 report by the NHTSA and the World Health Organization. Distracted driving makes it more likely that a driver will endanger the lives of passengers, bystanders and themselves.  Drivers who use cell phones are four times as likely to get into crashes serious enough to cause injury, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). An analysis of police-reported data in the U.S. Department of Transportation indicates that 3,331 people were killed and 393,000 were injured in crashes that involved distracted driving in 2011, according to the IIHS. It is likely that these numbers actually underestimate the role of distracted driving as a contributing factor in crashes. According to the NHTSA’s website, Distraction.Gov, the most common types of distractions that lead to serious injury or death include: •	Texting •	Using a cell phone or Smartphone •	Eating and drinking •	Talking to passengers •	Grooming •	Reading, including maps •	Using a navigation system •	Watching a video •	Adjusting a radio, CD player, or MP3 player Texting and using hand-held phones while driving are probably the most dangerous activities, as they require users to take their eyes off the road – and many of those distracted drivers cause severe rear-end collisions because they fail to brake before impact. Failure to Brake Before Impact Responsible for Severe Rear-End Collisions Good driving reflexes have undoubtedly saved many lives.  While all drivers get distracted, quick reactions can avoid or lessen the severity of car accident injuries.  However, those quick reactions generally require paying attention to the road and the other drivers around you.  Drivers who fail to apply their brakes when an accident is imminent make rear-end collisions worse and often cause severe injury or even death to those in the car they hit. At the Horn Law Firm, we take responsible driving seriously.  Through Drive By Example, a community service organization dedicated to advancing driver safety, our firm has partnered with schools, law enforcement, community groups and others to help implement effective driver safety campaigns that encourage drivers to model the habits and behaviors that protect them, their passengers and others on the roadway."
5,Small Fleet Vehicles Not Always the Best Option,autos-trucks," Rising gas prices are a source of concern for fleet managers. When the price for a barrel of oil spikes, some managers scramble to downsize their fleet with smaller more fuel efficient options. At face value, this makes sense. Smaller vehicles tend to get better gas mileage. However, this type of kneejerk decision making can hurt your business in the long run. Fleet managers can sometimes get blinded by the term ""fuel efficient."" It’s important to consider how your company uses fleet vehicles. Going from a six-cylinder to a four-cylinder engine may be good for gas mileage, but how does it affect your business operations? Will it impact your company’s ability to successfully complete responsibilities to customers and clients? Take this example – a fleet manager for a construction company decides to purchase smaller less powerful vehicles because of high gas prices. While the vehicles save on fuel, the maintenance budget skyrockets because the vehicles are being pushed beyond their limits. The key is to discuss your business operations with a fleet vehicle expert. Often times this might be a dealership, which specializes in commercial vehicle sales. They can help you find the right options that can help cut fuel costs without sacrificing on performance. In fact, purchasing high-performing fuel efficient vehicles is only part of the solution. To control fuel costs, you also need to take a multi-faceted approach. This might include: Educating drivers on driving and vehicle maintenance Closely monitoring fuel usage and idling Installing GPS technology to improve driving routes Upgrading fleet management software to improve productivity Reducing vehicle cargo weight The point is that there isn’t a single, cure-all solution for containing fleet costs because of rising fuel prices. Fleet managers have been waging this war for more than a decade now. What you need to understand is that it’s usually better to thoroughly review your situation and identify several solutions to help cut costs. Working with an outside expert can help you identify the right vehicles as well as the right options to help you reduce fuel costs. When shopping for fuel efficient fleet vehicles, look for ones that offer impressive fuel economy, but do not sacrifice on power and torque. In fact, some truck manufacturers have significantly improved vehicle aerodynamics and engine efficiency to provide better fuel efficiency. Vehicle manufacturers are continually developing new technologies to improve fuel efficiency without sacrificing performance. Some of the things you might see in high performance fleet vehicles down the road to improve fuel efficiency might include: Auto start/stop technology to reduce idling Active grille and wheel shutters for aerodynamics Drop-down front wind spoilers to improve underbody airflow Power running boards that tuck up against vehicle for better aerodynamics While gas prices continue to fluctuate, it’s good to know that there are plenty of options to help you solve the problem. Just remember, there isn’t a cure-all solution to the problem."
6,Shopping for new cars,autos-trucks," Even when you have a virtually unlimited amount of money at your disposal, you still may not know how and where to buy a convenient and reliable car. First and foremost, you should remember that your main goal is safe driving. Driving a super-expensive car is not as important as safe driving. Luxury cars are surely better for the most relaxing and comfortable ride. But when you drive such a car, you can eventually forget about your safety. You may or may not feel all the potholes and bumps on the road. You may not even notice all the vibrations and shocks. It is so quiet in a luxury car that even the noise of the engine is muted to a minimum. For this reason, the car always seems too slow, even when the speed is more than 100 km/hour. If you are planning to buy your very first car, it is better to shop for the class B or C vehicle. These small-sized cars allow you to quickly learn the rules of city traffic. It is also easier to control a small-sized car. Another big advantage of the small-sized vehicles is the ease of parking. As for the jeeps and other large vehicles, it is very hard to explain why so many people adore these huge and not-so-efficient vehicles. In some cases, you will have to pass additional exams to be allowed to drive a jeep. This is mainly because driving a jeep is somewhat more complex than driving a sedan. The biggest problem is in the fact that jeeps and SUVs are quite large, and the stopping distance is much higher than when you drive a sedan. In addition, due to the large size of your vehicle, you can eventually overlook a small car passing by. For many drivers, a car with a powerful engine is nothing more than unnecessary expenses. Those drivers who live in big cities often admit that they cannot find proper application for their SUVs and jeeps. For this very reason, car manufacturers offer a selection of more than 20 engines for different cars. Of course, with such a huge selection, it may seem to be quite hard to make the right choice.  Still, the things are not that complicated, when you learn more about different vehicles and the recommended horsepower. Another mistake made by almost all novice drivers is the desire of having an all-wheel drive car. Such a car may have a higher throughput, but it also has huge disadvantages. For example, in critical situations, even professional drivers can lose control of such cars. A rear-wheel drive car is also not the best option for the novice drivers. After all, such vehicles are prone to drift of the rear axles, which does not pose a threat at first glance. In this case, the front-drive car is the best possible choice. The front drive is more predictable on the road than any other type of drives. Besides, almost all modern vehicles are equipped with the front-wheel drive."
7,Ferrari Going Electric,autos-trucks," The New LaFerrari When I first found out about the LaFerrari, I can honestly tell you I didn't believe it. Ferrari developing a hybrid, can you catch me one of those flying pigs while you're at it? But now that I have looked at this wonderful piece of machinery I kind of wish I had a million pounds lying around. The LaFerrari is the most powerful Ferrari to date and only weighs 1255kg. On top of these starting statistics for a hybrid, the car consumes 40 percent less fuel than other Ferrari supercars! However if you want to get down to some basic stats that will leave you hating your Lamborghini, the LaFerrari has a top speed of over 220mph and can do 0-62 in under 3 seconds! I wonder what it is like to see a Lamborghini Aventador in your mirrors. Probably pretty good. After looking at the statistics I started to say, ""Hold up, with these stats how this supercar is a hybrid I do not know.""  So I did a little bit more research, this supercar is no more a hybrid than the dodo is a bird. It technically is a hybrid but with a V12 Engine producing 800PS and an electric engine producing 163PS. That means the LaFerrari is just under 20% electric making it the most one sided hybrid to hit the market yet! However for everyone who likes to read between the lines. Ferrari has created the first hybrid supercar and there is a reason behind their madness. They have released 499 of these supercars which mean they do not want it to be available for mass purchase but they do want potential customers to drive them.  So too highlight the facts simply, Ferrari have created a hybrid supercar and are only letting 499 people try it out. You know what that says to me? A test. Ferrari are using the LaFerrari to see how well the public take to the hybrid supercar because let’s face it even if it is in a hundred years time, fossil fuels will run out and that means the supercars that survive are going to be Hybrid. And Ferrari is leading the way."

So it will be more help complete with Pre Purchase Car Inspection. Examination A save vehicle inspection conducted by an approved situation associate includes all places of a car needed for it to function securely in Mo. This inspection includes such places as braking mechanism elements as well as wheels, fatigue program, energy program, protection straps, bumpers, signaling devices, and mirrors; each of which has its own analyze factors. For example, braking mechanism examining includes the examiner performing a decelerator analyze that analyze the car deceleration performance at a speed between 5 and 20 mph. And these are most important reasons for examination."
9,Mandatory Automobile examination Aspects,autos-trucks," During automobile examinations, the job of the automobile examiner is to create sure that there are no energy leaking that could be a risk to the community.

11,Keeping Your Car In Tip-Top Shape,autos-trucks," After purchasing this gig, I decided that we didn't need this service at the minute, so can we convert this order to the following gig instead ""I will do article submission to 15 high PR sites manually for $5 "" I'll paste the information below, ok thanks much! Other than your house, your car is probably one of your biggest investments. For that reason, it is essential that you keep it in prime condition so it will retain its value over time. Whether you plan to keep your cars until they will no longer move or like to trade them in for a newer model every few years, it is wise to keep your cars in good condition. After all, if you are going to continue to use them, you want them to be reliable; if you are going to sell them, you want them to bring in the highest profit possible. Here are some ideas on how to keep your cars in mint condition: Wash Them This may seem like an obvious one, but it is too often overlooked. Going through the car wash or even using a good old fashioned hose, soap, and sponge is relatively easy and inexpensive. However, the benefits of this simple task are numerous. Not only does it keep your car looking new and sleek, but it also helps prevent serious damage. Salt and other materials on the roads can eat away at the paint and also the undercarriage of your vehicle, causing both aesthetic and body harm to your car. Just like it is unwise to forgo your own hygiene, it is a bad idea to skip out on washing your cars. Take Them in for Check-ups A car needs regular maintenance to minimize the risk of serious problems down the road. The oil needs to be changed regularly (exactly how often will depend on a number of factors, such as the amount you drive your car and whether you use synthetic oil). Additionally, tire pressure should be checked and the engine and other inter-workings should be surveyed occasionally just to make sure they are in good working order. Similar to a person who gets a physical at the doctors, a car that gets a regular check-up is more likely to be diagnosed with conditions before they become a more serious and expensive issue. Treat it with Respect Finally, treat your vehicle with the respect it deserves. Drive prudently, following all laws and traffic signals. Try to avoid slamming on the brakes or other such actions that cause undue stress to your car. After all, if you treat it right, it's more likely to serve you faithfully well into the future."
12,There Are Several Techniques All Car Sales Professionals Must Follow If They Want To Close the Deal,autos-trucks," Anyone that sells cars as a way to make a living is very familiar with three words, ""closing the deal"". The difference between successful car sales professionals and those that are not as successful is how sharp their closing skills are. The more skilled you are at closing deals successfully can literally make or break your sales career. There are several methods that you should consider following if you truly want to have a higher percentage of sales. Both new and experienced sales professionals can benefit from learning these methods and implementing them into their sales pitch. You can even practice these techniques with friends and relatives until they become second nature to you. Always Assume Your Customer Is Buying It is important that you act and speak like your customer has already decided to make the purchase. Allow your speech and actions to naturally reflect that a deal is on the table. If you begin to act in this manner, your customer may also begin to follow suit. You keep talking as if the deal is done, and in the end, the customer will either purchase the car from you or they will object to some stipulation of the contract. If they begin to object during the closing, you can counteract these objections. Simply Ask Them to Purchase the Car This is a very simple technique, but many car sales professionals that are not very experienced fail to ever ask their customers to buy the car. They will explain all of the features of the car, and talk extensively about how nice the car is, but they do not ask the customer to purchase the car. This is something that you must do continually during the closing, and if they object, you need to continue with another technique. Create a Sense of Urgency Anyone that has spent any time in the sales industry will tell you that it is very important that you try to sell when the customer is in front of you because someone that promises to come back seldom does. Most customers that you will encounter during your career as a car sales professional will tell you that they are either just looking or they are short on time. Your job as the sales professional is to make them buy the car whilst they are there. You can create urgency by telling them that a sale is about to end, or anything that will make them think they will be missing out if they do not buy NOW. Although you want to create a sense of urgency, you do not want to use high pressured tactics. This will only push them away. Allow Them to Say Yes Easily The best thing you can do whilst you are with a customer is to listen to them. If you listen closely enough, you will hear what they desire and need out of this car. Add this bit of information into your closing. Once you ask them about their needs in your closing, their answers will most likely be ""yes!"" This is when you will show them how you will be able to deliver those needs in one of the cars on your lot."
13,What The Car You Drive Says About You,autos-trucks," At one time the car you drove said much more about you than being an illustration of your taste in automotive engineering. The car that you drove gave people an insight into the kind of life you were leading, what kind of job you had, and more importantly just how much money you were earning. The car has always been and will remain to be a status symbol of wealth and power, but these days, as far as the average man in the street is concerned it’s getting a lot harder to judge the lifestyle of the driver just by looking at the type of car that he drives. One of the standard dinner party questions that were bandied about at social events was about the kind of car that you were currently driving. Not that the person was actually interested in the car itself, but the answer that was given revealed more about income and social standing than any background check ever could. No one likes to ask questions about money, that is still one social taboo that remains more or less intact, but indirect questions seem to be acceptable. Social Hierarchy of the Car Traditionally, if you said you were driving a German made car such as an Audi or a BMW you were considered to be doing well - money was flowing and your life was on the up. If you were driving an Italian made car or a vehicle made by a French manufacturer such as a Citroen or a Fiat, then you were considered to have high aspirations, but not the money to back them up. Those that drove a Ford were thought to be sensible as far as financial matters were concerned. If you admitted you were the owner and driver of a British made car then you were expected to hit rock bottom pretty soon, and for those who drove a car made in the Far East such as a Toyota or a Nissan, well you never said it out loud as to do so would be social suicide. All of this has now been turned on its head and the answer someone gives when you ask them about the car that the drive will tell you next to nothing about their financial stability or their social status. Looks Can Be Deceiving The Mercedes Benz that was once the epitome of luxury for the executive on the move is now just as likely to be seen doing the school run, driven by a mother of two. The brand names which once offered style, class and sophistication have had to broaden their range in order to remain a contender in today’s market. With cars ranging in price from £14,000 to £350,000 telling someone that you drive a Mercedes means next to nothing in terms of revealing your finances. Several years ago if you had admitted to driving a Volkswagen you would have been thought to have been hard up, and pictured behind the wheel of a battered old camper van whereas now VW have a range of vehicles to suit just about every pocket, no matter how shallow or deep they may be."
14,How Your First Car Will Change Your Life,autos-trucks," Owning your first car will change your life more than you think. It’s not just a case of not having to wait outside in the wind, hail or snow for an overcrowded and smelly bus either. Your life will change because people will treat you differently, look at you differently and in some ways treat you more like an adult with responsibilities. Owning your first car is indeed a rite of passage just like puberty but rather than affecting your physical body it changes the way that the world perceives you, and the way that it treats you. A Friend For All Seasons Once word gets out that you have a car of your own and are fully mobile, you really do become a friend for all seasons, especially the cold and wet ones. You may even find that people who never used to give you the time of day are willing to spend time with you and hang out with you. This is because you have something that they desire, something that they need, a means of personal transportation that could come in very handy should there be a party that they need to get to, a gig that they need transportation for, or something bulky that they need to transport. And best friends they will remain for as long as they can use you. Yes it may mean that you get invited to some of the best parties and brilliant gigs, but remember that these new friends can drop you as soon as someone comes along with a better car or they get transport of their own. Money What Money? You may have been the one in the gang that always had money spare at the end of the week, which is probably why you thought you would be able to run a car. Well that is really going to change. Cars simply eat money, and if you have money put aside for a special occasion, they will come up with an occasion of their own such as a blown exhaust that will eat right into that little stash. You will go from being the well off mate to the guy always looking for petrol money. You Will Form A Bond Your car will become less of an inanimate object to you and more of a four wheeled friend. You will talk to your car, make deals with your car, sing in the car and generally start treating it as though it has its own personality. You will find yourself making bargains about buying something nice for it, or taking it to the car wash for a full valet or something else incredibly silly, just so that it starts as soon as you turn the ignition key, gets you to where you are going on time, or makes it to the service station before you totally run out of fuel. It might sound silly, but just about every car owner is guilty of doing it, just as you will be."
15,Auto Insurance And The Importance Of Having Coverage,autos-trucks," No matter how often you drive, in each and every state you must have adequate insurance coverage.  Most states by law require that a automobile be covered before you take to the roads in order to avoid bad situations becoming worse should a car accident arise.  To provide your family the most appropriate insurance coverage, there a few things you need to keep in mind when choosing the right insurance company for your particular needs. First of all, it’s a good idea to visit the web page for your state’s department of insurance.  You may possibly not have known that your state even has this type of website, but each one does.  Consumer reviews both negative and positive on insurance companies operating within the state are listed on each states department of insurance and also any auto claim complaints.  It could be tempting to assume that a big name company will provide satisfactory service, but it could be that a smaller Ballston Lake automobile insurance company provides much better customer support and rates.  Making it possible to narrow down your list of needs when it comes to auto insurance, Ballston provides basic rate comparison to a larger recognized insurance company. Checking with local body shops in a particular area could be a good plan to ensure you're going with a company who will be able to pay for local shops to repair damage should there ever be a car accident.  The manager of a repair shop that you trust and frequent can provide an interesting perspective.  They typically deal with insurance adjusters and various companies and can give some insight into which companies are the easiest to work with in regards to both process and staff when trying to collect on a claim for a vehicle that has been damaged in an accident.  In an effort to cut cost, some insurance companies try and push for recycled parts verses new original equipment and a body shop will know which companies generally go that route which is not the better option when it comes to your car's safety. For major insurance businesses and the coverage they offer, J.D. Power and Associates have rating surveys that could be extremely helpful.  Their website will help in comparing prices, claims handling, and overall client satisfaction while rating some of the major auto insurers in a yearly report. If you’re still having difficulty finding a Ballston Lake auto insurance company to cover your needs, check with a neighborhood agent.  There are two kinds of agents; independent agents plus captive agents.  Based on your needs, an independent agent acts as a broker for many insurance providers therefore they will help decipher for you the many policies and costs, enabling you to get the best insurance possible.  While selling the business's insurance, a captive agent will represent only one company. Having your own insurance professional is a great advantage because it means this person has an interest in keeping you happy as a customer of theirs.  They can more easily become familiarized with your specific situation and help guide you in finding the very best policy available for your needs and your budget range while helping to establish a good relationship between the two of you."
16,The New Seat Leon Is Stylish Inside And Outside,autos-trucks," The New Seat Leon Is Stylish Inside And Outside The latest SEAT Leon is the third car to be built on the VW Group’s much praised MQB platform. This platform will eventually be used in almost 30 cars from the Polo to Passat. The Leon is the trendiest car yet being built on the MQB platform. This car is smaller than its predecessor; it’s got a larger wheelbase for extra interior space and the boot is bigger too. Quality has been improved, with better interior and precise body panel gaps. The comfort has been improved too thanks to a much relaxing ride. Its engines and gearboxes have also come from the Mk7 Golf. The Seat Leon is the firm’s fresh ‘Arrow Head’ design language. LED headlights can be had as an option, while the new Leon is also the first vehicle to get the company’s new simpler ‘S’ logo. The interior is much more exciting place to be than the serious Golf, and the quality is top notch too. All models across the range get a touch screen to control the audio and the optional sat-nav. The dials seem to have been borrowed from the expensive Audi A3. The new Leon has been tested for the Euro NCAP safety ratings. However, the body is made from high-strength steel, stability control comes as standard and it has lots of airbags.  As it is built on the MQB platform, it features the same engines and the gadgetry as the new Golf and A3. Despite its elegant looks, the five-door Leon is still a practical car. It has lots of space for front seat passengers. The back doors open wide and there’s lot of leg and headroom for tall passengers. The boot is big with a luggage capacity of 380 litres and is nice and deep. The rear seats don’t fold flat fully. If practicality is what you’re looking for then wait for the Leon ST estate which arrives in late 2013. Its stylish looks don’t mean that the Seat Leon is not practical. It has lots of space for front seat passengers which make a comfortable driving position. The 380 litres boot is very handy. If practicality is what you are looking for than the Leon ST estate arrives later this year. The new Leon is the first car to get its new ‘Arrow Head’ design. The LED headlights are now LED and it gets the new simple ‘S’ logo. Seat Leon has been made with new steel body and it has host of safety equipment on board. It has plenty of air bags which helped it to score a five start Euro NCAP rating. All of the Seat Leon engine range is now turbocharged with direct injection. Some engines have improved efficiency up to 22 per cent from the previous engines. Using the MQB platform Seat has managed to cut weight by 90kg from the outgoing model. The Leon is also 10 per cent more aerodynamic than the previous car. Seat will add an even prudent Ecomotive model emitting just 89g/km, to its range later in 2013. But the Leon’s key plus point is that it’s around 10 per cent cheaper than a Golf on which it is based."
17,Tips For Finding a Great Mechanic,autos-trucks," The economy, did you hear? It is not so good these days. That is all we hear about on the news anymore. Personally, I keep my television set tuned to the Discovery or History channel when I watch TV and stay away from the popular news channels. I know my 401K has been losing ground, I can see it in my quarterly report and I do not have to be reminded of it every 30 seconds. It seems ""news only"" channels thrive entirely on bad news. Scaring the dickens out of us gets them the best ratings. At any rate, I will keep funding my retirement account every other week. After all, stocks are on sale these days and history shows that eventually the market will recover. In the past many of you may have traded in your vehicle every three years or so. Modern vehicles today experience very few problems in the first three years. Should a problem arise, warranty coverage would most likely be in effect. Going to the dealer for service may have been routine and somewhat affordable. Many dealers offer lifetime oil changes when you purchase a new vehicle or even a used one. This is a great deal as long as you can resist the up-sell for other services that they will charge up to triple the fair rate. Due to the current economic times, this may be the year to keep your car instead of trading it in on a new one. At this point, you have two choices, keep taking your car to the dealer for service and pay three times the labor and parts cost of an independent repair shop, or find one of those independent shops to work on your car when repairs and maintenance are necessary. Finding a reputable repair shop may be a little bit of trial and error. Word of mouth may be the best way to start. Ask your friends, co-workers or relatives what automotive shop they use to work on their vehicle. Also, ask if they had to go back to the shop repeatedly for the same problem at any time. Do not wait until you break down on the side of the road to start your search for the right mechanic. When you do get a recommendation from someone, go there to get an oil change. Why oil change? Well, if they cannot get that right you will not want them doing anything major on your car. Unbelievably, in my search for the right shop three out of four shops overfilled the engine with oil by as much as two quarts. That is almost as bad as driving with to little oil in the engine. Once you get a recommendation, if possible stop in to make an appointment. This way you can look around a little. The shop bays should be somewhat clean and uncluttered. Look to see how the employees are working, if one of them is sitting on a chair scratching his belly while the other is cussing and throwing wrenches around, it may be a sign to check out another place. If all looks good, go inside to make the appointment. The owner or service writer should greet you in a reasonable amount of time. They should be pleasant and really listen to what you want them to do. If he acts as if they are doing you, a favor or you just ruined his whole day by showing up, leave. Do not be scared, you are not committed to them at all and your car still runs, and that is why you start your search with routine maintenance. Lastly, listen to your gut! You know that feeling, that uncomfortable feeling, that you are about to be taken for every penny you can muster. If you get that gut feeling, walk away. Remember, this may cost more than the 18.95 you see advertised in the paper and other places. That price is just to get you in the door with the hopes of an up-sell later. No one makes a profit at 18.95. They probably lose money. But with one spark plug and wire change at the dealer at say 400.00 to 600.00, that makes up for a lot of oil changes! When your car is finished, as soon as possible check your oil. It should be at the full mark on the dipstick and the oil should be a golden clear color. If the oil is over or under the full mark by more than a 1/8 inch call them back and let them know. If they are rude, or get aggravated, start your search for another shop. If they are apologetic and offer to make it right, let them. Hey, stuff happens. Give them another shot next time. Always check a shops work. Become familiar with what your car looks like under the hood. More times than not I have had work done and had to put many things back together myself. Even at the dealer! The shop I currently use, I asked the owner if he had any good mechanics. He was honest and said he has two good ones and the other two were not so good. I said ok, so only the good ones will work on my car, right? He said that is right. I told him I really do not like putting my car back together after a repair job. He personally checks the work out before I pick my vehicles up. Because he knows, I certainly will! When you do find a good shop, hang on for dear life. Good mechanics and shops are hard to come by these days. Good mechanics seem to have a sixth sense when it comes to diagnosing problems with new vehicles. Especially with those pesky check engine lights. Sometimes it may take several trips to find exactly what the true cause is even with the most sophisticated diagnostic equipment available today. I hope this article will help you save a few bucks by finding a good independent repair shop rather than going to the dealer and paying overly inflated labor and parts cost."
18,Car Maintenance - Do It Yourself and Save Money,autos-trucks," Recently, with current economy many people are looking for ways to save money. Many of you are switching to generic brand food items, lowering your thermostats and possibly combining trips around town to save on gas. One thing you may have not looked into is doing your own routine maintenance on your vehicles. As daunting as this may sound for some of you, relax it is not that complicated. An oil change takes twenty minutes or less, after you have done it a couple of times. Changing your air filter takes even less time. On average most of us, realistically drive 20,000 miles per year. A little more or less depending on the length of your commute to work and back. That is five oil changes per year, at 55.00 per visit to the quick lube. Do it yourself for around 25.00. You can easily save yourself 150.00 per year just by changing your own oil. Many things happen throughout the course of a year that you can save money on doing yourself. Say your headlamp burns out. You take it to a shop or a dealer and it will probably be 25.00 labor, do it yourself, nothing. While my daughter was away at Collage both of her headlights burned out within three days of each other. Now I am sure she was fine driving around with one headlight and figured she would wait until she came home to have me do it. However, when both went bad, she had to act. Bless her heart! Instead of calling me to send her money to go to the dealer to change them she bought two bulbs at the auto parts store and followed the instructions in the owners manual and did it herself with a borrowed screwdriver. She was really tickled with herself. Therefore, you see anyone can do maintenance on their vehicles, and it is not just for men either. To get started saving money on maintaining your vehicles, here is a list of tools you will need. A repair manual specific for your vehicle - I personally like the one from Haynes, It has many pictures to guide you through every step. A combination tool set - A tool set with the most popular size sockets and wrenches. Most come complete with screwdrivers also. There is no need to go overboard and get the very best to start with. A set of ramps - Drive your front wheels up on these, and you will easily have all the room you need to change your oil and do other repairs. An oil drain pan - This is a large collection container to easily catch and contain the oil as it drains from the oil pan. Most have a convenient spout so you can pour the used oil into a five-gallon bucket for easy recycling. An oil filter wrench will be needed also. All of the above tools may sound like a lot, but you can save enough just from oil changes alone, in less than one year to recover what you have spent. As you get more familiar with doing repairs, the more you will be able to do. Hey, front brake pads! Most shops will convince you a brake job is as complicated as docking an aircraft carrier. I can do it in about 20 minuets per wheel. You can do it too! Doing your own brake pad replacement will equal a savings of about 300.00. If the thought of working on your car in the dead of winter scares you, there is an answer for that. Switching to synthetic oil can greatly increase the miles between oil changes. This can get anyone through the coldest part of the season. In the fall, check your belts, check all other fluids, change your oil and you should be good to go until the early spring thaw. So, if the economy has you looking for ways to save a buck. Try doing your own vehicle maintenance and keep some money in your wallet! The worst thing you can do is not doing needed maintenance as necessary and trying save money that way. It will cost more in the end."
19,Turbo Diesel Pick Up Trucks and Fuel Dilution Issues,autos-trucks," In the past most fuel dilution issues of crankcase oil in turbo charged diesel engines meant there was a mechanical problem of some kind. For 2007 and newer Ford 6.4L, Dodge 6.7L and Gm/GMC 6.6L turbo diesel engines, the emission control systems sometimes are the culprit, as these have been installed to meet more stringent environmental protection agency requirements pertaining to soot. Not everyone will experience dilution problems, as it will depend largely on how you operate your vehicle. Post 2007 turbo diesels are equipped with a Diesel particulate filter as mandated by the environmental protection agency. These filters reduce the soot emitted by as much as 85%. After so long, these filters have to go through a cleaning process called regeneration. Regeneration can occur during operation when exhaust gas temperatures reach 1,100 degrees. This happens regularly when the engines are worked as intended, such as towing and hauling and is called passive regeneration. It is when these engines are operated around town with no load is when temperatures are to low to passively burn off the soot. When temperatures do not reach 1,100 degrees, an active regeneration must take place. Two systems are used. In-stream injection and In-cylinder post injection. What happens is raw diesel fuel is introduced into the diesel particulate filter increasing the internal temperature to burn off the soot that has accumulated. With In-stream injection, the fuel is introduced through a separate injector either behind the turbo charger or in the exhaust stream just prior to the particulate filter. This type of active regeneration is largely used on medium to heavy-duty diesel engines. In-stream does not contribute to fuel dilution. In cylinder post injection has been adopted by the manufacturers of lighter turbo diesel trucks, mainly because of the lower cost. With this system, the diesel fuel is injected directly into the cylinders with the present injectors but on the exhaust stoke as well as the compression stroke, sending the unburned fuel through the exhaust ports to the particulate filter and be burned that way. This system works well at delivering the fuel to the particulate filter but has the drawback of promoting fuel dilution of the crankcase oil. As the fuel is injected on the exhaust stroke, fuel is able to pass by piston rings and wash down the cylinder walls as well, entering the crankcase and diluting the oil. Diesel fuel is a solvent and can reduce oil viscosity and film strength of the oil. An increase in oxidation can also occur. At this point, there is no correlation between fuel dilution and abnormal engine wear. This is a rather new issue and still being studied. Condemnation limits have been set at 5%. Oil analysis samples have shown 7 to 10% dilution rates. If you have one of these turbo diesels and work it hard, active regeneration will be at a minimum, as will the chance of higher limits of fuel dilution. It will be beneficial for you to have your oil analyzed periodically to see what the saturation level may be in your oil. It would also be a good idea to use premium oil that can better withstand the effects of fuel dilution. In closing, for the 2011 Ford and General Motors are changing to a system called selective catalytic reduction, eliminating In-cylinder post injection. The Dodge Cummins turbo charged pickups will continue to use In-cylinder Injection for the upcoming year."
20,Will Steam Power Prevail Again?,autos-trucks," Will steam powered vehicles make a mark in the green transportation movement? If it is up to Harry Schoell and his team of engineers it will. Steam engines were long used in transportation and mostly remembered in locomotive applications in the late 1800s to early 1900s. There were also quite a few steam powered vehicles, the most popular being the Stanley Steamer. The development of the internal combustion engine quickly made the steam engine obsolete due to cheap oil and the amount work involved in starting and operating a steam engine. Harry Schoell, Inventor and CEO of Cyclone power technologies, made significant improvements to a steam engine called the Rankine cycle engine, which is now referred to as the ""Schoell cycle engine."" In fact, the United States Patent office has issued eight patents to Cyclone Power for improvements in many areas of operation. I can not begin to list all improvements in an order of the most to least important, as they all come together to make a truly amazing system. So, I will start with the way it heats the water into steam. The combustion chamber is a centrifugal design, as where fuel is atomized and the flame is spun around coils filled with water to produce steam, hence the name cyclone. All fuel particles are thrown to the out side of the chamber until completely burned. Most notably, the cyclone engine is capable of burning most any fuel without any modifications. Imagine one day filling your tank with used motor oil either bought very cheap or obtained for free! A few days later, top off your tank with 100% bio-diesel or pure ethanol. The cyclone can even burn fryer oil! If you are on the road somewhere gasoline can be used. The fact that the cyclone engine can burn plant based fuels such as ethanol, cottonseed oil, even oils produced from orange peels and algae, makes it carbon neutral. Plants produce oxygen when they grow so the emissions from burning them are largely canceled out. One may feel warm and fuzzy driving in their electric car not producing any emissions, but when it is time to recharge the batteries the electric is still produced largely from coal and other fossil fuels. Also the batteries need to be replaced in about five years with current technology, creating a disposal problem of the lithium ion batteries. There is also a question weather our countries aging grid system could handle the added load if thousands upon thousands of cars were plugged in to recharge at any given time. In an effort to keep this article short I will briefly go over some other points that make this engine no less than incredible. The cyclone operates on a ""closed system"" meaning water will never have to be added or topped off. The engine will need no oil changes because it is lubricated with water. Yes, I said water! The starting torque of the cyclone is 850 ft lbs from their 100hp engine. This means there will be no need for a transmission. Quiet run, no muffler needed! Clean burn, no catalytic converter or complicated and expensive computer systems. In closing, the advantages of the cyclone steam engine are numerous. I should hope that Harry Schoell and his team can get this engine where it needs to be, and in my eyes that's in production. The fact that it can run from fuel easily produced in this country, and not primarily from corn or other important food source to drive up prices, is important to our countries national security. Look up Cylone power; I am sure you may also get excited about this new steam technology!"

1,Key Aspects of Having Auto Insurance,autos-trucks," Having car insurance may not always be a mandatory necessity, but being covered has a variety of benefits. Benefitting most of the car-owning sector, it provides individuals with economic security, peace of mind and impartial, even handed legislation concerning responsibility of accidents and payments. Having Auto Insurance is a Strong, Financial Safety Net Whilst some people may have money stored away for that dreaded, rainy day, most of us live from paycheque-to-paycheque. In these scenarios, there isn’t often very much wiggle room when it comes to costly emergencies, and additional, unexpected expenses. Being involved in an accident with your car is the sort of emergency situation which can really cost an arm and a leg. If you don’t have money squirreled away for just such an unfortunate event, you may find your bank account quite drained. Even a minor accident can grant you pricey bills in the thousands. Insuring your car is greatly recommended for just this reason, as it is far better to give just a little every month, within your budget, than to lose everything. Gaining Unbiased Legislation When it comes to auto-accidents, fair legislation is important. One of the advantages of having insurance for your vehicle, is receiving a professional in these matters should you be involved in a collision. These experts are able to inspect the details of the incident, and be able to establish who is responsible and which party should receive payment. Usually, this results in the fair conclusion of a claim, without need for outside interference. Avoid Elevated Medical Bills It is crucial that you consider all possible outcomes, should you be involved in an accident. For example, should you seriously injure the driver – or passengers – of the other car, you might have to make payments for their hospital bills. Having this expense on your hands could very well cost you much more than you can afford, even if you have a nest egg stashed away. Having a reliable safety net helps you avoid these highly expensive situations, making it possible for you to handle any financial or legal issues. Some Hidden Benefits of Having Car Insurance •	Both parties have the same company insuring them – If you are in an accident with someone who is covered by the same company as you, the deductible for collision coverage is waived. •	Windshields – Should your windshield become chipped, the deductible may be relinquished if you choose to repair rather than replace it. •	Travel – Some insurance companies will pay for your travel expenses up to a predetermined amount, should your car be stolen or damaged. •	Personal items within the vehicle – It may happen that you are carting around expensive paraphernalia within your car. Many insurance companies will cover you on items within your car, in the event of a collision, up to a specified amount. •	Insurance includes others – When you insure, you can include all who might drive the car, and cover them too. Should they be involved in an accident, you will still not be liable for charges."
2,What to Look Out For In a Car Insurance Plan,autos-trucks," While trying to select a car insurance policy it’s very important to understand what the car insurance entails. Understanding the jargon is very important - if you don’t understand what the contract is saying then don’t sign it.  Make sure to ask the agent who is selling you the insurance what every little detail means, because otherwise you’re probably getting into something that you know nothing about and that’s never a good idea. Know Your Choices Before you decide which insurance plan you want to sign up for, you should know what types of insurance plans exist, such as third party car insurance, theft, fire and damages cover, comprehensive car insurance etc. There’s quite a bit of a difference between third party cover, and comprehensive coverage as well as between the many other plans so you should know about all the possible types of policy so that you can choose a plan that suits you the best. Payment Options You should know about the different payment options before subscribing to an insurance plan, which means that you should know if you want to pay monthly instalments or if you wish to pay annually, what kind of interest is charged on making late payments, what type of exemptions may be available if you pay beforehand or make bulk payments etc. Limiting Factors You need to understand what your limitations are in terms of your insurance plans, such as the mileage etc. When insurance companies inquire about the mileage of your car, it’s always a good idea to be honest when it comes to factors such as these as well as about other questions that the insurance companies pose because they may limit your insurance cover to certain factors and you will need to know about them. Find Out What Ticks You need to know how to lower the payments on your car; for example if you get a cheaper car you will have to pay a bit less.  Avoiding modifications and getting extra driving qualifications will also ensure a lower payment on your car. Your age, marital status and whether you have kids or not are also contributing factors when it comes to knowing what kind of payments you’ll have to make towards your insurance plan. There will be some factors that you can’t change but make an effort towards the ones you can to lower premium payments. Figure Out Your Excess An excess refers to the amount that you will have to pay if you make a claim. This essentially means that if you want to pay a lower premium then you may want to keep your excess high, but even though agents often lure people into paying a higher excess to reduce premium value it’s important you know what kind of excess you can afford to pay in case there is a claim. If you’re a teen and you don’t have enough monetary stability to assure a higher excess payment then don’t go for it."
3,Navigating Tough Terrain – The Battle Between AWD and 4WD,autos-trucks," Four-wheel drive, or 4WD for short, was the way to navigate rough terrain in your sport utility vehicle for many years, but all-wheel drive, also known as AWD for short, seems to have taken over the market and has become available even on midsize sedans as well as SUVs. Though some people think that they are the same type of vehicle feature, they are, in fact, quite different. Because so many people are still confused or unclear about the main differences between 4WD and AWD, it is important to clear the air so that consumers can make more informed decisions when they are ready to make a new car purchase. The Basics All cars basically operate on 2-wheel drive, or 2WD for short. This means that only two of the tires, either the front tires or the back tires depending upon the model, are powered to make the car move in whatever direction you want it to go. This is efficient enough to navigate basic road conditions, including dry conditions as well as rainy conditions. With care, these vehicles can also navigate harsher conditions like ice and snow, but these cars would have a lot of trouble getting up a snow-covered hill or getting over a snow mound because there simply is not enough power in only using two wheels. 4WD and AWD both make use of all four wheels of a car, giving it more power to get through tough terrain and harsh weather conditions. The Advantages and Disadvantages of All-Wheel Drive A car that comes with an AWD feature can automatically detect when all four wheels need to be engaged. The driver does not even need to think about it nor flick a switch in the car to turn AWD on. Whenever the vehicle senses itself slipping, it will send power to the four wheels to get itself back on track. AWD requires more power and weight, which means that, when it is engaged, it causes more wear on the car’s tires and uses more gas. It is also not as good in extreme conditions or on very difficult terrain, like deep snow, as 4WD. However, in any condition that requires the car to handle the road better, AWD is better than standard 2WD. The Advantages and Disadvantages of Four-Wheel Drive In a 4WD vehicle, the driver is in total control over when to turn the extra power on. This means that if the car is slipping, the vehicle will not turn the power onto all four wheels automatically, so it is a bit riskier. Like AWD, 4WD uses more gas because it needs more power. However, it is definitely advantageous in extreme conditions. You can drive up an icy, snow-covered hill quite easily if your vehicle has 4WD engaged. Therefore, these vehicles are perfect for those people who live in areas that receive very harsh weather conditions, especially in the winter. They are also great at driving in off-road conditions for those individuals who like to go on mountains for camping, skiing, hiking, etc."
4,Factors To Consider When You Are Looking For The Perfect Racing Flag,autos-trucks," Going to a race is definitely exciting.  From the boom of the engines to the convenience of the snack bar, it’s not surprising that Americans like to watch racing.  As drivers hustle down the race course, you can see guys near you waving various flags.  These flags communicate messages to drivers and their crew members, and are an essential part of the sport.  The flags mean a variety of things, from telling the drivers and fans where to find sponsors, or cautioning the race drivers of likely oil on the track.  If you are thinking of purchasing a flag, important factors to consider are the material, design and overall longevity of the construction. A racing flag is usually meant to communicate particular messages to the people.  It can point individuals to find out which companies are supporting certain drivers.  It can assist drivers locate where particular sponsors can be found.  It can also explain messages of caution to drivers and their staff members.  Should oil discharge on the track, it leads to the course to get slippery, which can lead to potential collisions which could then cause a fire to break out on the course.  There is a flag to relay that message too.  The typical green and black stripes reveal that oil is located where it shouldn't be, and that drivers needs to be cautious.  There are numerous other flags which give directional signals.  Flags in racing is an extremely essential and significant part of having a good race. A racing flag that's designed nicely may last longer than one that's not.  Many flags are used outdoors mainly, so they should endure weather conditions such as wind, rain and a scorching sun.  Each element can result in damage, so it’s imperative that you find a flag that is pieced together carefully.  A hem that has more than one row of closely sewn lock stitches, for instance, will resist tattering more than one that will not.  An eye-catching flag is great, but it’s important to know that it will last a long time even if the design is complex and requires plenty of piecing together. Commercial grade fabrics and smooth polls that are easy to manage is exactly what you need to try to find when you search for a flag.  Flags which are too hefty isn't much fun because the wind cannot pick it up to blow all around.  Other flags might be too light-weight, so that it may stand out and blow around, however it's not very durable to the climate conditions.  Rest assured it is actually possible to possess the best of both worlds.  Commercial grade nylon fabrics that are designed for outdoor use make the ideal fabric for racing flags.  They have a long life, and can tolerate most weather elements with no problem.  It’s particularly significant to have a flag that is obvious when utilizing it to flash signals of caution to drivers. Overall, racing flags needs to be tough.  They will get a great deal of use for several months before the event, and of course more use throughout the event.  Make sure the flag is designed with toughness in mind.  That means focusing on the hem and making sure it is a multiple lock stitch, as well as, locate one made of nylon; it will make a significant difference to stand out and to be enjoyed by everybody using it."
5,The Best Way To Go About Becoming A Mercedes-Benz Mechanic,autos-trucks," When considering today’s job market, lots of people who are planning out their education and training look to typical and conventional methods of study in preparing for a future career, such as taking accounting or business classes.  However, there are definitely other methods for gaining training and skills to prepare for a future profession.  As an example, what about a long lasting occupation as a Mercedes-Benz mechanic?  In developing a real ability, a Mercedes-Benz mechanic will need to undergo training and certification just like any other career decision.  Well known for luxury and true craftsmanship, Mercedes-Benz is a company who expect only the best when it comes to the repair of their motor vehicles so a well skilled mechanic who is able to properly diagnose and fix the issues is vitally important to them and their reputation. A particular type of quality and precision will be necessary for all Mercedes-Benz mechanics which will mean accreditations.  While a general mechanic can adequately repair many vehicles, a Mercedes-Benz mechanic will be certified in areas including ECM repair where they are considered the best of the very best.  A high school diploma or GED will be very important for any Mercedes-Benz technician even if college is not on the list of prerequisites.  You’ll have to use basic math skills when making routine diagnosis issues on a daily basis.  Math training typically will not be offered when learning advanced mechanics, so a grasp of mathematics will be important. Be aware from the very beginning, there are no short cuts to being a skilled mechanic therefore you must be able to put in many many hours of work as a mechanic to effectively learn your craft and advance in your chosen career and this will include ECM repair.  There are several ways you can get a jump on this experience by taking various high school auto mechanic shop programs or by working in a repair shop for a few years.  A general understanding of cars and learning basic methods will certainly benefit you in the long run, where you are able to take those lessons and expand upon them while attempting to specialize in a specific area of automotive repair. Some benefits of working as a mechanic for more expensive vehicles such as Mercedes Benz include being able to expect a more significant salary as well as better chances at job security since developing these specialized skills are not easily attained or accomplished by most technicians.  Besides the obvious benefits, some appreciate the allure of being able to be their own boss and maybe hope to open up their own shops in the future where they can emphasize their specialties in repair and decide which models and makes of cars they’ll focus on. When considering any classes or training, do some research and decide where you would like to focus and what is the best way to go about your training.  Ask mechanics you might know for advice or recommendations as far as your education is concerned and they will likely offer some helpful tips to make the experience much more fulfilling.  Be reasonable when it pertains to the time needed to refine your craft as it will not happen overnight, however the benefits of becoming a certified mechanic will be well worth the while in the end."
6,Add Value To Your Home With Great Garage Designs,autos-trucks," Garage areas used to be considered an upgrade to your home.  A lot of homes in the 1960s and 1970s just simply did not have the space.  If a home had a connected garage it was usually a single car garage but more commonly a home could have a carport.  Since that time garage designs have improved. Now most homes that are built, even as early as the mid 80's, ordinarily have at least a two car garage, while some even have as many as three and in some cases four car garages.  As you acquire more possessions, such as cars and toys and equipment, you may find your current garage situation insufficient.  Adding a detached garage could be a solution to this.  Perhaps you do not need the space to keep vehicles or belongings, but you have a hobby or a profession that allows or requires space at home to work.  Constructing a detached garage could fill that requirement as well.  If you have a loved one who is need of more personal care but the thought of a retirement or convalescent home is undesirable, or you are interested in generating rental income but you do not have the interest or ability to invest in a rental property, a detached garage with a loft or an apartment can be the perfect solution. There are many different and sensible designs for detached garages available to purchase out on the market nowadays.  You are sure to discover a garage design to fit your needs, whether it is to have a single, double, or triple garage, or if you looking for that loft, apartment or workshop you have always wanted.  The World Wide Web is one place to easily and quickly find different garage designs to search through.  Architect and CAD drafting businesses have come up with dozens of garage plans to suit most needs, and if you have some specific needs that the stock plans do not address, these companies can alter existing plans or custom design one just for you. It is important to check with the building department of the city or township in which you reside to make sure a detached garage, with or without a living space, meets all zoning requirements.  In some locations you could be violating the zoning restrictions by building a detached structure and renting it if the area is zoned for single family houses.  You might currently even be in violation and not know it if you have a basement in which you rent out and have not even checked with the zoning of your city. If your needs require a detached garage and you want to purchase garage designs over the internet, make sure the company from which you buy includes not only the plans but a complete design plan.  This package needs to include all the information necessary to meet current building permitting requirements and to allow the contractor you hire to secure correct construction bids.  If adjustments to an existing plan are required, the ability to communicate with a draftsman and get a timely response is really important. Unless you are designing an entire custom garage, make sure you ask the design company about a money-back guarantee.  The guarantee should state that if you buy one of their pre-designed garage plans and it does not work on your property, you are qualified to receive a full refund.  You should also be given time to review the blueprints once you have them.  Three months is adequate to check with your building department and consult with your contractor to make sure the plans are usable.  If not, the company should really refund you your money and should work with you to create a design that does work and one with which you will be satisfied."

There are numerous vehicles with lots of variables. To make items simpler, you should discover all you can. The following paragraphs are full of excellent concepts that you can use to get a great vehicle quickly. Speak with knowledgeable people before you go auto buying. Since they aren't the one particular creating the final selection, they might be in a position to support you steer clear of a deal that is not the greatest for you. This can be any relative, a co-worker or a buddy. It can be a very good factor to buy a automobile near the last week of the month. Dealers are attempting to attain their quota, resulting in much better offers. When you come in later in the month, they want your sale to get them to that quota number. You can take advantage of this. Verify into your financing options prior to you commence searching for automobiles. You will know what is in your budget.

8,The 2011 BMW ActiveHybrid 7 Compared to The Toyota Prius: They're Not Alike,autos-trucks," A new 2011 BMW ActiveHybrid 7 is actually a hybrid automobile that bears little resemblance to a Toyota Prius or other similar hybrids. Gasoline efficiency is exactly what you think of when you think hybrid however the BMW hybrid is not that fuel efficient. Although the 2011 ActiveHybrid 7 is going to save on fuel compared to its other 7-series siblings, its ride in stop and go traffic is iffy and the power steering gets turned off in idle stop. It's really a great innovation in motor vehicle technology but its quirkiness when driving can get annoying. The application of an electric motor in a hybrid shows that the gas-powered motor is smaller but in the case of the BMW, it is not. Most hybrids reduce gasoline costs even while maintaining power, but BMW saw the extra power, and decided to make their cars go faster. Typically the 2011 BMW ActiveHybrid 7 has got the same engine, a twin turbo direct-injection 4.4-liter V-8, as the regular BMW 750i. The only real variation is the introduction of an electric motor than gets its power from a 120-volt lithium ion battery pack. The hybrid provides you with better fuel useage than the regular 750i but provide even more horsepower. Many hybrids are able to switch to all-electric mode but the ActiveHybrid 7 does not do that. It is much like the Integrated Motor Assist System of the Honda where the engine is going to shut down at stops and will add boost during acceleration. When you happen to be in the driver's seat, you will not even know that you are in a hybrid, but it has a blue area in the fuel gauge, which shows when the car is having electricity regenerated by its momentum. If the car stops at a traffic light, you'll know that it is a hybrid, by the engine going soundless and the tach needle drops to zero. Whenever you take the foot off of the brake, the engine comes back on smoothly which is impressive considering the size of the engine. While you are parked at a traffic light that is really prolonged, that is when the idle stop system works well, but not quite as well in stop-and-go traffic. For reasons yet unknown, the vehicle will power down for 5 seconds at a time even in stop-and-go traffic. Additionally, it takes getting used to the degree of power, because the vehicle lunges forward with the slightest touch of the accelerator. Just how the car was created, it is not a green car but rather a car that uses the hybrid system to add more power while improving fuel efficiency somewhat. As soon as you imagine a hybrid, you think of fuel efficiency, and while the 2011 BMW ActiveHybrid 7 is more efficient that the standard BMW 7-series, it only gets around 20 miles per gallon. Although that is great for a luxury sport vehicle that isn't all that much for a hybrid."
9,Understanding No Credit Check Auto Loans,autos-trucks," If you have poor credit, a no credit check auto loan probably sounds too good to be true. After experiencing the harsh denial that you're likely to get from traditional lenders, it's a refreshing change to find a car dealer that will offer you a car with minimal paperwork and no hassle over your credit score. No credit check auto loans are exactly what they sound like. Your loan paperwork will be completed with only a small amount of personal information and absolutely no look at your credit score. Lenders like these generally assume that you have a poorer credit score or you wouldn't be pursuing this kind of loan. There are both pros and cons to this loan. If you have poor credit, this may be the only option that's available to you. The main benefit of a no credit check car loan is that it allows individuals to get loans who wouldn't otherwise qualify. The downside to a no credit check car loan is that the interest rate will be higher than what you find with traditional car loans. You may also have very strict limits on how much you can borrow. You'll usually be asked to provide a recent paystub so the lender can determine what you can afford. If you don't have bad credit, or you're unsure of your credit score, you should start by finding out what your options are with traditional car loans. When you apply for this type of loan, the lender will pull your credit score and can probably tell you what it is. If you don't want to go through the application process, you can also pay a small fee to check your credit score yourself online. Most sites that provide you with your credit score will automatically renew your membership each month, so be sure to cancel your membership if you only want to see your score once. If your credit score isn't high enough to qualify for a traditional car loan, a no credit check loan is your best option. It's important to have a reliable vehicle. Many people don't have access to public transportation. Having a car will make it much easier to get to your job on time and earn the money you need to ultimately improve your credit score. Paying off this type of car loan will also help improve your credit score over time if you're diligent about the payments, making this loan a smart choice in many situations."

Bugs splattered across the windshield and paint look disgusting, but they cause bigger problems. If a good bug and tar remover isn’t used as soon as the insects hit your car, more problems can result. When the bugs begin to decompose, they create enzymes that are designed to break down the decomposing insects. However, they also begin destroying the paint. When road tar gets on the finish of your car, it is sticky and very difficult to remove unless you use a good quality bug and tar cleaner. If the tar isn’t removed using the proper method, it can result in scratches to the paint on your car. There are a lot of good commercial products on the market that you can use to remove the tar. You should use a removal product to loosen the tar from the surface. It may have to sit for about 30 seconds. Before using the bug and tar remover, you should make sure to clean the surface of the car where the tar had collected. After washing the surface thoroughly, you should use a soft cloth to remove the product. You shouldn’t leave it on for longer than 30 seconds because the finish could be damage further. Using anything abrasive could damage the paint. If there are any scratches as a result of removing the tar, buff the surface with a soft cloth and apply a coat of wax to regain the shine. Once the bugs and tar have been removed, waxing or using a paint sealant on the surface will prevent further problems."

12,Subaru BRZ – Coupe Full Of Thrills,autos-trucks," Subaru BRZ – Coupe Full Of Thrills History is either a blessing or a curse. The BRZ badge is an abbreviation for ‘Boxer Rear-drive Zenith’ and it refers to the engine and chassis layout. Everything about the BRZ is designed with one thing in mind ‘Thrill’. The exterior is striking and unlike most coupes the Subaru is not beautiful in a conventional sense but the bulging wheelarches, wide track and low nose give it a very dynamic attitude. Little changes to the bumper and fake vents on the front wings are the only difference between the BRZ and the GT 86. The BRZ looks clean and simple due the Subaru’s unique WR Blue Mica Paint. The BRZ is more streamlined than the MX-5 despite being 20mm longer and 55mm wider. Its shape is aerodynamic which creates almost little drag. Once you set your foot inside, you find a cabin which puts the driver first. The seats are lower than the Mazda and give excellent support. The top-spec SE Lux variant has leather and Alcantara trim, but the base SE has cloth seats. The SE version does get climate and cruise control, keyless entry and start, plus auxiliary audio ports and USB. Buyers who expect a lavish cabin will get disappointed. There is a decent amount of kit, the hard grey plastics and digital displays means the BRZ feels ugly inside. The four-seater Subaru gives a big advantage over the Mazda as it is more practical for everyday use. The boot is 243-litres but with rear seats folded this coupe’s capacity increases to 1,270 litres. Subaru steering is agile yet the ride is firm enough to remain settled on bumpy roads where as the Mazda is bouncy on bumpy roads. The BRZ has 39bhp power advantage over the MX-5 with 0-60mph time of 7.1 seconds. Subaru’s handling is a joy and it feels stable on the road than both of its rivals, GT 86 and the Mazda. This gives confidence to t he driver. This is the first Subaru with direct injection and it returns only 33.1mpg and high CO2 emission of 181g/km. Subaru offer a comprehensive ‘Everything Taken Care Of’ package. It includes dent and scratch repair, collection and delivery from each service, a full annual valet and even a monthly wash. All these things are free of charge. The BRZ and GT86 are slightly different on the road that is why it is difficult to distinguish between them on the road. The Subaru deserves the same praise as the much appreciated Toyota. It’s simple and aggressive styling; aerodynamics and greater practicality give it an edge over the Toyota, which justify its high price."

16,The Nissan Juke Is Good Value And Spacious,autos-trucks," The Nissan Juke Is Good Value And Spacious The car market right now is going through a tough time. It doesn’t have many gaps but Nissan is resolute to find them. The ‘crossover’ is comparatively new concept in the automobile industry and the Japanese company has decided that this is where it's at. Nissan launched its crossover campaign in 2007 with the Qashqai and has recently launched a 4x4/supermini, the Nissan Juke. The Nissan Juke has a high riding position and there is a four wheel drive version on range topping petrol version. Realistically speaking, this car is aimed at young go-getters who want to be unique and own ‘something different’. Nissan says it is aimed at young, adventurous and sporty men and women alike. Its unconventional design is sure to attract customers from all walks of life. Its biggest selling point is its price. At this low price you get a trendy car, a good engine and lots of kit. Hence it makes much more sense to buy a Ford Focus, which is a bit bigger or Ford Fiesta which is a bit smaller. There are four versions available in Juke; Visia, Acenta, Acenta Plus and Tekna. There are two engines to choose from: 1.6 litre petrol with 115bhp or 187bhp respectively. There is also a 1.5 litre diesel engine delivering 108bhp. The Juke offers excellent front visibility and a good view of the road. The seats are superbly comfortable making the Juke easy to get in and out. Juke is definitely the comfiest in its class. It depends on how you view this car as there’s lots of front and rear leg and head room but the boot has limited space. The seats can be folded to make a larger flat loading area and for extra space under the boot floor. With the back seats up it has more boot space than a MINI, but less than a Peugeot 207 or Ford Fiesta. If you regularly have two or three passengers travelling with you than this is the car for you, but if you are looking for a cargo car, its not for you. If you need lots of cup holders you’ll like the Juke, but if you want a car with lots of luggage capacity, search for an alternative.  The Euro NCAP crash test rating specialists gave it a full five star rating making it among the best in its class. All variants of the Nissan Juke come with six airbags, anti whiplash headrests and brake assist and ISOFIX child seat points in the rear."
17,The Subaru XV Is Attractive And Roomy,autos-trucks," The Subaru XV Is Attractive And Roomy The Subaru XV is the firm’s effort to boost declining sales in Europe, by targeting the money-spinning small SUV segment. It’s made to target rivals such as Nissan Qashqai, Hyundai ix35 and Mitsubishi ASX. Two petrol engines are available; 1.6 and 2.0 litre petrol mated to a CVT or manual transmission and 2.0 litre diesel engine. All cars get Subaru’s renowned permanent AWD. Subaru has a reputation for building vehicles with good handling and the XV carries along the trend. It’s more fun than you might think off-road, thanks to the agile steering and firm body control. However, the ride is harsh and suspension is noisy. The manual gearbox is better as the CVT is noisy and impassive. The well-established Outback and Forester have earned Subaru with a reputation for building reliable and tough SUV’s, so there’s no reason why the XV won’t be able to withstand daily driving. The plastics used inside look cheap but are vigorous. The XV has ample amount of safety kit fitted including, traction control, seven airbags, ABS, retractable pedals and a collapsible steering column. Subaru XV Crosstrek managed to get full five stars in it Euro NCAP crash test rating. It also scored 90 per cent for child occupant protection. Once you lift the tailgate, you get a 380 litre boot, which is lesser than the Nissan Qashqai. Once the seats are folded the boot capacity increases to a healthy 1,270 litres. The doors open wide enough for easy access to the cabin while the four wheel drive gives the XV the ability to tackle bad weather conditions, much better than a conventional front wheel drive family SUV. When it comes to being economical and CO2 emissions, the XV 2.0D is on the same level as its competitors. It gives 50.4mpg and emits 146g/km of CO2. The 1.6 and 2.0 litre petrol models emit 151g/km and 160g/km respectively. Subaru XV Crosstrek gets a small step up in efficiency but makes a big sacrifice in drivability. If you plan to make long journeys the diesel model will be cheaper, however both petrols provide a smart option.  The Crosstrek has some flaws such as the noisy engines, cheap interior plastics and unsettled ride. However, the interior is spacious, rugged design and sharp handling. It also boasts sharp handling, sleek looks and plenty of space. Nevertheless, the ride is pleasantly surprising. Its peculiar styling eventually homes in but to pay more for a less functional vehicle doesn’t really make sense."
18,Buying Automobiles - New Or Pre-owned?,autos-trucks," It is in your best interest as you research Buying Used Cars to understand that you will need to be patient as you go along and learn about it. For us, we were totally clueless until it became apparent that there was a lot to discover. We try to provide solid and reliable information on the subject, and we are confident in our ability to do that. The bottom line is that sometimes you just do not know what is inside a piece of content that could be tremendously useful. The thing we like to emphasize is to have confidence in your self because very often that is all you need. The reason you should read this article is simple and profound because it is knowledge that you have been searching for all along. There are many things to consider when acquiring a car. The primary thing to give some thought to is whether you really should buy a new or used car. This is an advantageous time for purchasing cars right now; demand is low and automobile manufacturers are in a difficult situation, with some big players like GM even skirting bankruptcy, so there's been downward pressure on the price of both new and second hand cars. With respect to first-time purchasers, getting a second hand car is the best option. The foremost grounds for promoting a second hand car would be your inexperience at owning a car. It's practically impossible for anyone to steer clear of minor accidents and the least consequence will be that your car gets scratched. The worth for a car decreases because of accidents, so it is better to have a car that you won't feel sorry about. This is not to say you won't have fallen in love with this your first car, but as soon as the harsh realities sink in you're going to be glad that it was second hand. An additional factor to think about would be the cost of insuring your vehicle. For most of us insurance coverage is a grudge buy, and we'd rather spend the money on something else. You will save a good deal on insurance with a used car, and you'll also find the cost of repairs to be lower. Bottom line, a pre-owned car is better from the economic point of view. Choosing Your Automobile Scanning the auto lot for the vehicle that most grabs your attention is not the way to go about it. You have to look past the eye-appeal to ensure that engine problems don't catch up with you. Find someone who knows about cars, from a practical perspective, to examine and give you a report on a car you like. For example, that beauty that's captured your eye might be a model known to be a gas guzzler. Are you willing to dispose of hundreds of dollars on gas each month? Alternative Ideas of Getting a Car Going to your local dealer is not the only approach to buy a car. In fact, people choose to search online for their cars these days. However, it is not like ordering a pair of shoes. You will want to check out the car personally, and, obviously, take it for a test drive. You simply won't find a company that sends the car straight to your door, as this is not possible for obvious reasons. How To Roadtest The Particular Vehicle Focus on the specific engine. You should subject the car to both city and also highway driving. Make sure to achieve high speeds, and ask the seller to allow you to drive it for a longer period. Only by doing this can you get a good idea of how well the car copes with endless periods of waiting at traffic lights, and how it performs when you want to quickly get to a countryside location for a weekend away."

The all wheel drive system makes the Legacy a family saloon. The Legacy stays firm around the corners in any weather conditions. Steering is not as expressive as one would like but it is certainly not in a coma as some of its competitors. It comes equipped with a CVT transmission as well five speed manual and six speed automatic. The four cylinder offers rapid acceleration and has a PZEV option which tweaks with things like fuel injectors to make a cleaner vehicle with less emissions. Subaru bucks the trend when it comes to interior as it offers a small information display which sits on top of the dash. Unlike its rivals who are full of technology and gadgets Legacy has easy to read buttons. You can be sure that the area around the back seats doesn’t have dual video displays on the front headrests, or massaging ottomans or customizable ambient lighting but what you do get is a Legacy which is good at keeping a low profile. It has the ""oomph"" for overtaking, performs good enough so no one can call it boring and attractive enough so that it doesn’t look behind the times."
20,Nissan X-Trail – The Best Value SUV,autos-trucks," Nissan X-Trail – The Best Value SUV The X Trail was added to Nissan’s off road range in 2001 and is something of an unsung hero. It is a compact 4x4 with practical boxy lines. Dynamically, the X-trail drives great on-road making it better choice than rivaling BMW X3 or Volvo X360. The X-Trail is the best option for those looking for a dependable yet enjoyable 4X4 car. It also returns a great value for money in terms with generous standard kit and strong resale values. The overall look of the Nissan X-Trail remains the same since 2001 apart from the light tweaks it received in 2007, but the X-Trail doesn’t really need any change in design as it is a winning formula that still feels fresh and has helped the Japanese manufacturer flourish through the off road vehicle market. The X-Trail has a rugged look thanks to its chunky bumpers and dark scuff plates. Inside it has a luxurious but practical cabin that feels upmarket with high quality materials. Having said that, the dashboard looks a bit odd with centrally fitted screen which looks like a substandard after market accessory. The X-Trail is powered by a 148bhp 2.0litre and 171bhp 2.0litre diesels mated with a six speed manual gearbox. The gearbox is smooth but it drives a bit firm and on motorways there is a lot of road noise. Having said that, it performs great on the bends thanks to the firm set-up giving it an edge over the agricultural Land Rover Freelander. The X-Trail’s appetite for revs makes it an entertaining car to drive. However, like other Nissans, the X-Trail is also not the best at stopping and takes 62.6 metre to stop when brakes are applied at 70mph, the rivaling Kia Sorento (larger in size) does the same in 52.6 metres. The X-Trail managed to score only four out of five stars in Euro NCAP crash test rating, which is same as the Toyota RAV4 but one star less than the Land Rover Freelander. However, the standard safety equipment includes six airbags, AntilocCK Braking System and electronic stability control. The four wheel or two wheel drive can be selected with a touch of a button that adds to the driver’s confidence. Nissan cars have a strong reputation for reliability and the X-Trail has performed really well in owner satisfaction surveys. It finished ninth in Auto Express Driver Power Survey. The X-Trail boast 603 litres of boot space which can be increased to 1,773litres on folding the seats, that is 100 litres  more than the rivaling Freelander which is larger in sizes. There is plenty of legroom for the passengers at the back and cabin boasts a huge glovebox and lots of cubbyholes. The driver enjoys a comfortable position thanks to highly adjustable seat and steering wheel. All of these make long journeys easy for both the driver and the passengers. The X-Trail returns fuel economy of 44.1mpg which is on a par with its rivals. However, it enjoys high residual values as compared to its rivals plus the kit levels are impressive. The Sport version gets a sunroof, Bluetooth connectivity and CD changer. All of these combine to make the X-Trail an appealing package for buyers."

1,Bmw 760li Special Edition,autos-trucks," Bmw 760li Special Edition The flagship BMW 7-series sold in the UK is fitted with the outstanding 3.0-litre diesel engine. The special edition 760Li is the peak of the firm’s expertise and a display of what happens when the engineers are given a relative free hand. There’s history too, BMW is celebrating the 25th anniversary of its flagship V12 model. Under the bonnet it has a 5.0-litre TwinPower V12 petrol engine with the kind of numbers that can make a supercar feel red. The maximum output of 537bhp arrives at 5250rpm but its 553lb ft kicks in at 1500rpm. The 760Li was facelifted earlier this year which made it different from other long wheelbase 7-series models in the BMW range. It also looks different to the V12 badging on the wings and heavily angled tailpipes at the rear. The 760Li needs to be brushed lightly to deliver massive amount of torque. Even at low revs, the 760Li can reach licence losing speed, and it was proved by a little sprint on the derestricted autobahn. BMW drives calmly and smoothly as the engine is silent at both high and slow throttle openings. The V12 has 89mm piston bores and an 80mm stroke which gives it a ration between the two dimensions of 0.9 which is ideal. The 60-degree bank angle makes sure that the vibration is kept very low. Don’t let go of the throttle and the turbocharged 5.0-litre shows its class and pedigree. BMW 760Li gives one of the most involving drives in its niche thanks to the Dynamic Damper Control, self-levelling rear suspension ,Driving Experience Control, Dynamic Drive roll stabilisation, along with Integral Active Steering,. But this car is not to go at top speeds it’s rather to sit in and relax and enjoy the comfortable ride, and like every other 7-series model in the range it still has a firm ride. There is not much to be critical of in the new 760Li except the firm ride and the new facelift which wouldn’t go well with everyone. The V12 performs amazingly and it is a master piece of refinement and engineering. The interior is ultra luxurious and modern. The fuel costs for this will be as high as the cost of the car and one can go for a 730Ld; a car that gives as much fun but at less cost to the flagship. It comes mated with a eight-speed automatic gearbox. BMW 760 Li SE 25th anniversary edition will cost £101,805 and exclusivity will be guaranteed. The top speed is limited to 155mph and 0-62mph time of 4.6sec. It gives 21.1mpg and the CO2 emissions stand at 303g/km."

3,BMW 125i – A Brilliant Mix Of Practicality And Performance,autos-trucks," BMW 125i – A Brilliant Mix Of Practicality And Performance BMW 1 Series is unbeatable in the compact family car class. The second generation BMW debuted earlier this year and since then it has claimed the title of ‘Hatchback King’. Its mix of low running costs, driving fun, up market appeal and practicality has won it many fans. BMW mesmerizes you once you climb inside. The smooth dash is vigorous and laid out clearly. The switchgears are precise and well engineered. The driving position is comfortable and the big M Sport steering wheel is very agile. The 1 series is spacious enough to give the rear passengers same amount of room as the front passengers. However, middle passengers have little bit of less space as the large transmission tunnel bites into space for their feet. The boot is well shaped and can handle 360litres of luggage which is 19litres more than the A-Class. When the seats are folded the capacity goes up to 1,200 litres. The 125i’s has a smooth and refined 218bhp turbocharged 2.0litre which comes equipped with six-speed manual gearbox. This engine helps the BMW power its way from 0-60mph in only 6.4 seconds. The standard model comes equipped with four-stage Drive Performance Control. The handling is very well balanced so is the rear-wheel-drive. It has strong and progressive brakes. The M Sport mode has lowered and stiffened suspension which gives a firm ride on bumpy roads. The tyres make a little bit of noise which results in less roll through corners, concise body control and stronger grip. This BMW comes with a price tag of £26,070 which beats Mercedes and Audi on price. It has a strong resale value and a great five-year servicing pack which adds to the BMW’s financial advantage.  BMW has fitted the exterior with 18-inch alloys, side skirts, sporty bumpers and twin chrome exhausts in a bid to distinguish it from its more modest stalemates. The interior is also upgraded and it now included figure-hugging sports seats and effects of aluminum finishes on the doors and center console. It has higher CO2 emissions of 154g/km and offers around 34.9mpg. Looking in to the evidence, the 1 series is going to remains at the top of the podium for some time to come. The BMW has firmly placed itself at the top of the class by beating two strong rivals in style. The sporty 125i M Sport mode offers an exciting mix of driving fun, quality and practicality. Low servicing costs and depreciation back this up. The relatively high emission costs leave a slight negative impact on 1 Series."
4,BMW Active Hybrid 3 Combines Performance With Excitement,autos-trucks," BMW Active Hybrid 3 Combines Performance With Excitement BMW markets itself as the ultimate driving machine and that reflects on its hybrid as well. BMW is not renowned for hybrids but it might come as a surprise to you that BMW has been doing hybrids for some time now. It has X6 SUV, 7-Series, 5-Series hybrids under its belt. The Active Hybrid 3 isn’t designed to maximize fuel economy rather it is filling a gap between the 335i and new M3 due next year. The power train is a 3.0-litre six-cylinder engine in accordance with a 54bhp electric motor churning out a massive 335bhp and 450Nm of torque. It travels 2.4miles on electric power alone. The engine delivers a lot of torque and with the electric motor adding its share, power delivery is even smoother and refined. It comes mated with an eight-speed auto gearbox. The rowdy engine note is there, giving the car a sporty feel. The car went from side to side in corners as the weight of the batteries and electronics takes its toll. You should go for the adaptive dampers to take care of this slinging around. BMW’s intention was from the beginning was to make the 3 series a hybrid so the battery packs sits under the boot. Hence, space has decreased from 480 litres to 390 litres. However, this doesn’t impact the interior space. It comes equipped with a 6.5inch iDrive system, shift paddles, cruise control, multifunction wheel and air-con. BMW is expected to sell 100 cars a year in the UK as BMW’s main aim with this car is petrol-loving markets. It is priced at £40,235. The 0-62mph time is 5.3seconds and has a limited top speed of 155mph. BMW Active Hybrid 3 give 47.9 mpg and the CO2 emissions are 139g/km. All 3 Series Saloon models have fuel saving methods under its sleeve. Automatic start/stop, an ECO PRO drive mode, break energy regeneration help it to have a respectable fuel efficiency figures. It also has front sport seats, a power sunroof; Dakota leather upholstery, heated front seats, heated steering wheel and a nine speaker sound system. It has USB port and Bluetooth connectivity. Although this car is hybrid but it has an envious acceleration and it might be a green alternative to the M3. It is not the sharpest 3 series to drive and the effortless switch between electric and hybrid petrol power is impressive. Still this car will not fare well in markets such as UK, where diesel is the main fuel."
5,Nissan Pathfinder Is The Most Practical SUV,autos-trucks," Nissan Pathfinder Is The Most Practical SUV Nissan Pathfinder is a rugged and strong built yet refined off roader. Nissan hasn’t ignored the practicality and that is shown with a large cabin. The pathfinder is a hardworking vehicle which doesn’t feel comfortable when on road. The ride is bouncy and the engine is growling , unlike other SUVs of the same class, the Pathfinder is nowhere near luxurious. However it serves the purpose very well of being a simple, reliable and powerful workhorse and costs about £4,000 less than the major rival Land Rover Discovery. The Nissan Pathfinder has simple but meaner boxy looks which doesn’t mean it is an ugly car. The cabin is inspired y the Navara, and is enormous and practically designed. It boast full seven seats and a split opening tail gate. There are many stowage spaces to hold your bits and bobs. The materials used are rugged and of high quality. The Pathfinder is powered by a 2.5 litre four cylinder engine with five speed manual or six speed automatic gearbox. It returns 187 bhp and does 0-62mph in 10.7secs and 11secs with automatic and manual gearbox respectively. The manual gear box requires patience when changing the gears. The ride of the Pathfinder is its biggest negative. It is unsettled on bumpy roads and steering feels wobbly therefore making the handling very difficult and the ride uncomfortable. Having said that, the Pathfinder is best at what it is designed to do, the rough stuff, thanks to a full set of low range gears and a lockable differential. The Nissan Pathfinder managed to achieve only four star Euro NCAP crash test rating, which might leave a bad impression on some as most of the cars get the maximum five star rating these days. But it is not easy for a 4x4 to get full five stars. The standard safety features include six airbags, ABS brakes, electric stability control and traction control. Nissan Pathfinder has a strong build which is bound to last longer. The Nissan Pathfinder is as practical as any van, all the versions are equipped with seven seats. The boot has 190 litres of space which can be increased to 515 litres by folding the last set bench of seats. However fold all the seats and you have an enormous space for 2,091 litres of luggage. The rear screen goes down as well allowing to fill the load. The Pathfinder is a bulky and heavy weight car and therefore thirsty on the fuel. With manual gear box it does 33.2mpg with 224g/km of carbon emissions and the automatic is even less at 31.4mpg with 238g/km of CO2. As the carbon emissions are higher the road tax costs are also sky high. The fuel tank has eighty litres of capacity and costs around £130 to fill. Keeping all this in mind. The initial costs might be less but the Pathfinder is expensive to run."
6,Limited Edition 2013 WRX and WRX STI,autos-trucks," Limited Edition 2013 WRX and WRX STI The fans of the modified and tuned up cars must have enjoyed the first day of the SEMA show. Subaru has played its part with the debut of Special Edition models of the 2013 WRX and WRX STI. The pair supports a checked orange and black scheme justifying their launch on Halloween. They be going on sale in limited numbers. Subaru is planning to cap the sale of the WRX Special Edition models to 200 units and the WRX STI version to a 100. Therefore they wouldn’t be easy to get your hands on. The WRX model supports a dark interior straight from the STI line, and has a black headliner with orange stitching on seats. This orange stitching continues on the floor mats, shift boot and door panels. The exterior boasts a contrast of Tangerine orange paint and custom jet black alloys, black fender badging and side mirrors. Subaru also offers black graphics as an option. The Special Edition of the WRX STI features front fog lamps and the STI’s SI Drive, DCCD and VDC systems along with all the features of the WRX Special Edition. Apart from these changes both of the cars remain the same under the bonnet and feature the same Boxer engines of the ordinary models. The WRX produces 265hp hwith 244 lb ft of peak torque at 4000 rpm and is run through Subaru Symmetrical All Wheel Drive. The WRX STI delivers a massive 305bhp with its turbocharged boxer engine . The STI is also equipped with Multimode Driver Controlled Differential (DCCD), Multi Mode Vehicle Dynamic Control (VDC) and Subaru Intelligent Drive. The DCCD is exclusive to the STI and the VDC features a track performance optimized mode. The WRX STI has a light steering and a six seed manual gearbox and returns the best drive on a twisting back road. The steering returns a great response and the Subaru four wheel drive system gives an excellent road grip. The SI-Drive feature makes sure the throttle response is sharp thus returning an engaging drive doing 0-62mph in just 5.2secs. The WRX received only four out of five star Euro NCAP crash test rating but it has handsome safety kit that includes six airbags, electronic stability control, traction control and side impact beams. Subaru has a built a good repute as a reliable manufacturer and both the WRX and WRX STI live up to the name thanks to the excellent mechanicals and strong build quality. The 2013 Special Edition WRX and WRX STI will be available to buy this spring, for any further information contact your local dealer."
7,BMW X6-Either You Love It Or Hate It,autos-trucks," BMW X6-Either You Love It Or Hate It The BMW X6 is the third in BMW’s X line up. The concept car was shown in 2007 in Frankfurt Motor Show and the production followed the March next year. The X6 is a coupe-SUV -based on the X5- with a sleek style and fun drive but it has limited off road ability. There are options of two diesel and three petrol engines. Diesel engines are better with X6 40d giving the best balance of performance and fuel consumption. The X6 boosts a ""love it or hate it"" design which is not everyone’s bread and butter. This might be the only car having so many different buyer opinions. From the bottom it looks just like the X5, while above the waistline, is a coupe with a shallow glass area and sleek roof making it a ‘Sports Activity Coupe’ as BMW calls it. 19 inch alloys and xenon headlamps come as standard across all models. There is no doubt that the petrol engines return an excellent performance but they prove very costly to run, the diesel engines are better in the sense that they give similar figures of performance at comparatively low running costs. The basic 30d does the 0-62mph in 7.5secs which results in easy overtaking on the road. The 40d does the same in 6.5secs and the range topping M50D gives 0-62mph in jus5.3secs. X6 has very agile drive for its size, weight and height. It handles very well on sharp turns and corners. The X6 has a incredible road grip thanks to the Dynamic Performance control technology that adjusts the torque across each axle. The BMW X6 has not be tested for Euro NCAP rating yet but it sure can get five stars when put through the test. It comes with a decent amount of safety feature that include ten airbags, electronic stability control, Isofix child seat anchors and tyre pressure monitor. The engines that and technology that power X6 have already been tried and tested in other BMW models and no major issues reported. All of these increase the driver’s confidence in driving X6. Though the BMW X6 is a bulky car, still there are only two individual seats at the back making it a strict four seater. It boasts a decent 570 litres of boot space and underneath there is a storage space for items you don’t want others to see. The rear visibility is poor but parking sensors make up for it and come as standard across the range. Going for a diesel engine surprisingly lowers the running costs, the 35i is the most efficient petrol returning 28.0mpg with 236g/km of carbon emissions. On the other hand even the biggest culprit in diesels – the M50d does 36.7mpg with CO2 emissions at 204g/km. Insuring the X6 will always be expensive but BMW offers a ‘Service Inclusive’ deal for just £400 that covers the vehicle for five years or 60,000 miles whichever comes first."
8,Honda Accord is Premium but Expensive to Keep,autos-trucks," Honda Accord is Premium but Expensive to Keep Honda Accord was first introduced in 1976 and reached UK in 1977, since then it has remained one of the best selling cars of Honda line. It has been aimed at the premium executive class. The latest was launched in 2008 and is eighth generation of the Accord. The new Accord boasts a fine exterior design and a comfortable and an up-market interior. The major rivals are BMW 3 series, Ford Mondeo, Vauxhall Insignia and Audi A4. It is available as a saloon or estate with option of 2.0l and 2.4l petrol engines and a 2.2 i-DTEC diesel. The latest Accord has an all-new design but it’s far from revolutionary. The new style makes the Accord look more premium than rivals like the Mondeo or Insignia but it looks bald when standing next to an Audi or BMW. Having said that, the Accord has an excellent interior with soft touch plastics and a premium feel. The Accord was given some cosmetic upgrades in 2011 with new headlights, new front and rear bumpers, chrome trim above the number plate, re-profiled cooling ducts and a new sporty grille. The ES and ES-GT trim levels get 17 inch alloys. Though there are only three engines to choose from, but they return a strong performance. The 154bhp 2.0 litre VTEC petrol feels very smooth, on the other hand the 198bhp 2.4-litre is pretty fast. The best seller is the 2.2-litre diesel which comes with 148bhp and provides the best cost and performance balance. The steering is responsive and precise. The suspension is excellent, delivering comfortable, refined and smooth motorway rides. The control and handling is surprisingly excellent for a front wheel driven car but the ride is not as engaging as an Audi or a BMW 3 series. Honda Accord enjoys five star Euro NCAP rating. It is also considered as one of the safest cars in the class. All of the Accords come with many standard safety features like six airbags, electronic stability control and anti-whiplash headrests. Honda cars are famous for their reliability and Accord is the same, no specific issues have been reported yet. Honda scored an impressive second in the 2010 JD power survey while the last Accord was admirably ranked 16th in the Auto Express Driver Power Top 100 rankings. The top blow to the Accord’s practicality is that it is not available in hatchback The boot has a narrow opening and 467 litres of apace which is less than almost all of the Accord’s rivals, the rear seats can be folded to make space for longer items. The passenger enjoy a reasonable amount of headroom but taller passengers might find that the legroom is tight. The main dash boasts many controls. The standard features include air con and cruise control. GT trim level get extras like sporty body kit. large wheels, leather trimmed steering and alloy gearstick knob. Honda Accord isn’t the most efficient car available. The best performer diesel does about 50mpg with 138g/km of carbon emissions. The 2.0 litre VTEC petrol returns 40mpg with 159g/km of CO2 with manual transmission. The bigger petrol engines and the automatic transmission versions are even bigger culprits. Therefore the overall running costs are higher than most of the rivals."
9,Sporty And Stylish Volkswagen Passat CC,autos-trucks," Sporty And Stylish Volkswagen Passat CC The Volkswagen Passat CC is the sportier and more stylish version of standard Passat. Before it came in with four seats only, but now the five seat option is also available. Like its predecessor, the new Passat CC is also a comfortable and quite car to drive. There are many engines to choose from, the petrols include 1.8 TSI with 158bhp and a 207bh 2.0 TSI and diesel option is a 2.0TDI with 138bhp and 168bhp then there is range topping 296bhp 3.6 litre V6 petrol. The Passat CC is the best looking car in Volkswagen range. The design has been refreshed by the tweaks such as the headlights and bumper rearrangement. The standard kit has also been improved. The top end models come with large alloys. The full CC range gets the Sports suspension as standard which is a bit firm than the standard one. The firmer suspension hasn’t compromised the comfort while the drive is sharper than ever. Adaptive bumpers is another feature of the CC, they operate in three modes Comfort, Normal and Sport. The entry level 1.8 TSI engine might be quick enough but is thirsty on the fuel. The best option is to go for the 168bhp 2.0 TDI which is as fast as the petrol but is much more fuel efficient. The range toping 3.6 litre V6 petrol is as quick as you can get doing 0-62mph in 5.6secs. Passat CC hasn’t been tested for the Euro NCAP rating yet. It has been more than four years since it was launched and there are no reports of any major faults. Many of the mechanicals are the same as standard Passat which has a five star Euro NCAP rating. The standard safety kit includes six airbags, antilock brake system and electronic stability control. Option of three seat rear bench has made the Passat CC more practical but you can choose the four seat arrangement that will provide a huge amount of room for the rear passengers. The boot space is 532 litres which is huge for the sporty shape. The boot space is larger than Audi A4 and Mercedes C Class. The Passat CC comes with impressive standard equipment such as climate control, Air con, electrically adjustable front seats, touch screen music system, Bluetooth connectivity and many controls on the steering wheel. Overall the cabin is well built and has a premium feel. Being a sports version, the Passat CC is not expected to come in economical or smaller engines. The best it can do is 60.1 mpg at 125g/km of carbon emissions when powered by the 138 bhp 2.0 TDI diesel. The range topping 3.6 litre V6 petrol returns only 30.4mpg. Volkswagen offers a fixed service plan that covers 30,000 miles or three years."
10,Toyota RAV4 Is Getting Old And Outdated,autos-trucks," Toyota RAV4 Is Getting Old And Outdated Toyota RAV4 was first introduced in 1994 and was the first in the compact SUV market. It had a car like drive and a ""tough street"" look, that caught on. Many competitors followed Toyota to get their share of the market. The next generation was launched in 2000 and the latest in 2006. Though RAV4 is a very good car, but still it fades into the background. Perhaps it is its age or may be it doesn’t have all of the features to offer like the rivals such as Land Rover Freelander, Honda CR-V and Nissan X-Trail. It’s weird that the third generation RAV4 lacks the sporty looks of its predecessor. It has an uninspiring design as compared to its direct rivals like Honda CR-V and Nissan X-Trail. RAV4 still supports the side hinged back door which feels so out dated as compared to top hinged tailgate. Having said that, the RAV4 makes up for what it lacks with its logically laid out interior. The materials and plastics used are of high quality. The driving position is quite high giving a good all round view. The RAV4 might not be exciting but it sure does deliver. It gives a secure feel on the road ,is comfortable to ride and performs well on the bends thanks to its four wheel drive system and high electric traction. The steering is responsive and light making it very easy to park. RAV has a soft suspension returning a smooth drive on bumpy roads. There are two engines to choose from a 2.0 litre petrol and 2.2 D-4D diesel. The petrol engine is much thirstier than the diesel. The 2.2D 4-D returns an economy of 47.1mpg considerable better than the CR-V’s 43.5mpg. The Toyota RAV4 only has a four star Euro NCAP rating. RAV4 is equipped with driver, side and curtain airbags, some models also have a driver knee air bag. Toyota is known for its reliability, and managed to score fifth position in Auto Express Driver Power Survey and RAV4 came 28th in model classifications indicating it is overall a reliable and safe car to own. For the extra peace of mind all models come with a five years standard warranty by Toyota. The back of the RAV4 is spacious and the seats can be slid back and forth according to the required legroom. The boot has 560 litres of space which is much more than the Honda CR-V. The seats can be folded to increase the boot space. The side hinged rear door proves to be impractical and frustrating in tight spaces. It doesn’t even open to full 90 degrees. One doesn’t have to spend any extra money for the basic options as most of the models come with a decent amount of kit like parking sensors, Bluetooth and cruise control while MP3 compatible stereo, air conditioner and alloy wheels come with all models, which is not the case with its rivals. Overall RAV4 is good value and a well built car but unfortunately it is ageing now. The rivals have much more to offer than RAV4. It desperately needs a makeover to get its share in the fiercely competitive market."
11,Honda Insight A Hybrid With Character,autos-trucks," Honda Insight A Hybrid With Character Honda Insight was first introduced in the UK in1999, most of us remember it by its quirky design and excellent economy. The new Insight is a four door hatchback as opposed to the original two door coupe. Though the new design is more spacious and practical but it’s not as economical as its predecessor and the carbon emissions are also higher. The fuel efficiency is less than the likes of Toyota Prius and even the Volkswagen Golf BlueMotion. The Honda Insight has a very similar outline of Toyota Prius but smaller in size. It comes with blue tinted headlights and smart grille at the front end. The rear is a bit oddly designed to get the most aerodynamics. The cabin gives a very modern feel. The speedometer glows in green colour when driven economically and in dark blue when not. Entry level version is equipped with 15 inch alloys, climate control, power windows and MP3 connectivity. The next level trim comes fitted with 16 inch alloy wheels, parking sensors, automatic wipers and lights and fog lights. The top of the range HX version has satellite navigation system with traffic updates and voice recognition system and Bluetooth compatibility. All versions of Insight has a 87bhp1.3 litre engine with 121 Nm of torque and an electric motor. This motor recharges the battery when the brakes are applied or the car is slowing down. It does 0-62mph in 12.5secs and has a top speed of 113mph. The car has an Econ mode to achieve maximum economy by limiting the engine response. The suspension is very good.

Honda cars have a very good reliability record, and Honda managed to score 6th position in the 2012 Driver Power reliability survey. The hybrid system is not new either, it has been already tested in the Civic. Honda insight boasts a 408 litre boot space increasing to 1,017 litres on folding the back seats which is more than many rivals like Vauxhall Ampera and Volkswagen Golf, but little bit less than the Prius. Insight seats are accommodating and has plenty of legroom at front and rear. However the taller passengers at the back may not have enough head room due to coupe inspired roofline. The average fuel economy returned by the Insight 68.9mpg with 96g/km of carbon emissions therefore qualifies for the UK road tax exemption. Having said that, it is much less than its rivals, Toyota Prius at 74.2mpg and 86g/km of CO2 and even VW Golf BlueMotion returns 74.0mpg with 99g/km of CO2. Though everyone knows that the car industry is ruthless, still one feels a bit for Honda. It was pioneer in hybrid cars and even before in clean and efficient petrol engines but the rival Toyota has managed to steal the environmental limelight."
12,A Few Safety Techniques For Anyone With A Car,autos-trucks," Many people enjoy using their cars. Nonetheless, many individuals neglect to think about different car safety issues. Let's take a peek at some recommendations that can help keep you safe when you're in your car. Even though you consider every known precaution, sooner or later your car will wear out. This may be something as basic as a flat tire, or something more complex like transmission issues. The initial thing you should do before you have a break down is to bring your car to a garage at least every 6 months and have them check your fluids, belts and tires and make sure you get a tune up at least once a year. However, it is possible to get yourself stranded. Once this ends up happening to you, make sure you get your car as far off the road as you possibly can and also set out flares to let oncoming traffic know there is an issue approaching. Also if possible, try and get your car to a well lit area where there are plenty of people around. Something else to look out for is theft of your truck. Over the United States a car is stolen every 20 seconds. Having certain measures will lessen the likelihood of somebody stealing your car. Very first thing is to ensure you always lock your car or truck no matter where you are. Also you may wish to get yourself one of those ""Club's"" to place on the steering wheel. Lots of thieves do not even attempt to break into a car with one of those. One last thing you really should do is get a car alarm system. The noise of a car alarm normally frightens thieves and they leave right away. Something more important that you need to do for your own safety is to form an emergency pack for your car. Integrate items such as jumper cables and flares along with blankets and extra water that should be considered for drinking or filling up your radiator in an emergency. And a non battery-operated, self-powered radio can be another useful item you probably want to have with you. It's also necessary to have a map in your glove compartment in the event you get lost or need to find an alternate route. Lastly, it's vital to have a mobile phone with you when you're on the road. This could come in useful if your car breaks down in an separated location. This way you are able to call the police or a garage if you know of one nearby. Having a cellular telephone when you're on a road trip can literally make the difference between sleeping in your car and contacting someone who can give you a tow and get you safely back home."
13,Selecting A Good Quality Pre-owned Car,autos-trucks," Ways To Choose A High Quality Used Car And with a financial savings like that it truly is amazing that any person buys new cars anymore. This post will look at some things to seek out when shopping for a used car. Of course the first thing you want to seek out is any rust on the exterior of the vehicle. And we are not only looking for visible rust but rust that could be hidden under the paint. How you can tell should there be rust under the paint is by looking at the finish. If you find bubble spots on the paint, then there is a possibility that rust is ready to come through. Even though you see just a bit rust, proceed to the next car since it will probably get worse in a few years. An additional area to look at for rust is inside the trunk of the car. That is an area of the car that lots of people forget to look at. Any small rust inside the trunk will spread to the rest of the car. Plus you won't want to put anything in that trunk as it may end up suffering from water damage as the water can come through rust spots. The next phase is to check the internal of the car. In the event the interior of the automobile is clean there is a pretty good chance that the person who owned it took good care of the vehicle. When the seats and carpets are tainted or torn there is a good chance that the previous owner didn't conserve the car and he probably didn't conduct the scheduled maintenance either. Now when you are inside the vehicle check all the controls, this consist of windows, door locks, heater and everything else the car has. The last thing you want to do is to buy a car in the summertime and then figure out the heater doesn't operate when winter hits. Now look at the tires to find out if there is tread on the tires and if you can find any uneven wear. If you observe that the tread on one side of the car has significantly less wear than the other side, then there can be some issues with the car. It may just need an alignment, but then again it could be an issue that could run thousands to repair. In the event that there is any type of uneven wear on the tread, don't give it an extra thought, move on to the next car. The very last thing you should do is to get the car for a test drive. You want to be sure that the car turns well without issues and the brakes will work well and not soft. If you take the car for a test drive you will find a way to find out if there are and clunks or other troubles."
14,Can Speedy Oil Change Service Stations Be Reputable?,autos-trucks," Many people either don't have the time or the know how to change their own oil so they end up going to those fast oil change service station. But are these motor oil change places on the up and up? In this article, I am going to concentrate on why it isn't a good idea to go to these places and why you should find a regular mechanic instead. I am sure you know that every car has certain rules of thumb about when certain services should be done. You have appointed upkeep for things like air filter change or an oil change. Still have you really looked over the owner's instructions for your car? I can pretty much guarantee whenever you look through the owners manual of your car you will find that your oil doesn't need to be changed every 3,000 miles like all those oil change places tell you. Actually if you happen to look in your book you may find that you only need to change your oil every 6,000 or even 7,000 miles. So, as you think of it, these quick oil change places are lying to you so they can take your money. If you study the owner's manual, you should also see the moment you should get the air filters changed. In my case, it is advised that I change my car's air filter every two years or if it's all clogged up. In my situation, the air filter continued to looked okay after four years but I opted to change it anyway just in case. However, these quick oil changes would always tell me that I must have the air filter changed. Six months after I changed my personal air filter without any help, I took my car to one of these oil change places and I was told that my air filter needed to be changed. They alleged that the air filter was starting to discolor which meant that it would start clogging at anytime. When I told them that I had just changed it a few months previous, they then told me it needed to be replaced in another six months or so. What bothered me was that they initially informed me that the filter had to be changed. Then when I told them about the new air filter, they changed their reply. This just shows how shady and evil these people are. There's once where these folks changed my transmission fluid. This seems like they're going to tell you that your transmission fluid should be changed everytime you visit. This one time I authorized these people to do it. Then about 3 months later when I made it back for an oil change they told me my transmission fluid was grimy and needed to be changed. After that, I never went to these businesses again. We've since located an honest mechanic and I don't bring my cars any place else anymore. One thing that I uncovered is most employees who work at these quick oil change places are not certified to fix cars, they just know how to con people. While an authorized mechanic has gotten the proper education."

17,Best Tips for Cleaning Your Wheels,autos-trucks," At some point in an automobile’s functioning existence, it will need some repairs or replacement for its parts. A visit to your mechanic is not always necessary, especially since you can take a hands-on approach and actually get the replacements done yourself which saves you money. Auto repair is not rocket science and you can learn the basics by consulting good auto repair guides freely found on the World Wide Web, which often provide detailed, step-by-step instructions on all sorts of auto repair. However, before you have to replace your parts, it is best to keep them in good condition so that they may last longer. Proper cleaning of your wheels is one way of ensuring you get good performance for longer from them.  For routine cleaning, using just a mild soap and water will be enough. However, when you want to carry out thorough cleaning, you need to know the type of finish used on your wheels so that you do not cause any damage on them. Different finishes require different types of cleaners, so you need to know what kind of finish your wheels are made of. To properly clean your wheels and keep them in perfect shape, here are some key pointers you need to keep in mind; •First ensure that the vehicle is parked under a shade so that the sun does not dry the  soap faster than you can rinse it off, and remember to turn off the engine to cool the  metal and the brakes around the rims. Don't let abrasive tire cleaners come into contact with your wheels, and try not to spray cold water on hot wheels. Using a mild soap and water, lather your wheels sufficiently. •Rinse off the wheels. Depending on the coating on your wheels and the amount of dirt, you may use a pressure washer. Then, using cleansers that contain no additives like bleach add a few drops of the cleanser in a large bucket of water and properly mix it. •After rinsing your wheels, choose a suitable polish and evenly polish them up. For clear coated wheels, use a polishing cleaner that is provided by the manufacturer. The main reason for polishing is to enhance the shine of the glossy rims after washing- and you can do this using a rag in circular motion until the whole area is evenly coated. •Finally, if you have chrome-plated wheels, wax them until the wax is completely rubbed in and is not noticeable. If you have clear coated wheels, you may leave out this step. The wax will create a layer between dirt, debris, oil and even the rims, making it easier for you the next time you clean your rims and also prevents surface corrosion. Following the above simple steps, you’re sure to maintain the great look of your tires for a long period of time. Doing your homework in terms of knowing your needs, your budget and the best tire manufacturers in the market for your auto is very important to get the right quality wheels in the first place. Having a good routine maintenance on your auto will keep your wheels running for longer and save you money."

1,DMAA Exclusion Almost A Thing Of The Past and Prop 65 Insurance Is No Longer On the Market,autos-trucks," FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE (Los Angeles): In just a matter of weeks word seems to have spread among dietary supplement product liability insurers that DMAA, the controversial ingredient in many pre-workout sports nutrition products, is something they no longer wish to insure. Greg Doherty, Practice Leader of the dietary supplement insurance division of Poms & Associates Insurance Brokers, Inc, today announced that effectively all of the marketable companies offering product liability coverage to the dietary supplement industriousness will now be adding a DMAA exclusion to their respective ""ingredient exclusion"" lists. As late as June of this year, less than a handful of two or three insurers were adding a DMAA exclusion. ""It's pretty amazing how fast this happened"" says Doherty. ""It appears that the April warning letters to ten DMAA product suppliers must have caught their eye all at the same time. Once that happened they began to do some digging and found the other negative information about DMAA, and decided it was time to protect themselves with a DMAA exclusion."" A carrier that in June gave notice that it may have offered coverage for products containing DMAA on a ""carveback"" basis, which means that based on the type of products being sold, the measure of DMAA and the amount of DMAA sales as a percentage of overall sales, this carrier may possibly not attach a DMAA exclusion for an additional premium. In spite of this, based on a recent interaction with that carrier, Doherty says that this possibility appears to have evaporated as well. The sudden appearance and adoption of a DMAA exclusion is a scenario mirroring the ephedra alkaloids ban in 2004. Notes Doherty, ""First the insurance companies stop covering it, then the government issues their outright ban on those products. Subsequently, the insurance companies paid out millions of dollars for ephedra claims. Will a government ban and insurance claims follow this time? Only time will tell if the there are massive insurance claims and if the DMAA exclusion possibly should have been issued sooner, at least from the perspective of the insurance companies."" As of this moment there are still two carriers available who apparently have not caught on to the wave of adding a DMAA exclusion. But Doherty adds, ""I can't simply go to them and ask why they haven't added a DMAA exclusion yet."" Proposition 65 Liability Insurance Withdrawn From Market Approximately an entire year to the day after being announced, insurance covering false advertising (including Prop 65 claims) has been withdrawn from the market and is no longer available. Doherty notes, ""It's my understanding that very few policies were purchased, probably because the cost was quite high. And, many people have the attitude that it's not going to happen to them, so why buy insurance? We were only able to get one customer to complete an application and give them a quote, and it was about as expensive as their product liability insurance. They didn't buy it. Interestingly, the coverage also provided true false advertising coverage, and prior to that there was no such thing. Now we've come full circle, just as we are seeing a plethora of new false advertising class actions being filed on both the food and dietary supplement industries."""
2,What To Look For When Buying A Second Hand Car,autos-trucks," What To Look For When Buying A Second Hand Car Many people dream about owning a great new vehicle, yet not every one of us have the financial muscle to get a great vehicle. Then the ideal option is investing in a second-hand vehicle which means you might be able to find your dream automobile at a comparatively affordable price. However before you buy a second-hand car one must check it thoroughly so that there are no issues with it, as the second-hand car could either be a great value for money or a complete waste of money. Some issues are common with all the second-hand cars. The very first thing that you need to look at is the mileage of the car. This may provide you with a fine understanding of the use of the car and about what condition the vehicle should be in. People do change the speedometer so you should be extremely attentive when it comes to the fuel consumption of the car. All that glitters is not gold so don’t be tricked by the excellent external surfaces or perhaps indoor of the automobile. Make sure you go through the ownership documents cautiously and don’t be scared to ask questions concerning the automobile as stolen vehicles have a knack of being low-cost. Water leaks in cars can considerably bring down the price of a vehicle. How will you notice a leaking vehicle? Well, it is straightforward, just pick up the mats and look at the space beneath it. If a vehicle has had any sort of accident, this kind of vehicle can be drastically harmful and can serve as a prospective death snare. Look for irregular sides on the figure of the car and be sure that the entry doors fit in the car properly. Rust is any vehicles primary foe. If the car gets corroded, then it is no better than taking it to the scrap yard. The seller might try and conceal rust by making use of unethical approaches like painting the whole thing. The car might look fine on the surface so that you would not bother examining what lies beneath.  Make sure you look around the tyre arches; this is where corrosion is most likely to hide. Check for rust beneath the body, you might get a covering of rust. Do not select a vehicle that isn’t satisfying your needs. It is better to get help of an expert in second hand or reconditioned cars."
3,Commercial Insurance will protect your business.,autos-trucks," There are a number of significant decisions that must be made by a new business owner. None may be as important as the decision to take out a commercial insurance policy. These policies are vital to the protection and overall success of the business. The words ""business insurance"" is far-reaching and covers several kinds of policy types. So, it is necessary to be aware of the different plans that you can have and how each plan protects. Property insurance can help to protect the business location as well as its contents. This plan will give content coverage for a business owner who works from their home or rental property.  If the property is owned by the business operator, then the policy would cover the contents as well as the structure itself. If other people keep their possessions on the property, the plan will also cover the loss of those items.  Several additions can be included to insure against specific disasters as well, such as fire, flooding or tornadoes. The Liability Policy represents one of the significant alternative commercial insurance available. These policies are intended to protect a business from the legal liabilities of internal negligence.    It fundamentally covers the business in case it gets sued. Liability plans can cover a wide range of mishaps, from employee harassment to stock market meltdowns. If a business is operating a motor vehicle in needs to have commercial auto insurance to protect it from liability.  Your typical automobile policy can not be compared to a plan of this type. Commercial auto policies cover any damage that may be done to others while using a business automobile. Company vehicles should be covered under a normal automobile insurance policy. Workers' compensation is one type of business insurance, but employers may also offer coverage for employees such as medical, life, and disability. Protection is available with life and disability plans to cover emergency events like the main owner or employee being hurt or killed.  This policy can offer financial help for the remaining workers or owners to purchase  and effected partner's share.  Business interruption insurance covers damages or losses sustained to the profit of a business due to the inability to operate for uncontrollable reasons. A prime example would be if a business is damaged due to lighting and could not be in operation for several days. As an experienced agent, I know how to help someone purchase a commercial insurance policy. Businesses should consider multiple plans and policies and make sure the one they choose meets their needs specifically, making sure exclusions or additions that are necessary take place. Based on these changes, premiums can fluctuate. Anything can happen while running a business, and anyone who runs one should always be ready for the absolute worst."

This is especially true if there is significant work that needs to be done to the frame, body and drive-train components and parts are not readily available. In most cases a professional shop will be able to locate all required parts and assemble and restore the car the way it was meant to be. One of the biggest obstacles preventing most classic car enthusiasts from going this route is the perceived cost. However, in most cases the more expensive option is to do nothing at all and simply let the car languish and rot. In fact, you may be surprised how affordable professional restoration really is. 2.) Sell Your Classic Car Lots of individuals and even some shops will buy basketcase projects. This essentially refers to complete classic car projects that are in pieces. Depending on the amount of work involved and the condition of the car and parts, you may be able to get much more than you think for your antique car or truck. You can start by contacting restoration shops to see if they're interested or know of anyone who is, and then proceed to traditional listings, Craigslist and even eBay if you're feeling lucky. 3.) Trade it! If you've got the right car you may be able to tempt a collector or enthusiast into a trade. Whether you're looking for a completed project, a newer car or truck or something else entirely, chances are great that you can find the perfect trade situation by checking and interacting on classic and antique car forums and websites. Traditional newspaper ads often get fast, local results, and visiting a pro restoration shop might turn up some leads as well. 4.) Museums Might Love it If you've got a great old car sleeping away in pieces somewhere on your property and you know you're never really going to do anything with it, you may want to consider giving it to an auto museum. Often you'll receive credit on the display and a generous tax break, and just the fact that the museum will restore and forever care for your old car is generally enough to consider this seriously as an option. 5.) Donate to Charity Donating your basketcase classic car project to charity has a number of potential tax benefits as well as the fact that - depending on the situation - your old car may net a significant cash infusion for charities that often struggle to obtain funds to support their causes. If it's just got to rot away anyway, you might as well help someone else out by checking around for some charities that may be interested in putting your old car or truck to good use. If you've got a car in pieces somewhere and want to see it live on, call a professional classic car restorer now to find out exactly what can be done with it, and about how much time and money that will cost.  However, caution should be used when finding a classic car restorations shop, as you'll want to make sure they have the equipment and expertise to preserve your car, buy it from you or sell it for you."
5,New Car Prices - Trending Up Due To Demand Picking Up,autos-trucks," It would appear that the days of lower new car prices are over. Though the global economic situation has not drastically changed with certain European countries still coming to terms with their problems, some positive indicators in markets like the US, Japan, India and to a lesser extent China have enabled car manufacturers to ramp up production to meet demand. Consequently, the issues faced by them during the slack demand period which led to increase in inventory of cars are now beginning to disappear. During the recession, there were many who could not afford the car loans to buy new or even used vehicles and that meant new car prices had hit all time lows. If you were one of the lucky ones to seize bargain offers made then, you can congratulate yourself for your wise decision.

Now the cost of new cars are up on an average of 7-10% and when you add the different taxes and levies, you are easily paying close to 12-13% more. Other factors like increased gas prices have also led to the demand for small cars going up substantially. This is turn has made these cars too more expensive than before. The fact that car manufacturers are now providing many additional luxury features and accessories within small cars are also leading to the small new car prices going up. Today the situation on the new car loans too has improved. The interest costs are lower than what you would have to shell out for used cars and that is also leading many to go for new cars. People want to keep their new cars for a minimum period of five years and that would also explain why they don’t mind spending on accessories and other pricey options for their cars. The demand for new cars and the plethora of options are inducing even those already having cars to go for the latest models. However, they are not able to get a good price for their old car and many are using the charity mode to at least get some tax related benefits to dispose off their old cars. Indeed, new car prices have gone up and by the look of things, it does not look like they would come down soon. If you are on the fence, deciding to whether go in for a new car purchase, then act quickly and book your new car before the costs go up even further. The economic situation is improving and this will only push up demand for all these consumer lifestyle products."

7,"Create an Incident Command Post using vehicle accessories such as tailgate tents, lights and flags",autos-trucks," When fires break out or accidents happen, emergency response teams are quick to arrive on the scene. Fast response is necessary in order to save lives and property. Anyone involved in an incident relies on the police, fire fighters or other responders at the scene to act quickly, organize efficiently, and make life-saving decisions. In such hectic conditions, organization is imperative and establishing the incident command post to coordinate response activities is top priority. It can often be difficult to distinguish which response vehicle is coordinating efforts, which is why custom vehicle accessories make all the difference. Accessories such as easy to set up EMS vehicle tents and lighting that can turn any response vehicle into a clearly designated incident command post are important tools for first responders. These vehicle accessories are making a hugely positive impact on incident management. The need to take orders from a single center is quite clear. The accident scene is full of many responders and all of them are on the scene to offer valuable assistance needed. However, the fact that so many people are on scene with a wide variety of emergency vehicles may create confusion. Any additional amount of confusion can easily lead to loss of lives that would otherwise have been prevented. Experts have noted that such mistakes have contributed to unfortunate happenings at accident scenes, they have since developed products and recommended the implementation of a mobile incident command center. The responders are therefore coordinated from the command vehicle identified by a clearly marked canopy, flag and lighting. Personnel arriving on scene shouldn't have to ask ""Where's the command post?"" But finding a sedan - or SUV - size command post in a sea of massive fire and rescue apparatus can pose a challenge. With EMS vehicle Command Post Flag and Light any vehicle can be identified by the green ""CP"" flag and a green beacon mounted on a collapsible, 10´ aluminum, shock-corded pole that attaches to the side of the chosen response vehicle via extra strong magnets. The beacon is visible from two miles away and can be set to stay lit or to flash. First Responder vehicle canopies were designed and created specifically to aid rescuers who will be arriving in different vehicle types. You may have even seen these accessories used in some of your favorite shows like CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. These canopies are adjustable to fit the rear opening of most emergency vehicle trucks, SUV's and vans. EMS vehicle tents are lightweight, easy to stow and quick to set up. These custom vehicle canopies are also designed to protect valuable equipment including computers, radios, fax machines and coordination materials by offering extended protection from the elements four feet beyond the rear of the vehicle. This easily provides enough space and shelter for up to 4 professionals on the scene to operate equipment and coordinate efforts. As most responders know, accidents are never convenient, which is why the additional lighting proves to be useful at night. This design is engineered specifically to aid the mobile rescue unit. Accident victims rely on responders and responders rely training and having the right equipment accessible. First responders are finding great value in EMS vehicle accessories such as easy up truck tents with command post markings and lighting."
8,Classic Corvette Restoration: Repairing the Chassis,autos-trucks," A perfectly-repaired, beautiful frame is one of the most important aspects of any classic Corvette restoration project. A great chassis will serve as a framework for a fantastic body and paintjob, and it will keep you safe when you drive and make other repairs. However, fixing your frame can be tough, and there are plenty of ways to make things worse. Here are a few of the most important things to consider when you're restoring the chassis on your vintage Corvette. The Diagnosis The first thing you'll need to do is diagnose the existing problems with your frame. If your car was ever in a collision, some areas may be bent or twisted - even beyond repair. You'll probably also encounter rust, especially if your car is decades old or was stored improperly by its previous owner. Whatever you do, make sure take full stock of all your concerns before you begin your repairs. Need for Removal If your chassis only suffers from minor rust, then you may not have to remove many components. However, alignments and other highly-involved repairs will likely require that you separate your frame from the rest of your car. Removing a car's frame is a project most people leave to professionals. If you're going to do it yourself, then you must set up a safe, supportive suspension system in your garage or shop. Some people use their ceiling beams, but a sturdy, standalone model is by far the most reliable option. Once you've removed your interior components, make all the proper disconnections, attach your chains, and lift. Steel or Fiberglass? The repairs you need may depend on the exact type of frame in your classic Corvette restoration. If you've got tubular fiberglass, you may not need to worry about rust - but you'll still have dents and bends to consider. If you have a steel frame, you'll probably have to remove the body to work on holes, twists, and large patches of rust. It might also be a good idea to chemically strip your steel frame, which removes small pieces of grit and prepares it for welding and cutting. Rust Repair Getting rid of rust is critical for any project, especially when you're dealing with a broken-down frame. If left untreated, a rusty chassis can cause your entire car to breakdown, costing you thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours of your valuable time. The most common rust removal techniques include: *Sand blasting: This method is essentially sanding with air. A strong hose sucks in air and uses it to ""blast"" grains of sand at affected areas.. *Bead basting: Similar to sand blasting, this technique blasts tiny beads instead of sand. Beads can also be reused, and may be more cost-effective over the course of several projects. *Chemical treatments: There are a variety of chemicals which can dissolve rust while leaving steel intact. However, it may be logistically impossible to remove parts of your frame for soaking. Professional Help Ultimately, you may need to consult a reputable auto shop if you need heavy-duty frame repairs. Not everyone has the equipment necessary for body removals, and alignments require extreme precision. If you need help with your current chassis - of if you want one custom-built - call a professional classic car restorer now, or contact a classic Corvette restoration shop to help you out."
9,Classic Car Restorations: How to Avoid a Money Pit,autos-trucks," Working on your own classic car restoration project can be a true joy, but it can also leave a gaping hole in your pocket. Replacing parts gets costly, tools are expensive, and your time is your most valuable asset of all. Even if you do your homework before you buy, you might run into glaring problems you didn't see before. If you want to avoid a serious money pit, here are a few things you should understand before you get a classic car. The Costs of your Parts One of the most important things to consider for a new project is the cost of the parts. If you're starting with nothing but a frame and some wheels, then you'll obviously need to find affordable dealers for every single component. It's not too hard to find your parts online, but you'll need to factor in high shipping costs for heavy pieces. Furthermore, you may even have to pay customs taxes if your car is European or Asian. There are certainly foreign auto dealers in the United States, but some obscure vintage parts are only available overseas. Even if you're starting with a well-put-together automobile, you might have to replace a wide range of parts. This is especially true for cars that were improperly stored, and that have sustained years of high heat, cold temperatures, or excessive humidity. If you see large patches of rust on the chassis or body, you're looking at tens or even hundreds of hours of repairs. Finding an Honest Seller It's also imperative that you find an honest dealer or independent seller. There are unfortunately some unscrupulous people in the class car restoration business, and it's all-too-common for hapless buyers to get ripped off. You can find reputable sellers through local car clubs, newspaper listings, and even online forums. Get an Appraisal Once you've found the perfect project, you'll want to get an appraisal to make sure everything checks out. Your seller may be honest, but even they might not know all of the potential problems with their cars. It's easy to overlook rust, peeling paint, and other issues which could cost you a fortune in the long run. You'll also need someone who understands the taxes, insurance, and depreciating values associated with classic automobiles. Overall, an inspection from a knowledgeable appraiser will probably pay for itself many times over in the future. Do you Have the Right Tools? Fixing cars requires a wide range of specialty tools, and you will have to make sure you've got what you need before you embark on a new project. Do you have a suspension system for lifting the body? Do you have air blowers and vacuums for rust removal and paint jobs? Is your garage large enough for all of the necessary repairs? These are all questions you should consider before making a final decision. Help from the Pros In the end, it might just not be cost effective to do all your repairs on your own. If you need help with tough jobs - or if you want to leave your whole project to experienced professionals - call a professional classic car restorations company now in order to ensure your project is completed flawlessly."
10,Classic Car Restoration: Four Tips for Storage,autos-trucks," When it comes to classic car restoration, storage is actually one of the riskiest parts of any project. Whether you're putting your car away for the winter, or you just can't avoid stowing it in the heat, there are certain precautions you've got to take. Failure to properly prep your car for storage can lead to serious problems for your engine, pipes, body, and interior. If you want to make sure your car doesn't deteriorate while you're away, be sure to follow these five tips. First, you'll want to do deep, detailed cleaning of the outside and inside of your car. Begin by thoroughly washing the exterior from top to bottom. Get all of the road salts and buildup off from under the car, as even the smallest particles can facilitate the formation of rust. You can take your car to high-end car washes, but you should probably still wash the undercarriage yourself. Next, wash the seats, dash, and every other surface of your interior. Even if they look clean, these areas are breeding grounds for bacteria. If you drive your car frequently, there may also be food particles or drink spills that could attract bugs. Your fluids have got to be clean and fresh before you put your car into storage. One of the most important things to do is to change your motor oil. You should also grease any bearings or fittings, even if they don't seem like they need lubrication. The current lube can dry up while you're away, leading to dangerous and costly metal-on-metal contact. Make sure to flush and refill your brake fluid, as well. Check your manual or consult an expert to find out what type of solution you need. Top off your gas tank, and use an additive to prevent it from absorbing water or turning to varnish. Finally, drain your coolant - just be sure to add it back in when you're ready to drive away! There a few additional steps you should take before stowing your car. First, take it on a twenty to thirty-minute run before you drive it to storage and empty the coolant. Once you've parked it, remove the battery, top the water off, and store it in a cool, dry place. To protect your interior from excess moisture, put a couple of boxes of baking soda inside. This is especially important if you're storing it in a humid area. Crack to windows to provide for circulation, and place a cover or rag into your tailpipe. Not every region is right for optimal storage. Even if you do take precautions against moisture, humid climates can lead to mildew in your upholstery and buildup in your fuel tank. On the other hand, cold areas can cause damage to your engine, transmission, and even chassis. The best place to store your classic automobile is Florida - a place with a temperate climate, pleasant temperatures, and consistent weather. For this reason, it's also the best place to buy or restore your dream car. Whether you're in the market for a new project, or you need professional help with the one you've got, call a professional classic car restorer to talk about your project now."
11,Making Sure You Get The Right Auto Insurance,autos-trucks," So just what is going on with auto insurance in this day and age? With everything else going on in your life, it can be nearly impossible to keep track of the latest trends and information. Here in this article, you will find some of the most important information that you have been looking for. In order to reduce the cost of your auto insurance policy, consider limiting the mileage you drive each year. Many insurers offer discounts for policyholders who do not spend a great deal of time on the road. It is important to be truthful when making claims of reduced mileage, however, as it is not unheard of for insurers to request proof of your driving habits in order to justify the reduction in price. You can reduce the cost of car insurance by making sure you don't buy coverage that you really don't need. For instance, if you have an older car with a relatively low replacement value then you may not need comprehensive or collision coverage. Eliminating excess coverage from your policy could lower your premiums considerably. If your goal is to lower the cost of your car insurance premium, remember that insurance companies often charge more to insure cars that are flashier or that cost more to repair. Having a low-profile vehicle,that is unlikely to get stolen, can often dramatically lower your rates. Remember that when it comes to coverages on your auto insurance policy, there are two that are mandatory. These are bodily injury and property damage liability. Also, if you have a new car that already has a loan, your company may require collision insurance in your policy. Other than that, the other coverages are optional. When searching for an auto insurance policy that is right for you and your vehicle, be aware of how much coverage you actually need. It is dangerous to be underinsured, but if you have have too much insurance, it can be an expensive mistake since you are paying for what you may not need. Many auto insurance companies automatically add extras, such as emergency road side assistance, legal protection, key replacement and guaranteed hire car to your policy. If you don't need these services, removing them from your policy can drop the annual cost of your auto insurance by a significant amount. Do not settle for the first auto insurance company that you find. You may be missing out on special discounts or rewards. For instance, some insurance companies offer discounted premiums for accident-free drivers, or for people of certain professions. Some even give discounts to college students who maintain good grades. Join an auto club to get better rates and special discounts. Many of these clubs partner with different insurance companies, so if you can join one, you can reap the benefits. Make sure to mention to your agent that you are a member of these clubs. Even if your company doesn't partner with them, they may still give you a lower rate. Always keep some kind of camera with you in your car. Being able to document the scene of an accident can help police and insurance companies to determine fault. It can also help the insurance adjuster to decide the outcome of your claim more quickly. If the accident was the fault of the other driver, your photos could help save you from costly rate increases. Maintenance If you are serious about saving money on automobile insurance, think about downsizing the number of vehicles you use. If your family can get by on only one car, you will save a substantial amount of money. Not only will you pay less for your insurance policy, but you'll also see savings in your monthly car maintenance bills. Remove towing from your car insurance. Removing towing will save money. Proper maintenance of your car and common sense may ensure that you will not need to be towed. Accidents do happen, but they are rare. It usually comes out a little cheaper in the end to pay out of pocket. In conclusion, it is definitely difficult to stay on top of all of the latest tips and tricks coming out about auto insurance. To make matters worse, information is constantly changing, which can make it nearly impossible to be an expert, unless you make it a point to keep yourself up to date. Hopefully, you found this article interesting, informative, and were able to learn a couple of new things."

15,The Brief Introduction Of The CarMD,autos-trucks," The CarMD can be used for a variety of situation. You can determine why your Check Engine light is on. You might also want to check for not found problems before you have on a long road trip. Or maybe you live in a state where they do state emissions ""smog"" tests. You can use it to check your vehicle out before you take it to get tested. If you are looking for a used car to purchase you can use the CarMD to check it out for potential problems before you buy it. CarMD can be taken to the car dealership and a diagnostic test can be run quickly on the used car. Even if the vehicle has been tampered with, a vehicle's computer stores codes even if the Check Engine light wiring has been disconnected. CarMD will access these codes and display a red LED indicator if any are present. Also, if the seller has recently cleared the computer's memory, the CarMD tool will indicate a possible problem with a yellow LED indicator. You can be rest assured that you will be able to determine the vehicle's health before making a purchase. On Board Diagnostics is a special program installed in your vehicle's computer system. It is part of the US government's mandate to help automotive manufactures lower their vehicle emissions. It is designed to check malfunctions, set a diagnostic code and turn on the Check Engine light when there is a problem. All 1996 or newer cars, light trucks, SUVs, and minivans manufactured or used in the US have the most advanced OBD, called the second-generation on-board diagnostics program. Many vehicles that were manufactured in the 80s and early 90s use OBD1 technology. It is the predecessor to today's second-generation diagnostics program. Some vehicles made in 1994 and 1995 use OBD1 and others use OBD2 systems. CarMD will work on vehicles with an early OBD2 system; however there will not be any information in the database to tell you what might be wrong. When your Check Engine light comes on it means that the vehicle's On-Board Diagnostics computer has found a problem that may affect emissions. This problem can range in severity from a loose gas cap, which wastes fuel and causes pollution, to an engine misfire, which may cause permanent damage. In any case, you really do not need to panic. Most of the time, this light is the vehicles' way of saying ""get me checked out soon!"" Ten percent of all vehicles on the road today are driving with the Check Engine light on. However, you really shouldn't do that for long periods of time without checking it out. It could be something as simple as a loose gas cap or it could be something that is potentially dangerous and costly if you let it go. The CarMD is a simple handheld device that will help you monitor your vehicle's health and will provide you with valuable information when something goes wrong.

17,Going Green with a Cat Back System,autos-trucks," The poisonous emissions from car exhausts are increasing by the day and the government is ever so keen on the issue. Catalytic converters are becoming a necessity and with them cat back systems all in the interest of our environment. This article illustrates the working of this exhaust components and how they can be used to improve the quality of our atmosphere. Catalytic converter This is part of a vehicle exhaust system and its function is to convert the byproducts of combustion into less toxic substances that can be emitted into the environment. This is done through various chemical processes that include oxidation carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons into carbon dioxide and water and reduction of oxides of nitrogen into nitrogen and water. There are two types of catalytic converters, two-way and three-way. The two-way converter was the earlier model produced between 1975 and 1980 and its name was derived from its function. It had the capability of oxidizing carbon monoxide and partially burnt carbons (hydrocarbons) into water and carbon dioxide. This model had one shortcoming, that it could not deal with the toxic nitrogen oxides that gasoline produces hence the invention of the three way converter. This is a newer model that cannot only convert carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons but also nitrogen oxides through reduction into nitrogen and water. From the discussion, you can understand why the law in some states is so keen on the presence of a catalytic converter. The absence of these would result to very harmful emissions into the atmosphere causing numerous health hazards. The catalytic converters go hand in hand with cat back systems discussed below. Cat back system The ‘cat’ stands for catalytic converter and was created to make use of legally required catalytic converters. It is the part of the exhaust system from the catalytic converter to the tip. It consists of the pipe from the converter to the muffler, the muffler and the exhaust tip. Its Function is to guide the gases safely out as well as to muffle the noise made by the high pressure gases. There are two reasons that you should get a vehicle that has these components. The first and most important reason is for our environment. Modern life is consistently adding hazards and more so to the environment. Needless to say, fresh air is life and we need to preserve it. Two, the law in various states requires it. Due to excessive emission of smog, various states are making it a requirement for all the vehicle owners and soon this will most likely be the case in all states. Save yourself the trouble and get one. The good news is that if you can get a cat back system in various outlets such as MagnaFlow for Acura, Audi, BMW, Ford, Land Rover, Jeep you name it. Just check out their products and help keep the environment clean."
18,How to Increase Your Engine Power at the Least Cost Possible,autos-trucks," Everyone is looking for ways to get more for less. Most methods used usually have a catch but the method discussed in this article is clear and simple and does not have any hidden costs. Whichever car you drive, there are various suggested ways of increasing your power usually costing more than you would be willing to give.  This article presents an argument for glass pack mufflers as an old, simple and inexpensive way to significantly increase your engine power at a lower cost. What is a glass pack muffler? This section gives the basics for those users who are not into all the car jargon.  There are many types of exhaust mufflers depending on the model of your car, weight, cost and so on. Glass pack mufflers are more of an accessory and can be fitted into any kind of vehicle. They are simply a type of muffler where the exhaust gases pass straight through the center of the muffler with fiberglass surrounding the exhaust channel to absorb some of the high frequency sound. The first make was released in 1968 under the trademark cherry bomb (you may find that most people know them by this name) and it features a straight through design. Improvements have been made since then but it is basically made of welded, aluminized steel designed to be reversible for ease of installation. How it works As we all know, mufflers are designed to reduce the noise produced as the high pressure exhaust gases pass through constricted space. Without them our roads would be unbearably noise polluted zones. Although they do this great service, it is always at the expense of the engine power. They are constricted and therefore impede the flow of gases and increase back pressure. This in turn affects the power and torque of your engine. This means that you have to choose between noise and back pressure. The makers of the glass pack mufflers found a way to get both through a design that allows direct flow of gases through the exhaust pipe greatly reducing the back pressure hence improving performance by letting out gases even faster. The fiberglass barrier, though not as effective as conventional mufflers, absorbs some of the high pitched sound. The trade-off Finally, there is always an advantage and a disadvantage in the use if any product.  As mentioned, the glass pack mufflers will produce a louder sound as compared to others. To counter this, some manufacturers such as MagnaFlow put extra acoustic packing material to muffle the noise even more. Since you are more interested in increasing the power, then this is more of what you want than what you do not.  Try them out!"
19,Road Safety Protocol,autos-trucks," Are you prepared for the worst on the road? Is your spare wheel checked and ready to replace a flat? Do you have a medical kit at hand? Do you know what the protocol is when you are involved in an accident? These are all questions most people sadly wished they had asked before being in one of the situations mentioned above. So many people get behind the wheel of a car and have no idea whatsoever how to respond when they find themselves standing next to the road in the rain with a flat wheel and no spanner. We will be shedding light on some useful tips that you should know about when you find yourself in a little predicament like those mentioned above. When involved in an accident When you or anyone you know is involved in an accident, there are a few things that should be kept in mind. First of all you should determine if any injuries where sustained by the accident. If no-one is injured in an accident it is safe to move the vehicles to the side of the road or to wherever else is safe. If someone has been injured however, you would have to leave everything as it is until the police and ambulance arrive. Another thing that one should remember when you are involved in an accident is to always take the details of all parties involved. This includes ID numbers, phone numbers, insurance numbers and so forth. Also make sure to share your details and take the details of both cars (registration numbers, model etc.), this helps with the process when claiming from insurance. It is always a good thing to have important numbers and details saved on your phone or stored some place where you can easily find it when you need it. When your car breaks down Most people (especially woman, not to be sexist) don’t know what to do or how to act when they find themselves in the uncomfortable position standing on the side of the road in the rain with a broken down car. To be honest, not everyone knows what to look at when they have smoke coming out of their engine, but there are a few precautions one can take to prevent your car from braking down. Always check the oil, water and tyre pressure before embarking on a journey. Once again you can’t go wrong by storing relevant numbers on your phone. Even if it does fell as if your world is falling apart, don’t panic. Here is a list of some essentials to take along on every journey to avoid sticky situations: Other than what we’ve already mentioned, there are a few more tips to consider such as pulling over as far off the side of the road as possible, stopping on a level surface when changing your wheel and try not to stop on a bend."
20,Turning A First Responder Vehicle Into A Mobile Command Post,autos-trucks," As a police officer, sheriff, fireman or EMS responder chances are pretty high that you're going to be first on the scene at an incident. Vehicle canopies and truck tents can help first responders turn their vehicles into a mobile command post to help organize the scene and provide additional shelter. The Incident Command System was developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide first responders such as police, fire and emergency medical services (EMS) with a guide to managing an incident and establishing cooperation and coordination of all agencies involved. The Incident Command Post, often a vehicle, is the on scene location where efforts are planned and coordinated. There is only one incident command post, however other vehicles may be used as satellite support centers. As a first responder speed and efficiency are obviously critical. One of the biggest challenges for many departments has been the inability to clearly distinguish which responder units are satellite and which one is the actual hub. Because first responders usually arrive in vehicles of all shapes and sizes they need to be able to make the most out of what they have and often this can become confusing as more responders arrive on the scene. This is where personalizing your emergency vehicle with the right equipment for incident response pays off. For a minimal price ranging falling between $175 and $375 emergency departments can furnish a vehicle with an easy up vehicle canopy or complete response kit including command post Flag and lighting. This equipment is compact and easy to stow, allowing emergency responders to quickly set up clearly marked positions with shelter that extends 3 to 4 feet beyond the rear of the vehicle. The center of command is also identified using a flag and lighting that is clearly visible above any other vehicle. Yes, Command Posts Come in All Shapes, Sizes A mobile command unit could come from any response agency ranging from the trunk of a police car to a specially equipped SUV worth a quarter-of-a-million-dollars. Most everything that needs to be done could be done from the trunk of a police vehicle. An emergency SUV could be housing additional radios, computer equipment and, in many cases, a fax machine and copier. The common denominator is that they all carry equipment essential to managing an emergency situation such as forms, administrative supplies, tactical equipment, barrier tape and checklists. Because first responders will be arriving in vehicles of all shapes and sizes they need to be able to make the most out of what they have to work with and the elements are rarely on your side. That's why when responding to an emergency, having a system that provides additional shelter to provide a working area and protect equipment is a must. Over time incidents have become bigger affecting more people across many regions translating into a need for specialized command units. Over the past 10 years fire departments, specifically, have shown an increased interest in using specialized command units to deal with major incidents and weather conditions. The Allentown Fire Department was one of these departments. They knew all too well the challenges of setting up a mobile command post with the changing seasons of Eastern Pennsylvania. Their changing seasons include winter snow and ice to summer heat and rain. Their command vehicle is a custom SUV in which the rear area of the vehicle was designed as a mobile command post. Since the command area required opening the rear doors, it was necessary for their department to find a protective device not only for the command area but for the personnel operating the command post. They implemented this type of light weight portable command post shelter for their vehicles which has proven to be the perfect solution. Any first responder department can use these specially fitted, light weight add-ons to turn a first response vehicle into a complete mobile command post to improve operations in adverse conditions."

You must first concentrate on parking the car on level ground and in a relatively quiet place. Once this is done, you will be required to relieve the petrol system pressure of the vehicle. If you are not aware of how to do this for the specific model, finding out is simple. Just detach the fuel panel which will be located beneath the dashboard. Once this has been done, it is necessary to turn the engine on and keep it running in neutral until it starts to stop from a lack of petrol. This is evident and you will notice the engine's change of pace almost immediately. When you notice this, get hold of the battery and use a wrench to pull out the black negative wire. Once this is done, in order to relieve the fuel pressure you must unscrew the fuel cap from the tank. After doing this, you will be ready to move on effectively and safely.

If you cannot do so, use a jack or similar device to get it up as much as possible. This will give it the support that is needed. Concentrate on disconnecting the fuel line from the filter, once you know you have identified it. The connection is held together by connect fittings and a plastic lock. For the disconnection to be possible, you may just need a screwdriver or similar tool to disengage the lock before simply pulling it out with the fingers. Certain models will require you to use a special tool for this purpose, which should be available at most auto parts suppliers and garages for a small price. This process might get a little messy on account of the petrol and the dirt, so carry a rag or a towel to deal with spillages and leaks. Once you have disconnected the petrol line successfully, you will need to think about how to remove the filtering device itself. It will be held in place with the use of a clamp bolt which should be secured onto the vehicle tightly. By using a wrench, you need to attempt to remove the clamp bolt while you are holding the filtering device firmly with the other hand. Once you have detached it, remove the entire device from area of the lorry. Attach your new device in the old one's place the same way as you removed the old one. Make absolutely certain that you position it in the correct way, so that the petrol flow points are pointed in the direction of the vehicle's engine. Once you are sure of this, you must use the wrench to fasten the fuel nut and clamp bolt securely, making sure no movement is possible. Re-install the fuel pump, reconnect the quick fittings and the black negative cable before starting the engine again and letting it run. Before you replace the fuel filter on your pickup truck, you should ensure that the filtering replacement is exactly the right match for your vehicle's make and model. Make sure of this before reinstalling the device. If you would like to be completely certain that you have the correct type of replacement, you might want to take the old filter with you before making a purchase in order to compare the two. It is crucial that you continue to carry out this process of replacement at least once a year in order to ensure your truck's engine runs and operates to its maximum. Make sure that throughout the procedure you stay safe, by keeping a distance from sparks and flames."

Unlike most products, you cannot simply throw away these types of batteries. The reason for this is that a 12 volt car battery contains many hazardous chemicals and materials. There are also many environmental safety concerns associated with the disposal of these batteries. There are actually several ways to properly dispose of car batteries. The most unique part of recycling batteries is that all of the elements can be reclaimed and reused in new car batteries. The lead in these batteries is almost 100% recyclable. The plastic components of these batteries can also be recycled and used in future products as well.  The sulfuric acid found in these batteries can be recycled and used in a number of different ways. For example it can be used in new car batteries, neutralized and then purified to be released as clean water, or it can also be turned into sodium sulfate. When turned to sodium sulfate it can be used in such products as fertilizer and dyes. In most standard car batteries heavy metals are found such as lead as well as plastic and acid. This is why if they are not properly disposed they can contaminate the air, water and soil of our planet. Also it does not matter if the battery is a 6 or 12 volt; both are classified as hazardous waste and need to be disposed of properly.

Since the economic downturn people more than ever are trying to extend the longevity of their vehicles.

Although the 3,000 mile rule has been around for many years now, some auto makers are stating that their newest vehicles can go for almost 10,000 miles without an oil change. In addition most mechanics suggest that you change the oil filter every time you make an oil change. Not changing your oil can result in a plethora of problems that center around costly repairs that could have been avoid with a basic oil change. Oil changes are relatively inexpensive and are a car maintenance necessity. The oil inside your engine acts as a vital lubricant allowing the metal parts to move smoothly. If your oil is not changed in a timely manner it can result in engine sludge. This sludge inside of your engine will cut down its performance dramatically. When this occurs your gas mileage will suffer greatly and overheating on hot summer days is more likely to happen. When a car is running the movement of the engine creates particles of debris which will find their way into the oil of the engine. When changing the oil it clears out all of these harmful pieces of debris which are causing damage to the internal components of the engine. Frequent oil changes will most defiantly contribute to a cleaner and better working engine. It has also been proven that the most common causes of engine wear are caused by friction. Therefore by completing these oil changes you dramatically decrease your chance of engine failure in your vehicle. A common misunderstanding is that people think dark oil means dirty oil. In reality dark oil signifies that the oil is doing its job. In time motor oil will break down, this is why it needs to be replaced.

13,9 Tips To Get Your Vehicle In Shape To Save Money on Gas,autos-trucks," If you can benefit from all the tips in this article, you have the potential to save a whopping 30 or $.07 a gallon. Underinflated tires create more resistance and drag, causing the engine to work harder and use more gas. Here are nine proven ways to improve mileage by preparing and maintaining your car, truck or van. Recommended maintenance should be done at the correct time intervals, so the vehicle is always running at its best efficiency. This will naturally give you the best gas mileage. 1- Check your tire pressure every three weeks in all four tires. Invest in a good quality pressure gauge. Tires have a recommended inflation range (eg 32 to 35 psi). Your tires should be inflated to the higher number of pounds, recommended by the manufacturer. This will give you the best mileage. Studies have found that if your tires are only 5 pounds underinflated, you will lose 2% or $.07 a gallon. Underinflated tires create more resistance and drag, causing the engine to work harder and use more gas. 2- The engine uses gas to transport every pound in your vehicle. The more weight, the more the load on the engine and the more gas is needed every mile. Take out as much excess weight as possible. We all have ""stuff"" in the car, like golf clubs, that doesn’t have to be there all the time. The U.S. Dept of Energy estimates that we can save 2 or $.70/gallon. Using high performance spark plugs will yield the best mileage. 6- Remove your roof rack if it is not being used, because it causes extra wind drag and reduces your fuel economy. 7- Lowering a tailgate on your pickup will give it less resistance to the wind and improve your mileage. 8- Synthetic oil can save an average of 5% or $.14 a gallon. It lasts longer than regular oil and allows your engine to work more efficiently. Once you change to synthetic you must keep using it. Synthetic cannot be mixed with regular, so it is a good idea to keep some with you if you need to add a small makeup amount. Usually, brands cannot be mixed. 9- The next time you need new tires, consider the latest high mileage designs. Goodyear’s fuel-saving tread compound provides a low rolling resistance. The manufacturer says that this can save up to 2,600 miles worth of gas over the life of the tires (60,000 miles). Figuring gas at $3.80/gallon and an average of 18mpg before switching, there would be a $527 saving over the life of the tires. This is almost enough to pay for the tires."

Since all of them are important in their own right and influence the quality of life, paying much more than the average for them in one of the better performing economies of the world would appear to be a travesty of justice to many. It seems quite funny that Australians should be paying much more for bananas as compared to citizens in Germany, New Zealand, the UK or France and they do feel ripped off. The impact is a wide spread one given the fact that bananas are one of the top selling fruits in Australia. Coming to new car prices, the thought is that there should be more of imports. The current situation does not allow for much import and to that extent, the Australian car market is a pretty protected one. In the absence of foreign competition, it is felt that local car manufacturers are having a field day and the consumer is also not helped by the fact that certain ‘taxes’ have only served to escalate new car prices in Australia further. The recommendation is to follow New Zealand that imports many Japanese used cars and gets fantastic deals on them. One example of how much more an Australian pays for cars can be understood from the fact that he pays $360,000 for a Mercedes that is available for only $110,000. Though this example is a bit too stretched, it is an undeniable truth that on most family cars, the Australians pay more than $5000 for the same vehicle as compared to their peers in other countries. This saving of $5000 by itself would mean a lot to a family, says the report. The report acknowledges the impact of inflation and global commodity prices going up but feels that if some of the government policies can be made friendlier towards new car prices, the consumer would be benefitted and that would also push up demand. The scenario on housing and retail is pretty similar, making Australia one of the most expensive countries in the world and unless there is a policy shift, Australians will continue to pay more and new car prices would continue to remain much more expensive, concludes the report."

1,Honda Civic Type R Best Performing Family Vehicle,autos-trucks," Honda Civic Type R Best Performing Family Vehicle The Honda Civic is a much designed family rear door which is built by one of the world's mainly scientifically ground – breaking automobile makers.

3,Birth of a Style Icon: Lexus IS 200,autos-trucks," Birth of a Style Icon: Lexus IS 200 Toyota launched Lexus to compete mainly with luxury automobile manufacturers like BMW, Merc and Cadillac. Thus the core focus of Lexus’ lineup remained on luxurious, high performing vehicles; including sedans, coups, SUVs and, as of 2010, hatchbacks as well. Though LS 400 was the first luxury car designed and developed by Lexus, under top secret F1 project, in 1989, it was until 1998 that Lexus IS was launched, an entry level compact sedan directly challenging BMW 3 Series and Mercedes C Class. With introduction of an entry level high performance model, Lexus equipped itself to engage its top rivals on all fronts. Shift towards performance First generation IS was brain child of accomplished engineer Nobuaki Katayama and was based on previous, AS200, Altezza. Previously Lexus was focusing mainly on luxury, with IS a sharp shift towards performance could be felt. Lexus IS 200 engine in sedan version of IS was only a 2.0 litre petrol engine but it produced 210 bhp, however it was destined only for Japanese market and exported by individual dealers, not by Lexus. Iconic looks Apart from high performance, IS’ styling was also acclaimed as it used chromed tail lights which were never used before. Soon ‘Altezza Styled’ lights became a hit trend, with many auto-part manufacturers developing similarly styled lights for other makes and models. Since Lexus was launched to challenge already established automakers, so in some ways it took inspiration from them as well; LS resembled Toyota Camry and Crown, SC and GS employed Mercedes’ trademark front lighting; first generation IS can be called the true Lexus as its design and specs were truly unique. Getting intimidating and masculine with time Second generation IS went under the knife and a more aggressive and masculine looking IS was presented in 2005. However, tail lights of Australian and UK versions resembled tail lights of contemporary Camry. These aggressive looks were also complemented by an equally intimidating array of new Lexus IS engines; ranging from 2.0 to 5 litre V6s and V8s, producing from nimble 153 to jaw dropping 417 bhp in a compact saloon chassis. With strict environmental regulations in European countries, leading to higher taxes, Lexus IS found it hard to grip European market with its bigger V8s. Up till now, its sale statistics indicate that Japan and USA are the leading markets of IS. So like its German rivals, Lexus refrained from introducing bigger engine models in Europe and British markets, though enthusiasts still import them into these markets."

8,Classic Car Restoration: What to do with a Basketcase Car,autos-trucks," Deciding what to do with a basketcase car is one of the toughest decisions for people who've already invested time, money, and love into their classic car restorations. At the same time, there are plenty of vintage car veterans who are always ready to finish a difficult project. Whether you want to put the final touches on a half-finished car or you just can't find the time to complete your own, you need to know how to save yourself time, frustration, and money. Here are a few things to consider before you buy, finish, or sell a basketcase car. When You Want to Buy a Basketcase Restoring a basketcase can be a challenging but rewarding experience. However, there are often good reasons why other enthusiasts are eager to get their incomplete hotrods and muscle cars off their hands. Before you invest in an old project, you'll need to make these important considerations: *Safety comes first. If the car you're considering doesn't even have breaks, an engine, or a steering wheel yet, then you may not have much to worry about. Otherwise, you should test the car in a safe, empty area. You need to make sure the owner is being honest about the car's reliability and safety - or lack thereof. *Check the frame and body. Cars that look like they're on their last legs can sometimes be restored to their previous luster - but only if they still have solid foundations. If a classic car's frame and body are in decent shape, then there's good chance you'll be able to make some headway on its restoration. If not, you're looking at a bottomless money pit. *Look for cover-ups. Some restorers and shops will cover large patches of rust and even holes with sheet metal. They don't always do so maliciously, but unnoticed rust is extremely dangerous. It's especially important to check for defects in places where larger parts have been replaced. Sourcing Your Parts When you're restoring a barely-finished basketcase, you'll need to find the best places to get your parts. If a previous owner didn't get the project finished, it may have been because the necessary components were hard to find, too expensive, or both. Before you even make the purchase, it's important that you find out how you're going to get what you need - and what it's all going to cost. Once you've figured out what parts are necessary, you can check the online inventories of specialty shops across the country. There are also junkyards full of classic cars with parts for the taking, though you'll need to go in person to see what's available. Ultimately, you're going to incur the greatest costs if you need foreign parts or shipping for large items. When to Call it Quits Even if you've lovingly labored over a classic car for years, there may come a time when you have to move on. A project will sometimes seem too good to be true when you first start - yet it becomes nothing but a financial drain further down the road. Your priorities and interests might also change, leaving you with an immobile heap in your garage or driveway. Whatever the case may be, you can still get back some of your hard-earned money. Contact a professional classic car restorer now and inquire if they purchase or are interested in purchasing a basketcase project from you."
9,Classic Cars in Florida Withstand the Test of Time,autos-trucks," Classic cars in Florida are the best choice for hobbyists who want their vintage cars in peak condition. Because of the state's temperate climate, classic cars in Florida are not subject to the harsh environmental conditions of those in the northeastern and western states. Even the highest quality body work and paint jobs can be ruined by the elements, and environmental conditions can be extremely difficult to predict and control. Here are a few of the pitfalls you avoid when you buy classic cars in Florida. Cold Temperatures - bodies, coolants States on the upper east coast are often subject to extremely cold temperatures which can wreak havoc on restored automobiles. For instance, car batteries are always less efficient in the cold. While newer cars' batteries may stand up well in freezing temperatures, older models often fail to start. Also, older cars' coolant systems are less advanced than those found in automobiles produced today. Even with modern antifreeze and lubricants, old transmissions can easily become clogged and sluggish. Finally, cold temperatures - as well as frequently changing temperatures - can shorten the life of tires by causing them to expand and compress. Replacing parts on contemporary vehicles is expensive enough, but finding parts for classic cars can cost a fortune. Snow Frequent snows in cold states greatly increase the risk of rust on classic cars. Many collectors prize their automobiles' authentic steel bodies, but metal can easily corrode when it comes into contact with water. Snow can hit warm cars, melt, and cause a great deal of winter-time rust damage. Road Salt Most states with high annual snowfalls also have effective salting teams for clearing their roads. While road salt certainly makes streets safer to drive on, it can be horrible for restored automobiles. Salt acts as a catalyst in the chemical reaction between iron and water, accelerating the rusting process on original steel car bodies. Any classic car that's been heavily driven in the snow has likely suffered more than its fair share of rust damage. Extreme Heat The dry heat of dessert states is horrible for both the look and performance of classic cars. Exposure to the hot sun causes paint to fade, peel away, crack, and bubble. Even the upholstery of cars can fade or become excessively dry in high temperatures. As for performance, the cooling systems of older cars are often ill-equipped to handle extreme heat. The hoses which feed essential lubricants and coolants to the engine and other critical components can crack or melt during the hot summer months. Classic cars from extremely hot states often require additional work and replacement parts to mitigate such heat damage, and they may even need entirely new paint jobs. Dust and Sand The excessive dust and sand found in dry climates can easily damage a classic paint job. Over time, small particles can scratch away paint and gloss, causing a car's color to fade. Dust can also make its way into the engine and other critical components. Classic cars which have spent years or even decades sitting in dry states may have accumulated a great deal of dust damage. Avoid these headaches and get a restored automobile that will look and perform the way it's supposed to. Buy your classic cars in Florida - the perfect weather is as good for vehicles as it is for people."
10,Classic Car Restoration Services: Understanding Classic Car Paint,autos-trucks," Getting a new paint job can be one of the most beneficial classic car restoration services. Classic car restoration services can use new paint to make your restoration look vibrant, colorful, and as good as new. However, there are several options to consider when you want to touch up or completely restore your vintage car's paint job. Here are some of the things you need to think about before buying paint, primer, or even full paint jobs from classic car restoration services. Restoration or Repainting? Repainting an entire car - classic or modern - can be costly. Thankfully, it is sometimes possible to salvage the paint job on your classic car and retain the original color. When old cars sit out for years in junk yards or spend decades without proper maintenance, their outer layers of paint can easily corrode. Ultraviolet rays, dust, salt, and acidic rain can wreak havoc on paint jobs. If your car has large patches of rust or corrosion, it will probably need several new coatings of primer, paint, and gloss. If there are just a few blemishes, however, you can see dramatic improvements by simply removing the outer layer of paint. As long as the original paint job was several layers thick, stripping away the damaged layer can reveal deep, vibrant color. Buying Paint It can sometimes be difficult to find the right paint for your car. Older automobiles were often sold in colors that are no longer popular, so hobbyists who want to reproduce an authentic look will need to search for specialty paints. Classic car restoration services often carry vintage colors and offer options for mixing paints to achieve a specific appearance. Prepping for a New Paint Job If you're going to repaint your car yourself, you need to put a great deal of time and effort into the prep work. Begin by using a power-sander to thoroughly smooth your car's body and remove blemishes. This is a time-consuming process, but it is absolutely crucial for a quality paint job. Once your car is smooth, thoroughly wash and dry it, using an air compressor to remove excess moisture, dirt, and particles left over from the sanding process. Finish the prep job by taping and covering every surface you don't want painted. Classic Car Paint You first need to choose the most optimal environment possible for completing your paint job. Indoors is ideal, and perfect weather is a must if you're going to paint outside. Dirt and insects can easily make their way onto your primer and paint once applied, leaving unsightly marks. Before you apply any color, you'll need to put on two coats of primer. Once your primer is dry, remove most of it by yet again sanding your car. This will leave a smooth, paint-friendly surface and fill in any gaps in car body. When you're ready to paint, you'll need to either apply several thick coats, or use one coat followed by a protective gloss. In either case, you must constantly make sure the prior coats of paint or primer are completely dry and free of blemishes before you continue with the next. Buying a Paint Job Many hobbyists enjoy doing their own paint jobs, but it requires a great deal of time, money, know-how, and specialized equipment. Unless you own an auto shop yourself, it may be better to hire classic car restoration services to professionally apply a beautiful new paint job to your car. Professional classic car restoration services can use blasting techniques like sand blasting to strip a car of its paint and finish, but even this doesn't always work for some cars. For a comprehensive classic car paint restoration project, dipping the frame and body components in an acid wash to completely remove all seals, gaskets, paints, solvents, oils and dirt is often the best option.

11,Understanding Fiberglass Vs. Metal Classic Corvette Restoration,autos-trucks," If you're interested in classic Corvette restoration, you have two primary options for body materials - fiberglass and steel. While almost all cars from the 1920s and 30s were made from steel, classic Corvette restoration enthusiasts often opt for newer fiberglass bodies. Each option has its pros and cons, and what is best for one hobbyist may not work so well for another. Here are some of the things you need to consider when picking your materials for classic Corvette restoration. Bragging Rights Although fiberglass bodies are often more practical, collectors typically view steel as the gold standard for classic Corvettes. It has that authentic look, feel, and heavy weight reminiscent of pre-WWII American cars. Even steel reproductions of old Corvette bodies are seen as ""more authentic"" than the fiberglass models. Price In almost every situation, a fiberglass body is going to be cheaper than its metal counterpart. Counting the body work and classic car paint jobs often necessary with metal originals, restoring Corvettes with steel bodies can cost over ten thousand dollars more than with fiberglass. The difference in price doesn't necessarily reflect a difference in quality, however. Although fiberglass used to be seen as a cheap imitation material, companies are now making glass bodies which look and feel almost exactly like the originals. This value is the main reason for the widespread use of fiberglass among the classic Corvette community. Availability The availability of fiberglass reproductions usually depends on current trends in the restoration market. While it is generally easier to find a given car body made from fiberglass than from steel, a lack of demand for a certain year's model can make it difficult to acquire. On the other hand, the availability of steel originals is unaffected by market trends. While most steel Corvette bodies are hard to come by, certain models may not exist at all in fiberglass. For classic Corvette restorers interested in rarer models, steel may be the only viable option. Environmental Conditions Steel and fiberglass are both subject to wear and tear from certain elements. Steel is resilient under a wide range of temperatures, but it corrodes easily. People who live in wet or snowy areas will thus find it easier to maintain fiberglass Corvettes. However, fiberglass can easily warp in hot environments. When this happens, it also releases chemicals into the air and can turn a dingy green color. If available, steel may be a better option for enthusiasts who will have to store their cars in hot areas. Workability For amateur restorers, steel can be much easier to work with than fiberglass. It requires little special equipment or training, and simple cutting, grinding, and welding techniques are often sufficient for restorations and repairs. Making repairs to fiberglass requires the precise mixing, cutting, and laying of new glass. Overall, the material is much less forgiving than steel. Of course, these concerns are only important to those who plan on doing their own body work. For classic Corvette restoration enthusiasts who want bodies already in excellent repair, reproductions - most often fiberglass - may be the best option.

12,Classic Car Restoration Services: Blasting Vs. Chemical Dip,autos-trucks," Classic car restoration projects - especially Corvette restorations - require the owner and shop to make the critical decision between blasting the car and using a chemical dip service. Comprehensive classic car restoration services will make this determination based on the particular car and the type of body materials it is comprised of. In order to understand which process will work for your restoration project, it's important to comprehend the basic differences between blasting and a chemical or acid dip. Classic Car Restoration Services: Blasting When it comes to classic car restorations, blasting refers to the process of stripping paint, enamel, finish and other coatings from the body, frame and other areas of the vehicle. This is accomplished by literally blasting particulates at the car at high velocity and intensity. These particulates are referred to as the blasting media, and can consist of different grades of sand, glass beads, crush walnut shells and other media. This process strips the paint and other surface materials off the body and leaves a workable surface that is generally ready to prime. However, there are a number of things to consider when working on your Corvette restoration, antique Chevy pickup or other project. The most significant problem is that despite the best blasting efforts, it's impossible to get the media into every space on your body and frame. Weld points, joints and inside the rails of the frame are all areas that cannot be reached with sodablasting, sandblasting or other blasting techniques. In some cases this issue can be corrected by filling these spaces with a waxy filler substance, but even this material will not be able to penetrate all areas where rust may be developing. Working with a professional classic car restoration services firm is critical for a number of other reasons related to blasting. This includes the fact that blasting leaves a significant amount of particulate materials that are difficult to clean and may cause problems during the final paint coat application process as the particles work their way out of the car and onto the surface. Additionally, inexperienced restorers can actually warp the body elements of your classic car if they are not properly trained or provided with adequate equipment. If done correctly, one of the most significant benefits of blasting your classic car is that the surface will be instantly ready for primer. Additionally, blasting does not strip the vehicle of sealants and primer in areas that you want left un-blasted. Overall, blasting is cheaper than a chemical dip, and there are more classic car restoration services offering this particular method than there are those offering a full acid bath. Nevertheless, there are distinct benefits to a chemical dip as well. Classic Car Restoration Services: Chemical Dip One of the most significant problems reported with chemical dips is that the neutralization process isn't always completed properly. In many cases the job simply can't be completed properly (for the long term) because the acid neutralizer - applied to the car after the dip to stop the acid from doing residual damage - isn't able to get into all of the same areas that the chemical dip reached. This means that over time, some of the acid may leech out and corrode paint or otherwise damage the surface of your classic car. The trade-off here is that a chemical dip can force its way into every nook and crevice of your car- even attacking the rust on the inside of the frame rails. A chemical dip also means that there is very little preparation work needed - all undercoating, sealers, oil, resin, tar, dirt and anything else will be stripped away without any manual intervention before or during the dipping process. Some classic car restoration services have reported that after an acid dip, the resulting surface of the car is so smooth that it's difficult or impossible to get it to take a coat of paint. Couple this with the fact that an acid bath is often more expensive and less easy to obtain than blasting, and it's easy to see why so many people complete their classic car restoration projects with blasting services. However, a true professional classic car restorations shop will carefully analyze your vehicle to determine which the right choice is for you. Because there are so many variables involved and because even the slightest mistake can prove disastrous, it's best to leave your serious, committed project to an expert classic car restoration services firm."
13,Dedicated Transport Companies,autos-trucks," Pretoria, South Africa – January 2012 – Transport companies are liberally represented in this country. Road transport in particular, is one of the biggest sectors of this industry, and this is where Active Transport has positioned itself. The road network is extensive, comprising some 754 000 kms nationally, with about 70 000 kms being surfaced. For many years previously, most of South Africa's goods were dispatched by rail. As the economy grew and prompt deliveries became more important, trucking of goods via road grew. The rail sector just could not offer the same service that road cartage could. There are said to be plans to regenerate the aging goods rail system, but this lies in the future, and will take time and large investment before it might play the same role as it did in bygone days. Where to Find Transport Businesses Although telephone directories and Yellow Pages list these organisations, the internet is accessible to most persons seeking information. Certainly, the majority of established companies either are listed here, and/or have their own websites. Because clients would be most likely to contact a moving company in their own area, search engines will take them directly to relevant listings. Well established contractors such as Active Transport, have branches in the major centres, Johannesburg, Pretoria, Cape Town, Durban, and cities in other provinces nationally. Types of Transport Providers There are probably more types of carriers than there are types of vehicles. Besides air, sea and generic truck freight, most concerns specialise. They move abnormal loads and rigging, provide supply chain storage, as well as offer distribution and transport to the the taxi industry, car hire, busses and shuttle services. These concerns also specialise in their own defined geographical areas. Certain service providers cover only their local area, whilst others do likewise and also undertake long distance, cross border and international moving. Active Transport offers its quality services in all these sectors. Furniture Removals Due in part to South Africa's new dispensation and democracy, economic growth has been substantial. Coupled with this, home and office building and housing development continues on a large scale. This clearly has a very positive impact on furniture removal and relocation contractors, be they office/corporate or domestic services. Not only do first time home owners need to occupy their new premises with all their possessions, but many also upgrade after a few years, again requiring relocation services. Relocating office equipment is another specialised undertaking. Down time must be kept at a minimum – no business owner can afford the time to cart equipment via many trips in a borrowed minivan or pick-up truck. Sensitive electronic equipment requires extreme care in packing and moving. Documents and files need to be kept in good order. Active Transport has the expertise, experience and qualified staff to provide effective solutions for furniture packing, removal, storage and transportation. Only covered trucks are used, and the safety and protection of everything they handle, is of prime importance. A concern such as Active Transport, which regards removals as an art and a way of life, rather than just a series of jobs, makes it their core business to provide exceptional service in all aspects of their activities."

15,How Long Does It Take To Become A Police Officer?,autos-trucks," Being a part of the police force is one of the most coveted positions in the United States as well as across the globe. A person who becomes a police officer is bound to face a lot of challenges and responsibilities during his course of his/her job. However, there is an intrinsic motivation and pleasure at being able to help the society at large with your services as a police officer. A Police officer has to undergo an extensive selection process in which he is tested both physically and mentally. Once he is found to be fit in every aspect, he has to undergo a rigorous training procedure at a police academy. A letter of employment then comes with many strings attached rather than a uniform, badge and keys to your police car, as suspected by many of us wanting to become police officers. Every state in the United States has a different training procedure for police officers. Each state also has a number of training academies which offer law enforcement training to individuals who are selected for the police force. There are around 274 academies on county, regional or state basis, 249 academies on college, university and technical school level and 103 academies at city or municipal level, making a total of 626 law enforcement academies in the United States. Some states require candidates to get relevant law enforcement training at the local college and then apply for the police force. Whereas there are some states that require individuals to go through the hiring process and then go through the police academy’s in-house training program. There are some other states, which may require completing the internal training apart from having an external academy certificate. However, in each of these scenarios every selected candidate has to undergo a mix of classroom training, along with strenuous physical training. The average duration of basic training is around 18 weeks in all these academies. However, they might range from four to six weeks considering the differences in each academy. This includes covering topics like firearms skills, first aid, self defense, criminal law, ethics, health and fitness, patrol procedures, problem solving, mediation skills, stress prevention, human relations etc. On the other hand, this excludes the field training component.  On average, a trainee has to spend 180 hours or about eight weeks in the field while he is tagged along a training officer on routine patrol as well as various other duties. Some states also require continuous education after you have got your training certificate for further promotion and advancement at your job."
16,All The Stuff You Have To Know With regards to Engine Dynamometers,autos-trucks," The very best and most professional ways to determine the engine's efficiency is the dynamometer.  This particular machine is able to study the power and also torque of the powerplant that it's hooked to. They are utilized by the actual powerplant producers themselves. How does a dynamometer work? In some instances it is connected to the dyno using a shaft.  This is completed prior to the engine is actually attached to the chassis and definately will allow the dyno to complete the measurements on the powerplant. Afterwards, the actual motor is ignited, and it is set running at a consistent speed, and the torque that is applied to the dynamometer is the engine's torque. The results of these calculations are usually precise and there aren't any losses due to rubbing. The dyno's we're speaking about tend to be the older types of dyno's. The new dynamometer employ computer systems to perform the calculations. These are super easy to make use of and handle. Desire to be able to simulate standard driving circumstances and also race conditions? Then the use of the new dyno's is the thing that you should be utilizing in order to simulate these kinds of conditions. When you're out there driving a car on the highway, there are issues that in which may influence just how an engine will respond and also the level of power that it may create. A few of these items that will be able to effect the motors effectiveness would be the air temperature as well as the level of dampness as well as pressure. These could always be taken into consideration whenever checking an engine with a dynamometer.  Using math and some different formulas and of course the dyno, different meteorological conditions can be simulated and the power of the engine calculated.  So how the power adjusts any time the air pressure lowers for instance can be simply calculated. Real-life circumstances can be simulated through improving the temperature at which the dynamometer checks are performed, because the motor is heating up as it runs. Anyhow, it mustn't be overlooked that after the actual motor is mounted to the chassis it's going to hook up with the drivetrain.  After the engine is put in a vehicle it changes the power to get soaked up. Hence the numbers coming from a motor dynamometer might be a quite different. If you need to appraise the power at the wheels you will need a particular dyno, that is known as the chassis dynamometer.  I hope you have liked this small visit of the dyno."
17,An unbiased view of 3M Clear Bra,autos-trucks," The 3m clear bra is actually a terrific invention for any car-lover who treats his prized possession like a true friend. A man's most desirable buddy will not be usually the household dog. Oftentimes a automobile can take the spot of a terrific pet and nothing hurts over seeing that initially scratch or dent on your preferred automobile. Yet, conventional protective bras are not probably the most eye-catching alternative for automobile owners who desire to protect their investments. The issue with all the conventional protective covering is just as a result of truth that it covers the magnificent machine. No genuine car enthusiast wants to hide his prized automobile beneath a rubbery surface. He does not desire to invest a great deal of funds on the ideal finish to cover it up with a protective layer. Sadly, lots of auto owners had to pick out in between chips and scrapes or hiding the finish. Not any longer. A auto enthusiast can go for a 3m clear bra that protects the automobile by developing a colorless barrier in between the car's finish and the elements. The 3m clear bra is just a protective film which is literally painted more than the car's exterior. This item is generally utilized on trucks, vehicles and vans of vehicle owners who cringe in the believed of a pebble receiving near their priceless object. The 3m clear bra can also be used to safeguard headlights also. The protective layer is commonly applied for the front on the car and on the lenses with the headlights. The beauty of this material is that its practically undetectable. The original design from the car is just not changed in any way. The owner has the peace of mind that comes with understanding that the car is protected although having the luxury of enjoying his automobile in its original state. Some might wonder if the product is honestly as effective as the conventional protective cover. The 3m clear bra will shield the vehicle from chipping. The material was originally created to become implemented on aircraft propellers to defend them from chipping. Certainly the material is going to be efficient at preventing chipping on vehicles too. Yet another concern could be the excellent in the clarity with the 3m clear bra. How clear is it, definitely? The manufacturer from the item boasts that the material is practically undetectable unless the car is very white in color. The clear coat is slightly visible on a stark white automobile when especially close however it is not detectable from a distance. You might see a faint line exactly where the 3m clear bra stops but that's far better than an ugly bug shield or paint chips."
18,Damage Control: Mitigating the Effects of Rising Product Liability Insurance Rates.,autos-trucks," It had to happen. Product liability insurance rates for the dietary supplement business, which have been in a steep decline for about seven years, have bottomed out in the previous ninety days, and are probably headed upwards in the coming term. Why? Rates have declined by 80% according to some estimates. They couldn't go down without end. Insurers have been struck by shattering losses and an progressively litigious social environment. Interest rates are at monumental lows with no end in sight. The ebb and flow, roller coaster course of premiums for commercial insurance has historical precedence and is destined once again to rise. Nevertheless there are several practical steps you can put into practice that improve the odds that you will endure the seller's market for insurance and be around to capitalize on the next buyers market when it comes. Now, some tips. Don't Delay Until the Last Minute Start talking to your broker about your renewal at least 90 days before the renewal date. Underwriters will be asking more questions about your business, questions they weren't bothering to ask last year. Since the process is going to be more difficult, it will take more time. Focus on Coverage- With Price Take some time in understanding your coverage. And not simply for product liability insurance rates (although for most supplement companies this is far and away the most pricey policy they purchase). Are the risks you're most worried about insured in your current coverage? Are you aware of areas wherein you have exposure but no coverage? Read your policies, or better yet meet with your insurance professional and carry a comprehensive review of coverage. Be prepared, as one more characteristic of a ""hard"" or sellers market is that insurance companies invariably attempt to reduce coverage by adding up exclusions and endorsements that conflict with what you thought you were buying. Inform Management for Higher Premiums Nobody likes surprises. Mid-level managers at larger companies need to prepare the bosses for higher premium rates. Insurance buyers should communicate with internal senior management regarding the company's tolerances for uninsured risk, as deductibles may rise and high limits of liability insurance may perhaps no longer be an affordable luxury. Step in to your Underwriters Shoes Attempt to imagine yourself as the product liability underwriter for your business. What questions would you ask and how can your company respond to them? You accepted a 483 warning letter this year (it's on the internet and your underwriter will find it)-do you have a ready and logical explanation? Can you give copies of the certificate of insurance program you mange for your suppliers or-do you even have one? Are there any elements of your website that would frighten away an otherwise interested underwriter (sports nutrition companies should take special note of this suggestion). Have you jumped from carrier to carrier each year (red flag for an underwriter) or does your record show that you have demonstrated some level of loyalty to one or two carriers? If you've had insured claims in the last five years, are you prepared to tell your side of the story as to what happened, and present supporting records if asked? Select a Broker Who Specializes In Your Industry and Team Up Have you ever said to yourself, ""my broker clearly does not understand what we do""? Make it a top priority to find a broker who understands the supplement industry and will be an effective advocate for your insurance interests. Whether you supply raw material, finished product, or both, in a hard market the underwriter will still place you in the dietary supplement arena, where some unscrupulous characters still thrive. The reality is you are going to pay for that association, and a competent broker will have the skills to distinguish you from the rest of the pack. In addition, most insurance buyers are not aware that all insurers offering product liability to the dietary supplement business require the use of a wholesale insurance broker to retrieve them. So the broker you select (hereafter called the ""retail broker"") must submit your account to a wholesale broker, who in turn will yield it to viable insurance companies. Most people are under the impression that their retail broker is talking directly with the insurance underwriters. This is not the case. As a result, the introduction of even another party to the buying chain makes the insurance procurement process more vulnerable to something ""falling between the cracks."" With two brokers (wholesale and retail) now in the picture, it is even more critical that a company select a competent and knowledgeable retail broker to coordinate the marketing of its insurance So select your broker carefully-- and don't wait until the last minute!"
19,Have Your Pickup Truck Safety Inspected,autos-trucks," If you are interested in learning about ways that you can have your pickup truck safety inspected, then you should browse the web for relevant information. The Internet now has all kinds of articles to help you with this and some of them can offer you important insight. So spend some time online and see what you can come up with. Also, ask family members and friends that might know something on the subject. Other drivers can be the best source of information. First of all you need to remember that the car's safety is extremely important and you should never overlook that aspect. All drivers should be aware of this, however truck drivers have to be extra careful in order to ensure that themselves and other drivers around them are not at risk. As trucks operate in a very different way than normal sized cars do, one can never be thorough enough when inspecting a vehicle's safety. To ensure a safe trip at all times and under any weather conditions, a few things need to be done regularly by all truck drivers. Although this has been said a lot, it can never be stressed enough. You need to make sure that the car's tires are faultless at all times. Check that they have sufficient tread and make sure they are properly inflated. When they are under-inflated they tend to be less safe, burn more fuel and prevent the car from being able to carry a significant load. If they are over-inflated then they are unsafe under wet weather conditions, make the vehicle harder to handle and they wear down very easily which results in you having to spend more money in new tires. Also check for little objects, like stones or nails that might have become embedded in the tire and make sure the sidewalls have not been damaged in any way as this can cause problems when you're driving at a high speed. One of the most important things that you will need to check is that your brakes are working properly. Make sure that the lug nuts are tight and of course not cross-threaded. Ensure that the breaks are not too worn down or damaged. Even if they look fine when you try them, still double and triple check when you're inspecting the car. This is a very important part of the process and you need to know that everything is in great condition. Although it does not look like it should be at the top of your inspection list, still checking all glass parts of the vehicle is crucial. You should ensure that the windshield as well as the side and back windows are completely clean and free from cracks or anything else that could prevent you from seeing properly. When you're driving you need to maintain maximum visibility at all times, so clean your windows properly with a special cleaner that will allow you to get rid of every little mark that could turn into a problem when driving. The mirrors inside and outside the car should be checked as well and any dirt or marks should be carefully removed. It goes without saying that the engine will have to be thoroughly inspected as well. If there are any problems in that area, then they should identified as early as possible for problems to be avoided. For this reason you need to check fluid levels, petrol, oil and engine cooler. If the engine has been acting strange, then spend a bit more time on getting this area sorted and make sure you check everything again and again, from engine air filter to battery. Make sure there are no broken wires or any other kind of damage, especially if the car has been parked outside for a long period of time. Ensuring that the lights work properly is also very important. Make sure they are all bright enough, clean and function with no problems. Even hazard lights and side markers should be working at all times, so if anything is damaged, then you should immediately replace it. A good idea would be to always have extra light bulbs for every kind of light on your car in a cupboard or a tool case inside the vehicle. This way, even if something stops working unexpectedly, you will be able to replace it immediately. When you want to have your pickup truck safety inspected, you should ensure you take all the above steps. Perhaps even keeping a safety kit on board with you all the time is something you would like to do as it can save you from unexpected problems, costs and frustration. Include a flashlight, a first aid kit, a fire extinguisher and a few necessary tools in it. Make sure you always have a phone that works well and from which, should anything happen, you can immediately call for assistance."
20,Reasons To Have Your Car Suspension Inspected,autos-trucks," If you decide you want to have your car suspension inspected, then there are some basic facts about a car's undercarriage to understand. Worn suspension systems are something you want to catch early on. Otherwise, the tires may begin to show excessive wear and tear and you may encounter mysterious knocking noises from under the vehicle. If you perform a lot of commuting and cover many miles each day, your automobile may eventually need realignment. You can test the timing for realignment by driving slowly, such as a roll-up to a stop sign, and slightly easing your grip on the steering wheel. If the car seems to instinctively pull one direction or another, then realignment may be in order. You may also note this tendency when making a turn, and the car wants to go strongly in a certain direction as you pull the wheel. Other things to note while driving include knocking sounds from the vehicle. Turn off the radio and listen for any noises as you roll along. If there is a clattering or knocking noise, there may be a bolt loose in the undercarriage. Alignment work will include inspection of items related to the issue. This could include a review of struts bearings and ball joints, bushings and sway bar links. Catching issues early on can help save you costly repairs down the road, as suspension or alignment problems can become complex if left in disrepair. Simple issues such driving through road construction zones day after day may actually lead to problems with suspension. These rough roads, where paving has been stripped, can put excessive strain on shocks and struts. Over time, even bolts near the tires may rattle loose. If you have not had your car examined lately, then even simple rumble strips on the side of the road might lead to problems with a car that needs work. Things that a mechanic may look for is leaky or cracked shocks, amount of unnecessary vehicle motion such as bouncing or swaying, and tire wear that is not even. The tire issue, in particular, can mean that shocks and struts need replacement. Excessive bounce experienced in a vehicle can affect overall control of the car, comfort during riding, and even ability to brake in a timely manner. Over time, a bounce that starts out subtle can grow worse, so it is best to get the automobile inspected for quick repairs. One quick way to occasionally test the shocks is to park the car, then go around to one side and lean on it. Step away, and if the car bounces more than once, the shocks or struts may need to be examined. Another instance when you may want to have the undercarriage and alignment examined is after an accident. When a car is damaged, you may be focused on having the physical damage repaired. Remember that when a car is hit, the vehicle's alignment also absorbs the impact. Momentum from the crash can bend metal on the underside that you may not see, which might cause suspension and alignment issues. This problem eventually can lead to hidden wear and tear or obvious issues such as knocking or rattling noises within the nuts and bolts. A mechanic trained to spot alignment issues after an accident can ensure adequate repairs. It is important not to overlook this aspect when going for repairs after an accident. You also may choose to have a used vehicle inspected if you are considering buying it. A full-vehicle inspection can be worthwhile to see whether there is any damage or issues, or even possibly whether the car has been in an accident. An inspection can alert you to any damage or previous repairs that may have been made. This type of knowledge is something you would want to know before buying the vehicle, and could become information for negotiating a purchase price. On the other hand, you may decide to walk away from the car and not buy based on inspection information. Most cars are designed to withstand the rigors of the road and provide you with many years of good performance. As the miles add up on an automobile's odometer, though, it can soon be time to have your car suspension inspected. Do not neglect this important part of auto maintenance. Regular checkups can ensure that you enjoy a smooth ride and that the parts are all in good working order. This attention to detail not only can add life to the tires, but may extend the years of service from a vehicle."

1,How To Find Reasonable Repair And Replacement Of Automotive Windshields,autos-trucks," Whether needing to repair or replace automotive windshields due to a crack, or, window which has been broken out, it is imperative that if such happened due to an accident or crime, one contact any insurance company immediately. For, while one may have to pay a rather large portion to replace a windshield, then if any other incidents were to occur throughout the policy time frame, one may not have to pay additional out of pocket expenses associated with such damage. However, even more important than contacting the insurance is locating a company one can trust to do such important work. For, unless a windshield is installed correctly, often such windows can pop out and cause extremely dangerous situations. In addition, whether the damage is due to a small crack, or, a window which has been broken out in its entirety, there may also be other work required. So, while there may be a portable windshield repair company hanging out on the local corner, most can not replace full windows and drivers may want to be careful about having such company provide any extensive work related to such repair. Of course, if there is only a minor crack or scratch which can be filled with filament used by such companies, then the cost of such repairs can be cut in half. In fact, if the window broken is attached to a mechanism, whether standard or electric to raise and lower the window, then there may also be work to reconnect such features required as part of such repair. Of course, if so, it is important that the quote to the insurance also includes the amount for such work. For, any repairs needed in associated with such insurance claims or premiums must be included, often at the initial time of filing such claim. Otherwise, there are a number of people who would attempt to acquire extra services for the amount paid to fix any new damage. However, this is not to say that some automotive garages or services may not agree to provide repair for such free of charge. Although, when and where possible most often such repair shops either require that one pay for such repairs up front, or, that such insurance claim be paid before such work begins. For, while one may have insurance does not always mean that such company is going to be good, quick or efficient about paying such money. Of course, if one can go to an approved garage which is connected to the insurance one holds, then most often such work can begin immediately. However, if there is a large deductible required, then the company may request such difference at the beginning of such work. Of course, the best way to avoid such costs is to keep windshields clear of any debris when parked outside. In addition, when driving, it is often best to avoid traveling next to any cars or trucks which may have open areas in which items could fly and hit other vehicles. For example, often gravel trucks are to blame for cracked windshields. However, if the driver would have simply sped up, passed and got around the flying debris before it hit the windshield, then such work may not be required. Although, there are also shops which allow one to pay such work out in payments. Of course, such service centers are often privately owned and only known by word of mouth in the local community. In addition, whether paying for such damage through insurance, or, out of pocket, it is important that one meet any and all agreements related to such payments, otherwise such garage may be able to repossess the vehicle until such payments are complete. Last but not least, if is often good to compare prices among different garages and service centers, especially when paying out of pocket for such repairs. For, while often portable companies can often repair automotive windshields which only require filament, there may be other repairs which such companies are not equipped to fix. As such, when doing such comparison, it is good to compare both services provided as well as the cost for completion. To this end, when needing car repairs due to a broken window or other damage, it is often best to use a garage which is either approved by, or, connected to the insurance company with which such individual holds a policy. For, in doing so, most work beyond the typical annual or semi-annual deductible often required is generally covered, leaving one to only pay the difference when and where necessary to complete such repairs."
2,How Automotive Windshields Are Repaired,autos-trucks," Broken automotive windshields are no laughing matter. The term broken can be used lightly in some situations, and not so lightly in others. A broken windshield is considered to be a windshield that has a chip, crack, or spider web appearing crack within it. Damaged automotive glass can be a serious issue. If you do not get the problem rectified immediately, it can make it impossible for you to be able to operate your vehicle. Even tiny dings that appear on this area of your vehicle can turn into larger problems down the road. When these small dings start to grow, they can block out your vision, which makes operating your vehicle a hazard in itself. Windshield replacement can help you fix a broken car windshield. Replacements are not the only solution to your problem though. Smaller flaws that have not grown to be bigger messes can be rectified with simple repairs. These repairs can help you restore the strength of your vehicles glass, and help you avoid having to have this entire portion of your vehicle replaced down the line. Understanding the way that these repair services are carried out, will give you a general idea of what you can expect, if your vehicles windshield ever becomes damaged. One of the first things that a repair service will do before fixing the problem is perform an evaluation of the damage. The repair personnel will examine the simple chip or crack. They will determine the size of the crack, and also look at the depth of it as well. Location is also a major factor that has to be considered when fixing this portion of your vehicle. A lot of smaller flaws that are made to automotive windshields can be fixed by applying a resin to the surface of the chip or crack, and allowing it to dry. Be aware, that the only time that a repair service will use a resin to fix a chip or a crack that appears along your vehicles windshield is if the bottom layer of your glass has not been damaged. Most of the modern day windshields that are placed on cars are made up of two glass layers. In between these two layers, there is a laminated rubber membrane. Resin repair services will only be able to fix damages that do not surpass the rubber membrane layer of your windshield. In the event that both layers of the part are damaged, you will need to look into having this entire portion of your vehicle replaced, as opposed to just having to patched up a little bit. Some cracks that appear along the outer perimeter of your vehicles windshield can also be difficult to correct with a simple resin layer repair. Therefore, before hiring a repair service to fix your issue, it is important that you evaluate the state of the damage first. Be aware, that most companies that offer repairs will offer full replacements of the product as well. However, there are some companies that offer repairs that do not offer replacement services. Therefore, it is up to you to determine what type of service you believe you may require. After you have personally determined that the only thing that needs to be done to your windshield is a simple repair, the repair process is fairly easy. A typical repair job will take about thirty minutes to complete. Using a special type of sunlight cured resin; the repair person will inject the epoxy onto the area that is cracked. They will use special tools during the application process, in order to ensure that the repair is going to suffice. The tools that are used are designed to fix cracks and chips that do not pass the first layer of glass on the part. After the resin is applied to the area, you will need to wait a few minutes for the substance to dry, before using your vehicle. The good thing about the resin is it dries clear. This will make it appear like there was never anything wrong with the product. The clear drying resin will match the remaining portion of your vehicles windshield. The sunlight is what is used to dry the resin, after it has been applied. Therefore, you will not have to do anything additional after having a repair service performed on this area of your vehicle. There are not a lot of people that realize how significant automotive windshields are, until they are forced to repair this portion of their vehicles. A broken windshield will make you a hazard on the road, aside from that it will ruin the beauty of your vehicle."
3,Knowing The Benefits And History Of Automotive Windshields,autos-trucks," Automotive windshields are large pieces of safety glass that are installed on different forms of vehicles. They come equipped on cars, buses, planes and even some motorcycles. The glass used is usually lamented. This means the glass was treated with two sheets of curved glass separated by a sheet of plastic before it was glued and sealed down to a window frame. Windshields were created to protect automobile occupants from environmental elements. It has been used to shelter people from both snow and rain. It also protect occupants from the wind and debris that may be in the air. It is effective in keeping out harmful ultraviolet rays since many vehicles come equipped with a special coating of UV. It is similar to the coating used on standard sunglasses with or without the tint. When the original car was created, windshields were created out of pure glass. When the glass is not lamented, it can cause a severe risk to passengers in the event of an accident. It was not until a series of incidents that glass windows were replaced with a material much stronger and safer. With a tougher glass, it would shatter into harmless little pieces in the event of an accident. This would cause far less damage to drivers and passengers. The first lamented windshield was first created in France. It used a cellulose middle layer instead of conventional plastic. The cellulose layer was very effective in holding the two layers of glass together when an accident occurred. It was not until many years later that plastic became a better alternative. The purpose was to ensure that windshields will not break when an accident occurred. Having windshields on motorcycles is becoming more popular today as people are becoming more socially aware and responsible. A typical windshield is large enough to protect both a person's face and torso from carelessly discarded cigarettes. The discarded cigarettes has been a constant problem for bike riders that have to deal with burns and ashes left behind. It can also protect against other air and wind borne elements and debris. Before, a bike rider had to look over his/her windshield because it did not provide enough clarity. That has all changed and manufactures have created better windshields with better material. Now a good windshield can redirect noise, airflow and low-pressure turbulence. This makes a motorcycle ride more enjoyable and safer since riders reduce the chance of suffering from wind fatigue. Polycarbonate windshields are currently a new and better material available for automobile owners. Makers of the innovative product have tested it to ensure customers with the best material available that is both chemical and impact resistant. It has been tested under the pressures of steel wool to guarantee the effectiveness in protection and resistance. Optical clarity is also many times better than original lamented glass shields. It is currently only approved in the motorcycle industry but people can still obtain the replacement for other forms of vehicles since it is in compliance with state requirements. Laminated polycarbonate windshields are made differently from commercial ones more readily available. The layers include a flexible polymer substrate rather than plastic. A chemical and scratch resistant coating is applied with a special adhesive in between two layers of polycarbonate sheets. Each layer is then treated to become transparent for people's safety. Another option that people have is the use of tinted windows to protect from sun glare. The law places heavy restrictions on the use of heavily tinted glass windows. There is a maximum level of tint permitted and exceeding that limit can lead to multiple consequences other than being fined. If necessary for sun glare protection, drivers should consider having the uppermost part of their window more noticeably tinted. Thermal glass has also been used in the past. This was a popular option before the invention of navigational systems. As of now, thermal glass can potential prevent many navigational systems from working because the metal embedded into the glass blocks the signal communication between a satellite and the device. People that have thermal glass can decide to buy an external antenna for their device to resolve this particular issue. Automotive windshields have come a long way in history. They have evolved and changed to adapt to the needs of people overtime. People can obtain greater benefits if they properly accommodate their vehicles to adapt to their particular needs. Custom and special applications can be done to automobiles as long as they do not violate the law or the maximum restrictions."
4,Jaguar S Type Shifter Part malfunction,autos-trucks," A very common difficulty with the 1999-2002 Jaguar S-Type cars can be breakage in the pricey shifter assembly for the automatic transmission. And to make matters worse, this shifter assembly has been on back-order from Jaguar for nearly a year or longer without ETA for new stock at the time of this listing. The aluminum shift block replaces the weak plastic piece that fails on all Jaguar shifter assemblies. No need for a used shifter assembly or new shifter assembly from dealer! Save you hundreds of dollars. Disconnect shifter assembly from vehicle, detach shift cable and install new aluminum shifter block. Reinstall to get a lifetime of trouble free shifting. No more applying the parking brake to shift in or out of gear! No costly tows to the repair shop or dealer! Shifter block malfunction is the most typical repair I see at Lansing Professional Fleet Auto Repair that fails in the Jaguar S-Types. I will be able to save you thousands of dollars, headaches and miss diagnosis of this problem. I myself believe Jaguar S Types are utter garbage and I feel sorry for everybody who has bought one and desire to influence any future individuals from ever buying one. If you happen to be among the blessed ones who've not had any of these repairs fail with your S-Type or Lincoln LS you happen to be extremely lucky. In case you didn't know these cars are sisters, meaning they are identical, they share several similar components and style flaws. The three most typical problems are as follows. Shift linkage breaks and vehicle will not go into or come out of park, front lower ball joints or front struts rattle and clunk, and rear of vehicle clunks and rattles awfully from bad lower strut bushings. Shifter failure is the most typical and costly repair relating to the Jaguar S-Type. Sadly doing it once will not guarantee it is not going to happen for a second time. many owners learn a few days or months later the shifter breaks again. Average cost of this repair is $500-1000.00 Currently Jaguar has no supplier for the failed shifter assembly also to my knowledge I purchased the last new one back in December of 2009! I've obtained second-hand ones on EBay for about 100.00 since then I've seen them under $200 every now and then. Why does this component break down you may ask? Well from the manufacture's genius design and production skills they decided that a tiny plastic block the dimensions of half your hand is resilient enough to handle the force of your complete weight of your vehicle, the shifter itself, the transmission, the shift cable and regular wear on these parts. To this day no recall continues to be issued as they do not think this is a safety concern or not enough people are injured (just your pockets) from this part failing. I discovered an aftermarket company who will now be selling an alternate design ($179-$269) that may once and for all handle shifter block breakdown. The piece that in the beginning failed was produced from firm plastic. The new design is constructed from aluminum and will never fail over again. The repair will take you close to 1-2 hrs to complete for everybody who is good seasoned mechanic. If you aren't you might have considered trying to permit another person do that one. You'll need to remove the middle console and part of the dash after which detach the shifter assembly to put in this part. We could replace the shifter block on the Jaguar S-Types in around 30 minutes because of the sizable amount of replacements we now have done.

7,How a Tyre's Wear Patterns Can Help Diagnose Other Issues with Your Car?,autos-trucks," Ever heard of forensics concentrating on car tyres? Believe it or not, this is a rare idea, yet in many events has proven to be useful in gathering great amounts of data comparable with what a corpse can provide for a law enforcement pathologist. Yes, mythical signs that can provide details as to what the cause of the tyre's untimely diminishing can be identified with the help of an expert. Such data can be extremely vital; in attesting viable errors and faults from your car tyre's wearing patterns, it can tell the driver and the mechanic about what other aspects or parts may need repairing to give replacement cheap tyres the maximum life cycle possible. Let's begin with the fundamentals. As can be anticipated, the type of wear pattern from tyres is direct and is attributed by the tread having been worn off to a certain extent that the tyres' tread wear signs are at or close to a level with the tread's surface. So, the tyre has closely accomplished its valuable lifecycle. Though this may look as if it's the end of the story, it isn't. The suspension arithmetic on several vehicles may be depicting that the treads of the tyres might not be completely balanced. Other automobile tread wear patterns may tell a different story. What must be kept in mind is that a few wear situations may require some time before they show signs of error or malfunction. For instance, what does feathering on two external corners of the tyre tread indicate? This pattern is more likely indicating that the tyre has been continuously operating at extremely low pressures. Another situation could include a strip worn around the core of the tread that may explain that the tyre has been operating under escalated pressure levels.

8,What Are Remould Tyres and How Are They Different From Other Tyres?,autos-trucks," Have you ever seen someone turn an old tyre into a tyre swing, incorporate a tyre into an obstacle course, or use one as a flower bed? Those are several ways people can recycle tyres. A remould tyre is simply one more way of recycling a tyre. The difference between a remould tyre and the tyres at a playground is that a remould tyre is still kept on the road! Tyres need to be replaced when the treads run low. Low treads on tyres decrease steering ability and the ability to stop effectively. A remould tyre is created by replacing the worn tread on the tyre with a new tread through a hot cure process. First, the remaining low tread on an old tyre is buffed from the surface. Next, the tyre is inspected for flaws. Passing tyres are then covered with an uncured rubber and placed in a mould used for new tyres. The result is a recycled tyre that can again be placed on a vehicle. There are other similar methods for restoring old tyres. Some tyres are recycled by a new tread being applied to a buffed tyre. These tyres are not referred to as a remould tyre because the new tread is simply attached on. A remould tyre is only a buffed tyre placed in an existing mould that is used to manufacture a new tyre. A remould tyre suffers a large amount of discrimination from consumers. People generally suspect the tyre treads seen along highways are from remould tyres that came apart on unsuspecting motorists. Evidence suggests, however, that many of these so-called ""road alligators"" are just as likely to come from new tyres as they are from a remould tyre. Treads are likely to become displaced from tyres through under inflation and delaying the replacement of damaged tyres. Consumers are likely to turn away from a remould tyre because for slightly more money they can put their fears of remould tyres to rest through investing in brand new tyres. Notwithstanding public perception of a remould tyre, these tyres are popular for trucking companies and industries where tyres are replaced on a consistent basis. They are also popular for those looking to save a little money when needing to replace their existing tyres. A remould tyre is subjected to similar tests of durability and quality that a new tyre is required to undergo. The result is that remoulds still offer safety, cost savings, and an additional way to help the environment. Instead of tying your old tyre to a tree branch, consider donating or selling it to a remould tyre company. Likewise, when one of your own tyres needs replacing, consider the possibility of obtaining a remould tyre for your vehicle."

12,Car Insurance For Teens,autos-trucks," Teens are a group which insurers consider to be a high risk group of drivers. This means that finding car insurance at affordable rates can be incredibly difficult. But there are ways to find car insurance for teens, and they needn’t be difficult to follow. Why Do Teens Have Problems Finding Car Insurance? Teens tend to have trouble finding car insurance because of their inexperience. This inexperience comes mainly because of their age, but it also comes about due to the fact that any teen with a driving license won’t have had it long. This naturally means that teens will have a higher risk of making a mistake and, as a result, having some sort of accident. And the reason that insurance companies raise their rates for teens is not down to any blind stereotypes because there is scientific evidence shown from countless studies that younger people do tend to have more accidents than experienced drivers. What Can Teens Do? There are a number of things teens can do. Some of these methods are practical and some are not, but the following are just some of the things which can influence the car insurance rates for teens: • The type of car driven • A driver’s academic record • Marital status • Safety features • Different insurance companies Type of Car Driven The type of car driven will have a major influence on the insurance premiums for teens. Nothing creates a big red flag for insurance firms more than a teen with less than a year’s driving experience who wants to drive a really expensive car. This is a big risk for insurers, and some insurers won’t even offer a policy at any affordable price. The best option is to choose a car which is cheap and easily repaired because if an accident does happen then the insurance firm won’t be paying out a large amount. Academic Record This is quite a strange factor which comes into play, but there are studies which show that students with better academic records are less likely to have an accident. Insurers have taken the results of these studies on board which means that those students who have a Grade Point Average (GPA) of 3.2 or more will see lower insurance premiums. Marital Status For most teenagers, this is not really a viable option. But if a teen is intending to get married then this can dramatically reduce the amount of money they will have to pay for auto insurance. Studies have shown that those teens who have kids or who have a wife will be more responsible when it comes to making decisions on the road. This translates to lower premiums for those teens. Safety Features The more safety features that are applied to the vehicle the teen is attempting to insure the lower the premiums will get. This applies to safety features which protect the car from theft and damage and the individual from any personal injuries. The following are just some of the safety features which can work to lower the premiums associated with a car insurance policy: • Anti-lock brakes • Engine immobilizer • Airbags • Car alarm • Storing the car in a garage • Automatic seat belts Different Insurance Companies Even if all of the above tips are followed, it’s still best to compare all of the different insurance companies in order to get the best deal. However, it’s not practical to call on each insurance company individually. This is where the insurance comparison site comes in. Simply open up a variety of comparison websites and follow all of the instructions given on these websites. It’s best to use a variety of websites because this will make sure that the results given are more accurate."
13,Rise And Fall Of The Dodge Magnum,autos-trucks," The Dodge Magnum name was originally launched in 1978 as an extension of the Chrysler brand in response to changing rules for the upcoming NASCAR racing season which would prevent the Dodge Charger from competing. NASCAR legend Richard Petty originally favoured the Magnum in the opening stages of the 1978 season however he found the handling difficult to control and switched to a Chevy after just 7 races. Despite this, the Magnum has found success, helping Kyle Petty (Richard's son) win his first race and he stuck with them for a further 5 races before abandoning them due to extensive and irreparable damage. As of 2008 there were only two known NASCAR Magnums in existence, both in good condition and one resides in the Talledega NASCAR museum for fans to view. From such exciting beginnings the Magnum name was passed from car to car including the original 'Dart' sold in Brazil and then as a vehicle in itself sold in Mexico between 1981-88 before being dropped as a name all together in 1989. Dodge Magnum Revival The Magnum model name was brought back in 2004 as a station wagon version of the Chrysler 300 with some subtle body changes and built in Ontario, Canada. In 2005 the SRT-8 - a performance focused model was launched and sold as the 2006 model of the vehicle. With a 6.1 L engine and over 425 break horse power it won the Canadian Car of the Year Contest in 2006 as the 'Best New Modern Muscle Car'. With a 0-60mph time of just 5.1 seconds and 0-100 mph in 11.7 seconds it's easy to see why. Dropped Again At the tail end of 2007 it was announced by Chrysler that the Magnum, along with four other models would be dropped the following year, stating they were ""…not earning their keep"", however Ralph Gilles, head of the SRT division of Chrysler indicated the name and the model may be brought back, claiming the death of the magnum was down to one person: ""It was single-handedly killed by one executive who is no longer with the company. He's retired. A lot of people in the company still like that vehicle -- a lot."" Outside of the USA, the Dodge Magnum was sold under the name 'Chrysler 300 Touring' and was essentially the same with slight design tweaks and the option of a 3.0L CRD Turbo Diesel engine. As the Dodge Magnum is at present discontinued owners have found buying replacement parts, and especially custom parts such as wheels to be difficult to obtain however there are manufacturers producing high performance parts to match the high performance of the SRT-8."

This place had previously been a rented race track that is widely availed of basically by several producers. The most important highlight of the car news item would be the fact Porsche is offering the racetrack totally free."
15,"Tire testing from ""A"" to ""C""",autos-trucks," Tire testing is a critical element that helps separate different qualities and types of tires. When we think of a quality tire we think of dependability. This dependability is crucial considering the demanding driving conditions that we face daily. The brand and price of a tire also does not solely dictate how well the tire will perform. One must take into consideration driving style, type of vehicle and the location in which the vehicle is driving. All of the above considerations are valid elements that tire testers actively consider when testing tires. All tires sold in the United States today must meet federal safety standards. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration enforces the Uniform Tire Quality Grade System, and tires must meet certain expectations set by government-mandated tests. These tests include a tread wear, traction and temperature resistance test. All of these tests are completed by the manufacturer who then reports the results to the government. When the test results are analyzed and given back from the government the manufactures then assign grades to each particular tire. These grades are input into the sidewall of each different type of tire they manufacture. When grading tread wear, the grades range from 60 to over 500. The higher the grade, the better the tread wear will be on the tire. When grading traction testers first look at the tire’s ability to stop a vehicle in a straight motion on a wet pavement test surface. When testing traction the test does not require you to test for acceleration. Traction grades range from ""AA"" to ""C"" with ""AA"" being the highest possible grade. When measuring temperature we look at the ability of the tire to maintain the ability to dissipate heat under a controlled indoor test. Temperature grades will range from ""A"" to ""C"" with ""A"" being the best grade. When analyzing speed ratings we look at indoor laboratory testing. In this lab testing, measurements of high speed tire durability are conducted under controlled test conditions. You might be asking yourself the question, why do we need a speed test; I thought people were supposed to stay under the speed limit? To this we answer, the reality is that people are not always going to obey the speed limit. With this said the tires top speed capability must at least equal the vehicles top speed capability.  Hopefully this gives you a better understanding of the importance of tire testing, and how it might play into the tires you count on every day."
16,Want a New Forklift For Sale?,autos-trucks," For small business proprietors who're looking for a new (or used) forklift for their place, and to adequately operate their business, being sure that you find the most affordable priced  is a forklifts for sale case of making the effort to shop around, and to make comparisons with the best forklift retailers in your area, in order to know you're making the appropriate selection when you're prepared to buy.

17,Keep money in your wallet with fuel efficient tires and nitrogen,autos-trucks," Most people realize that a car or truck’s tire is an essential part of the vehicle and overall driving experience. What people may not realize is that all tires are not created equal and rolling resistance plays a large part in a tire’s overall worth. Rolling resistance is the underlining factor in fuel efficiency that directly relates to your tire. In simple terms this literally means the amount of force that is needed to keep your tire rotating. If your vehicle needs more force it is going to consume more gasoline. Luckily there are fuel efficient tires that are engineered for low rolling resistance which reduces the strain on your motor which allows for improved fuel mileage. With gas prices on the rise some states have started conducting tire studies. These studies are designed to help assist consumers in finding the most fuel efficient tires at an affordable price. So why are fuel-efficient tires more efficient? These tires are made with an innovative assortment of materials that generate less heat when you drive. Also the tires have a reduced tread depth that allows for an even higher decrease in tire resistance. Next time you need tires or if your vehicles gas mileage is becoming consistently worse, consider fuel efficient tires as a cost saving alternative. In addition to fuel efficient tires nitrogen in place of the air inside your tires can improve the longevity of your tires. Nitrogen is a colorless and odorless element. As far back as 1772, Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford discovered Nitrogen as a component of air. However, while nitrogen might be plentiful throughout the universe it is a relatively uncommon element here on earth. The element can also appear as a liquid or a solid along with its most common form, gas. Nitrogen does require extra care, however. When used in large quantities in a small area it can displace oxygen causing an asphyxiation hazard. As an automotive tool it should be left to the professionals. Over the years nitrogen tire inflation has been used in many applications that demand top tire performance. Some of these applications are U.S. military, commercial aircraft, race cars and even NASA. The reason why nitrogen helps with tire wear is because nitrogen escapes from the tire 30% slower than oxygen. When a nitrogen filled tire heats up the pressure inside of the tire is less likely to flex. When the tire pressure flexes less it helps the tire stay at recommended pressure. When the tires remain at OEM recommended pressures fuel mileage is vastly improved, saving you money in the long run. So next time you get your tires changed, ask about nitrogen!"
18,HM Modeller USA - Hydrema,autos-trucks," Articulated dump trucks appear everywhere, Hydrema’s High Mobility dump trucks for 10 and 22 tons loads exhibit ultra low ground impression as they ‘float’ over the landscape with minimal strain on both soil and driver. The uniquely constructed articulation combined with 800 millimetre wide tyres and specially constructed wheel suspension makes the two-axle Hydrema 912HM with a 10 tons load capacity and the three-axle Hydrema 922HM with a 22 tons load capacity the ideal equipment for soft and hostile terrain, or where a low ground impression is required e.g. for garden grounds or renovation of golf courses. Hydrema 912HM was presented in Europe in 2009 as a further development of the very successful Hydrema 912D that is widely used on construction sites and for tasks with limited space. The Hydrema 912HM has an extremely large overhead clearance due to its large wheels as well as a sprung front axle, which together with the dynamic articulated pivot result in all four wheels always having full contact with the ground. The equipment is constructed such that front wheels and back wheels fall in the same track. This all equate to the equipment being able to make its way even under the most difficult conditions in very muddy terrain, where others have to give up. Both Hydrema HM dump truck models have newly developed, suspended front axles that are unique. The system is an electro-hydraulic spring system with independent suspension cylinders and level regulation of the two front wheels. The system is both fast and possessing a long suspension displacement enabling it to handle severe ruggedness in difficult terrain and light ruggedness during fast driving. The system also provides great stability when the equipment turns during transport. Hydrema 922HM has been on the market i Europe for several years and it has experienced great success particularly in projects with very soft ground and especially golf course projects. The key is its very low unladen weight relative to the load capacity. A number of golf course architects today demand the use of Hydrema dump trucks in the construction of new courses because the ground impression is so limited. Less impression damage means faster and better growth on newly constructed courses. Hydrema 922HM also has 800 millimetre wide tyres and the unique hydraulically stabilised articulated pivot and rear wheel suspension that provide optimum contact with the ground even in very uneven terrain. Hydrema has a particularly comfortable suspended rubber mounted cab. Wheel suspension and construction that give optimum contact with the ground also provide a much calmer drive and thus optimum driver comfort. Hydrema is dedicatedly working to limit vibration strain on the driver, and the machine fulfils the strict standards in EU for whole body vibrations. This has been achieved by utilising special simulation tools during the development phase and new hydraulic components have been developed in connection with the construction of the suspension. Both machines are equipped with very efficient hydraulic systems with variable pumps. This provides fast reaction times in all functions and always plenty of power to the vital functions. Hydrema 922 is equipped with a 6.7 litres Cummins 194kW/264 hp engine, while Hydrema 912 has a Perkins engine of 4.4 litres and 96 kW/131 hp. Both engines are very efficient on fuel consumption making the machine low in operating costs. The engines of course comply to the Tier III standard. The dump trucks’ ability to drive under even very extreme conditions has been tested in various projects, and the customers clearly report on improved operating costs on several points. The season can be extended, the cost in constructing special access roads is lowered, the efficiency is increased due to higher speed of transport over difficult terrain, and there are cost savings by avoiding damages to for example drains and watering systems on golf courses. Additionally, you have low fuel consumption and satisfied drivers, who perform a little better when they get optimum work conditions. Hydrema also delivers Hydrema 922D with 600 millimetre tyre mounting, as well as Hydrema 912DS is delivered with 600 millimetre tyre mounting, but still suspended front axle and the other advantages that Hydrema dump trucks offer. The smaller tyre mounting offers a smaller total width but does not change the load capacity."

20,Online Buying Used Cars,autos-trucks," People today have started using the Internet as a platform for buying and selling cars for new as well as used ones. Buying used cars online is the best way to buy a car because most of the times you can find various lucrative offer. There are a huge amount of websites where sellers list their cars along with photos and detailed descriptions and this is the easiest and quickest way to find the car of your dreams. There are many online websites like Used Cars San Diego who provide all the information regarding the cars.  It is considered as the easiest, comfortable and quickest way to buy used cars.  Care has to be taken while selecting the online car dealer or selling company as their credibility and reputation has to be checked thoroughly. People these days use the internet for buying second hand cars in two ways: •	First they look for the car that meets all their needs. Once they have found such a car they go to the dealer selling that car and then buy it personally. •	Although the first option is still the best way to go but most people now are buying used cars online without even seeing them in person. Once you have made contact over Used Cars San Diego with the seller and have gone to check the car over, it is essential that you get to see all documents related to the cars history. This will give you an idea of how well the car has been treated and if it has had all the checkups it should have had. If you are buying your used car from a dealer then you have the right to see the written warranty that is provided by the dealer before you buy, this is one way of making sure of what you are getting before you commit yourself. When you go to look at the car make sure that you give it a thorough inspection in good lighting and that you take it for a test drive. Where possible make sure that you test drive the car in most situations, for example up and down hills, in heavy traffic where you are stopping and starting and if possible a brief drive down the motorway. This will all tell you how the car handles and feels and pay particular attention to not only how the car handles but also how the engine sounds. One of the best tips when it comes to buying a used car is if you know nothing about cars then make sure that you take someone with you who does. If you don’t have a friend or family member then it can pay to book someone from an auto club to go with you and look over the car. While of course this will cost you in the long run it can work out cheaper if the car is nothing more than an old banger. Always remember that while you can get a good bargain when it comes to buying your used car privately you won’t have any warranty as such as you would get from a used car dealer. So usually you will buy the car ""as seen"" and this is the risk you take for saving a couple of hundred pounds or more on the car. It is not advised to ask for a monthly payment plan for buying the used car, as many dealers make up the cost and will give a very attractive plan but the buyer may end up with huge costs on purchasing the car.  The interest rates they charge, the term for repaying the amount, all kinds of fees and the overall cost can all be manipulated."

1,History of Isuzu Heavy Duty Trucks,autos-trucks," Isuzu Motors Limited is a well-known Japanese company that has made both cars and trucks in several sizes, and their heavy duty commercial truck series are very popular and widely used. They have become a very well respected and innovative company. Start of Isuzu Motors Limited Brand Though it didn't have the Isuzu name as yet, the company has its beginning in 1916 when the Tokyo Ishikawajima Shipbuilding and Engineering Company joined in with the Tokyo Gas Electric Industrial Company to make vehicles. Two years later, they were given permission to do this and to sell the new vehicles in Japan, with the cars made being designed by a UK company called the Wolseley Motor Company. Isuzu Starts Producing Trucks Isuzu branched out into their truck making venture in 1922 with their first commercial truck being the Wolseley Model A-9. In 1934 they came up with the Isuzu name in honor of the Isuzu River in the Ise Shrine area, and by 1949 they officially took the Isuzu Motors Limited name and were making headlines as the biggest heavy duty truck maker in Japan. Isuzu Trucks After World War II After the war, Isuzu began to make their trucks at an even faster pace to keep up with the new demands on the company. They produced commercial trucks designed to transport food and other products, which were used in the reconstruction of Japan after World War II. The need for these heavy duty commercial trucks helped create a boom in the manufacturing at the Isuzu plants. By 1959, Isuzu was producing several kinds of heavy duty commercial trucks and had designed a cab forward control truck dubbed as the N series. This style of truck is still popular because of the turning radius, and the fact that it is easy to drive. In 1960, the N Series trucks were also made featuring a diesel engine. This was the first time this was done in the manufacture of this type of truck in Japan. Isuzu Over the Next Decades Isuzu manufacturers continued their innovation over the next few decades, coming out with the medium weight series F trucks in 1970, a flat low series truck four years later, a wide cab in 1980 and they came out with trucks with front end suspension in their trucks in 1990. In 1995 Isuzu introduced the C&E series of heavy duty trucks and in 1997 the company showed how innovative it was by producing Japan's very first four bag air suspension in their trucks with the GIGAMAX series. In 1998 developed a bedless style of truck called the Forward V and in 1999 they debuted the Forward MAX, and in 2002, their more efficient Smoother F transmission was placed in some of their truck models. Isuzu Works With the U.S. The U.S. first worked with the Isuzu Motors Limited in 1971 when General Motors made a deal with them to make Isuzu vehicle for the very first time. This began the Isuzu venture to work with other U.S. companies in the next 30 years as they made similar deals with Chevrolet and Dodge. In fact, by 1999 General Motors had become the majority stakeholder in Isuzu at 49 percent, but sadly this occurred around the time of a major recession and Isuzu ended up shutting down these operations in the U.S. and instead focused mainly on making commercial trucks and diesel engines. Modern Isuzu Trucks Era These days, Isuzu still has some of its N and F series of commercial trucks driving around the world. Plus, they are still making commercial trucks designed for towing, hauling building supplies, working in pest control, and landscaping. It is estimated that nearly 90 percent of the Isuzu trucks that have been sold in the U.S. are still running due to their high quality and workmanship. In 2005, Isuzu was known at the biggest truck manufacturer in the world for heavy and medium duty trucks by 2009 they have made more than 21 million diesel engines, which are currently being used by the companies Renault, Opel and General Motors. Today, Isuzu has its headquarters in Tokyo and is still turning out quality trucks with a multitude of uses."
2,A Driven market is Heating up within Car Sales Australia,autos-trucks," The online car sales market in Australia has been dominated by CarSales.com.au ever since it was first created in 1996, an impressive fifteen years, however new players are pushing hard to fight for a share of the market. Any effort to compete may be in vain as one of the biggest challenges for other used car sales related websites is to appear in search engine result pages (SERP) for the search terms ""car sales"" and ""used cars"". There is a distinct advantage to the domain name CarSales.com.au as it naturally dominates search engine results for the search query ""car sales"", yet there is some variation in SERP position for the next most popular search query ""used cars"". The TradingPost.com.au has recently made a significant effort to compete with the search term ""used cars"" with obvious SEO optimization techniques as their website has suddenly become visible on the first page of search queries in recent months. It has also been sharing penultimate number 1 position for the Australian version of Google (www.google.com.au) recently which is a surprise to the long term dominance of CarSales.com.au. Another competitor in the space is CarsGuide.com.au, which is part of News Limited. They have recently taken a different approach to compete with CarSales.com.au by swamping traditional media such as radio and billboards with messages similar to marketing themselves as ""the smart choice for selling your car online"". A commentators in the industry suggested that CarsGuide are attempting to establish themselves as the ""Number 2"" in the industry and have accepted the premise that beating CarSales off their top podium position is an impossibility. Perhaps such an assumption narrow minded since CarsGuide is a News Limited entity which has tremendous resources at its disposal. After all, News Limited is one of Australia's largest media conglomerate companies, employing more than 8,000 staff nationwide and approximately 3,000 journalists. The publicly listed company's interests span newspaper and magazine publishing, Internet, Pay TV, National Rugby League, market research, DVD and film distribution, and film and television production trading assets. Nonetheless, CarSales announced in their end of Financial Year 2011 Report that Profit was up 35% from the previous financial year to $58.3m after tax. Who would have thought that a website dedicated to facilitating the selling of vehicles in Australia would be so profitable? Being a public listed company offers transparency to competitors and may inevitably drive those competitors to the belief that competing is worthwhile. Meanwhile, there are a number of other sizeable corporations competing as well, including eBay with their ""Motors"" section in combination with the eBay owned company Gumtree.com.au. A striking difference between CarSales and its competitors is that CarSales is the most expensive option to list your car for sale in Australia. A direct approach taken by CarsGuide is to simply offer listings for ""half the price"" at $30 versus $60, however is listing on CarsGuide at least half the value? If we take a look at the ""Private Cars for Sale"" on CarsGuide, the number of cars listed as at 9th April 2012 is not even close to half with just 12,112 versus 72,819 on CarSales. On these metrics alone it would appear that 16% of the cost compared to CarSales comes to less than $10, so it really does not appear to be good value for money. Of course, the true value for money comes from the number of potential buyers, however these types of metrics are not publicly disclosed. In contrast, what if we were to analyze the FREE market of online car sales in Australia? Is it possible that there is some value there instead? Thankfully for many faithful users of Gumtree it continues to be a free option available despite its ownership by eBay and it boasts 63,246 cars for sale at the same date. While these numbers appear to be similar to CarSales, the downside however is that Gumtree seems to have significant regional popularity and lacks market penetration in the capital cities throughout Australia. For example, there are only 4,443 cars listed in Brisbane versus 16,341, so the largest population market is still clearly dominated by CarSales. A surprise competitor in the free Car Sales market however is Boost Classifieds, which boasts 8,615 Private Used Cars listed in Brisbane, which is obviously significant value for money since it is absolutely free. With such fantastic free options available we're led to question why people continue to pay to sell their cars online? The simple reasoning is the lack of marketing, while CarsGuide, TradingPost and CarSales can afford to help convince the public that paying to sell their car on their sites is good value for money, the truth is that even selling one of your greatest assets online can be achieved without cost."
3,MV-1 Mobility Vans,autos-trucks," The AM General auto assembly plant in Mishawaka, Indiana is where they used to build Hummer H2s. Now, its workers are making something a little less ... controversial. It's a van called the MV-1, MV standing for ""Mobility Vehicle,"" and it's designed specifically for wheelchair-using passengers. Its designers claim that it is better suited to the handicapped than converted conventional vans, and the first factory-built model rolled off the assembly line yesterday. A product of Miami's Vehicle Production Group, the MV-1 has a large 56 x 36-inch (142 x 91 cm) side door, and a 1,200 pound (544 kg)-capacity deployable ramp that stows under the floor when not in use. It can accommodate two wheelchair-using passengers, or one wheelchair and five additional traditionally-seated occupants, if the optional jump seat is used. Floor tracks are used to secure wheelchairs and scooters. The non-handicapped driver sits behind the wheel in a regular-style seat - perhaps future versions could allow wheelchair users to also drive, using something like RUVID's hand control device? The vehicle is based around a body-on-frame configuration, and is powered by a Ford 4.6L 2V EFI V8 engine with an electronic four-speed automatic transmission. For the energy and/or environmentally-conscious, however, a factory-installed Compressed Natural Gas fuel system is also available. Mobility vans with the CNG system should have a driving range of approximately 290 miles (466.7 km). The MV-1 proves you can be more mobile and more environmentally friendly. It is the only vehicle in its class with an available OEM engineered and assembled Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) fueling system option. Because it's factory-installed, the MV-1 wheelchair vans with CNG option gives you the same durability, reliability and quality that everyone demands from gasoline-powered vehicles. And, since natural gas is primarily a domestic resource, the CNG MV-1, with an estimated 290-mile range, is good for the environment and good for America. Now everyone can breathe easier. CNG features: •	Unique CNG fueling system option designed and factory-installed, not an aftermarket conversion. •	Estimated 290-mile CNG range (which includes a 40-mile low level indicator). •	Three Type-3 CNG tanks integrated seamlessly into the vehicle design and factory-installed. •	Best-in-class luggage capacity (29.1 cubic feet). •	21.1 Gasoline Gallon Equivalent (GGE). For your protection, safety features are integrated throughout the MV-1. Starting with the anti-slip surface which covers the ramp and interior floor to give wheelchairs and scooters increased grip. While on the road, the MV-1 has Electronic Stability Control (ESC) to keep your ride steady. With passive and active safety features, it offers unprecedented peace of mind for mobility vehicle passengers and drivers. The MV-1 meets all applicable U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) and Canada Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (CMVSS). MV- 1 wheelchair vans Warranty refers to: •	Bumper to Bumper - 3 years / 36,000 miles •	Powertrain - 5 years / 75,000 miles •	Ramp - 5 years / 75,000 miles •	Corrosion Protection - 5 years / 100,000 miles.

6,Car Insurance: A Guide to Coverage,autos-trucks," Car insurance protects you in the event of an accident or damage to your vehicle, but many people don’t know how much coverage is necessary. Here’s some information to help you select the right types and right amount of auto insurance to properly protect you when driving. Sufficient insurance coverage is essential and is required by law in most states. You may opt for the minimum insurance coverage required by law, but that may not fully protect you if you're at fault in an accident. For your protection, it's better to carry more than the minimum insurance coverage. Most car insurance companies offer a variety of coverage options to protect you and your passengers, your vehicle and other drivers, including: • Liability • Collision • Comprehensive • Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist • Medical • Personal Injury Protection (PIP) • Umbrella (optional) Liability Insurance Liability insurance pays for injuries and property damage caused by a crash if it’s determined you were at fault, and is required in every state except New Hampshire. Liability insurance does not cover injuries to vehicle occupants, or damage to your vehicle. Your policy should provide coverage for no less than $100,000 per person, $300,000 per accident and $50,000 for property damage, or no less than $300,000 if your policy has a single limit. You will be liable for claims exceeding your coverage, so consider buying additional coverage if you’re able. Collision Insurance Collision insurance pays for damage to your vehicle in an accident. If your car is totaled, you'll receive what the insurer considers to be the pre-crash market value of your car, minus your deductible. Comprehensive Insurance Comprehensive covers theft of your vehicle and non-collision damage to your car, as well as animal collisions. You may be eligible for car insurance discounts if your vehicle has anti-theft or tracking devices. Liability, collision and comprehensive insurance are what finance companies require when purchasing or leasing a vehicle. There are other types of insurance you may wish to include with your auto insurance coverage, including: Uninsured motorist or underinsured motorist protection is required by many states, and covers injuries to the occupants of your car if the other driver has insufficient or no insurance. In the event of a qualifying accident, the insurer pays the difference between what the uninsured driver can pay and what the injured driver would be entitled to. Medical protection provides coverage for you and your passengers, regardless of fault. Personal Injury Protection (PIP) insurance provides additional protection including rental-car coverage and roadside assistance. With Umbrella coverage, ""umbrella"" refers to how the policy shields the insured's assets more broadly than primary coverage, and provides extra protection beyond your car insurance limits, in case of something unexpected."
7,Car Maintenance Tips to Take You from Winter to Spring,autos-trucks," Car Maintenance Tips to Take You from Winter to Spring Wisconsin winters are tough.  Whilst most people take the time to prepare their vehicle for the harsh winter months ahead, few consider the importance of making preparations for spring.  The moment the temperature gauge starts to creep up, you should think about booking a visit with your local car repair shop to give your trusty vehicle a little TLC. Following a regular car maintenance schedule through the seasons will ensure your vehicle is ready to face the conditions ahead whether you’ll be negotiating icy roads or driving in humid or arid conditions. Car repair shops offer a comprehensive range of seasonal checks that will prepare your car, truck or any other vehicle you drive for the months of driving ahead.  Truck maintenance is especially vital as these vehicles must be fit for purpose and transport their load safely. Car Maintenance Schedule for the Spring and Summer Springtime is a time of reawakening and renewal following the cold winter months.  Attending to the maintenance guidelines below will ensure your vehicle emerges from the winter in roadworthy condition.  A well maintained vehicle will give you years more reliable service and be less prone to major faults. •Swap out tires – If you’ve been using winter tires, it’s time to swap these out for all-season tires.  Check each tire is inflated and balanced and also ensure you have a well-maintained spare tire available.  Any car repair shop should be able to help you with checking your tire pressure and ensuring your tire tread is sufficient and most importantly, legal. •Check your brakes – Icy roads mean heavy braking and that can put your brake pads under a lot of pressure.  If you’ve noticed brake squeal or any grinding noises when hitting the brakes, you need to get them checked as soon as possible. •Top up your fluids – A well-lubricated vehicle is a happy vehicle.  So many engine parts rely on liquids to keep them cool, oiled and working at optimum levels.  Again, booking a seasonal check at your local car repair shop will identify any problems with fluid levels.  Engine oil, coolant, transmission fluid, and windscreen washer fluid are all essential to the performance of your vehicle and levels need to be checked and topped up at regular intervals.  Over the winter, freezing temperatures can cause these fluids to become dull and ineffective so a complete drain out and top up with fresh fluids is recommended. •Automatic transmission – vehicles with automatic transmissions need special consideration when refreshing fluids.  Overheating is a real problem with these vehicles and it’s therefore important to keep vehicle fluids at the right level. •Air-conditioning and ventilation – You probably haven’t had your air-conditioning on during the winter months so it’s a good idea to have a complete service of the system to ensure it works perfectly on those hot days. •General component checks – lights, seatbelts, dashboard warning lights, wiper blades, spark plugs and hoses should be checked for general wear and tear and replaced or repaired if faults are found. Keeping your vehicle in top condition throughout the year is important.  By booking your vehicle into one of the leading car repair shops in Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, you can ensure your car maintenance schedule is taken care of.  You can sign up to our car repair shop mailing list today to receive the latest discounts and coupons."
8,What Do You Know About Car Restoration,autos-trucks," Restoring any type of car can take many months, if not years. It all depends on what state the car is in when you first buy it (or rescue it, as some would say). You also have to find the relevant parts and fix each part in turn so you can be sure to get it back into full working order. This may be more difficult in some cases than others. If you have always set your heart on having a particularly rare car from the Fifties, you will probably find the parts are harder to get than if you chose a more popular model from the Seventies. So it is usually worth doing a spot of research to see how practical a particular car restoration job will be before you buy the car itself. Also checking out if when restored you can purchase a car warranty and checking what could void the warranty. Another point to consider is how skilled you are at working on cars. Many people are capable of doing a simple oil change and performing many other regular tasks. But these tasks are generally performed on a modern car – and they’re nothing like the tasks you would be doing if you were restoring an old or vintage vehicle of some kind. So it makes sense to ensure you know what you’re getting yourself into before you get started. You should also be aware that car restoration can be anything from an involved job to a ‘starting from scratch’ kind of job. It’s one thing to find a car from two or three decades ago that needs a fair bit of work doing to it. It’s quite another to find an old rusting wreck with no wheels in the middle of a field that could hark back half a century or so. How far would you go to get the car of your dreams and would you be capable of restoring it to the degree you want? The good news is that there are services out there that can help with various car restoration jobs as well. This means that if you feel able to tackle some jobs but not others, there is help at hand to see you through to the finished car. It’s realistic to allow plenty of time to work on a car restoration job. Many people focus on it as a hobby, so they are able to enjoy it in their spare time and watch as the car gradually starts to edge closer to what it would originally have looked like. And who knows, this could soon be your hobby too. I would purchase a car warranty when my car is finished that way i can protect my new/old car."
9,Could You Pimp Your Ride,autos-trucks," There are lots of famous pimped cars to use as inspiration if you are struggling to find ideas to transform your own vehicle. For example Jordan is well known for her pink cars, so if you want to change the colour of your own vehicle it’s not impossible to do. Paris Hilton also has a pink car – and her Bentley pink on the inside as well as the outside, in case you were wondering! Of course you can pimp out your car in lots of ways, and not just by changing the colour. Jack Osbourne of the famous Osbourne family has a selection of zombies painted onto the bonnet of his car. And if you want to see the difference you can make to the interior of a van when money is no object, look inside P Diddy’s Chevy Express. This boasts a wine cooler and a plasma screen, among other things. No doubt it is a home from home. Before you even think about changing the style and look of your vehicle remember to check your car warranty so it doesn't get voided. Then you have peace of mind and you can start pimping your car. But you don’t need thousands of pounds to pimp your own ride. You can make simple changes to the exterior simply by using decals to brighten up the look. These are available very cheaply and are easy to fit too. Another cheap way to change things is to look for steering wheel covers. These are available in all kinds of finishes and colours; just be sure it still feels comfortable and it is still easy to use while driving. You could also change your wheel trims if you have a little more money to spend. Make sure it is in keeping with the rest of the car though; if you have an old car it will look odd with brand new alloy wheels! Of course there are plenty of ideas for pimping your car, from adding new seat covers to installing bucket seats and doing everything in between. But remember that you don’t have to stick to ideas that have already been used by other people. You can find your own ways to pimp your car that will be unique to you – after all that’s what you’re trying to achieve, something unique that will catch the eye of others. In a sense making changes to your car, while not voiding your car warranty is the ideal way to ensure you can make it stand out from the rest. What will you do to yours?"
10,What is New with Lexus Green Cars?,autos-trucks," Over the last several years, especially the last decade, more consumers have found interest in hybrid vehicles. These Green Cars offer drivers many benefits that they simply cannot find with combustion-engine vehicles. One of these newer green cars that is becoming very popular with consumers is the Lexus CT-200h. When it comes to hybrid cars, there are several types on the market today. Regardless of the specific type, all hybrids have something in common and that is that they all have two sources of power. This includes the Lexus CT-200h. As a general note, the power combination that is found in these green cars is a combination of petrol or diesel engine along with an electric motor. Hybrids can be grouped into three different types: micro, mild and Full Hybrid. The Lexus CT-200h falls under the Full Hybrid class of vehicles. Many of those interested in green cars, and full hybrids in particular, become confused when certain myths pop up now and then. One myth is that full hybrids have to be plugged into mains in order to recharge. It is true that there are some green cars that do require plugs, but the Lexus CT-200h is not one of them. This vehicle can automatically recharge its batteries as it goes through regenerative braking. It can also recharge as it generates electricity when cruising at higher speeds. There is also a myth going about that emissions are not really reduced by green cars. This is not true. The truth is when a full hybrid vehicle is running on its electric motor it produces nearly zero emissions. When the electric motor is working in combination with the combustion it still produces far less emissions that virtually any other type of vehicle. This brings up another issue that is often not fully understood when it comes to full hybrid green cars. That issue concerns how the power sources mesh together. This confusion may arise because it is true that different types of green cars utilize their power sources in different ways. For Lexus full hybrids, the vehicles combine both petrol and electric. These vehicles can be operated under the electric engine alone, or they can be operated under the combustion engine alone, but are most often operated under a combination of both power sources. Because of the superior technology that is employed in the Lexus hybrids, drivers do not experience what has been called range anxiety which is common for those who drive electric vehicles. But while the Lexus CT-200h has all the power and range that drivers demand today, it also has an exterior and interior that drivers love. When drivers buy a new vehicle, regardless of its power source, they want a vehicle that is stylish and sleek. The entire line of Lexus hybrids offers exceptional styling as well as all of the options that drivers want. To learn more about the Lexus CT-200h or green cars in general, visit the site. Visitors can find in-depth information on hybrid vehicles and how green cars can help the environment, save owners money on petrol costs, and fill any style requirement."
11,Why Are Sack Trucks Important?,autos-trucks," In business and other commercial situations, carrying materials to and fro is a very common situation. While people can manage to carry these things without any help from a machine or an instrument, it poses a risk to both the individual doing the task as well as the paraphernalia he is carrying.

Sack trucks are usually made of different materials such as tube steel, aluminum tube, high impact plastics, and aluminum extrusion.

Why Bother Going Out at All? There are many people who find shopping online very convenient because they can search anything they like, research the details and most of the time have everything shipped right to their doorstep, there seems to be no reason to physically go out at all.

13,Common Problems with Used Heavy Trucks,autos-trucks," Heavy duty trucks are very expensive and are certainly a big investment for many people, especially when they absolutely need it for their jobs. While purchasing brand new trucks may seem like the best option in terms of reliability and efficiency, they can quickly skyrocket over a conservative budget that most people are willing to spend, which leaves the options of used heavy trucks. There are many safe and reliable used heavy trucks available on the market but it’s important to know the common problems that these types of trucks have, so that you can avoid purchasing a model that will require constant repairs. Rust As is the case with many used cars, used heavy trucks also face the problem of rust. While some truck bodies will not show obvious signs of rust, it’s very important to do a thorough check to make sure the integrity of the vehicle body is perfectly intact. If there are problematic areas that have succumbed to rust buildup, it’s recommended to continue your search for a good used truck. The biggest problem with rust is the fact that the truck becomes weak in particular parts and the rust will simply continue to spread until the truck is no longer useable. This is especially dangerous with large areas of rust since it may cause parts of the vehicle to fall off, making it extremely dangerous while out on the road. Leaks The most common places for used heavy trucks to have leaks are the engine and the radiator, both of which should always be in perfect working order. Oil leaks from the engine pose several different threats, which is why many professional strongly stress the fact that vehicles leaking oil should never be used for extended periods of time, they should in fact be repaired immediately upon discovery. There are several problems that occur with oil leaks, not only is it bad for the environment, it can damage other parts of the truck over time (especially rubber hoses), not to mention the fact that it can also catch on fire, especially if it’s dripping on the exhaust system. Transmission Whether it’s a manual or automatic transmission, it’s one of the major components of used heavy trucks that cause problems after a certain amount of use or simply from poor maintenance over time. Replacing the transmission on a used heavy truck, any vehicle for that matter can become quite costly, making a used truck purchase more of a loss than an investment. Prior to purchasing a used heavy truck, make sure to get a complete truck inspection report or else you may have to face the unfortunate decision of scrapping the truck for another or spending a lot of money on a replacement.A bad transmission not only affects your budget but it also affects the safety of the truck, making it a hazard for you and anyone else that may be around the vehicle at the time of transmission failure. For some older truck models, it’s common for transmissions to simply stop working, leaving you in a state where you must immediately find a safe area to stop in, which also sets you back for the job you may be on at the time. By keeping a sharp eye out for these common problematic areas on used heavy trucks, you will be able to find a good model for a great price and not have to worry about your safety or of any hassles that may pop up from poorly inspected trucks."
14,Term Life Insurance,autos-trucks," What is a Universal Life Insurance? Universal life insurance was introduced in the years 1981-1982 as a permanent life insurance which rests on cash value. It has the features of both a term and whole life insurance which allows policy holders to choose varying payment methods and coverage every year while adjusting its interest on a monthly basis. Basic Characteristics of a Universal Life Insurance Account Value: This is the accumulated gross value of all the investments contributed to the policy which include the income after deducting all the current monthly expenses. Cash Surrender Value: This is the current account value of the policy with all the surrender charges and outstanding loans already deducted. This is based on a multiple of the policy’s required minimum premium back end charges which are normally larger than front-end charges. Premiums: This is the amount required by the insurance company that the policy holder pay which is equivalent to the cost of the insurance charges as well as other expenses related with the policy. Death Benefit Options: There are four classifications for death benefit options under universal life insurance policies and these are as follow: a. Level death benefit: This only covers the amount accumulated during the length of the policy. b. Level death benefit, indexed: This option features yearly increase in the amount of death benefit as predetermined by percentage rule. c. Level death benefit with account value: The amount given is equivalent to the initial face value amount plus its gross account value. This is by far the most popular because the gross account value is never taxed. d. Level death benefit with cumulative gross premiums: The amount received is increased as the amount of the gross deposit added to the policy increases. Advantages of Universal Life Insurance Universal Life Insurance has several advantages one of which is its flexibility. It can easily be adjusted to fit your changing needs. You are given the freedom to change the timing and even the amount of your premium payments as the need arises. You are also given the luxury to vary the amount of death benefit which you wish to leave behind according to your set of preferences. Aside from this, universal life insurance is also considered cheaper compared to other types of insurance. The cash value of your policy remains intact as long as your payment sufficiently covers the monthly insurance charges. Moreover, it keeps your investments safe and intact because it does not venture into using your investments in the stock market which other types of insurance policies do. It is very transparent so you can conveniently monitor the movement of your policy’s account value. Benefits of Universal Life Insurance Universal life insurance can be used in several ways. It will not only cover future funeral, medical and burial expenses but it can also be used as an income replacement for the surviving children and spouses. It can also be considered as an additional tax shelter for those who have maxed out in their IRA. Most importantly, it is one of the best options to secure any economic loss which the family of the decedent may experience after the policy holder’s demise."
15,Why Use Infrared Tube Heaters to Heat Your Shop or Barn?,autos-trucks," A common problem with heating most shops, barns or similar buildings is that many are poorly insulated and/or have a very high air turnover ratio due to high ceilings, large overhead doors and generally drafty conditions.  The solution? – gas infrared tube heaters. Why infrared?  What is infrared? Infrared is just another term for radiant. Think of a stove, fireplace, oven or even our own sun. These sources all emit infrared (radiant) heat energy at the speed of light in a straight line. Upon striking objects (floors, people, machinery, animals, etc.) that energy converts to heat and warms the surrounding air. Think of the sun. The sun does not heat the air, the sun heats the earth’s surface and earth’s surface heats the air. In a shop, barn or other wide-open interior space, infrared heaters are designed to produce safe, comfortable radiant heat to floors and objects in order to heat the surrounding air. Generally, infrared heaters are directed downward from the ceiling toward a target area below. For instance, in a horse barn infrared heaters can be directed toward a wash and grooming area or down a common walkway, between horse stalls or even in riding arenas.  In an auto repair shop, heaters can be located over or near workbenches or between overhead doors. What kind of infrared heaters are best suited for shop and barn environments? We recommend gas infrared tube heaters.  You’ll find a lot of information on the internet to help you learn what infrared can do for you.  To find the best brands, type into your browser ""best tube heaters"" or ""superior tube heaters"".  This should take you to a number of manufacturers’ sites where you can read about the products they offer and learn why gas infrared tube heaters are usually the best for heating farm buildings, shops, manufacturing facilities, aircraft hangars and other large open structures. Why infrared tube heaters? A few good reasons: Infrared tube heaters emit soft, comfortable radiant heat energy without moving any air with no drafts. No blowing air can help prevent respiratory illnesses in both humans and animals. General creature comfort is improved. Infrared heats the ground. Warm floors means warm bodies and feet. Infrared, like light, can be directed at a target. For barns, this can mean the horse wash area, dry off areas, stalls, aisle ways, or wherever the need for heat is greatest.  For shops, this can mean work areas and assembly lines. Energy savings and efficiency. Infrared heaters can be strategically mounted to throw radiant energy where it is needed, rather than to empty spaces. This tactical approach to heating space can save a boatload of money in operational costs versus forced-air heating methods. Infrared tube heaters are completely self contained. By drawing outside air into the burner at one end and venting products of combustion out the opposite end to the outside, the flame inside the heater is completely isolated from dusty and contaminated indoor air. This prolongs life of the heater. Infrared feels natural. Just like standing in the sunshine, the soft heat energy creates a healthier and happier environment for people and animals. What exactly is a tube heater? A tube heater consists of a burner box, which includes control components much a gas valve, circuit board, safety switch, etc.) Extending horizontally from the burner is a long 4"" diameter 16 gauge steel tube, anywhere from 10 to 70 feet in length. Positioned above is an aluminum parabolic reflector running over the length of the tube. When the burner comes on, a long flame shoots down the tube until it gets hot. The reflector ensures that heat energy that bounces out from the top portions of the tubing gets reflected downward to the floor area. The goal is to get all of that energy focussed downward. A simple web search of infrared tube heaters will give you a good overview of the different tube heater brands and what they offer. Hint: not all brands are the same. For instance, one manufacturer has a 99.9% efficient reflector configuration – the best in the industry. Others range anywhere from 65% efficient (effective) to 95%. A superior reflector design can mean better heating efficiency and lower operating costs. If you’re searching for a tube heating system, do a thorough online search first. Not all are alike.  Some are simply better than others. As stated above, Google ""superior tube heaters"" or ""best tube heaters"". Look for the best warranty, best construction quality, best reflective efficiency, and best serviceability among all brands. Then, buy only from a company with a solid reputation in the infrared industry, a company capable of giving you the type of support that will merit your business. You should get a good price, of course, but make sure that whoever you buy from will be on hand to fulfill, guarantee and offer support to you down the road.  We don’t recommend buying from large catalogue houses that sell thousands of unrelated items.  They tend to be ""order takers"" only and you’ll find it nearly impossible to get design/application assistance or future service."
16,Insurance software solutions – Smarter ways of selling insurance,autos-trucks," An insurance company performs a lot of insurance related functions such as enrollment management, underwriting, claims management, policy administration, and accounting etc., for its customers. To enhance customer service and improve service delivery models, most insurance companies are now turning to automated insurance management software solutions. Automated insurance software solutions make it feasible for customers to carry out their business critical insurance activities in a secure, cost-effective and reliable manner. Most insurance software come with the added facility of customization – insurance companies can get their software customized as per their business requirements. Application theme, colors, functionalities etc. can be changed as per an insurer’s preference. There has been a significant shift in the U.S. health insurance sector since the consumer-centric Affordable Care Act was signed into a law.

18,Compare Breakdown Cover Before Cancelling Your Policy,autos-trucks," As the effects of the global financial crisis continue to impact our daily lives, many households are seeking ways to save money each month. While energy and water bills must be paid and food and fuel must be bought, it is services that do not have an immediate return that are being cut back on first. This means that many people are neglecting to renew things like their breakdown cover in order to have a little more money available. compare breakdown cover policies before you do anything. Some companies offer cover for as little as £13 per month. Without any form of cover, if you do suffer a mechanical failure, an electrical issue or a flat tyre that you cannot fix yourself, the cost of having your vehicle recovered and repaired come easily run into multiple hundreds of pounds, negating any saving you were making by not being covered in the first place. Having some form of breakdown cover in place means that if you do breakdown when you are on a journey, all you need to do is make a phone call to the company that covers you and you have the peace of mind that an operative is on the way to help, meaning you should be on your way again in no time. If your vehicle cannot be fixed, most policies will enable you to have it transported to a local garage, your intended destination or back home for no additional cost. Without cover, you will have to arrange all that by yourself, from the side of the road. Breakdown insurance comparison sites feature useful guides and customer reviews, as well as enabling you to compare cover prices. If you are on a tight budget, you may be surprised at how cheap some packages are. If you use your car or motorcycle to make your living, a comprehensive cover policy should be a high priority, as the longer your transport is out of action, the less money you can earn. If you have young children, a policy should also be top of your list. If you breakdown with a baby or toddler in your car, breakdown recovery teams will make getting to your vehicle their number one job and endeavour to be with you as soon as feasibly possible. If you are lucky, you will not need to call out a recovery vehicle or any roadside assistance at all but do you really want to risk embarking on a long journey without knowing that should the worst happen, help is only a phone call away? With even the most basic cover, you will be able to drive any distance with the peace of mind that if you car's engine does cut out or your electrics fail, you won't be left calling around local firms looking for recovery yourself. Is that saving really worth it?"
19,How Car Insurance Might Save You From A Economic Ruin After a Crash,autos-trucks," Your car insurance policy is supposed to help prevent any financial disaster due to a car accident. Whenever you run into a road incident and cars or home is damaged, your vehicle insurance plan will help you cover another party for that loss. But there has to be tangible evidence that you're the main cause of the accident. Using a automobile insurance policy, it's in fact possible to make up for deaths and injuries. Many different types of accident exists. What this means is the service expense may range between one extreme to another. Repairing tiny damages can cause the vehicle owner anything from a few hundred dollars to a couple thousand dollars. You really should examine the estimated costs ahead of auto repairs. A few damages may need a lot more spare parts to restore. Others require quite a few surfaces to spray paint on. As a result use your personal objective viewpoint when talking to your car technician. In case your car insurance fees are merely a tiny proportion of the service cost, it may be advantageous to claim from the insurance company. On the other hand if the claims is just a fraction of your monthly premiums, it definitely is not good to file for claims. It's because it doesn't sound right to pay for even more monthly premiums for the next 36 months as a result of a really small claim made within the policy period. This is certainly true, even if you think it is strange. You need to file a coverage claim only when the car accident repair cost is substantial. It is in accordance with how much money you may be paying for the car insurance fees. So it will be all worth it, there is a guide you may use. If your car accident repair costs one and a half times in excess of your insurance premium, it could be great to make claims. Definitely, if you feel any type of financial stress as a consequence of a substantial accident statement, make the car insurance claims straight away. Any sort of accident that concerns actual injury has the potential to become seriously unpleasant. There is always serious pain involved, individuals become affected and need immediate medical assistance. You may become broke instantly if you should pay the price of  hospital expenses. For this reason auto insurance is very necessary, even when you do not use your automobile frequently. Accidents can happen. Accidents are occasions which no individual desires. Yet they still occur. Whilst the most severe can happen, you're still protected by your car insurance policy. This is because every cost can be reimbursed, aside from the excess. In conclusion, prior to your choosing an automobile insurance policy, you should always be investing in a comprehensive coverage. This is because a third party or third party fire and theft insurance only covers the damage you cause to other folks. Your own car remains unprotected from harm. Hence if your automobile is entirely damaged, you've still got to pay lots of money repairing it or to purchase a new one."
20,Tips For Buying A Used Car,autos-trucks," If you're in the market for a used car it's a good idea to arm yourself with some buyer's guide tools before you set out into the somewhat murky world of second hand car buying. Below are some tips and ideas which should help you get it right. Buying a used car can be risky yet so many of us do this regularly as many people either can't afford to buy a new car or find new cars a bit of a waste of money as they depreciate the moment they leave the forecourt. But if you arm yourself with some great advice and make sure you know what you want and look for, buying a used car can be a breeze and possible also bag you a bargain. Used cars can be bought privately, through small and large car dealers or through approved schemes run by the dealerships themselves. If you go to a dealership they tend to mainly have the makes they also sell new while if you go to a used car dealer they usually have a wide variety of makes and models on offer although some dealers specialises in one type of car. Private sellers only tend to have one car to sell and if you're buying privately you probably found the car through and ad. When buying a car make sure you have budgeted well and can afford to own the car you're buying. In addition to the price you pay you also have to insure, tax, MOT and service the car, as well as fuel it. Make sure you've budgeted for all this. Then make sure to do your homework in regards to what car you need and how much the car you want usually costs. Once at the dealer or seller check out the service history and the V5 vehicle document. Make sure all documents are in order and that the car has been serviced on a regular basis. Then take the car for a test drive and check that everything works, including electrical components, lights and breaks. Also take a good look at the car and look for mismatched panels and colour variations as this can mean that the car has been in an accident. If you're happy with what you see, the paper work and the test drive, haggle on price. Many sellers will have allowed for a bit of bargaining when they set the price. But remember your budget and don't feel pressured into buying something you feel isn't right. Whether you're looking for used cars in Malvern or other areas always make sure the car you're buying feels right for you. If not, walk away as there will always be something similar available somewhere else."

1,"Volkswagen Scirocco, More Than A Sporty Golf",autos-trucks," A coupe car is the car for people who want a sporty car but don't want to go down the route of a full fledge sports car or two-seater racer but instead wants a car which is built around a normal family car. Below is one examples of a Coupe which is both practical and nippy. The Volkswagen Scirocco is based on the Golf but is both sleeker and sportier and offers drivers grippy handling and precise steering and great fun for the appreciative driver. Its competitors are the Audi TT and the BMW 6 series and compared to these two cars, the Volkswagen Scirocco is a steal with a starting price of around 20,000 depending on what deal you're able to make with your dealership. And as it is a Volkswagen, a make known for making solid and long lasting cars, this car will also hold its value well making it a safe investment. The Scirocco 1.4 TSI can deliver 42.8 mpg on mixed driving but if you use the car to its full potential, this figure will take a hammering. The Bluemotion version however will give you an excellent 60 mpg which means you can have your cake and eat it in term of being financially savvy. Although the Scirocco is good fun and reasonably priced it does have some drawbacks and that is the interior space. Not for the driver though, there's plenty of space up front. It's potential passengers who will suffer with low headroom. And there's not that much space for your luggage either so the car might be more of a couple's or single's car than a family car. The VW Scirocco Coupe is also well thought of by industry professionals such as review centres and car guides and often features in the top five list of great coupe buys alongside the ever popular Audi TT and cars like the Mini Coupe. But compared to these two cars the back seat on the Scirocco is enormous, something worth thinking about if you'd like to treat your friends to a spin. If you fancy trying the VW Scirocco, Kent is one area where you'll find dealers willing to accommodate."

3,Increased Trouble for Dietary Supplement Liability Insurance Applicants,autos-trucks," On Dec. 22, 2007, a bill signed by President Bush a year earlier became law. It set a required reporting system of profoundly adverse events (SAE) for dietary supplements sold and used in the United States. With further requirements, it mandated the company whose name appears on the product hold records related to every report for six years from the time the report is initially received. In spite of this, just those adverse events that are ""serious"" must be reported. The definition of ""serious"" is understandable and includes, but isn't restricted to, death, a life-threatening experience and in-patient hospitalization. But has any person studied the implications of not disclosing SAE reports to their product liability insurance carrier? No, and the consequences of not doing so could be dire. Almost each application for product liability insurance for dietary supplement companies has a question identical or very similar will this: ""Is the applicant aware of any fact, circumstance or situation which one might reasonably expect could give rise to a claim that would fall within the scope of the insurance being requested?"" Companies subject to the new SAE notification requirements should think about this subject carefully prior to responding either ""yes"" or ""no."" If a business is maintaining the required SAE records, can the company in good faith answer ""no"" to the question? Hardly. And what are the aftereffects of answering the question falsely? Put plainly, if a lawsuit arises from a previously documented SAE incident, the insurance company will confidently deny the claim after it discovers (and it will) the SAE was documented in the company’s records. The insurance company will allege fraud for inducing it to issue a policy based on concealed information. It will not simply deny the claim, but most likely will look to rescind the policy completely. Thus, the latest SAE reporting requirements have introduced a new necessity to disclose such events to a product liability insurance company when applying for the insurance, or risk a claim turned down when a claim is created. The GMP (good manufacturing practice) inspection procedure holds comparable risk. It is well known the amount of FDA inspections for GMP conformity have risen dramatically. According to FDA data, only seven GMP inspections occurred in 2008, which increased to 34 in 2009 and to 84 in '10. As of Sept. 13, there have been 145 inspections in 2011. A lot of of these inspections have resulted in warning notices to companies citing a range of violations and calling for a swift reply outlining remedial steps to be followed. These letters are a matter of public record and can be seen on the FDA’s website. With the number of inspections and enforcement undertakings overall on an abrupt rise, it stands to reason that more companies will be receiving a warning notice of some gravity in the near future. An additional question on nearly all product liability applications is virtually the same as or identical to this: ""Have any of the applicant’s products or ingredients or components thereof, ever been the subject of any investigation, enforcement action, or notice of violation of any kind by any governmental, quasi-governmental, directorial, regulatory or oversight body?"" Once more, a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer is called for. If a business has had an audit that resulted in a warning letter, it again should ponder carefully before answering the question. If the company has been issued a warning notice, the only logical response to the question is ""yes."" Though, a ""yes"" response will lift the eyebrow of the insurance underwriter, who for a long time has been viewing truthful ""no"" answers because of low enforcement activity before 2008. The underwriter will certainly want to know the details about the enforcement action and what remedial steps were taken. Product liability underwriters have almost always been sensitive to the quality and safety of the manufacturing process for dietary supplements. Seeing this question answered ""yes"" is definitely going to cause the insurer seek more info. The risk for answering the question misleadingly is precisely the same as with the SAE reports issue. A liability claim, especially a large one, will precipitate an investigation not only of the fact situation surrounding the claim, but also of the application process and the candor of the responses. As with the SAE reports, an incorrect answer, whether ""accidental"" or not, might lead the carrier to attempt to rescind the coverage at the time a company requires it the most—after the lawsuit is served. To sum up, these two government regulations have forced a higher standard of disclosure and detail on companies when applying for product liability insurance each year. As the saying goes, the devil is in the details, and insurance underwriters are looking for those details to be appropriately disclosed as part of the application procedure."
4,The Anatomy of an Oil Filter,autos-trucks," The Anatomy of an Oil Filter From the outside, you can’t tell anything about how good an oil filter is on the inside. All you can see is whatever paint or label is on it. But what’s on the inside is critical to your engine and so it should be to you as well. On my old car, the one I used to get through college, I went to one of those quick oil change places that were cheap and supposed to be fast. I had no idea what kind of filter they put on my car, I think it was white. I had idea what oil went into the car either. But after graduation when I began to make some real income I bought my first new car, an Infiniti G35. I love that car. When it came time for its first service at 3750 miles I didn’t even think about returning to that fast oil change place, I took the car to my local Infiniti Express Service dealer. I learned about this service when I bought my car— Infiniti certified technicians work on the car and use only genuine Infiniti parts to service it. And that means a lot to me. You see, after I bought my new car I spent a lot of time Googling all kinds of things about cars—topics I’d never cared about before because I’d never had a great car like my new Infiniti. One night I learned a lot about oil filters, turns out they’re not all the same and the differences are very important. Inside an oil filter, there is a pleated material that is the actual filter. This filter ""media"" allows oil to flow through but catches particles above a certain size. What this material is made of and how many pleats it has is very important. Some filters have media that is basically paper, others use advanced synthetic materials. Some media doesn’t let the oil flow very well and at the same time doesn’t even filter very well! Good media doesn’t impede the oil flow and it catches particles well—you can have your cake and eat it too. The filter media is sealed at both ends with endplates, some filters use cheap cardboard for this and others use metal. Every oil filter should have a bypass valve (some don’t though) which in case the filter gets clogged opens and allows oil to continue to flow to your engine. Some bypass valves are made from nitrile rubber which doesn’t work well when cold, some are made from silicone which is much more durable than nitrile and some are made from metal which is obviously very durable. Lastly, filters should have an anti-drain back valve, and these can vary in quality just as the bypass valves do. I know that Infiniti put a filter on my car that was made to work with the recommended oil in my car, and that lives up to the high quality standards that Infiniti sets for its vehicles. I’m not willing to gamble my new car’s engine on the unknown quality of the oil filters at the corner quick oil change place. I’ll trust my Infiniti Express Service dealer to put genuine Infiniti parts like oil and air filters into my car, and have them put there by certified technicians that know what they’re doing. And guess what I discovered? Infiniti Express Service is just as fast (if not faster!) then that quick oil change place I used to go to. Infiniti Express Service is about the same price too. Plus, at Express Service they give me car a complimentary multi-point safety inspection, test my battery, and wash my car before they return it to me! You can bet I’ll bring my car back to my Infiniti Express Service dealer for my 5000, 7500, and 15000 mile service too."
5,Understanding Engine Oil,autos-trucks," Understanding Engine Oil Did you ever think about engine oil? Most people don’t until it’s time for their 3750, 5000, 7500 or 15000 mile oil change. But the fact is, engine oil is an amazing product. Did you know that the average engine oil has over 200 chemical compounds in it? Do you know what the difference between synthetic and non-synthetic oil is? Or what those numbers like ""5w-20"" mean on the oil bottle? I took my car, an Infiniti model, to my local Infiniti Express Service dealer for a quick oil change and service. As an engineer I appreciate engine oil for the amazingly evolved product it is, and I appreciate my dealership because I know that the people working on it are Infiniti certified technicians who only use genuine Infiniti parts and when doing their fast oil change use only Infiniti specified oil. Here’s why this is so important. Engine oil has two jobs, lubricate moving parts and cool the hot parts of the engine. The lubrication part is done by the oil creating a film, a barrier, between moving parts such as the piston and the cylinder wall which prevents them from actually touching and coming in contact. If the oil film breaks down, then metal on metal contact occurs and if this continues the engine wears out prematurely. The cooling part is accomplished by oil splashing on hot parts of the engine like the underside of the pistons, absorbing heat from there and carrying it to the oil pan where it can be convected out to cooler air flowing under the car. Your engine oil must flow almost instantly when you cold start your engine. If the oil is too thick and flows slowly then metal on metal contact is occurring while the engine internals are waiting for oil flow to arrive. Once the engine is fully up to operating temperature, engine oil is typically around 220 F degrees. When hot, if the oil is too thin, then again metal on metal contact occurs and engine wear accelerates. The solution was the invention of multi-viscosity oils. In the old days, oil had a single weight, say 40w. The ""weight"" of the oil refers to it’s relative resistance to flowing through a narrow orifice. You can thick of ‘weight’ as being the thickness or thinness of the oil. A single weight oil, like 40w, is a heavy, thick oil that at 100C degrees (212F) is certified by the American Petroleum Institute to meet the standards for that weight. The problem is, in order not to thin out at 100C temperature, 40w is so thick when cold that it flows, well, about as good as molasses. If you try to use a single weight oil that’s thin enough to flow well when cold, it will become too thin to keep its integrity at high temperature allowing the oil film to break down. Multi-weight oils like a 5w-20 have special additives that allow the oil to be thin when cold and act like a thicker oil when hot. The ""5w,"" the first number, means that at 0C degrees (32F) the oil flows like a thin 5w oil. This is good, it means that when you start your car and all of the oil is in the pan instead of the engine, the oil will flow quickly and begin protecting engine parts. The second number, ""20,"" means that at 100C degrees (212F) the oil has resisted thinning out so that it has the ‘thickness’ that a single weight 20w oil would have when hot. Synthetic oils have a base, the main ingredient in the oil, that consists of synthesized polymers. Synthetic oil is vastly superior to regular ""fossil"" oil—it has a much broader range of temperatures it can operate in without scorching when too hot or turning into sludge when too cold. Synthetic oil resists breaking down and keeps its ability to lubricate long after regular oil would be worn out, so your vehicle manufacturer can recommend much longer oil change intervals without harming your engine. Modern engines are complicated, some have valves with variable timing which usually uses the oil as a hydraulic fluid within the mechanism controlling the valve timing. You don’t want to use an oil that is too thick or too thin as it may impact the functioning of this mechanism. This is why I’m glad to let the Infiniti Express Dealer service my car and change its oil and filter—I know that they know what oil is right for my car, something I’m not 100% sure of at those other places. I know that the Infiniti certified technicians working on my car know what oil and parts it needs and that genuine Infiniti parts are optimized for my car. The Complimentary Multi-Point Safety Inspection and car wash my Infiniti Express Service dealer throws in at each oil change is a nice bonus. So now you know something about engine oil and why it’s important to make sure the right stuff is going into your crankcase."
6,Benefits of Motor Fleet Insurance Policy over Individual Vehicle Insurance,autos-trucks," Almost every business uses commercial vehicles to run its business operations efficiently. Like any other physical asset of the business, these vehicles are very valuable and should be insured. When it comes to insuring the commercial vehicles, business owners have two options. They can get individual insurance policy for each vehicle or cover all the vehicles in one comprehensive insurance policy. In this article, we will discuss on this topic in detail and see which one is better. One thing is for sure, you should get your commercial vehicle insured. According to Continuous Insurance Enforcement (CIE) law, every registered vehicle must have valid insurance at all times. This law in UK, states that it is an offense to keep vehicles without insurance and a huge penalty will be imposed on vehicle owners for not having insurance for their vehicles. Though this law is not introduced in Northern Ireland, still it is mandatory to have adequate insurance cover for any motor vehicle that is used or left on a public highway. So, if your business uses vehicles, it is legally necessary to have vehicle insurance. Motor fleet insurance policy Now that we are clear about the importance of insurance policy, we need to look for the options. As discussed earlier, we can either take individual insurance policies or go for a single policy, where several vehicles of any type are covered. Also called as motor fleet insurance, the latter one is a good option for companies having four or more commercial vehicles. However, the former option (individual insurance policy) is suitable for businesses with one or two vehicles. If your business has more than three vehicles, consider choosing motor fleet insurance. Here are its benefits. Benefits over individual vehicle insurance policy There are many benefits of fleet insurance policy over individual vehicle insurance. This policy simply ensures that each and every vehicle of the business is outlined in a single policy. •	Avoids the hassles of handling different insurance policies: Fleet insurance not only provides the benefit of covering all vehicles under a single policy, but also helps you stay away from the issues that arise while handling various insurance policies. You need not worry about the renewals of each and every individual policy of different vehicles. It is easy to handle fleet insurance - all vehicles will have single renewal date; single set of options and conditions; same process to claim, etc. •	Provides coverage for the insurer/driver: Many fleet insurance policies also cover the insurer/driver, which is a must have in today’s environment. Also there are cost implications to fleet vehicles with younger drivers. So, the premium rates may depend on the scope of the driving restrictions requested. •	Saves time and money: Motor fleet insurance provides major benefits in terms of money and time. Since many vehicles are covered in a single policy, the premium will certainly be less than the sum of individual insurance policy premiums. Since all vehicles are covered under one policy, you can save a lot of time on tracking and maintaining various policies. Get better deals from reputed brokerage firms It is always better to approach reputed insurance brokerage firms when planning to go for a motor fleet insurance. They will have contacts with many insurance companies that offer motor fleet insurance. Remember, not all companies offer motor fleet insurance. These brokerage firms compare the quotes from various companies that offer this insurance and tailor the policy to the needs of your business. They also give professional advice on various aspects of this insurance like breakdown assistance insurance, comprehensive fleet rates, free legal expenses, windscreen insurance, third party fire and theft insurance, theft of keys, fire brigade charges and so on. Having understood the benefits, it is wise to choose for a motor fleet insurance policy for your business. Depending on the requirement of your business, you should ensure adequate cover for your vehicles."
7,How Can I Find Cheap Car Tyres?,autos-trucks," In today's economic climate, consumers are trying to find ways to save money. Along with the increased cost of gasoline, proper vehicle maintenance is becoming more expensive every day. Consumers can save a substantial amount of money by finding ways to buy cheap tyres. Below are some of them. Salvage yards There are many cars, trucks and SUV's that have been wrecked and sent to the salvage yards. Most still have very good parts on them and are sold as used. This includes selling their used tyres. With such a big selection of vehicles, the chances of finding used cheap ones that will fit a specific automobile is high. The best thing about buying used tyres at salvage yards is that they are usually very cheap. The treads can be checked to see if they pass inspection by sticking a penny or a nickel in the indenture between them. If the head is not showing, the tyres should pass. Also, to help make sure that the tyres have not dry-rotted, check the inspection on the front windshield. If it is not very old, the tyres should be okay. Service stations Many service stations repair and change vehicle tyres. At times, customers ask for their tyres to be changed off even if they still have plenty of tread on them and they could still pass the state inspection. Some of these stations keep the used tyres. Asking them if they have any for sale may provide a cheap alternative to buying new ones. Service stations have to pay to dispose of any tyres that they do not want to keep so they very well might sell them. Department discount stores Some of the large department discount stores carry automobile supplies. Many of them sell these supplies considerably less than regular auto shops. Tyres can be bought usually at 20 to 30 percent discount. Tyre discount stores Tyre discount stores usually offer wider selections when trying to find inexpensive tyres. They buy in bulk and can sell them cheaper than department discount stores. These stores can also be found online. They may offer extra incentives for buying them online, such as free shipping. Auto tyre shops Every so often, these specialty stores will offer sales that are really good buys. Tyres can be bought rather cheaply. Some have even advertised that if a customer buys one tyre, the second tyre will be free. Other sales can include cheap prices for tyres that are going to be discontinued and not sold in the future by them. There are many places that consumers can look to buy really cheap tyres. After only a few minutes of searching, real bargains can be found."
8,The Five Main Types of Tyres For All Driving Conditions,autos-trucks," Choosing car tyres is not always an easy decision for most motorists. Where to buy them, what kind to buy, and of course, the budget, is the price of the tyre really worth its coin? Every car has factory tyres that were made for that car and sticking with them is not a bad decision but there are other factors to consider. First of all, what type of tread is needed? Where does the motorist live and what types of roads and terrain does the car travel on? Dirt roads or gravel roads will need a better grip tyre, while a car that travels a lot of highway miles will need a harder rubber tyre that will last longer and be quieter than the mountain climbing tyres. There are five main types of tyres for all driving conditions. Standard or all season tyres. This tyre's name says it all. It is good in wet or dry pavement, rain or snow and has a harder rubber compound that gives the tyre longer life. The tread pattern also cuts down on the noise and allows a quite smooth highway drive. ALL Terrain Tyres. This tyre has the best grip and is designed to tackle any mountain the motorist can drive on. Its tread design is for handling gravel, dirt roads, mud tracks, and sand dunes. Winter Tyres. These tyres are not the most quite since they have little metal studs in their treads for gripping into snow packed roads. They are used only in the winter but insure safety to the motorist under extreme slippery conditions. Performance Tyres. These tyres are for the warmer climates where the pavement gets really hot. They are made of a softer rubber compound that grips the hot pavement, but handles poorly on wet or slippery roads. Run Flat Tyres. This tyre is different from the others because it allows the motorist to drive for a while to safety if they have received a puncture to cause a flat. Finding the best price for tyres isn't that easy but here are something's to take in consideration. The best deals come with package buying. Many dealers offer buy three tyres get one free, or buy four rims and get half price tyres. Online tyre prices may be cheaper but there is a shipping cost and a lot of dealers will offer free installation or free mounting and balancing with tyre purchase. Some dealers will offer lifetime tyre rotation and balancing, so there is a lot to consider. The most important thing to remember, whatever tyre is needed, proper maintenance is a must. Make sure the car's tyres are properly inflated and properly aligned, this will add to the life of the tyre and the safety of the passengers."
9,Are Run Flat Tyres a Good or Bad Choice?,autos-trucks," Some leading manufacturers are developing the adaption of using run flat tyres in the line up of their vehicles. This allows some advantages for the owner of the vehicle but like anything it comes with certain disadvantages. The main purpose for this added feature is the ability to drive a short amount of distance after suffering a puncture in the tyre to make it to a service station. Doesn't this sound great? You could be driving down the road, following a vehicle, when something falls off the vehicle in front of you and with no time to react. PPUUUUFFF! You don't have time to change a tire or really don't want to be out on this busy commute road attempting to fix your problem with motorist wheezing by. So sure there are advantages to running these tyres. Like being able to continue along for a short amount to time until you can get to a safe service station to make repairs before a blow out happens. It is much easier to keep clean and have someone else do the work while you wait the short amount of time to get back on the road and on schedule. Even better, maybe you're a person that needs the cargo room in the trunk of your car where usually the spare tyre is stored. With these special tyres there shouldn't be any need to carry a spare along with you. This would allow you to use that most precious cargo room to your personal use. As stated before, with everything there are certain disadvantages. To start with, what if you are on a trip or commute where the nearest service station is not as near as you would wish? These tyres will keep you running for a short amount of time, but like any tyre they will eventually breakdown causing you the need to replace the entire tyre. This could become costly if you have too many flats. Worst yet if you run too long on a flat tyre you could easily damage the rim and have the need to replace this costly feature that wouldn't need to be done otherwise. This could all be prevented as long as you keep the spare tyre in the vehicle and change it out if you have a long distance to go after an incident. Wouldn't that defeat the whole purpose of using these tyres? If you kept the spare and used it to prevent damage you would lose that extra cargo space, still have to change the tyre, and be right where you were before purchasing these tyres. So as long as you have many service stations along your route or at least get a punctured tyre close to one, run flat tyres would be a good purchase for you. Otherwise, the wait for better technology with these tyres may be worthwhile."
10,Keeping Those Hideous Dents off Those Cool Cars,autos-trucks," People go to great pains to make their car look hot, trendy and sporty. They spend huge amounts of time and money ensuring that they get the right car paints and other add-ons to make their car stand out from the crowd. We have all seen the effect that a flashy car has as it goes by. Basically, a modern and amazing designed car captures people attention and that makes the car owner proud driving a showstopper. But once your car gets a looks-altering imperfection and has been damaged from unexpected accident, these can become your worst nightmare. In order to prevent these situations, here are some helpful tips from the expert in car maintenance. Adhering to road rules - although many drivers may take this for granted, this is one of the first causes of car damages such as dents and scratches. Reckless drivers are the ones who ignore traffic rules and basically drive as fast as they like and are thereby more likely to get into an accident. A car can be repaired after an accident but lives are permanently altered by many accidents. If road rules are strictly followed, the chances of getting an accident are very unlikely. Parking carefully - parking areas are the most common place of getting car scratch or dent. This is because, some people tend to park very carelessly and some of the people are just not really good at parking on a narrow space, this is one of the reasons why cars are being damaged. Using car turntables or truck turntables is one of the best methods of keeping your vehicle free from dents when parking at home. This is because these parking solutions are excellent for turning and maneuvering cars in tight driveways. Avoiding driving temptations - when drivers have acquired a certain level of competence, they tend to take a lot for granted. Since driving is no longer a novelty they resort to doing other things when driving like eating, drinking, talking on cell phones, staring at passersby and many other distracting activities. These can prove very costly not only for the car but also for the life of the driver. Unauthorized car users - minors should never be allowed to drive or play at the wheel of any car, whether the car is within the home compound or not. This is because; minors easily get caught up with the excitement of being behind its wheel and can easily cause a hazard. Planning routes beforehand - most people do not do this and end up racing from one place to another in a mad rush to meet deadlines. Prudent drivers who value themselves and the money they have spent to make their cars look good, plan their driving routes well ahead of time. This will allow them ample time to complete their daily assignments in good time and negotiate their way away from dense traffic areas that can also be areas where accidents are most likely to occur."
11,Jeep tire covers part of the plan when going off-road,autos-trucks," When an off-roader plans a rugged terrain adventure, he or she dresses appropriately. There is often no telling what one will encounter on such a trip, and that is certainly part of the thrill. It could be the deep rich sand of a deserted beach or the heavy splattering mud of a backwoods field. Whatever the circumstance might be, it is important to take basic and timely precautions, and that involves safeguarding the 4x4 as much as it means wearing the right gear to survive and enjoy the off-road experience. Jeep parts accessories are a vital aspect of that planning, and that includes ensuring the spare tire is firmly secure and ready for use if and when the need might arise. While off-road enthusiasts do not generally plan to break down in the midst of rugged terrain, the best among them make sure they have the proper equipment to handle any situation that might arise. The spare is a crucial part of any back-up system, and one important thing to consider is to make certain the tire is protected and free from the elements. Jeep tire covers offer that protection and can go a long ways to keeping the spare free from dirt and grime and looking as good as new if the spare must be put it to use. Most jeep tire covers are made of strong material designed to withstand all types of weather conditions and reinforced with rawhide stitching to make certain of a secure fit. The jeep tire cover not only provides a snug fit over the spare, but is designed with ease of operation to allow quick removal in the case of an emergency. When an emergency occurs, a well thought-out back-up plan can save the day. The cover also offers a design element to go with the jeep. It gives the owner the opportunity to express love for the vehicle or even something else near and dear to one's heart. Many jeep design covers come with the logo of the vehicle manufacturer for proud and prominent display. Still others have other images popular among the 4x4 crowd. And for the truly unique, it is possible to purchase a custom tire cover to express a myriad of feelings visually or verbally. These covers also come in color-coordinated creations to match the jeep or to make a creative statement. Whatever the design purpose, a jeep tire cover can provide a distinctive addition to a vehicle designed for enjoyment and adventure. Whatever jeep parts accessories strike the fancy of a 4x4 owner, there is a wealth of information that describes the product and offers suggestions about its use. In the case of jeep tire covers, one must first determine the proper size for a tight fit. Once that question has been answered, the various options may be reviewed to help discern which alternative provides the greatest safety while also offering design and class. As good as a custom tire cover can look, there is nothing to replace the security of knowing that it will help preserve the spare for the moment that it is called into service."
12,Debate of the Decade: Is Synthetic Oil or Conventional Oil Better?,autos-trucks," Oil Change – Synthetic vs. Conventional - It’s that time again! ""Maintenance Soon"" pops up on your dash display and if you’re anything like me, you get excited thinking about your upcoming visit to your second favorite place in the world, after the dentist that is. Going in for a ""simple oil change"" is a daunting task and exhaustive battle if you are not properly armed. For now, let’s focus on one of the most commonly debated issues of the 21st century: Synthetic Oil versus Conventional Oil. Conventional Oil – Conventional oils, also known as standard oil, have been used in automobile engines since day one. This tells your average Joe or Jane that it should be perfectly fine, and in most cases, it is. However, engine development and technology has come a long way since the release of the first mass-produced Ford. These advances may encourage the more technologically savvy individual to lean towards synthetic oils. Fortunately for you, the manufacturer of your vehicle specifies if you must employ synthetic oils, at least to maintain your warranty. Synthetic Oils – Synthetic oils provide significant benefits over conventional oils in a few ways. Through years of lab testing it has been proven that the synthetic product will withstand higher temperatures and abuse than its predecessor. Also, higher end synthetics provide better lubrication. Lastly, another benefit is increased oil life. Yes, most synthetics these days will not break down as fast as their conventional counterparts. Does this mean it is better? I’d say so! Does this mean it is best for you? Not necessarily. I can’t make it that easy! Common Misconceptions – I never get bored of all the misinformed sales pitches and variety of ways eager servicemen attempt to woo you into their top products. It is a common misconception that switching from synthetic oil to conventional oil will affect the oil seals. Back in the 70’s and 80’s, when synthetic oils were introduced to the general public, inconsistencies in the blending of the formulas would cause oil leaks. Basically, the properties of the synthetics would cause oil seals to shrink where as petroleum based oils allow a perfect seal swell. Well that was 30 years ago folks and oil technology has come a long way. This is no longer an issue if using the majority of mainstream synthetics. Which One Should You Use – Your owner’s manual will indicate if the car maker recommends synthetic oil over standard oil. If it implies synthetic, then use synthetic. Also, ignore anything the serviceman implies about oil seal swell and oil leaks involved in the selection of the synthetic or conventional oil. Now to the fun part! How to decide which route is the best for you to take. Honesty is the best policy when truly evaluating your needs. If you meet or exceed your owner’s manuals service interval expectations when it comes to changing oil, like a saint follows the bible, you are probably the right candidate for standard oil. If you aim for that mileage interval but overshoot it by a long shot and are pretty consistent at that practice due to your busy schedule, then synthetic oil should be considered. Are you a cruiser or a gas pedal bruiser? For you light-footed, ""defensive"" drivers, standard oil is more than sufficient. Those heavy-footed, ""offensive"" drivers like myself, may want to lean towards synthetics. I’m just being honest. Stop and go driving is actually more strenuous on your engine than coasting on the highway. Remember, the harder your engine works decides if you should move from standard oil to synthetic oil. Ultimately, your driving and vehicle maintenance habits should determine whether you spend the extra bucks on the synthetic up-sell, or go with the more economical conventional oil option."
13,What Are You Using To Stop Your Car?,autos-trucks," It’s important to know which brake pads are best for you, considering that they are only the most vital system on your automobile.  A lot relies on the hard work they constantly perform for you.  Sometimes taken for granted, they could potentially save your life, and the life of your family.  So what is it that we’re actually buying when we purchase a set of brakes for our vehicles?  There are 4 basic types of brake pads: semi-metallic, non-asbestos organic, low-metallic NAO and ceramic. 4 Types of Brake Pads: Semi-metallic brake pad – Semi-metallic brake pads generally consist of anywhere between 30 to 65 percent metal material which may include steel wool bits or wire, iron powder, graphite or copper mixed with inorganic fillers, and friction modifiers that hold that whole recipe together.  This is the most common type of brake pad and for years the majority of automobiles used this type of friction material due to their durability.  Another positive is their superior brake heat transfer capabilities.  However, they tend to wear down brake rotors quickly, have noise issues, and don’t always perform as well till they are warmed up. Non-asbestos organic brake pad – Typically this type of brake pad is simply known as ""organic brake pads"" or ""NAO brake pads"" for short.  This brake pad material is made from such items as rubber, glass, carbon and Kevlar fibers, with filler materials and high-temperature brake pad resins.  Much softer than their semi-metallic counterparts, these brake pads boast lower noise complaints and less wear to each brake rotor.  The downfall of these brake pads is that they wear much faster and create a lot of brake dust build-up on the wheels, and they don’t stop your car as well. Low-metallic NAO – As the name suggests, these pads are made from an organic compound mixed with minimal amounts of copper or steel. Generally they contain more than 10 percent but less than 30 percent metal.  The metal in these pads provides better heat transfer and braking distances.  However, this also makes the pads noisier than their organic counterparts, but not quite as dusty. Ceramic brake pad – Growing more and more popular on today’s vehicles, these brake pads are put together with ceramic fibers, a variety of bonding and filler materials and sometimes even small amounts of metal.  No two compositions are exactly alike except for the fact that they contain a ceramic material.  Ceramic brake pads are create the least brake dust, are quiet brake pads, and offer the best braking characteristics without wearing down the rotors like the other braking compounds.  These brakes don’t brake as well until they are warmed up. The brake system is the most important safety feature on your vehicle.  Talk with your auto mechanic about which brake pad will work best for you.  However inconvenient it may be to have them checked, it would be much more inconvenient if they failed.  Whenever uncertain about your automobile, have a qualified automotive technician check it out.  Your life and your family’s life ride on it."
14,Just An Oil Change?,autos-trucks," How is it that in many consumers’ minds, the most performed and most important service on your vehicle became ""just an oil change""?  Whether you have this performed at the intervals the old quickie lube shops made up of 3,000 miles, or most manufacturers recommended 7,500 miles, it is still completed more often than any other service on your vehicle.  This is your vehicles routine check-up and should be of higher importance. A long lasting engine has proper lubrication.  This means not only replacing the engine oil on time, but making sure the oil level is always where it needs to be, and the oil is the right type for your application.  As you drive further and further, your engine oil breaks down.  This destroys the lubricating abilities of the oil.  Engines that don’t have proper lubrication work harder, get hotter, and wear faster.  Last time I checked, your motor was the most important part of your vehicle. In addition to being concerned with your engine, the oil change is the time to verify the rest of the vehicle is in good shape.  Here are some routine services and checks that you need to make sure your mechanic is doing, every time your car is in for service. Tire Maintenance – A tire rotation and air pressure check should be performed every oil change.  It is also recommended to have your tire balance and wheel alignment checked at the very least.  All shops will check your air pressure for free and in California it is required by law.  Most automotive shops offer a free tire rotation and free balance and alignment checks with their oil change service.  This is a good way to extend the life of your tires and ensure your vehicles safety. Brakes – Verify that the mechanic or auto technician checked your brakes during your oil change.  The wheels will come off during the tire rotation so it’s only a matter of them observing the brakes condition.  Once again, most shops perform this as a free service to you while having your oil changed.  Checking the brakes is necessary in determining how safe your vehicle is. Fluids – As the oil is essential to the engines performance, so are the other fluids under the hood.  All shops should verify the fluid levels and any irregularities with them.  Most shops will even offer free fluid top-off.  It’s always good to double-check with the mechanic that this service was performed. General Inspection – Give your auto service technician a chance to fully inspect your vehicle for any potential concerns.  A lot of auto repair shops will do a multi-point inspection just as a doctor does on you at your check-ups.  Generally this is also a free service offered by the auto repair center upon request.  The mechanics should be looking for leaking, cracked, worn, torn or broken parts during this written inspection. So rather than bringing your car in for ""just an oil change"", have it thoroughly inspected and maintained.  It will take longer than a 10 minute oil change, but your safety and your vehicles overall well-being relies on it.  Most shops will even perform theses much needed services and checks for free.  Your most important service is the key to your car’s long life."
15,How Important Is Your Car To You?,autos-trucks," Do you take your car for granted?  Most of us these days could not live without our cars but at the same time don’t give them the TLC they deserve.  Automobiles slave for us day in and day out and when they act up, become the target of insults.  Just like a good relationship, vehicles need maintenance to perform as expected.  I’m not saying that all your time and attention needs to be put in to them, but they do deserve a little love. With the continuing down economy and fewer new car sales per year than in the past, it is important that we maintain our vehicles.  If you can afford to buy or lease a new vehicle every 30,000 miles then you can ignore this article.  Fact is, most consumers will keep their car for far longer than this.  Actually, Edmunds statistics say that the average consumer will keep their new vehicle for 5-6 years.  At the average 15,000 miles per year, that may set you at 90,000 miles.  Some studies show averages of even up to 10 years since the decline of the economy. It is less expensive to maintain a vehicle than purchase a new one.  If you’re looking to pinch pennies, pinch them in the right place.  Dish out a little more dough on the maintenance to prolong the life of the vehicle to save on new car costs.  Make sense?  Vehicles these days are built to last a lot longer than past years.  Getting 10 years out of a car with proper maintenance is well within reach.  When the costs of maintaining or repair your vehicle get up to 50% of the value of it, then make the switch. Some believe that it is cheaper going the ""if it’s not broken, don’t fix it"" route.  If only this were true.  While your car is in use, everything from the oil to the tires and internal engine components are experiencing wear.  Eventually something will wear down and break.  Some fixes are a lot less expensive than others.  Take your transmission for example.  Replacing the transmission fluid every so often as it ""breaks down"" may cost you a few hundred dollars, while replacing your transmission only once will cost you several thousand.  This is true with almost every system on your vehicle. Truth is, no one enjoys spending money on vehicle maintenance and repairs, considering all the more pleasurable retail items out there.  But having to purchase a vehicle more frequently will create an even bigger hit on your wallet.  For something that just serves to get you from point  A to point B, why not save as much as you possibly can.  Save yourself bundles of cash by maintaining your automobile."
16,Protect Your Car - And Yourself - With These Simple Tips,autos-trucks," Is there anything I can do between services to help protect my car from major breakdowns or mishaps? This is a question I am asked most often by car owners.  Car manufacturers usually include a section of little things you can do as a consumer to help maintain your vehicle in the owner’s manual.  Unfortunately these manuals aren’t written by Stephen King and are the least bit entertaining and sometimes even overwhelming.  Fortunately, there are 5 simple steps you can take to protect your car. 5 Simple Steps to Protect Your Car 1.Do a walk-around – Every time you plan to drive your car, do a quick walk-around to potentially spot any dangers.  Most importantly take notice of your tire pressure and ensure that none of the tires are low or have any unusual objects in them.  Also, check for any possible fluid leaks. The walk-around also provides you with an opportunity to see if any damage was recently caused to your vehicle, which will help you determine when and where the damage occurred. 2.Check tire pressure – If you are performing step one then you should only have to do this about once a month.  There should be a sticker in the driver’s side door jamb that has the auto manufacturers recommended pressure.  Parts stores such as AutoZone have inexpensive tire pressure gauges and a trained staff to show you how to use it.  Or you can drive up to any automotive repair or tire shop and have it done accurately and for free in minutes. 3.Check the vehicles fluid levels – Once again this can be done yourself or by a local auto shop for free and within minutes.  Under the hood you should have access to the engine oil, automatic transmission fluid, brake fluid, power steering fluid, washer fluid and coolant dipsticks and reservoirs.  Pull the dipstick and wipe it off then re-dip it to verify the proper level.  For some reservoirs just verify the level is in between the markings.  If they are low visit your local auto service shop where most offer a free top-off.  If the brake fluid is significantly low, your brake pads may be worn out so have your brakes inspected immediately.  Be sure the proper fluids are going in the proper places.  For example, not all vehicles take the same coolant, engine oil, etc. 4.Observe changes in drivability – Take notice of any changes in what should be a smooth ride.  A vehicle that has a steering wheel shake at 60 mph may need the tires re-balanced or potentially have a separated tire tread.  If your car pulls in one direction or the other on the highway it may be a sign of an alignment issue.  If anything seems even a little off then write down the changes and visit your local mechanic immediately. 5.Keep your eyes and ears open – Lastly, like step four, keep your ears open for any strange squeaks, moans, groans, and clunks coming from your car when driving and going over bumps.  If not resolved, these could lead to bigger problems.  Also, if any of your dash warning lights go on you should immediately seek your mechanic for help.  Those indicators mean that there is something important wrong or about to go wrong on your vehicle."

18,You Really Do Need Life Insurance And The Earlier You Take One Out The Better Deal You Will Get,autos-trucks," Like most young Australians starting out in life the world is your oyster. Living in a land with a glorious climate and a good education and vocational training system which enables you to find a decent job and start enjoying life. And is there a lot of life to enjoy; from surfing to skiing, from sailing to playing one of the many sports at which All Australians excel and are proud. So why would you ever even consider purchasing Life Insurance. Yes that is right. You wouldn't. But it is suggested that you think very carefully about taking out a policy sooner rather than later. The reasons are manifold and here are a few for you to consider; At some stage hopefully you will get married and start a family. The earlier you start with a policy the better the coverage will be and your family will be protected should anything happen to you. How often do you read of horrific accidents where there are multiple deaths and families are left devastated and destitute, even though the deceased was in no way responsible for the accident. And it doesn't have to be by car, You may fall overboard on a yacht race or fall off a horse. And this is just accidental death. The fact that we Aussies live in a wonderful climate does not exempt us from getting ill, Heart attacks, cancers and other illnesses also manifest themselves in Australia and the effect on the family will be just as devastating. In fact maybe worse. So it is suggested the younger and healthier you are the better odds you will get in taking out a life insurance policy. There are many types of policy depending on what you want to do. The simplest form of Life Insurance is a straightforward bet. You bet against the insurance company that you won't die before you turn 65 (say). The actuaries, who are guys with massive mathematical ability take all of the factors they can think of into account and give you odds on this bet. So if you are a young healthy 20 year old who is going to work in a non hazardous environment, your policy is likely to be a lot cheaper per AU$100,000 than if you were 30 years old, a heavy smoker, was overweight and working as a coal miner.. There are many other types of life insurance policies, some which will cover you and for which, after 25 or 30 years of premiums will pay you out a lump sum or an annuity, which is a regular payment every year until you decease or similar. These types of policies seem attractive as the value added sounds fantastic but before committing to one of these policies check out the small print as well as whether the amount promised is going to be worth that much is inflation is 5% pa for example. There are other policies which offer income protection in the event of a disabling injury for example. All of these are pertinent and it is advisable to consider life insurance as early in your career as you sensibly can."
19,Are Your Wipers Ready for Rain?,autos-trucks," It's raining! It's pouring! The collision rates are soaring! Sacramento-area traffic becomes incredibly chaotic when water begins to fall from the sky. Thousands of vehicle accidents happen to reckless drivers as well as overly cautious drivers when it rains, and with storms coming in short sporadic bursts throughout the year, rain is without a doubt a major driving hazard. Slick roads and decreased visibility are the two major factors in what causes collisions during the Sacramento rainy season. Short of wiping down the road ways, there's not much motorists can do to stop the roads from becoming slippery when wet. However, we can do something to improve visibility and road safety. Maintaining windshield wipers is a crucial part of vehicle maintenance for anyone driving in the rain. Wiper blades are made of thin strips of rubber that work as squeegees to remove water from the driver's line of vision, adjustable to various speeds to keep the windshield free of rain and debris. But windshield wipers deteriorate and wear out, and as they degrade they become less and less effective. It's not the use of wipers that causes them to break down. In fact, it's the off-season that the driver must worry about. Hot California summers are extremely hard on the thin rubber strips that coat the blades. Heat can cause the rubber to dry up and crack, resulting in breaks in the blade when it's time to perform. UV rays also affect flexibility of the blade, which can result in stuttered lines across a rain soaked windshield. Then when the rains begin and you need your wipers, they're not ready for you. As summer ends and winter rains, it's a good idea to check, replace, or even upgrade your windshield wipers. Most auto parts stores offer guides to assist you in looking up replacement blades specific to the make and model of your vehicle. Many blades are designed for easy replacement with snap clips or small push tabs to release the old blades. Always consult your vehicle maintenance manual to find the correct wiper blade replacement strategy. Changing blades before you need them will give you the confidence needed to face the hazards of a rainy commute. The professionals at our Sacramento body shop are always available to answer your questions about your vehicle and vehicle safety. If the worst happens, and you find yourself involved in a rain-aggravated fender-bender, our expert team of collision repair technicians will get you back on the road looking great. Seasons change here in Sac, but our dedication to customer service at G&R Body & Paint is year-round. Call us at 916-731-8203 or e-mail to info@grbodyshop.com."
