1,The Career in Politics,politics," Why do candidates for Congress spend millions of dollars for an office that pays $169,200.00? Between 2004 and 2006, members of Congress' net worth increased an average of 84% - book advances, speaking engagements, stock and land deals, privileged mortgages, etc. The United States is no longer the representative democracy our founders conceived because of a glaring flaw in our Constitution: it allows individuals to make a career of public office. This creates a critical conflict of interest for politicians between their own ambitions and their responsibility as representatives of the American people. These ""careerists"" gradually lose their principles in acceding to campaign contributors, heeding opinion polls, and following their political party's line. Career Congressional members, many of whom have been in office most of their adult lives, have usurped much of the sovereignty of the electorate. This has become a government of the people, by the politicians, and for the special interests, to paraphrase Abraham Lincoln. Self-serving, entrenched Republican and Democratic politicos create costly and harmful programs to secure votes. These programs increase Americans' reliance upon the government, while diminishing our initiative, self-sufficiency, and self-esteem. The average employed American is paying higher payroll taxes than income taxes - for programs from which he or she may never be the beneficiary. These programs, such as unemployment insurance, welfare, Social Security, and Medicare, make recipients completely dependent on the government. Incumbents seek ""earmarks"" and ""pork"" to reinforce their constituents' loyalty at the polls. Earmarks are expenses that conference committees attach, without a vote by Congress, to approved spending bills. In 2004 and 2005, there were an astonishing 15,268 earmarks that squandered over $40 billion from the U.S. Treasury on non-essential projects, such as the infamous ""Alaskan bridge to nowhere."" And in 2007, despite all the political posturing about reform, there was $10 billion of wasteful pork - with the House Appropriation Committee alone writing over $4 billion in earmarks as of November 2007. These funds would be better used to significantly reduce our national debt. Instead, members of both political parties indulge in this underhanded funding; self-serving legislators use their earmarks, an unnecessary waste our tax money, to support their ambitions to remain in office. Legislators constantly battle to reach their goal of being part of the powerful, majority political party. Fortunately, the contentious battle between the parties has prevented the United States from becoming an oligarchy. Unfortunately, the polarizing battle for dominance has increased enmity to ethnic proportions. We have a dysfunctional government because the bitter partisanship precludes the ability to compromise. The mean-spirited pettiness of either minority party discredits the administration's performance, blocks appointees, obstructs important legislation, and convenes endless committee hearings for harassing purposes. Sadly, we have no loyal opposition. The divisiveness, which conceals the theft of our sovereignty and the abuse of the legislators' power, is so extensive that it affects the entire country. Unfortunately, we are so engrossed in this vitriolic rivalry between the political parties that we are unaware that career politicians are exploiting our government. We have been mislead into thinking that members of the opposing political party are the adversaries, while it is actually the career politicians, skillfully looking out for themselves, who are the bad guys. Politicians use the opposing political party as a scapegoat to divert the attention of voters from their own failings. The art of leadership, as displayed by really great popular leaders in all ages, consists in consolidating the attention of the people against a single adversary and taking care that nothing will split up that attention into sections. - Adolph Hitler We can eliminate the ability of office holders to make a career out of civil service by limiting each federal elected office to a single term and guarantee the perpetuation of our representative, democratic Republic."
2,Is America Ready for Barack Obama to be president?,politics," On June 3rd, 2008 Illinois Senator Barack Obama claimed the Democratic presidential nominee, and with this honor Obama become the first black candidate ever nominated by a major political party for the nation's highest office. While breaking this barrier, the question must be asked, is America ready for Obama? Besides the change in policies that Obama represents, his nomination will bring a change in America racially. Is America ready for a black president? Is it conceivable to think that a place where blacks were once enslaved could rise above racial disrimination and elect a black man for president? Will white Americans and even some black Americans really vote for a black man to hold the nations highest position? Or, will he fall victim to the the politically correct population? The people who will smile in your face and say that they will/would vote for a black man because they don't want to be viewed as a racist (or feel that is the right thing to say especially if you are black) but behind close doors know that they will not vote for Obama? The polls are saying that older whites, and non-college educated whites will not vote for Obama; and that Obama's supporters are comprised of black Americans and young white college educated Americans who probably won't go out and actually cast a vote. There are some older white blue collar democrats that supported and voted for Hillary Clinton who have stated they are staunch democrats, always vote for a Democrat but would never vote for Obama. I am specifically pointing out this group of people due to all the coverage this demographic received while the West Virginia primaries occurred. There probably are white collar black and white voters who also feel this way but I am just going to point out what was shown on EVERY single news outlet during the voting. Many white Hillary supporters stated they are willing to sacrifice their political beliefs because they can't bear the thought of having a black man as president regardless if they agree with his views or not. Some even said they didn't think Obama was an American and that he was a Muslim. Now I know the media didn't show everyone they interviewed, like the people who said they would consider Obama and not make a quick judgment and not vote for him, but as usual the media likes to stir things up by showing footage that would get a rise out of their viewers and get under people's skin. That's what they do. You have to be smart enough to decipher what is fact and what is fiction. Just because it's on the news doesn't mean it true. Just like with the polls. One minute Obama is blowing McCain out of the water then a few hours later or a channel change they are saying they are neck and neck, or McCain is ahead. The media is saying to you if you don't like these numbers you better make sure you get out and vote if you want your candidate to win. Don't feel comfortable if your candidate is ahead in these polls, the numbers we are hearing now don't matter, what matters is the final number on election day. So regardless of who you like you must get out and vote because EVERY vote DOES count! I wonder if America is truly ready for Obama (or any other black candidate) because some news outlets, and on some specific news stations, the media is making the 2008 election a race issue. They constantly want to break everything up into black Americans feel this way, white Americans feel that way, Hispanic Americans feel that way, etc. Why isn't it Americans feel this way. Regardless of one's race, deep down we all want the same basic necessities; health care, education for our children, stable economy, affordable housing, a government we can believe and trust in, etc. These hopes are not defined by ones color so the media should not use race when speaking of Obama. He is not only a black man (actually he is part white too), his race is a small part of who he is. It's ironic that they always use black when describing him, when he wasn't even raised by black people and his mother was white. I would think he would relate more to whites because that is who raised him and who he grew up with. But, this takes us back to the one drop rule, if you have one drop of black blood you are black. The media shouldn't always bring up Obama's race. Discuss his issues and not his color, or absentee father. They never say older Americans feel this way, or veterans feel this way when speaking of McCain.  Speaking of that why is it they always bring up McCain being a POW? Is (or isn't he) more than that? The issues should be what this election is all about. On some stations anchors are still harboring on the issue of Rev. Wright. This can be seen on The View, whenever the topic of Obama and his issues comes up Elisabeth Hasselbeck always reverts back to Obamas association to the Reverend. Lets move forward and decide if we want to vote for Obama based on his views, and voting history and what he will bring to the oval office. Now if you don't want to vote for Obama because you don't agree with his message and desire of change, or you feel he doesn't have enough experience, that is fine; but to not vote for him because of the color of his skin, takes us back to a problem that unfortunately in America won't go away - the issue of race. In the United States, race and racism is something we can't escape from. Why, I don't know. Maybe if Obama is elected President the lines of communication will open and racism will take a bold step into being non-existent. (I doubt it, but anything is possible-look there IS a black man who has a good chance of being the president, so never say never.) Other nations see the idea of the United States having a black president as something positive but here in the United States that idea is unthinkable to many. Some members of the KKK and other hate groups have stated that their membership is on the rise due to the thought of having a black man as the president of the United States. Race to many is more important than the issues, and speaking of issues what does Obama really stand for? Do you believe the hype? Will he really be able to make a change that his entire platform consist of? Personally, I feel that regardless of who is elected President there is only so much that can REALISTICALLY be done. The President can hope for things to change and try to make changes, but without support from Congress not much can really happen. Change is something that most people are uncomfortable with, even something as small as a change in a hairstyle can become a big deal. It going to be interesting to see what will happen if there is a change in color of the next president or a drastic change in policies. It's refreshing and promising to hear that someone is trying to lead the country in a new direction, but it frightens me to think of what will become of the person hoping to implement so many changes in such a short amount of time. It takes me back to other men (Martin Luther King, JFK, Lincoln, RFK) who tried to make changes and were assassinated because of their desire to make things different, not necessarily better, but different. (Depending on who you are, you and you alone will know if the change was for the better.) Well what do you think? Is America ready for Obama, and what about you? Are you ready for Obama to be the next president of the Unites States? Be honest and share your thoughts and videos on the message board at isamericareadyforobama.com"
3,The Obama Health Plan,politics," The Democratic National Convention (www.demconvention.com) week officially kicks off today in Denver, Colorado and concludes on August 28, 2008. Delegates from all fifty U.S. states and from American dependencies and territories such as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands attend the convention and cast their votes to choose the Party's presidential candidate. Like the Republican National Convention, the Democratic National Convention marks the formal end of the primary election period and the start of the general election season. While both campaigns and the parties’ gear up for the general election season it is important that we look at all of the candidates health care beliefs and plans for all Americans. Barack Obama’s ""Plan for a Healthy American"" can be downloaded at barackobama.com. Obama’s web site reports ""The U.S. spends $2 trillion on health care every year, and offers the best medical technology and scientific research in the world. Yet, the benefits of the American health care system come at a price that an increasing number of individuals and families, employers and employees, and public and private providers cannot afford."" It goes on to say that, ""Barack Obama believes that protecting and promoting health and wellness in this nation is a shared responsibility among individuals and families, school systems, employers, the medical and public health workforce, and federal, state, and local governments."" Obama breaks his health care reform plan down into three parts saying that it builds ""upon the strengths of the U.S. health care system."" The three parts are: Quality, Affordable & Portable Health Coverage For All Modernizing The U.S. Health Care System To Lower Costs & Improve Quality Promoting Prevention & Strengthening Public Health Will Obama be able to cut health care costs? For that answer we’ll have to wait and see. Why should health care be a big issue during the elections? Because according to U.S. Census Bureau, a substantial increase in the number of seniors will occur during the 2010 to 2030 as the nation’s baby boomers age. By the year 2020, 12 million older Americans will require long-term care services. By 2030, 72 million Americans will be over the age of 65 or one out of every five Americans. As the U.S. population continues to age about 80 percent of seniors have at least one chronic health condition and 50 percent have at least two. Arthritis, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and respiratory disorders are some of the leading health struggles they will face. The baby boomers are also living longer than any generation before them. Studies show that as our population ages, the more services they rely on from the health care industry. The baby boomers; especial the tail end boomers could live to see 100 plus years; health care demands will dramatically increase and put pressure on health care services. So the health care beliefs and plans of the candidates, our next President, are very important. While the cost of health care is out of the ordinary American’s hands we can take control of our own personal medical history. Knowing, tracking and recording your personal medical history is a critical must. Did you know that most states only require your doctors to keep patient records for an average of 5 to 7 years? So what happens to your records when you really need them? What f your doctor retires, changes practices or moves to another state? Do you really want to fit to rebuild your medical and drug history in an emergency? Wouldn’t it be more sensible to prepare now and keep a running record of your medical and drug history, contact numbers for doctors, family and ICE, pharmacies, insurance companies, personal inventory, directives and much more. The MedicMinder provides peace of mind for users – the knowledge that all pertinent medical and drug history is documented in one comprehensive, easy to use system. No second-guessing in an emergency – having this vital information in immediate reach reduces guesswork and stress so often felt during times of medical crisis.

4,Obama Vs Mccain On The Economy,politics," In a previous post, I discussed Obama’s positions on key economic issues. In this post, I will compare and contrast the two candidates on those same economic issues. After reviewing these issues, I am confident that you will conclude that Barack Obama is a friend of working people while John McCain is a friend of big business and the wealthy elite. On labor related issues, Obama supported the Employee Free Choice Act, federal legislation that grants workers the right to join unions free from employer harassment or intimidation. Obama voted in favor of the motion to close debate on the Employee Free Choice Act. McCain not only failed to sponsor this legislation, he voted against the motion to close debate, effectively killing the Employee Free Choice Act. (H.R. 800, Vote #227, 6/26/07) On another labor issue, protecting striking workers, Obama has opposed replacing striking workers with permanent replacements. McCain voted against ending debate on a bill that would prohibit employers from hiring permanent replacements for striking workers (S55, Vote #189, 7/13/94). Finally, in regard to labor issues, Obama has supported raising the minimum wage and indexing it to inflation.  Obama voted in favor of raising the federal minimum wage to $7.25 an hour while McCain voted against increasing the minimum wage (SA.44 to S.256, Vote #26, 3/7/05). On the subject of tax relief for working families, Obama supports a tax credit of $500 per individual or $1,000 per working family. In addition, Obama supports requiring the wealthiest Americans to pay a higher tax rate to finance these tax credits and other federal programs. McCain supports  a summer gas tax holiday in which the federal gas tax and the diesel tax would be suspended. He also supports keeping the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, where the top tax rate was cut from 39.6% to 35.0%, giving the very wealthy a tax windfall. In regard to the so called summer ""tax holiday,"" this proposal has been denounced by Obama as a ""gimmick."" The problem with this proposal is that it has no long term effect. The tax relief is limited and temporary. What happens when summer ends? In addition, a cut in the gas tax, even if temporary, would mean that state governments would lose millions of dollars in federal funding for highway improvements necessary for safety and the reduction of traffic congestion. Another issue of major importance to this year’s presidential campaign is trade. Obama wants to amend the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) so that it benefits American workers by including good labor and environmental standards. McCain is a strong supporter of NAFTA, which the AFL-CIO has stated has cost 1 million American jobs from 1993-2004 (Working Families Vote 2008). McCain has made it clear that he does not support amending NAFTA to create stronger labor and environmental standards. In regard to the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), a free trade agreement that is opposed by the labor movement, Obama voted against it while McCain voted for CAFTA (S.1307, Vote 170, 6/30/05). Finally, in regard to protecting homeownership and cracking down on mortgage fraud, Obama supports the creation of a fund to help homeowners refinance their mortgages. The fund would be paid, in part, from increased penalties levied against lenders who act irresponsibly or commit fraud. Obama has also introduced legislation (Stop Fraud Act) that defines mortgage fraud, increases funding for state and local law enforcement, and increases penalties for mortgage fraud. As for his plan to deal with this problem, McCain said the following: …""there is no substitute for faster economic growth.  No government program is a substitute for the jobs provided by a growing economy."" (Forbes, March 20, 2008) In other words, McCain’s plan is to do nothing for those faced with the loss of their homes or for those who watch while the value of their homes decline. This should hardly come as a surprise to those who may recall that McCain was previously quoted as saying that he did not understand economics."
5,Halt Global Warming by Stopping Fossil Fuel Combustion,politics," After years of warning the world about global warming and its dire consequences, Al Gore, the Nobel Prize winner, has finally taken the next, logical step.  He is proposing a solution. Mr. Gore has realized that conservation measures and ""Cap and Trade"" measures do not work.  The world can be saved only, if we completely eliminate all carbon dioxide emissions during the next forty years. Converting the electric power generating sector first, does make the most sense.  All major technologies for generating electric power from renewable energy sources are in various stages of development.  Installations using wind power, solar energy, geothermal heat, and marine power have been started up and are slowly gaining a measurable foothold. At present, coal fired power plants generate the least expensive electricity.  Therefore, market forces will never lead to the shutdown of the most egregious greenhouse gas emitters.  Only legislative action can prevent the construction of any new, coal fired power plants. We must also be aware that it will be very difficult to satisfy our growing electricity demand by building only windmill farms, solar plantations, and geothermal power plants.  For many years to come, there will not be enough manufacturing capacity to build an adequate number of electric power plants using renewable energies.  Initially, the capital costs of these plants will be high, risks for meeting rated output will be well above average, and elevated maintenance costs will be a common experience. We also need to address a few unresolved technical issues.  The most pressing one is the fact that both wind power and solar power can supply energy only on an interruptible basis.  Electric power is a fleeting commodity and we have not yet developed technologies that are capable of storing large amounts of electric energy. It seems unavoidable that nuclear power generation must assume a more substantial role during the next decades.  Nuclear power has become safer and public resistance to nuclear power plants is slowly receding.  Nuclear power plants can be installed faster once we begin to rely more on standardized reactor designs. Nuclear reactors with smaller capacities need to be built as replacements for coal fired plant boilers.  Huge amounts of capital and much time can be saved if existing coal plants can be retrofitted with steam produced in nuclear reactors to replace coal fired boilers.  Steam turbines, generators, substations, administrative buildings, and cooling towers can continue their operation with only minor performance reductions. This new type of reactor must be designed to be absolutely safe by installing both passive and redundant safety systems.  Retrofit reactors should become available in a very few, standardized designs and in sizes that fit up with the predominant sizes of coal fired boilers in use. While the US will be replacing, retrofitting, or shutting down its fossil fuel fired plants, it is an opportune time to prepare the US to regain its independence from foreign oil imports. Very soon, such activity can save the US more than one trillion dollars annually.  Past experience shows that petroleum prices and consumption of transportation fuels will maintain their unstoppable growths. Ideally, the world will continue using its fleets of cars, trucks, trains, ships, and airplanes.  Ideally, the world will keep its oil refineries operating and will preserve the huge distribution systems that deliver high quality liquid fuels to all corners of the world.  Replacement of transportation fleets, oil refineries, and liquid fuel distribution systems will cost too much and may break the economies of even the richest countries. We must realize that the world cannot live for more than a few weeks without transportation of foods, goods, and commodities.  Famines, riots, and economic upheavals will become unavoidable consequences of the lack of plentiful and affordable transportation fuels. To protect against such looming, economic disasters, the US must take the lead and learn how to produce petroleum substitutes from biomass.  Recent events have taught us that we must never again abuse arable lands to make ethanol or diesel from food crops. Instead, we must find plant species with very high energy contents and must grow these plants on arid and infertile lands.  By using desalinated water and novel industrial farming techniques one can grow enough biomass to supply the entire world with transportation fuels for several centuries.  Arid lands are abundant. Best of all, making petroleum substitutes from renewable biomass sources will not have to cost more than $50 per barrel. Building plants for the domestic production of electric power and of transportation fuels from renewable energies will make the US strategically more secure, will make us economically stronger, will reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by one quarter, will create a huge number of jobs, and will pay for itself by producing large, domestic revenues for many decades to come. The US must lead the world by example.  No other country has the capabilities and the resources to rebuild its energy supply systems."
6,A-Z of Global Warming - Kyoto Protocol,politics," This article is taken from The A-Z of Global Warming deals with the Kyoto Protocol. A major political force which brought global climate change to the fore was born from the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, where an agreement called the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), was agreed. This followed hot on the heals from the release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's ( IPCC ) first report on climate change. The Kyoto Protocol as it became known entered into force on the 16th February 2005 and became the first important step in relation to climate change as governments and countries around the world committed themselves to a binding agreement to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The road to Kyoto was a bumpy one. After agreeing the UNFCCC, governments realised that action had to be taken to set real reduction targets, and so, in 1997, in Kyoto in Japan the parties to the UNFCCC reached agreement on what later became known as The Kyoto Protocol. For the protocol to enter into force it had to become ratified by at least 55 parties to the convention, and incorporating a list of 35 industrialised nations.  These nations together with the EU, accounted for at least 55% of the total of CO2 emissions in 1990. A stalling point came however when the USA, having signed up to the protocol under President Clinton, withdrew from the protocol when President Bush was elected in early 2000. Luckily, the protocol was given a lifeline by Russia, when President Putin ratified the agreement on November 18th 2004. The protocol's main aims required industrialised countries to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gasses by 5% below 1990 levels by 2008-2012. The gasses covered are the 6 main greenhouse gasses, namely; The agreement attempts to do this by providing for various market based mechanisms to assist countries or individual companies meet their respective emission targets. Emissions caps are put on Annex 1 countries, giving each country an emissions quota, or allowable amount of CO2 emissions. So for example the European Union has been given a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8% below 1990 levels. This target can be distributed amongst member states. In general developed Annex 1 countries have to reduce their CO2 emissions, whilst developing non Annex 1 countries have not had to cap their emissions, but instead will participate in CO2 emission reducing projects. There are three basic methods open to countries to meet their targets; Emissions Trading Schemes (ETS) As explained above, these schemes allow for the trading of CO2 emissions for carbon credits. So, if a country or industry exceeds their assigned amount of CO2 emissions, they would be able to purchase credits from a country or industry that has not. Only a small proportion of global emissions are covered by these schemes, and currently the EU has the largest scheme, the EU ETS. Clean Development Mechanisms (CDM) This is a way for Annex 1 countries to earn credits by investing and funding climate friendly projects and technologies in developing countries, thus helping control emissions in these countries. Joint Implementations Projects (JIP) Basically these are the same as CDM's, but with Annex 1 countries investing in climate friendly technology in other Annex 1 countries, rather than other developing countries. Whilst Kyoto is an incredible achievement it is at present the world's only agreement attempting to limit greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. There are problems due to the fact that the USA has not ratified the Protocol, and neither had Australia, until literally 3rd December 2007, following government change. Whist the USA refuses to sign up to the protocol other countries such as India and China, whilst ratifying the Protocol do not have obligations at present to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions on the basis that these countries were not responsible for today's greenhouse gas levels. However, at the rate these countries are developing, they will soon be the World's major polluters as they build more and more fossil-fuelled electricity plants to satisfy their energy needs. Indeed it is believed that in June 2007 China overtook the USA as the world's highest CO2 emitters It is true to say however that instead of the richest countries reducing their emissions by 5% to 1990 levels, they have in fact increased them by some 10%. It is believed that only four countries, UK, France, Germany and Sweden are on track to meet the targets set. Recently the UK announced the introduction of a Climate Change Bill making it the first country to set legally binding targets to reduce its CO2 emissions. The Bill will receive royal ascent in the autumn of 2008, and it will set targets to reduce CO2 emissions by 60% by 2050. What will happen after 2012? Well, UN secretary Ban Ki-moon convened a high level event that took place in New York on 24th September 2007, to promote discussions on ways to move the international community toward negotiations on a new global agreement on climate change. This took place at the UN climate change conference which took place in Bali on 3rd December 2008.  The purpose of discussions will be to try and get in place a multilateral framework for action on climate change, already refered to as Kyoto 2, for the period after the Kyoto agreement ends in 2012. Whist the Kyoto Protocol was a big step in the right direction, it seems that much more needs to be done and far greater cuts made to CO2 emissions to ensure global temperatures do not rise over critical levels.

7,How We Could Solve the Gas Crises Tomorrow,politics," We could solve the gas crises tomorrow! That's right, literally, tomorrow. And no, it's not complicated, not difficult, it doesn't require enormous sacrifice or investment. The average driver, without replacing the car they have, and without changing the miles they drive, could reduce their fuel consumption by 20% simply by driving sanely. When approaching a stop or a turn, take your foot off the gas a block before - if you have never done it, you'll be amazed at how far a car can coast without appreciably slowing.  When accelerating, lightly touch the pedal, don't jump on it.  Take your foot off the gas pedal anytime to slow down, rather than to use the brake, coast down hills and highway ramps.  On the highway, keep a full two second gap between you and the car ahead, so you can drive at a steady pace - most drivers in heavy traffic are continuously braking and re-accelerating, wasting gas.  And perhaps most importantly, most cars have maximum fuel efficiency at 55 to 60 mph.  At speeds above that efficiency falls off precipitously.  At 75 mph you use one third more gas per mile you drive than you do at 55.  Keep your car maintained - clean air filter and fuel filter, fresh oil, and particularly, properly inflated tires are all important elements in improving fuel efficiency. Try it!  You may find that besides saving a bunch of money, that you'll feel good about yourself, good about helping your Nation and helping Planet Earth. Do you really think that the few minutes you might save by driving like a maniac is worth keeping ourselves dependent and beholden to the dictators who control the world's remaining supply of oil?  Is it really worth burning up this precious resource that we are stealing from our children, our grandchildren, and future generations?  Is it really worth polluting the air we breathe, and the atmosphere that regulates the planet's climate? At this time, the world's ability to pump oil out of the ground is just equal to the rate at which the world is burning it up.  Oil prices are determined by a worldwide market.  There are millions of speculators who are betting that the world will continue to burn it up faster, and that supply will not be able to keep up. Fully one quarter of the world supply of oil is consumed in the United States.  If The United States could show the national resolve to reduce gas consumption by even 10%, that would produce an immediate surplus of 2 million barrels of oil a day - within days there would be no place to store that much oil.  Speculators would jump off the oil market like rats off a sinking ship.  The price of a barrel of oil on the world market would Tumble. Of course, reducing gas consumption through driving for fuel efficiency is just a step.  The longer term solution is to trade-in the gas guzzlers for far more efficient vehicles, and eventually, to find the energy source that will replace oil as a fuel. We once had a National leader who resolved to put a man on the moon!  Where is the National leader who will resolve to end our dependence on oil?"
8,The A-Z of Global Warming- Fossil Fuels,politics," This article is taken from The A-Z of Global Warming and discusses fossil fuels. The generation of electricity through burning carbon rich coal has a greater impact on the atmosphere than any other single human activity. In 2003 the power industry created 44.5% of all manmade carbon dioxide (CO2) according to the World Resources Institute, Climate Analysis Indicators Tool (CAIT). If one looks at emissions of carbon dioxide alone (ignoring all other greenhouse gases), then for the year 2000, the figure is just under 33%, and the latest figure available from 2003, as mentioned above shows an increase for this sector to 44.5%. The latest figure however excludes CO2 from land use change.  So what are fossil fuels, and how are they formed? Well fossil fuels form deep in the earth's crust over millions of years from enormous pressure and heat which converts dead plant and animal matter into hydrocarbons in the form of coal, oil or natural gas, which can then be dug up and burnt as fuel. As these fossil fuels have formed over millions of years they are no longer considered to be part of the natural carbon cycle as they have effectively been ""locked up"" within the earth's crust and rocks etc. In 2005 alone some 28 billion tonnes of CO2 was released into the atmosphere, from burning fossil fuels, which is equivalent to around 800 tonnes a second! Out of all the fossil fuels the worst culprit is coal, which is used as the fuel in coal fired electricity power stations for the production of electricity. Generating electricity through carbon rich coal however has a greater impact on the atmosphere than any other single human activity. The power industry produces over twice the amount of CO2 as is produced by the transport sector. Basically electricity generation hasn't changed much from the 19th century with large power plants burning fossil fuels for the creation of electricity, and this model looks set to continue for some time to come. Within the rapidly expanding economies of India and China, coal fired electricity plants will dramatically increase. In fact China, the USA and India are the top three producers in the world. Apart from carbon dioxide, burning coal produces a host of other chemicals, like sulphur dioxide, which causes acid rain, Nitrous oxide and other heavy metals. What makes matters worse is that coal is the world's most widely available fossil fuel and there is almost 200 years of coal left, if it is used at its current rate. This will be pretty academic however as according to the latest report out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climatic Change, if the burning of fossil fuels continue unchanged, the Earth could warm by as much as 6 degrees Celsius (10.8 F)  by 2100. This would mean almost certain extinction of most of life on the earth. One only has to look at pictures from recent news stories showing industrial cities in these developing countries to see the pollution and clouds of smog hanging over the cities and blocking out the sunlight. It is estimated that by the year 2030, 55% of all power stations built in the Asia pacific region will be coal fired. The transport sector in 2000 accounted for around 14% of greenhouse gas emissions, or 20% of CO2 alone (ignoring other greenhouse gases), in 2003. The majority of these emissions are from road transport, with aviation second, followed by shipping and rail last. Emissions from the aviation sector are expected to grow the quickest however. So whilst developed and especially developing nations continue to build power stations to gobble up the Earth's supply of fossil fuels, serious harm is being done to the atmosphere which will continue to elevate global temperatures as higher CO2 levels add to the greenhouse effect. There are in fact enough fossil fuels left to take the world to levels of CO2 concentrations of around 750ppm and above, (around 330 ppm more than present) which would elevate temperatures to such an extent that it would be catastrophic for all of Earth's inhabitants. CO2 as a result of burning fossil fuels is only one of the many greenhouse gases, which is contributing to the warming of the atmosphere. In the next article we will look at Earth's greenhouse gases, which are essential to life on Earth, but which are now warming the planet as their levels steadily increase.

9,David Hulme: Power Plays,politics," In defining what is currently central in politics, it’s become commonplace to repeat a 1992 slogan used in the Clinton-Gore campaign: ""It’s the economy, stupid!"" Created by political strategist James Carville to keep campaign workers focused, the phrase has resurfaced in the run-up to the next U.S. presidential election as ""It’s still the economy, stupid!"" But is it? Would it not be more accurate to say the central issue in so many human problems is the selfish desire for power? Harvard professor Joseph Nye Jr. writes that power is ""the ability to achieve one’s purposes or goals."" Sounds harmless enough. But, he continues, ""the dictionary tells us that it is the ability to do things and to control others."" And that’s where the difficulty so often arises. If what lies behind the purposes, goals and desire to control others is not right and good, human beings can do unspeakable evil to each other. The ""power play"" is something we’re all subject to, we all dislike and, at one time or another, we all try to perpetrate. It begins when we struggle with parents and peers over childhood space, possessions and attention. We demonstrate our ""strength"" however we can to get what we want. While not everyone becomes the spiteful little girl or the schoolyard bully, we all push others out of the way to get our way. As we grow more sophisticated, we learn what it takes to manipulate our parents to achieve our goals, often playing one against the other. This pattern of behavior soon gets translated into the adult world, where power plays are all too familiar. While offensive war is perhaps the ultimate form, there are many more subtle varieties that we might not readily think of. For example, the adage that knowledge is power underlies our willingness to gossip and slander. Here an ancient Hebrew maxim could teach us a thing or two. It said that spreading lies about others, ruining their reputations, was like taking their life away (Leviticus 19:16). Vision.org features several articles that reference abuse of power, power plays, manipulation, and wrongful control of others. The insidiousness of these aspects of human nature becomes very apparent across time. Surprisingly or not, many of them are linked with religion. In a piece on the pharaoh of the Exodus, we explain the power play that the ancient ruler engaged in as he stubbornly refused to let the Hebrews go. The confrontation between the human god and the God of Israel brought terrible results for the Egyptian and his people. In ""The Gospels for the 21st Century,"" we continue with the developing struggle between the Pharisees and Jesus of Nazareth. They had said, ""If we let Him alone like this, everyone will believe in Him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our place and nation"" (John 11:48). Now the confrontation was coming to a head. Part Two of ""The Most Dangerous Book"" focuses on the battle to publish the Bible in English. In its desperate attempt to preserve power over people’s knowledge, the Roman Catholic Church saw to it that those who gave their all to this effort were burned as heretics. That same church was to suffer as Henry VIII turned the tables and curtailed its dominant role in English life, exerting his kingly power in pursuit of a divorce and a male heir. Finally, it would be difficult to deny that all the worst aspects of the human desire for power over others are involved in the tortuous history of Jerusalem. In Part Two of ""City of Faiths,"" we examine the Palestinian perspective. Despite the problems that the drive for human power has caused across human history, there yet remains a power for good that will triumph. The spirit of God is the spirit ""of power and of love and of a sound mind"" (2 Timothy 1:7). It’s the spirit of rightly used power for the good of others."
10,Bad Energy Policies Will Harm World Economies,politics," In 2000 a new US administration drafted a new energy plan.  Two oilmen, with secret advice of the oil industry, orchestrated and supervised the plan.  The results have been devastating.  Gas and oil prices have escalated to more than $4 per gallon and are forecast to hit $5 per gallon soon. The problems our oilmen were trying to solve, were not of their doing.  Their decision, to solve the energy puzzle, was laudable.  Regrettably, they were not equipped to handle the consequences of their actions. In November 2008 the US is reaching another milestone in history. A new president and a new Congress will be elected. Energy is becoming one of the main issues of the hotly contested election campaign.  We already know one outcome for sure.  Neither candidate has any idea about the seriousness of the energy problems confronting our country and the world. The US needs swift and effective actions to stabilize world energy prices, to introduce measures for dealing with global warming and climate change, and to turn around an economy that has been looted by its financial sector.  How can the US take the lead in fighting global warming?  How can the US send the right signals to the rest of the world?  How can the US convince the owners of the world's oil reserves that coercive price fixing is breeding resentment? The US does not possess a single weapon to force its intentions upon others.  It can do so only by the quality of her ideas. Owners of coal, petroleum, and natural gas reserves will only change, if they have to face risks.  These new risks could be: The near-future threat of a low priced petroleum substitute, The threat of subsidized renewable energies for the generation of low cost electricity, The threat of a treaty that will outlaw fossil fuel burning across the world. When these threats become reality, we will see a rush to sell as many energy reserves as quickly as possible. Without these threats the decision process is much simpler.  Sell as little energy as possible and wait for prices to rise.  The longer you wait, the more money you make. Obviously, it will take time to convert fossil fuel fired power plants to plants that are powered by renewable energies like solar power, hydropower, wind power, marine power, geothermal heat, and nuclear heat. Obviously, it will take time to produce the first barrel of a high quality petroleum substitute from fast growing plants that have no resemblance to food crops and can be grown on arid lands. Obviously, it will take even longer to convince 200 countries to sign a treaty that forbids the use of fossil fuels. But what choices do the US and the world have? We cannot continue and emit huge amounts of greenhouse gases much longer. The environmental costs are beginning to escalate. Citizens across the world will demand actions from governments. Countries with large coastal areas are already experiencing the accelerating rise of ocean levels.  This rise will speed up in lockstep with greenhouse gas emissions.  Once carbon dioxide, the major product of fossil fuel combustion, enters the atmosphere, it cannot be recaptured.  The accumulation of carbon dioxide is irreversible and the accelerated melting of glaciers on mountains and of ice sheets in the Polar Regions is unstoppable. Therefore, we must halt atmospheric accumulation of greenhouse gases.  Temporarily, we can sequester about one third of all fossil fuel generated emissions.  The carbon dioxide emitted by large smokestacks of coal fired power plants, oil refinery and chemical plant chimneys, and from flues of manufacturing companies making materials, industrial products, and consumer goods can be cleaned.  The separated carbon dioxide gas must be compressed and transported to suited geological underground cavities. This method cannot be applied to the exhausts of automobiles, trucks, trains, ships, and airplanes.  Sequestration is unaffordable for homes, commercial buildings, and small manufacturing and fabricating establishments. The challenges for the new administration and the new Congress to come up with a good, effective energy plan will be intimidating.  Drilling for oil in the US, energy conservation, and ""Cap and Trade"" schemes will not solve our energy problems.  Conservation may be necessary to provide temporary relief at the pump.  Unavoidable future environmental disasters may be delayed by a couple of years.  None of the three concepts can stop global overheating. We must bite the bullet.  We must replace all fossil fuels with renewable energies and nuclear heat.  To operate our transportation sector, we need liquid fuels.  We must learn to produce petroleum substitutes.  Petroleum reserves and production capacities are getting tight and prices are skyrocketing.  We must wake up.  We cannot continue and let the present owners of fossil fuels destroy the habitats of our grandchildren and their offspring."
11,Cow Farts kill Babies,politics," Don’t reset your browser. I said that. I really did. Deal with it. Now are you ready for the next sentence? Meat is bad. OMG did I say that? I friggin love meat, how can I say that? Well, I’ve been reading, and I’m not too thrilled with the livestock industry after finding out some pretty horrendous things. Now, first of all I ain’t gonna pretend that I don’t eat meat. I eat burgers like a good American. I eat chicken and pork too.. I do. So now you know. I admit it. But I am honestly scared. The livestock industry has been buying politicians for so long that it is by far one of the most unwatched industries, and, BTW, the largest contributor to global warming. Why? Cows fart dude. Straight up. Figure every cow farts a dozen or so times a day, times that by 1000’s of cows and that’s an ass load of methane. (get it?) Not too mention all the poo. Seriously though. The livestock rearing industry contributes to global warming annually more than twice as much as the next culprit. Transportation. That’s right. We need Hybrid Cows now too!! The main reason for this is that the livestock industry creates a great deal of Nitrous Oxide and Methane (from the farts) which are all stronger greenhouse gasses than carbon. Don’t believe me? Ever stand in the middle of a bunch of cows? Breathe in? You get the point. On top of that livestock contribute 64 of the earth’s total surface area for grazing. Let that sink in. Picture almost 1/3 of America as grazing area. That’s a lot of land. That’s not even touching the amount of land needed to raise crops for feeding livestock. And when you add that to the fact that the land they graze on gets severely degraded after they graze that most of the time they become fallow. Leading to desertification in many places like Africa and the American West. 70% of rainforest destruction is so livestock can be reared. Add that together and the livestock industry has had and continues to have an extreme effect on Global warming. How has this happened? The automotive industry is regulated more and more (as they should be) every year. Every industry now is under the magnifying glass. We have finally gotten to a point where industry is being held accountable for their pollution and what not. How has the world’s biggest environmental problem gone unnoticed all this time? It would seem to me that BIG CATTLE is paying our politicians more money than even BIG OIL. That can be the only answer. Even now, recently the government decided it would be a good idea to open up previously protected rangeland for grazing because the ranchers aren’t making enough money because food is expensive for livestock. Talk about fighting fire with fire. That’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve heard and if I were to be in a room with whoever signed that agreement……well let’s just say I’d probably go to jail for what I would do to them. All this….and wait…..there’s more!!! Oh yes!! Guess what else the livestock industry is doing? They are pumping us full of chemicals, and hormones and antibiotics with every bite of that porterhouse. The living conditions on most meat processing facilities are so bad that to keep the cows from getting sick they feed them steady and continuous doses of antibiotics. The same antibiotics we might need when we are sick. But they won’t get us better because our bodies build immunities to them and we are eating them every day in our whoppers. Along with growth hormones and other chemicals that probably cause cancer since everything causes cancer. And we worry so much about getting people to quit smoking…..probably save more lives if we all stopped eating meat and bought us some lucky strikes. If you’re anything like me at this point your not just surprised. You’re pissed off. I was. I couldn’t believe the things I was reading about how things are done and what we are ingesting. The groundwater pollution alone could get us all very sick. If you’re anything like me you’re also saying….""Dave, I hear ya, but I can’t stop eating meat."" Yeah, me neither. I am far too skinny already to be able to cut out meat….plus….I’m sorry….I like it. But now, with every burger I eat, I am scared at what I’m eating and how badly I am contributing to this little problem we have with destroying the earth. There are some things we can do and some things others are doing to help. There is a plant in Michigan that is making cattle feed out of soybean mash. That’s a relatively low impact crop as compared to grains and corn. In lay mans terms you get more in smaller areas of cropland. That’s a step in the right direction. There is another facility in Kansas I think that takes waste from a chicken ranch and processing facility and turns it into fuel that they sell back to the processing facility. That’s a great step. But perhaps the biggest steps need to be taken by us. You and I. Well, hopefully more than that but you get the idea. It’s not about eliminating meat from your lives because for many that might not be possible or healthy. It’s about reducing it a bit for sure. But it’s more about education. Know where your meat is coming from and choose wisely. There are ranchers that do things the right way. For the most part buying organically raised meat can be an improvement. Anything that is given the ""organic"" tag is at least run in a sustainable environment so that can go a ways in reducing the impact your steak has. Also, look into other sources of meats like the Buffalo. There are a few buffalo ranches in the US that provide very good meat with less environmental damage being done because of the nature of the Buffalo and what they eat in comparison to what other livestock eat. Many people just think buying local will help, but it won’t help much if your local rancher sucks so you need to look into the local livestock scene first. One thing that I can do and have done that was very easy was to eliminate almost entirely fast food meats from my life. You can be sure that the meat you get at places like that is not coming from responsibly run ranches. It’s pumped full of hormones and sugars that don’t belong in meat and it’s worse for you than just about anything else you could eat. I have all but eliminated from my diet and if and when I do have to, I usually feel like crap afterwards. Proof positive that there is something in the meat that isn’t good. For anyone or anything. In closing, I would like to really thank all the vegetarians out there. I wish I could do it. I really think that if we all were vegetarians that it would be a great way to improve our planet’s health and put a halt to global warming. One thing that really needs to happen is that we all let our politicians know that we know what they know about the livestock industry and that we are pissed off. We need as much regulation or more than the automotive industry is getting. How the few that control what we eat have gotten away with so much I don’t know. But now that we do know, we need to do something about it. Tell your friends, and family. Write to your congressman, write to your local ranchers, and tell them to clean up their act or your going all broccoli on their ass. Reduce you meat consumption, eat only organic raised meats, never, ever again go to McDonalds, and tell someone else to do the same. Reduce the demand reduce the problem."
12,John McCain Might Be A Compelling And Competitive Candidate For A Couple Of Reasons.,politics," Not because his campaign managers sends out a link for a strategy briefing. If his campaign manager didn't realize that the economy and the war were the two biggest issues then he would clearly be the dumbest campaign manager around. John McCain: Arizona senator has warned that any pullout of troops could be disastrous. He has pushed the president to send in a heavy wave of troops to quell the violence and establish order. John McCain (R-AZ), a leading candidate for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination, has been one of the key congressional supporters of the interventionist foreign policies of the George W. In early April 2007, after taking what the Washington Post described as a ""heavily guarded walk through a newly fortified Baghdad market,"" McCain gushed about the progress in Iraq since the president's ""surge"" strategy began to be implemented earlier in the year.
He will make the Bush income and investment tax cuts permanent, keeping income tax rates at their current level."". John McCain may be trying to sell himself as a ""maverick"" and a ""straight talker"" who will tell the truth no matter the consequences, but independent, non-partisan watchdog groups aren't buying it. Since Senator McCain wrapped up his Party's nomination, hardly a week has passed without at least one non-partisan fact checker criticizing McCain for distorting his record on something. John McCain does a photo-op in front of a wind mill factory and he's all of a sudden Mr.Green. Our scum leaders are willing to bury our country in debt to get their hands on oil.
John McCain : I've been in politics for over 20 years. And for over 20 years, I've had Barbera Streisand trying to do my job. He is a maverick and a moderate. If a maverick is defined as a person who goes against the grain and is willing to take risks, particularly political ones, he isn't it. John McCain is respectable, and while I certainly commend his stands against issues such as torture and farm subsidies, he has become just another politician who sold his soul for votes. McCain-Fiengold, Immigration reform, Iraq he's on the wrong side of too many issues for me to support him, and some of those stands seem to be motivated by political expedience rather than a grounded moral conviction.
He believes the Internet offers tremendous promise in terms of freedom of expression, information sharing, and the spread of knowledge and commerce . However, there is a darker side to the Internet. John McCain should reject and denounce his pastor Rod Parsley just like he did in case of his other pastor John Hagee. Anybody who wants to destroy Islam is actually trying to destroy the God of Prophet Abraham. John McCain, Gramm may be looking at a quantum leap in power and influence.
Someone should ask McCain how long he's willing to have us stay in Iraq even if we are sustaining casualties. Since he believes it is in our strategic interests to stay there on a permanent basis I doubt very much he'll say that in that case he'd only be comfortable staying two or five or some other relatively short span of years. Someone told me the bug has been corrected. Someone who could become a very good president in his ability to not always conform to the party line. Unlike Obama, who always stays strictly democratic and is an extreme liberal.

13,Religious Terrorism,politics," Acts of terrorism are not confined to Muslims alone. Terrorists come from every religion. But the media often uses the term Islamic terrorists or Islamic terrorism, implying terrorism is associated with Islam. It is our duty as American Muslims to present the true picture of Islam, which is that Islam does not teach terrorism under any circumstances. It forbids killing of innocent civilians. The holy Book of Islam, the Quran, says: ""If anyone murders an innocent person ... it will be as if he had murdered the whole of humanity."" So, who are the Muslims who commit such heinous acts in the name of Islam? It is obvious from the above injunction of the Quran that they do not followtrue Islam. Therefore, they must be driven not by Islam but some other desire (such as hate or revenge) to commit acts of terrorism. Muslims around the world greet (or are supposed to greet) each other, and others, using the Arabic words, ""Assalamu ‘Alaikum"" which means: ""peace beunto you."" There is no doubt that some Muslims, while using such a benevolent greeting, carry malevolent intentions in their hearts. The holy Book of Islam,the Quran, condemns such people by saying: ""Why do you say that which you do not practice?"" Such Muslims, therefore, do not represent Islam. Islam hasnothing to do with those who commit acts of terrorism. Therefore, it is wise to differentiate Muslims and Islam. Just as acts of terrorism committed by Christians cannot be attributed to Christianity, acts of terrorism committed by Muslims must not be attributed to Islam or its teachings. There is a popular feeling in the West, and justifiably so, that Islam is a very oppressive and retrogressive religion. But this is based on a wrong perception of Islam, unfortunately, due to the practice of Islam by some countries. Do these countries practice Islam as they profess they do? The Quran, (unequivocallyand unconditionally) says: ""There is no compulsion in religion."" However, we see all kinds of compulsion in these countries. People in these countries are deprived of most of their basic human rights. They are afraid to express opinions in public against the government's practice of Islam for fear of persecution. How can these countries claim to be practicing Islam when they violate its basic principle of compassion and tolerance? They practice ""Rajm"" (stoning to death) for adultery, although there is no such thing in the Quran. Their rulers invoke God's compassion, mercy and forgiveness. But theyshow very little or none at all themselves."
14,Securing Energy Independence for the USA,politics," Crude oil prices have reached $140.  The US dollar has lost hugely against the Euro and the Canadian dollar.  Petroleum prices will continue their unstoppable surge, which is driven by steadily increasing demand, Wall Street speculation, and OPEC refusal to meet demand. Present and previous US administrations have made no serious efforts to develop effective countermeasures.  The attempt of the Bush administration to gain control of oil in the Middle East has failed.  Highly subsidized US ethanol production from corn has not made a dent in petroleum demand, but has led to a huge rise in worldwide grain and food prices. Instead, the administration and many politicians are demanding energy conservation and a failing ""Cap and Trade"" permit system.  Drilling for oil in Alaska and offshore is another request by oil lobbyists. Countermeasures have not contributed anything to produce supplies.  However, ill conceived solutions have made many politically connected people very rich.  Greed has trumped patriotism! For more than twenty years, politicians, industry, media, and citizens are discussing the issue of oil imports and their pernicious effects on the US economy.  In May 2008 the US imported 14.2 million barrels of crude oil per day.  At $140 per barrel the USA gives away roughly $2 billion every single day to foreign nations!  In addition, a substantial amount of refined fuels is imported.  This means that the US is approaching a shameful threshold, when it pays $1 trillion dollars for foreign fuel imports annually.  These huge funds could do wonders for the US economy, if they would be spent on energy supplies produced by our own industry, inside the US. The US has a severe energy problem.  It possesses huge reserves of coal and oil shale.  However, coal, oil, and natural gas emit large amounts of greenhouse gases when burned.  Fossil fuel combustion is the cause of global warming.  We cannot dare to continue the continuing the use of fossil fuels for more than a couple of decades.  Otherwise, too much carbon dioxide will accumulate in the Earth's atmosphere and will lead to an acceleration of global warming.  Global warming is responsible for climate change and for mounting damages to nature, worldwide assets, and people.  Melting of glaciers and ice in the Polar Regions is already a growing and unstoppable threat. Electricity and liquid transportation fuels are the lifeblood of our economies.  Economic growth is not possible without plentiful, affordable, and secure energy supplies.  Economies will fail when supplies of petroleum become scarce, when global warming keeps inflicting damages, and when petroleum prices keep continuing their skyward move. Are there any solutions that can be developed and implemented before petroleum is depleted and before global warming exceeds the 3 to 4 degree Celsius global warming threshold? Fortunately, there are many alternate approaches for generating electricity that will not emit greenhouse gases. Surprisingly, there seems to be only one single concept, which has the potential to produce sufficient substitute supplies of liquid transportation fuels.  This concept is the conversion of biomass into liquid petroleum substitutes.  Unfortunately, early in 2008, this concept has been discredited by the ill conceived production of fuel ethanol from food crops. Conversion of biomass into fuel is the one and only option, which we may be able to develop to maturity in the next thirty years.  We must learn how to use sunlight, water, carbon dioxide, and fertilizer and convert them into biomass.  Categorically, food crops are not suited for conversion into fuels.  Food crops have been selected, domesticated, and bred to provide storable, tasty, and nutritious foods.  Energy crops must be selected based on entirely different properties.  Energy crops must have very high energy content, must provide very high crop yields, and must grow very fast.  This means that we must find and further breed plants with very high energy yields; i.e. plants with the highest production of energy per acre per year. Nature has been converting sunlight into biomass for millions of years.  In fact, the Earth's generous fossil fuel reserves are nothing else but biomass converted into coal, petroleum, and natural gas.  All we have to do is to imitate nature's example.  Obviously, there must be a major obstacle.  We do not know exactly which processes nature used to make petroleum.  And we have a major handicap to overcome.  We are allowed only hours for conversion.  Nature may have taken her time and may have used thousands or even millions of years for the same conversion. We have learned the hard way that the conversion of food crops into liquid fuels creates market forces, which cannot be controlled unless the world installs huge regulatory bureaucracies.  Instead, we must use a concept for producing petroleum substitutes that cannot be manipulated. Most sunshine reaches Earth near the equator in tropical and sub-tropical regions.  Numerous arid regions, without sufficient precipitation, are located in these lands, too.  By placing large, industrial scale biomass plantations into these areas, we prevent the abuse of fertile lands for food production.  We can also prevent the further deforestation of rain forests and the abuse of other, primeval lands. Water is the commodity that is missing in these areas.  Lack of water is the reason these lands are arid.  Therefore, we must use seawater and use heat from the sun to produce desalinated freshwater. Finally, the US must establish an autonomous agency with the mission, program, and budget to make the US independent of foreign oil imports!  The energy industry does not have the means and incentives."
15,Is It Intelligent To Outsource Intelligence?,politics," Another reality in the post-9/11 growth of intelligence analysis capability is outsourcing. We have outsourced the management of billlion-dollar technical collection programs, and we have contracted intelligence analysts. The National Reconnaissance Office is a lot more than an office; may have the largest budget of all the U.S. intelligence agencies. It may also be the best example of how U.S. government contractors, i.e., private industry, are taking over the government and costing us needless billions of dollars. The NRO buys spy satellites. Over the course of the last ten years, much of its government employee expertise has largely been eliminated by swapping career experts out for military personnel rotated in for a few years. Instead of having an Air Force officer who worked on satellites for ten or fifteen years making decisions, the NRO began bringing in officers on two- and three-year assignments. Someone who was procuring tires last year would be procuring satellite component systems this year. The result was that the big aerospace contractors gained greater influence in the decision making, not only because they were the only ones left with expertise, but also because the NRO decided to transfer much of its own program management responsibility to a single, big contractor. Simultaneously with handing off management responsibility to the contractor, in the late 1990s and the first five years of this decade, the NRO and the aerospace industry were planning to spend scores of billions of dollars on a new generation of spy satellites with even more marvelous capabilities. The winning contractor was Boeing, which set about to build billions of dollars' worth of new spy satellites with incremental capabilities under the project named Future Imagery Architecture, or FlA. The costs escalated, the delivery dates slipped by years, but the NRO kept going. Eventually, presented with ever bigger bills and ever later schedules, the NRO canceled FIA under congressional pressure. Billions of dollars had been wasted.38 These costly new spacecraft were to be built not so much because we needed to use their capabilities, but rather because if we spent the money, we would keep the industrial base alive by ordering newer and better satellites. It became a perpetual motion machine: constantly building slightly more capable satellites at ever-increasing cost, spending more on research to develop more capabilities, even though those capabilities did not address important intelligence collection needs. I was part of that cycle thirty years ago when, during my one year as an employee at a defense contractor, I was told by the NRO that it had developed a new capability that could lead to a new satellite. My job, at the NRO's request, was to come up with some problem on which we could use the new technology. In other words, I was to figure out the need that the new satellite would meet, the requirement. This same backwards process (first developing the technology and then figuring out why we need it) has been going on for decades. After you can see really small objects, after you have a synthetic aperture radar satellite that can take pictures at night, after you can pick up any signal released in the radio spectrum, what more do you really need? When most of the world's communication is moving from electrons passing through the air to photons in fiber-optic cables, when commercial imaging satellites allow private companies to sell reconnaissance imagery, should we perhaps consider spending less on satellites, rather than more? Maybe what we do need is more numerous, less expensive spy satellites, capable of being quickly launched in a crisis to augment existing satellites or to replace satellites that may fail or be destroyed. Although the nation's spy satellite agency is not planning to do that, another part of the Defense Department is. In addition to the costly satellites of NRO, the Air Force is planning to build the cheaper, more quickly launched birds as part of an additional program. We do need to maintain an industrial base with the expertise to innovate intelligence platforms in space, but what we have done is destroy career government expertise and hand the keys to an agency over to giant contractors. These companies have so much congressional influence that feeding the beast becomes the requirement, rather than collecting intelligence we need at a reasonable cost, so that available funds can also be spent on other needs. In the area of analysis, the number of contractors also grew. Not satisfied with doubling the number of analysts at the CIA, the intelligence community wanted access to even more staff. The intelligence community turned to the private sector, or at least privately owned companies. Many of the companies involved, such as Lockheed Martin, earn almost all of their money by selling to governments. Others, such as Booz Allen Hamilton, also have a commercial line of business. The companies are consultancies, weapons manufacturers, software developers, and IT support firms. What they now have in common is that they have established intelligence analysis staffs that are on contract to support various intelligence agencies. A drive around northern Virginia reveals the many newly constructed high-rises in which private companies employ intelligence analysts to do the work that was formerly done only by government employees. Inside the buildings, in highly secured suites, analysts with top secret clearances write intelligence analyses for the CIA, DIA, and other agencies. Often the analyses are only slightly edited by government employees before being sent off to policy makers. A former government official told me that the initial draft of one National Intelligence Estimate was reportedly written by an analyst who was not a government employee; it was allegedly revised only slightly by the government. When an analysis is done by a contractor, the corporate logo is usually replaced by CIA letterhead and the policy maker is often unaware that the CIA did not really produce the analysis; a for-profit corporation did. The private intelligence officers are not just in the corporate high-rises. Many work ""on site,"" meaning they go to the intelligence agencies and work alongside government counterparts doing similar work. As Sebastian Abbot, a former student of mine at Harvard and now with the Associated Press, reported, ""That has led to a phenomenon known as 'butss in seats' -- contractors literally sit beside their public sector counterparts and perform equivalent tasks. According to [former CIA official John] Gannon, 'Butts in seats within the analytic community . . . is really a post-9/11 phenomenon, for the most part.' John Brennan, former acting Director of the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) and currently President and CEO of TAC, says more than half of the 200 analysts at the NCTC were from the private sector while he was there . . . the vast majority of Booz Allen's intelligence work is not classic management consulting, but simply providing. 'butts in seats' to the intelligence community.""39 One colleague of mine being given a tour of the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) expressed surprise at the number of people working there and was told that ""most of them are contractors."" He could have been told the same at the intelligence analysis division at Homeland Security or many other agencies in and around Washington. R. J. Hillhouse has made it her preoccupation to track intelligence outsourcing. She writes, ""For all practical purposes, effective control of the NSA is with private corporations, which run its support and management functions . . . more than 70 percent of the staff of the Pentagon's newest intelligence unit, CIFA (Counterintelligence Field Activity), is made up of corporate contractors. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) lawyers revealed at a conference in May that contractors make up 51 percent of the staff in DIA offices. At the CIA, the situation is similar. Between 50 and 60 percent of the workforce of the CIA's most important directorate, the National Clandestine Service (NCS), responsible for the gathering of human intelligence, is composed of employees of for-profit corporations.""40 The head of one private intelligence analysis program proudly told me that the hundreds of analysts in his division average many more years of experience than do the young analysts now at CIA. Why have these experienced staff left the government to do essentially the same jobs in a privately owned company? The popular assumption is that the pay is better. For the corporate vice presidents and partners, that is the case. They have almost all been senior officials in intelligence agencies for twenty years or more, ""retired"" to collect their federal pension, and are now also being paid by their new private sector employer, often more than twice their previous federal salary. For the typical analyst, however, the private salary is about the same as what he or she would be paid ""on the inside."" The analysts I have spoken with say they prefer the corporate environment because ""it's just run better"" or ""there is less bureaucratic chickenshit."" Their supervisors all seem to agree that they have ""more time to focus on the issues"" and ""more ability to select only really good staff and an easier time getting rid of the ones who don't work out."" But does it cost more money than if the government's work were done by government employees? Some studies show that a contract for a given number of analysts' time is more expensive than paying a similar number of government employees. The contractors, however, cry foul and note that in an ""all-in"" comparison including the support costs (IT systems, buildings, and other overhead), the cost of private analysts is about the same. There is, however, a profit margin associated with the contracts. The hefty bonuses given senior officials in the contractor firms, along with the publicly reported profitability, are costs that would nor have been accrued had the jobs been done in-house, in the government agencies. Cost, however, is not the determining factor in the outsourcing boom. Ease of execution is probably the driving consideration. After 9/11, when money flowed quickly and in large sums to intelligence agencies, it was the path of least resistance to simply sign contracts rather than to rebuild the intelligence community in a thoughtful way with a long-term strategic plan.41 Senior intelligence managers have found it easier and quicker to turn to private companies to hire and house staff than to fix their own agencies' hiring systems. The problems of hiring and firing civil servants that are often given as a justification for outsourcing really do not hold. Intelligence agency personnel are exempted from normal civil service personnel rules. They could be paid more than other government employees. They can quickly be fired without cause anytime an agency believes they are doing substandard work or their expertise is no longer in demand. The government could easily rent office space for more analysts. It was just easier for an intelligence agency manager to have a contractor do it all. The result of all those many decisions to take the easy way out and sign contracts is that we have created a two-tier system for intelligence analysis. For now, at least, the more experienced analysts are often in profit-making firms, aspiring to be among the ranks of their highly paid bosses someday. And their highly paid bosses are motivated to persuade the intelligence agencies, where they once worked, of the continued need for their contracts. And many of the bosses in the intelligence agencies are thinking about what they will do when they have worked twenty years and can begin pulling down a government pension. Given those dynamics, it is unlikely that the post-9/11 boom in intelligence analysis outsourcing will be reversed anytime soon. The CIA did, however, promise in 2007 that there would be a 10 percent cut in outsourcing soon.42 It will, of course, be difficult to know if that really happens. What is more likely to happen is that the dramatic growth in the intelligence community budget will slow and the budget may even have to retract, given overall federal fiscal realities. When cuts have to be made, based on past tendencies, the agency managers will cut their contracts before they reduce their own staffs and other activities. What we may then discover is that many of the best analysts we had, those with institutional memories, are no longer working on the important problems.

16,What Do Navy SEALs Do When They Retire?,politics," The U.S. Navy SEALs, or the United States Navy Sea, Air, and Land Forces, are the U.S. Navy’s elite Special Operations Forces. They conduct clandestine operations from the sea, air, and land. Navy SEALs are considered silent professionals who have acquired razor-sharp precision and are known to possess unbending standards coupled with uncompromising loyalty and sense of teamwork. Counterterrorism operations, direct action operations, unconventional warfare, and special reconnaissance are just a few of the missions included in their career as Navy SEALs. Navy SEALs are subjected to training in a wide diversity of environments and on a great variety of fields. Each setting and mission requires them to employ special procedures, tactics, and techniques. Physically, emotionally, mentally, psychologically, the Navy SEALs are molded to face any task thrown at them on a mission. Hence, even after their Navy SEALs careers, they easily adapt to the civilian world of employment. The following are the most common jobs that ex-Navy SEALs men are known to be employed at: o Business and Business Administration — Ex-Navy SEALs make good financial administrators, human resources specialists, security administrators, social science specialists and the like. Aside from being capable of running their own businesses, ex-Navy SEALs are able to administer, supervise, monitor, and perform professional management services vital in an organization’s operation, something they have learned to do in the Navy. o Health Care — From physicians to dentists, health scientist to health system administrator, physical therapist to occupational therapist, ex-Navy SEALs do not find it hard to get employment within these areas. Ex-Navy SEALs find it easy to be driven by the goal of providing high standards when it comes to medical care. Like their Navy SEALs training, they find it motivating and challenging to answer the needs of patients with various medical problems requiring medical management and creativity. o Architecture/Engineering/Technical Support — From civil, electrical, to environmental engineering jobs, architectural jobs, and other technical support jobs, ex-Navy SEALs are able to show excellence in this area that requires the application of general knowledge of mathematics and physical science. These kind of jobs may entail planning, designing, constructing, and maintaining structures and facilities that may be use for shelter, transportation, and so on and so forth. o Trades and Specialized Skilled Occupations — This category can include various occupations like fire protection and prevention specialist, maintenance mechanic, rehabilitation specialist, chef, electrician, and a whole lot more. These jobs require professional knowledge and abilities for full performance, something that ex-Navy SEALs have been equipped with during their training and in their navy career. Whatever the job title, every position that ex-Navy SEALs seek after their navy career speaks of compassion, energy, and commitment. And like their SEALs career, they find these jobs professionally rewarding and emotionally satisfying."
17,No Agony of Defeat for Hillary Clinton,politics," On June 7, 2008, Senator Hillary Clinton made history. I knew it as I watched her deliver her exit speech before 2,000 supporters at Washington's National Building Museum. She wasn't just endorsing presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Senator Barack Obama; she was leading by example. In her speech, she exemplified how to be gracious in the face of defeat. She did not take ""no"" for failure. She remained ambitious, confident, and strong. There is much the entrepreneurial woman can learn from Senator Clinton, including the following 10 lessons about facing so-called defeat: ""Well, this isn't exactly the party I'd planned, but I sure like the company."" ""I want to start today by saying how grateful I am to all of you - to everyone who poured your hearts and your hopes into this campaign, who drove for miles and lined the streets waving homemade signs, who scrimped and saved to raise money, who knocked on doors and made calls, who talked and sometimes argued with your friends and neighbors, who emailed and contributed online, who invested so much in our common enterprise, to the moms and dads who came to our events, who lifted their little girls and little boys on their shoulders and whispered in their ears, 'See, you can be anything you want to be.'"" ""To all those who voted for me, and to whom I pledged my utmost, my commitment to you and to the progress we seek is unyielding . . . I will continue to stand strong with you, every time, every place, and every way that I can. The dreams we share are worth fighting for."" ""I entered this race because I have an old-fashioned conviction: that public service is about helping people solve their problems and live their dreams. I've had every opportunity and blessing in my own life - and I want the same for all Americans. Until that day comes, you will always find me on the front lines of democracy - fighting for the future."" ""The way to continue our fight now - to accomplish the goals for which we stand - is to take our energy, our passion, our strength and do all we can to help elect Barack Obama the next President of the United States."" ""The Democratic Party is a family, and it's now time to restore the ties that bind us together and to come together around the ideals we share, the values we cherish, and the country we love."" ""I ran as a daughter who benefited from opportunities my mother never dreamed of. I ran as a mother who worries about my daughter's future and a mother who wants to lead all children to brighter tomorrows."" ""Always aim high, work hard, and care deeply about what you believe in. When you stumble, keep faith. When you're knocked down, get right back up. And never listen to anyone who says you can't or shouldn't go on."" ""Although we weren't able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you, it's got about 18 million cracks in it. And the light is shining through like never before, filling us all with the hope and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time. That has always been the history of progress in America."" ""So I want to say to my supporters, when you hear people saying - or think to yourself - 'if only' or 'what if,' I say, 'Please don't go there.' Every moment wasted looking back keeps us from moving forward. Life is too short, time is too precious, and the stakes are too high to dwell on what might have been."" Love her or hate her, Senator Clinton holds a vision for the future and keeps her eye on the mark. No moss will ever grow under her feet. Instead, she counts her blessings and moves on. She considers failure as nothing more than a stepping-stone toward success. She is resilient and determined, she never gives up, and she knows who she is. She is a woman getting it done. No agony of defeat for Senator Hillary Clinton!"
18,Anti-Terrorism: Defending Against Terrorism,politics," Terrorism has now reached the point that it has entered into every aspect of daily life. All over the world terrorist activities threaten the safety of civilians and military personnel alike. Regardless of who commits these terrorist actions, whether jihadists or other types of violent extremists, the need for qualified individuals to combat and prevent them is increasing. Anti-terrorism officers are an example of qualified individuals who help protect national security. Anti-terrorism officers (ATOs) are highly trained individuals that primarily hold policy advisory and planning positions in areas where terrorism is a critical threat. Unlike many operational counterterrorism roles, anti-terrorism officers must have a level of education and experience that goes beyond military field training. An advanced education can open the door to many rewarding career opportunities, and provide a specialized and responsible alternative to conventional high security jobs. Anti-Terrorism Skills An anti-terrorism officer must develop a deep understanding of threats to homeland security from non-state actors, and is responsible for advising senior leadership how to appropriately and effectively deal with all terrorism-related issues. For example, anti-terrorism personnel formulate and help implement far-reaching strategies to secure critical infrastructure like military bases, embassies and air/seaports to name a few. Anti-terrorism training involves the broad study of international and local threats to national security posed by terrorism. Those charged with providing senior decision makers with the intelligence they need to implement appropriate security measures must understand how to offset and effectively manage emerging threats before they become a reality. Anti-Terrorism Education and Anti-Terrorism Training Anti-terrorism officers need to have the knowledge used in every arena of the strategic security industry. Anti-terrorism officers will use knowledge of explosives, weapons of mass destruction, political and religious extremism, underground economies and terrorist techniques to combat terrorist threats and operations. A proper education gives those in the field of anti-terrorism the ability to develop a comprehensive picture of the global strategic security environment. Anti-terrorism training focuses on pro-active strategies like planning, prevention and resolution. Playing a preventive and defensive (deterrent) role toward specific targets, an anti-terrorism officer helps reduce the vulnerability of possible terrorist targets and tactics. Terrorist tactics are purposefully evasive; consequently, early warning and prevention lies in the ability to successfully detect potential indicators. With many countries introducing anti-terrorism legislation (ex: USA's Patriot Act), the focus on specialty training has never been stronger. As global terrorist activity continues to increase, advanced anti-terrorism education and training can be your ticket to some of the most challenging and meaningful national security job opportunities related to anti-terrorism."
19,Insider politic news in Malaysia Today,politics," Malaysian political scene has endured a series of events and has had its fair share of protests that involved quite a number of politicians in the past decade. Issues like the murder of the Mongolian Model Altantuya Shaariibuu and the accusations of Razak Baginda, a former political analyst with the Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia, Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak, who many claimed is related to the case. The trial is on-going with Razak still under charged with abetting two police officers who is accused of murdering the model and subsequently blowing her body to pieces using C4 explosives. Issues arises like the petrol hikes have caused a major uproar among citizens not so much about the petrol hikes but more so are talked about on the issues involving the hike. The government of Malaysia today are being said to have not done enough to keep the price low, thereby increasing the people's burden. Words of advice like ‘changing the lifestyle' of the people by the Malaysia Prime Minister are being shot back for being too naïve. The people want to know where the profits of the national petroleum company Petronas have been channeled to if not to help curb the rising price of fuel. The former Prime Minister, Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad and his dissatisfaction on his successor and how he claims the Primer to be a puppet to his son-in-law Khairy Jamalluddin, who has many corporate directorship under his belt. The former prime minister, who has alleged to have tried to control the judicial system too are being talked about, but many voiced that the past is gone, and more focus should be put on the present, which many believe that the government is incapable in managing Malaysia's economy and administration. These hot topics are constantly discussed in a place where the true facets of Malaysian politics are talked about and discussed not by the politicians but by the people whose lives are affected by the politicians, the people of Malaysia. There are many ways by which the people of Malaysia wants to be heard, for instance Raja Petra Kamarudin, a prominent opposition activist and editor that he claims would have insider information about the dark circles of the country's political arena and the various comments he has made that caused his incarceration under the Malaysian Seditious Act. These issues are discussed in detail in Malaysia Today as it comes from the people themselves. Most of the people would give their insights and suggestions to be heard and understood. As a channel of interaction, Malaysia Today provides a place for Malaysians to talk about what they feel and think about politics that affects their everyday lives and everything else that don't."
20,Breaking the OPEC Chains,politics," Worldwide demand for petroleum is increasing.  Crude oil prices have topped $135 per barrel.  Oil prices have been on a steady climb for a long time.  Dwindling OPEC oil reserves and a weak dollar are driving petroleum prices to new heights. The US government has made no serious efforts to develop effective countermeasures.  Instead, energy conservation, ethanol production from corn, and a failing ""Cap and Trade"" permit system are hyped by politicians. Exploding grain prices have exposed the ethanol hoax and made poor people across the world scramble for food.  Coal and oil sands are used to produce petroleum substitutes and increase greenhouse gas emissions.  The ""Cap and Trade"" concept was tried in Europe.  The concept is deeply flawed.  It does not provide lasting relief.  It merely delays the day of reckoning for a few years. Electricity and liquid transportation fuels are the lifeblood of our economies.  Economic growth is impossible without plentiful, affordable, and secure energy supplies.  Economies will collapse when supplies of petroleum begin to shrink, when global warming keeps causing damages, and when energy prices continue skyrocketing.  Will our grandkids witness such disasters? We are facing a problem that is too large to be solved by industrial entities.  The financial risks of introducing new technologies are too large.  Government agencies and industry cooperatives must find technical solutions to our problems, must install a few of any new energy producing installations, and must make the advanced technologies economically competitive. Are there any solutions that can be developed before petroleum is depleted and before global warming exceeds the 3 to 4 degree Celsius global warming threshold? The world community must solve these two threatening disasters very quickly.  Petroleum reserves will last only a few more decades considering the accelerating, worldwide demand.  Greenhouse gases from coal and petroleum combustion will continue to accumulate in our air at ever faster rates and will accelerate global warming and ice melting.  Any of these disasters may strike within less than five decades. Increased use of nuclear power can generate large amounts of electricity and can replace the use of coal.  Increased use of solar power, hydropower, wind power, marine power, and geothermal heat can provide additional electricity. Surprisingly, only one single concept seems to have the potential to produce sufficient amounts of liquid transportation fuels.  This concept is the conversion of biomass into liquid petroleum substitutes. The concept of biomass conversion has just suffered a major public relations debacle.  The ill conceived process of converting corn by fermentation into ethanol has led to a temporary tripling of US corn prices.  This huge increase caused the destabilization of worldwide food prices.  This effect was entirely predictable.  Nevertheless, this concept was considered worthy to receive large governmental subsidies. Biomass conversion into fuel is our one and only option.  We must learn how to convert sunlight, water, carbon dioxide, and fertilizer into biomass.  Food crops are not suited for conversion.  Food crops have been selected, domesticated, and bred to provide tasty and nutritious foods.  Energy crops must be selected based on entirely different properties.  Energy crops must have very high energy content, must provide very high crop yields, and must grow very fast.  This means that we must find and further breed plants with very high energy yields; i.e. plants with the highest values of energy per acre per year. When designing biomass plantations, we must address several specifications.  We need plenty of sunshine and we must protect against the misappropriation and abuse of fertile lands and of forests.  By locating biomass plantations on arid lands and by combining biomass growing and biomass conversion into a single facility, we can avoid abuse of agricultural lands. Biomass production must be designed to be highly automated and mechanized to lower costs.  Additionally, biomass is best converted into petroleum substitutes within hours.  Such quick conversion requires on-site processing.  Harvested biomass cannot be stored for long times.  Liquefied petroleum substitutes can be stored in tanks and can be transported by pipeline. Obviously, such radical plantation concept, which ideally uses hydroponic techniques and is not dependent on soil quality, will need development.  New biomass types must be identified.  The performance of high energy yield plants must be optimized.  The engineering of hydroponic plantations located on arid lands or in deserts must be completed, pilot plants must be built and tested, and fast conversion processes for converting carbohydrates into hydrocarbons must be found and developed to maturity. One question remains; does our Earth have large enough areas of arid land which are ideally located closely to coasts and seawater? In 2004 the world consumed roughly 30 billion barrels of petroleum.  This figure translates into an energy consumption of 173 exajoules per year.  We know the energy yields of a few food plants.  We can extrapolate those energy yields and arrive at a probable energy yield of newly bred plants of 10,000 gigajoules per hectare per year.  When we divide energy consumption by energy yield we arrive at a figure of 17.3 million hectare or 42.6 million acres.  This area is equal in size to the state of Florida.  This small area can support biomass growth to supply the entire world with transportation fuels!  Very large areas are readily available to support the growth of biomass.  The Earth has many arid areas and huge deserts. US government must lead the world in this endeavor and must establish an agency with a single mission: Develop the technologies to produce plentiful, affordable, and secure liquid transportation fuels for the next few centuries."

1,"John McCain for President?  Yeah, Right.",politics," Does this accurately describe your reaction to John McCain?  If it is, I quite agree. In fact, I have no intention of supporting him whatsoever.  I've been holding my nose for the Republican presidential candidates since I was old enough to vote, and I haven't seen much of a return on my support.  Up to now, they've been lackluster at best.  This year, the Republicans managed to nominate the only human being that could make me look back on either of the Bushes or Bob Dole and say ""I wish our nominee was one of them instead"". Now, everyone is adamant that we vote for McCain.  They say there's a world of difference between him and Obama, and let's say that's true.  What's he done about it since 2000 or so?  When was the last time you saw McCain oppose a Democrat or their agenda points in any way before he started running for President?  In fact, what else has he done but join with Democrats, poke his fingers in conservative eyes to build his fake maverick credentials, and revel in the puff press at our expense? Can you say for certain he'll support or ignore any of those differences at any given time, knowing his obsession for media accolades?  His love for their attentions is the only thing about him that's predictable.  How is he going to react when he's President, and that very same media is around him all the time, waiting to hammer him for his departures from their orthodoxy, or glorify his breaks from his own party? If you see him becoming even more of a donkey in elephant's clothing because of this, I do too.  Not only that, but his entire party will fall into line behind him, just like they did under Bush, and walk right off a cliff yet again.  It kind of takes the edge off the argument that he's an improvement over Obama, and demoralizing to boot. So what am I going to do about this?  I'm voting my principles with a third party instead this year.  Personally, I like Bob Barr, but for those of you who aren't of the Libertarian bent might want to look at Chuck Baldwin of the Constitution Party instead.  Do they have a real chance of winning?  Historically speaking, no.  Does that make it a wasted vote?  Look at the other choices, and make your own decision.  You already know mine. I find this preferable to sitting out the election, and here's why you should think twice if you're considering doing that yourself.  Yes, I agree with you that swallowing the jagged horsepill of the McCain candidacy is asking too much, but his undeserved nomination isn't the only issue here.  There's the Congress to consider, because it's the source, or obstruction, of the real and long-term damage. Why care about the Congress now?  Surprisingly enough, the congressional Republicans have started taking desirable action, especially with regards to energy policy.  While you may not give them much thought in a presidential election year, this time you really should.  If you decide to stay home, you could be costing a decent representative or Senator their job a la Rick Santorum's undeserved fate.  I have one such deserving Senator on my local ballot this year, and I'm definitely voting for him regardless of McCain. Therefore, even if your reaction to McCain is 'yeah, right' just like mine, don't stay home in November.  Look into a third party candidate so you have someone to support.  A third party means you can vote your principles for President, send a message to the RINOs that they can't take you for granted, and not sacrifice a worthwhile conservative representative or Senator to do it.  By all means, let McCain take his own electoral thrashing, but leave those who don't deserve one out of it."
2,"I'm With Stupid, but I'm All Alone!",politics," I’m With Stupid, But I’m All Alone! A politician’s self-evaluation. I am a politician. I have learned a few things about myself during my self-evaluation. Here are a FEW things I have learned about myself after thinking about it for a while. -I vote for bills that I have not read. -I have my pages and secretaries read my bills for me and translate them to me. -I do not vote with my beliefs, as I really do not have any of my own. -I cannot make a decision, cast a vote, or answer any questions about any issue without checking with my party first. -I vote for all of the pork I can get away with to buy votes. -I know people will blindly follow me, no matter what I do, because of the D or R following my name at the ballot box. -I know the average American will never know how I voted on issues. -I believe America should never fight for ANYTHING unless it ends quickly and no one gets hurt, especially the enemy. -I believe America is a great country because of our government, not because of great people or freedoms. -I will vote for anything, in any way necessary, to go along with the party line, no matter what my personal beliefs are. -I choose my beliefs based on polls. -I may have voted for something last year, but this year I will be against it, because it is election time and I want those votes. -I take all of the perks I can. -I believe a budget shows what money HAS to be spent. If there is a surplus, we will repave a road that does not need it. -I believe purchases should be made with no logical decision about whether the price is right, as long as one of my constituents gets paid. -I believe the rights of a few tree frogs are more important than the well being of people. -I believe if ten people are offended by something then millions of others will have to change their lives to accommodate the wishes of those few. -I believe it is better for me to spend time on renaming projects than to address more important issues facing America. -I believe I do not need to show up for votes. -I believe it is OK to accuse other politicians of wrongdoing in attempt to get a perjury conviction if they do not tell me what I want to hear. -I believe all people have to be reliant on government so that I can stay in power. -I believe over 50 percent of the population should not have to pay any taxes. This will allow me to cater to them so that I will never lose power again. -I believe in Socialism because it will get me more power, especially in schools and healthcare. -I believe if we have nothing to do while in Congress we should make laws just to act like we accomplished something, no matter how silly the law is. -I believe if a vote did not go my way then someone cheated, lied, or the machines were wrong, not that I possibly could have been the worse candidate. -I believe we have to keep the IRS so that I will not lose power. These are just a few things I have found out about myself and as I said, these are just a FEW of the things I believe in. I have to see my shrink now. Oh, you want to know who I am? I am YOUR politician. If you are reading this nonsense, you need to be sure to educate yourself about your politicians, as everyone believes their politicians are great and it is the other politicians that are bad. If you have a politician who has been in office for multiple terms you cannot blame the politician anymore, you have to blame the voters who keep putting that politician there. A comfortable politician, who knows they will not get voted out of office, is a very, very bad thing. 2008 will be one of the most important elections of all time. More importantly than anything, please get every informed person you can to get out and vote. Friends, relatives, co-workers, or anyone else. They will tell you that their vote will not count, but you can tell them that their vote will cancel out an ignorant vote of someone else. Good luck, Bear Brooks Author of: A Jackass at Every Turn!

3,The Second Amendment-Clarified,politics," It does not matter who you are, or what walk of life you come from, chances are that you are aware of the 2nd Amendment of the Bill Of Rights. This said, you are also aware of the constant battle between those who wish to keep and those who wish to change or do away totally with this amendment. This said, we will go further into the raging battle that has drawn so many into the Debate--Guns or No Guns. First-let's let's look at the wording of the Second Amendment that is drawing so much debate: "" A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. "" There are numerous opinions to the use of the word ""Militia"" in this statement. What did the Forefathers mean, when they stated ""Militia""? Let's ask them!!! ""A militia, when properly formed, are in fact the people themselves … and include all men capable of bearing arms,"" declared Richard Henry Lee, a First Congress senator. ""To preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of people always possess arms."" ""Who are the militia?"" asked Tench Coxe, delegate for Pennsylvania to the Continental Congress. ""Are they not ourselves? Is it feared, then, that we shall turn our arms each man gainst his own bosom. Congress have no power to disarm the militia. Their swords, and every other terrible implement of the soldier, are the birthright of an American… [T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or state governments, but, where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the people."" A simple search for the opinions of the Forefathers will inform anyone, that the ""Militia"", was in fact ""The People"".  Those wishing to Twist the words of the Bill Of Rights can only impress the un-knowing---The words and meanings of the Forefathers and the ""Bill Of Right's"" are clear---""Shall not Be Infringed"" So why is the support for peoples rights to bear arms different from the rights of Speech or Religion? It isn't---All people will stand up for their freedom of Speech ( Everyone wants to speak their opinion ). All people want to practice their beliefs---and they have the right to do so. This is why there can be no ""All Out Attack"" on these Right's-You would be challenging ""All People"" When it comes to the Freedom of the Second Amendment---All people, do not own firearms.  Many people are not involved in the Defence of the Second Amendment, because they do not believe it applies to them ( They do not own firearms ) This could not be further from the truth!!! ""Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like in the United States where men were free."" -- Ronald Reagan Freedom--This is the root of those seeking to defend the Right given to us by the Bill Of Right's. The defence of the 2nd Amendment is not only at the heart of every Firearms owner, It should also be of great importance to anyone who is thankful for the free life we live in this country, whether they own a firearm or not. Why? Because we live in a nation that was built on freedom----There is no Bill of Guns---Only a Bill Of Rights. I may not agree with what you say, I may not agree with your religion, however I will defend your right's. Will you defend mine??"
4,"If You Want Government to Listen, You've Got To Make the Ask!",politics," One of my main messages for advocates is ""make the ask."" In my opinion it is almost always a waste of time to talk to an elected official without asking for something. Believe it or not, though, people have actually had the audacity to disagree with me on this. I know, it shocked me as well :). I've listened to the critics and I'm here to say, well, they're partially right (see, I listen to other people despite what my husband says). But I still stand by my ""make the ask"" advice. Let me explain what I mean. First, though, before I get too much in to it, perhaps I should explain what I mean by ""make the ask."" Simply put, advocates should ask for something specific as opposed to simply trying to ""educate"" or ""inform"" elected officials. Frankly, trying to educate elected officials without asking for something specific is like trying to educate a middle-schooler without telling them it will be on the test. It goes in one ear and out the other. Those who disagree with this advice usually have something to say along the following lines: either they believe they'll ""get more attention if they don't ask (since everyone else is);"" they ""just want to say thank you;"" or they've ""already asked and don't want to be a pest."" These criticisms sound perfectly reasonable and in many cases are partially true. Let's examine each in more detail. ""Everyone's always asking. I'll get more attention if I don't"" Unfortunately, if you use all your time with an elected official to just say nice things, you won't get their attention over the long term - and you'll probably be ignored.  I'm really sorry to have to put it that way, but it's true. Yes, it's nice for the legislator to have a meeting with someone who ""isn't always asking for something."" It's even nicer for the legislator to have a meeting with someone who asks ""how can I help you on your issues?"" -- and I'm not in anyway suggesting that these questions should not be a part of your message. That said, ""making the ask"" flips that switch in an elected official's brain that says ""hey, I better pay attention to what this person is saying."" It achieves that goal far more effectively than a polite ""I don't really need anything right now, I just thought I'd stop by."" The good news is that if you're feeling non-aggressive, you can ask for something easy that, and here's the key, provides the legislator with as much benefit as it does you! Here are some examples of what I mean: A site visit: Ask your elected officials to visit a facility in the district, perhaps a place where they can meet with constituents and be seen in a positive light in the media. You're helping them connect with people in the community, and you've made an ""ask."" In this case, the ask is ""will you come and visit us in the district?""  One of our lobby clients used this technique to approach members of Congress who would normally be, shall we say, a little skeptical of their views.  By asking for something easy, like a site visit, instead of launching immediately in to a hard policy ask, these advocates have been able to build positive relationships with their legislators that will serve them well when the hard policy issues arise. A statement of support: Perhaps your elected official would be willing to make a public statement of support, either in writing or by making a speech.  This can be especially useful when it's connected to a ""hook"" of some sort.  So, for example, if it's National ""hug a puppy"" week, the elected official can make a statement about how wonderful it is to hug puppies - and you can be sure the media is there to get a picture of the puppy hugging activity (my puppy is available if needed).  The ask, in this case, is ""will you make a statement in support of 'hug a puppy' week?""  And be sure to follow-up with all the talking points and other materials to make this happen. (hey, can we start a ""hug a puppy"" week?) An article for your newsletter:  For advocates affiliated with a state or community organization that puts together a newsletter, asking your elected officials to write an article for that newsletter can be a great way of getting their attention. Most elected officials welcome the opportunity to put their name in front of their constituents, and your request that they post something in your publication will require them to think about your cause. In addition, if they agree to write the article (or, in most cases, to review the article you have drafted for them and agree to sign their name to it) they will almost always want to speak positively about your issue. That makes it much harder for them to vote against you should the time ever come. In essence, these ""relationship building asks"" help you set the stage for future, sometimes more difficult or more controversial, policy asks.  They are an ideal way to capture a legislator's attention without being too pushy. ""I don't want to ask: I just want to say ""thank you"""" I heard a variation of this from a legislator who was also speaking at one of the conferences at which I was presenting. In fact, the legislator went on right before me and told the attendees that they should do nothing but thank the legislature for all the support for their issue and that there was no need to ask for anything specific. I was in a bit of an awkward position as I, well, completely disagreed. Now, don't get me wrong. My mother raised me right. I do believe that we should all say ""thank you"" as frequently as possible. And if you're communicating with your elected officials frequently (say once per month or more) go ahead and use up one of those communications as a pure and simple thank you. However, in this case the advice was directed at a group of people who talked to their representatives once-per-year. In these situations, while a thank you is a great way to start out, it should be accompanied with an ""ask,"" even if it's one of the easy asks noted above.  Without that ask (and the required follow-up on the ask), those lobby day participants would probably not have found any other occasions to talk to their legislators at any other point through the year. ""I already asked and I didn't get an answer.  They know what I want.   I don't want to ask again."" This one really irritates me.  The whole purpose of an ask is to eventually get an answer, right?  Sure it's frustrating when our elected officials don't respond to our ""asks"" as quickly as we'd like.  Why does that happen?  Usually it's for one of three reasons.  Either: All of these problems can be solved by asking again.  I recognize that it might take months or even years to get a straight answer out of a member of Congress, state legislator or even city council member.  But you sure won't get one at all if you don't ask again.  Giving up after the first or second try just makes it way too easy on them. When it comes down to the bottom line, elected officials and their staff expect you to eventually present them with an issue and a specific solution to that issue. Otherwise, why are you communicating with them?  I can't think how many times as a legislative staff person I had meetings I just thought were a complete waste of time because no one asked me for anything. So how are the critics partially right?  Well, I guess if you're communicating with your elected officials frequently then you can afford to spend some of those communications on the niceties.  And since everyone SHOULD be communicating frequently with their elected officials, then we all should be spending time on the niceties.  But in the real world, where we might reach out a couple times per year, making the ask is an essential component of getting what we want from our government.  And isn't that what it's all about?"
5,Alternatives to GM foods,politics," In England, GM foods will always be associated with lies and deception. That's for a very good reason, because everything we have been told here about GM over the years is provably untrue. Take one example: we were told that GM crops were necessary for the good of the Third World. It would help eradicate hunger, it was said. Now we find out that the vast majority of GM crops in the world today are grown in North America. If GM type food is being developed for the benefit of the Third World, why is the First World deriving so much benefit from it first, before the others? Why on earth do the wheat growers of the US and Canadian prairies need seed that delivers higher yields? If GM is so important for Africa and Asia, why aren't they top priority instead? It beggars belief that GM is touted as the answer to world hunger but is busy being devoted mainly to feeding the fattest people on the planet, and not the needy and under-nourished. Nobody is saying the scientists are lying. The men in white coats who invented the new way of growing crops no doubt had the best interests of humanity at heart. Unfortunately, their patents are in the hands of businessmen, people who struggle to produce a convincing picture of altruism. One example: GM seeds that are making it to Africa are being sold to the farmers there, sold in a market where farmers rarely deal in a cash economy, and, moreover, sold as First Generation hybrids, which means they are sterile. Local farmers are used to conserving seeds from one season to the next, to provide for the new crop. They are having to get used to a brand new system of selling all their harvest each year and saving money from the proceeds to buy next year's seed. It's a plan that ties the dirt poor farmer to the big seed companies - forever. There is no way the farmers can break out of the trap. Worse, they are being tempted to grow inappropriate crops: the rice farmers are not just being offered GM rice, but the whole range of GM plants. Farmers are switching to what might seem the most profitable product available, a short-term philosophy that ignores local need; local climate conditions; and local food supply. Back in Britain, the GM bandwagon arrived in the 1990s. The population was told that GM  crops would need to be 'tested' in our country. Why? Is the climate that different to the US, or the soil, or the agricultural methods? If GM foods are helping the hungry, why does prosperous England turn out to be the next area for colonisation on the list? Worse, the British public soon had to get used to the news that GM seeds were carried by the wind, and spread. We were promised that this wouldn't happen; we were told that these GM 'trial' beds would be isolated and protected. Rubbish. GM plants spread into areas where farmers didn't want them, and farmers who had consciously said they didn't want anything to do with the 'GM revolution' were finding their fields polluted by the new technology. It didn't end there. The GM companies then had the damn nerve to sue the victims for 'stealing' the GM crops, the invaders on their land, (which they hadn't asked for and didn't want) and were being awarded damages in the courts! In Canada, even more bizarrely, the GM companies were suing farmers for 'trespass' and said they were threatening their patents, and were being awarded not only the produce of their fields but their land as well. That was the last straw. If there's one thing that Englishmen hate, it's legalised robbery. It reminds them of the dust bowl of the 1930s in America, the tragedy that John Steinbeck and Woody Guthrie chronicled so wonderfully, where farmers were swept off their land by caterpillar tractors, all perfectly legally and at the behest of rapacious banks and landlords. There was more to come. The media got on the case and decided that GM crops represented 'Frankenstein foods'. No, it doesn't make any sense, but that didn't stop the campaign. The bogey of eating 'artificial' food was scarey to the British public and they turned off the idea in droves. They stopped buying anything that even had a hint of GM about it. The GM industry hit back, and made sure that food labelling was no longer required to specify if packets of soya beans were GM or not. One week, labels might say, 'made from 50% GM crops', the next week they said nothing. The population was livid. Big Business had once again rigged the game, forcing politicians to kowtow to their call and outlaw information that might be detrimental to their sales. People weren't buying GM? The cynical response was not to tell people it was there. How's that for deception? Oh, did I mention it was all perfectly legal? That just made the angry people madder. They felt used, abused, and manipulated, and turned against GM companies. The GM industry had one last trick up its sleeve. It recognised that a huge publicity campaign had been mounted against its most vociferous advocate, Monsanto, so it simply collapsed the company, dropped the name and started up again under another title. Bad move. If anything, this just convinced the doubters they were right. If the company was so unsure about sales that it could re-invent itself overnight, then what else was invented, spurious and untrue? The move proved one thing. If you critisise the GM giants, they cry 'Foul' and talk about the free market and consumer choice. If consumers then actually go ahead and choose, well, like choosing something that isn't in the big companies' interest, like buying their food, then they'll change food packing; change company names; and outlaw information. What happened to the Free Market? Oh, that's only good when you, the people, buy what the company wants to sell you. If you won't buy it, they'll rig the market. It won't be so darn 'free' then, but at least sales will hold up. So much for capitalists; they believe in capitalism, when it suits them. If it doesn't suit, they'll choose Big Government, every time."
6,A river Ran Through it,politics," I live in Southern California.   People here may be more aware of the need for conserving water that in other ""wetter"" places.  Overall, water conservation is vital.  I’m not talking about doomsday prophecies about not having any water to drink, but I’m talking about how much the need for water has effected everything else around us.  Even things that are seemingly unconnected. The following article I wrote is proof of this phenomenon.  One of the hot topics in this years election is the immigration issue.  What do we do?  Close our borders?  Deport illegals? Grant amnesty?  Who knows.  Let this article show you that the immigration problem today has a lot to do with water, and how we get it, use it, waste it and forget about it. A River Ran Through It…….. Imagine a lush green valley. Hillsides covered with trees and shrubs….all green and alive. There is river and a delta that runs right on through the valley. The river provides. The delta is spawning ground for many fish and of course, as in all delta areas, it makes the soil perfect for sustaining vegetation. The river provides. It provides food in the form of fish, and in the form of crops. It provides jobs for the valley residents thus creating an economy all its own. The river provides. The river provided. This valley is not some fictional place created by Rawls or Baum. It existed much like I described for many, many years and although the valley is still there geographically; the river that once provided is not. This is the story of the Mexicali Valley. The valley rests between the US Mexico Border and the sea of Cortez. The river of course is the Colorado. In years long since past the Colorado River ran from its source in the Rocky Mountains all the way south to the sea of Cortez. This created an ideal spot for the local Meso-Indian population. They were a self sustaining people. They fished in the river, planted crops of wheat and corn and beans in the fertile soil it provided. The people that lived there, worked there. Because of the river, there was money, jobs, food, and safety. The Mexicali Valley was a more suitable place to live then the areas north in the US. The deserts of Arizona, Colorado, Utah and southern California were arid to say the least. However, the smell of money proved too powerful to keep people away. Spurred by a growth that began with the gold rush, the American southwest was being settled at an alarming rate. Even back then in the early 1900’s people were keen to the fact that LA was a hit. People began buying up massive tracts of land in the San Fernando Valley. Sensing correctly at the immense value of the land. The truth is, the land was at the time worthless, being mostly dry and unfarmable. They knew something that many others didn’t. That William Mulholland, rich, white man that he was…..had a plan. A plan to ensure that the land would rise in value, quite possibly forever. The advantages of living in a desert climate are many days of sunshine and warm weather year round. The disadvantages? Water. There was no water within 200 miles of the San Fernando Valley. It didn’t rain more than 30 days out of the year in the San Fernando Valley. So how was this area going to grow? How were his wealthy financial backers going to profit from their land? By literally stealing water from the residents of Owens Valley and building the now infamous LA River aqua ducts. Low and behold this wasn’t enough. As more and more people flocked to the southern California area, and more recently to Las Vegas and Phoenix the need for water was as high as the mountains that provided it. A series of projects like the Hoover Dam in 1922 portioned off the life giving waters of the Colorado river to Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, and of course the growing giant Southern California. Oh yeah, we told Mexico that we would be sure to let a few drops come their way as well. Project after project and development after development made sure that Mexico did not receive any of our precious water. The farms of southern California were growing vegetables that provided food for our whole country so they felt it was justified to just keep taking water. The Mexicali valley has 1% of the water they had before this happened. And so the many farms are no more, the many fish are no more and they many people that lived there have illegally crossed our borders to work on farms here. You can reread that if you want to. In my opinion, illegal immigration is a top 5 problem in our country and maybe top 3 in southern California where 1 in 7 workers are undocumented. I run into them every day. My job puts me in situations where an ID is necessary, and many, many do not have any form of ID. Many show me Mexican driver’s licenses after getting out of a pickup truck overloaded with people and lawnmowers. I used to get angry. I used to direct my anger at them. They make an easy target. They don’t speak English, they have dirty jobs, they tolerate living in substandard conditions etc. They are an easy target. Lucky for me I read a lot. When I learned about the history of the Colorado River and the history of the growth of Southern California, I see who is really to blame. Money and greed and our rich predecessors that had zero vision of a future beyond their own wallets. It gets worse. We are going to run out of water anyway. Now, partly because the illegal population has caused our cities to grow even faster. The greedy, in keeping with their father’s wishes, just keep on feeding the beast. LA keeps building new developments with apartments and malls so all these ""new"" people will have a place to live. In places like Valencia, where it doesn’t rain, and the dry brush burns almost every year. And the coyotes that call that area home kill a few dogs and then get shot, and eventually forced out. When will enough be enough? If you are reading this and you live in LA, make sure the people you voted for know that you are not for further development. It is simply an invitation for more and more people to come. What usually happens is that people that lived in LA proper move out when the illegal aliens move in? They move to Simi Valley and to Valencia. There are other things that I find interesting as well. Like the fact that even though the largest portion of the river comes to southern California, we are the only state in the group that doesn’t have any forced conservation measures in place. Vegas buys grass from people and helps them design a native plant yard and garden. Phoenix has similar program. Both cities have dry days where washing your car and watering your lawn is prohibited. Vegas spends an estimated $7.79 per person on water conservation methods. LA spends none. On paper LA spends $2.00. But in fact nothing at all is done. Businesses, residential homes, all of us use water too much. If you live in the San Fernando Valley, like I do, and you have grass, like I do, you use too much water. Grass is not a native plant, palm trees are not a native plant, and orange groves are not native plants contrary to popular belief. If we really want to ebb the flow of illegal immigrants crossing into our country, then we must do something to make them want to stay there. If they had food, and farms, and jobs there, they wouldn’t want, no, need to come here to survive. If you conserve water, don’t just think of it as saving a couple of bucks, or even helping the environment, think of it as helping national security. Helping to secure our borders and reduce the population growth that is coming from Mexico. People will still come, but it is a step in the right direction. We destroyed their ability to be self sustaining in the first place, now they are contributing to our inability to do the same. The past, once again, is coming back to haunt us. Thank you William Mulholland, I hope you enjoyed your money. You are a not a hero to me, you are not a leader to me; you are not an engineering marvel as some call you. You are a greedy thief whose lives mission was to stay rich, get richer and make your friends rich and you have created a situation that will eventually destroy our cities. Thank you William Mulholland. Dave Other Related Posts:"
7,Barack Obama Shirts are a hit with the younger voters,politics," When it comes to reaching out to the public Obama can achieve the unity he wants, as a candidate Obama was not even known less than a year ago. However, he was able to use the Internet to connect with millions of young people who are also voters who do not have a TV set or who do not watch the candidates in their debates. Obama has been known as saying we have not even scratched the surface of with this new political landscape, meaning the Internet and the computer users who might not hear from the candidates directly. Obama has not only stayed on track with what he said here over a year ago, but has also gone on to develop plans of how he can enact many of his ideas to make changes if he is elected. Obama has also maintained a strong stance in all areas of his campaign while focusing on the problems of the country and what changes need to be made. Along with bringing these ideas of change to the Internet user so that they hear it in his words and not in the medias method of telling only parts of what a candidate has to say. There are many voters that have learned what Barack Obama stands for, what his policy changes would mean to the country and what they can expect if he is elected as the next President of the United States. They have learned all this with their Internet connection on the web without all of the added extras or opinions of the media. While some people are content watching the televised debates and the local news to form their opinion of who they want to run the country as the Commander and Chief for the next four years. There are many people who know with the Internet this is no longer the best way to make the decision of who they should vote for and to many people information is power. The power to be informed, the power understand just what a candidate plans to change, add and omit during their presidency. It is only by a voter thoroughly educating themselves about the candidates that they will make the correct decision for which candidate they feel can do the best job of running the country. The Barack Obama campaign has made this much easier by bringing Obama’s stand on what needs to change in the country to the internet and with this many more young voters know what he stands for. Many voters in general for the first time in many years are getting the unbiased information they need minus the media.  Who in many cases decides who they feel should be the proper candidate to win the election and push that agenda and the voters either begin to believe it or they feel they must make a choice with out all the information they need if they are going to be a part of the voting process. To assist in this campaign the supporters who have heard Obama’s message loud and clear are now wearing t-shirts to help support his continued campaign efforts. Buy yourself a Barack Obama shirts and help support him in every way possible that will help him get elected as president. You can help support Barack Obama by wearing trendy Barack Obama t-shirts or by making a donation to the campaign. All the Barack Obama designs mentioned here are not official but rather are inspired by who might possibly be one of the most influencial politicians in a long time."
8,Excess Oil Profits or Healthy Economies?,politics," Market prices for petroleum are moving upwards.  This movement can be stopped only when alternate liquid fuels will become available in large quantities.  OPEC (Organization of Oil Exporting Countries) controls and sets global prices for petroleum. US oil companies follow the OPEC price lead gladly and are reaping excessive profits.  Available petroleum reserves are being depleted at a rapid pace.  Demand is overtaking supplies.  Discoveries of new petroleum deposits are plummeting.  Excessive prices for transportation fuels will lead to economic hardships and eventual economic collapse.  World economies must find alternate liquid fuel supplies or they will self-destruct. Remaining petroleum reserves are estimated at 1.3 to 2.3 trillion barrels.  These reserves can only last 25 to 50 years at consumption rates that will exceed 50 billion barrels per year on an average for the next fifty years.  This huge consumption will add more than 100 ppm of carbon dioxide to the Earth's atmosphere, which is already overloaded. Transportation fuels are the lifeblood of modern economies.  Foods, goods, and commodities must be transported to reach consumers.  Short interruptions in transportation lead to economic crises.  Long-term interruptions lead unavoidably to economic disasters and collapses.  Governments and industries have not been able to develop sensible solutions for secure, future fuel supplies. Many options for extending or replacing petroleum and its many refinery products have been proposed.  Finding new petroleum deposits, making petroleum substitutes from coal or oil shale, producing ethanol from food crops, producing hydrogen using nuclear power, legislating ""Cap and Trade"" policies, and demanding strict energy conservation measures have been suggested.  None of these energy supply options can withstand closer scrutiny and analysis. If none of these popular proposals is acceptable in the final analysis, is there any solution left that can be developed in time, can be used for several centuries, will not slow global economies, and will in fact accelerate economic growth for all the world's countries? Only one single option for saving our world from economic collapse exists.  We must learn how to convert solar energy into liquid fuels and we must prevent the use of precious, limited, fertile lands that produce food crops, feed livestock, or grow forests.  We must learn how to grow and breed high energy yield plants, plants that have high energy contents and produce large amounts of biomass on a single acre of land. Additionally, we must find energy conversion processes that convert biomass into petroleum substitutes and we must modify existing refinery techniques to produce liquid motor fuels from biotic petroleum substitutes.  None of these process steps is utopian.  All of them can be developed and tested on a large scale in less than two decades. The benefits of such an approach are manifold and exceptional.  The world will be enabled to produce affordable, plentiful, and secure liquid fuels for centuries.  Competition between food and energy producers for fertile lands is not necessary and must be outlawed.  The continued use of the world's inventory of combustion engines installed in automobiles, trucks, trains, ships, and airplanes is assured.  The world's facilities for oil refining and fuel distribution can be used without major changes.  A seamless transition from a fossil fuel dominated economies to solar based economies is entirely possible.  Millions of new jobs across the globe will be created.  Nobody loses, most people win. How can we create this new, exciting future, how can we prepare for it, how can we implement it? The world's future critically depends on the achievement of several well defined objectives and tasks.  None of the necessary tasks seems to be excessively difficult; none of the tasks is in conflict with established science or with established economic conventions.  How do we proceed? Only the USA is capable of leading the world in developing renewable, liquid fuels.  The US must lead by example.  The US has all the prerequisite facilities, lands, technologies, scientists, and engineers.  Above all, the US must find political leaders with intelligence, vision, and independence. The US must establish a single mission agency, the Energy Independence Agency.  This agency must be charged with developing a range of techniques for producing liquid transportation fuels from biomass and converting solar energy into liquid fuels that can be stored and distributed globally. The introduction of this new energy technology can be accelerated by inviting the rest of the world to cooperate. This proposal will find many opponents.  OPEC and oil interests will be the most powerful and most vociferous adversaries.  Other challengers will come from the agricultural community, from scientists and from diverse political, financial, and environmentalist interest groups. However, antagonists must remember that the world is facing an existential threat.  If we do not find a way to effectively and conclusively deal with the approaching transportation fuel shortage, we will destroy economies and cultures.  We cannot turn back the clock.  We must deal with the situation we are facing today.  We must resolve threatening global issues within less than three decades. We must assure the continuing growth of economies, we must stop global warming and climate change, and we must prepare the world for a major increase of its population.  We must act very soon or the Earth as we know it will cease to exist. Future generations will thank us for our efforts and for our concern for their wellbeing."
9,The Defense Intelligence Agency: Bringing Military Intelligence to the Armed Forces.,politics," There are more than ""spy games"" going on in the Central Intelligence Agency. A career in the CIA could have you doing any number of activities, and not everything will be about espionage and covert actions.   The mission of the CIA is to provide foreign intelligence for national security to the President and senior US policymakers. To achieve this, the CIA has specialists in numerous fields, ranging from clandestine operations to mechanical engineering. The CIA has employees from all fields of study and backgrounds to collect and provide intelligence that consumers need.   The CIA offers career options into five major categories, each of which has many different possibilities and application requirements (most require at least a bachelor's degree in a national security related field and, quite often, a master's degree or higher is preferred). The career options are as follows: analytical positions, clandestine service, language positions, scientist, engineer and technology positions and support services. No matter what career path is chosen, an extensive knowledge of the world of intelligence, high academic standing, and a relevant background in strategic security issues will likely help you be better prepared when applying to the CIA.  This article will provide a quick look into two of these career paths, and what will be beneficial for you to know for a successful career in the CIA.  Analytical Positions: Once intelligence is collected someone has to analyze and put into context the importance of that intelligence. An analyst for the CIA will evaluate information from many sources and will have to determine what information is reliable. It is the job of the analyst to perform meaningful assessments of this intelligence to pass along to government officials.   Trained Intelligence Analysts must possess advanced critical thinking and analytical problem solving skills along with a keen knowledge of their subject matter. Some of the analyst positions for the CIA are in counterterrorism, counterintelligence and intelligence collection. A background in any one these subject matters would be invaluable to a career in the CIA.  Clandestine Service: The CIA's clandestine service provides the intelligence needed by U.S. policymakers to protect national security interests.  One must complete a 12-month Clandestine Service Training (CST) Program to begin their career as a field-based Core Collector for the CIA. Core Collector's will partake in all aspects of clandestine operations while performing their overseas assignments.  Knowledge in intelligence collection, intelligence operations and counterintelligence will provide the background needed to be successful in the CIA's clandestine service.   Just about every employment opportunity at the CIA requires a bachelor's or master's degree. In order to prepare for what it takes to be involved with the CIA, knowledge within the intelligence community will benefit anyone interested in pursuing a career with the CIA.  While much of the work that the CIA and other intelligence agencies do is conducted behind closed doors, there are many aspects of the CIA that you can learn about through open sources to help you understand how our nation collects, analyzes, and uses intelligence to protect and preserve its interests."
10,The Thomas Jefferson Affair: The DNA Evidence,politics," Thomas Jefferson is one of the most famous figures in American History.  The third President of the United States, Jefferson was one of the Founding Fathers, establishing a republic United States all those years ago.  He is still remembered today in history classes for his role in establishing modern America, and is hailed as a national hero. Yet certain allegations made about Thomas Jefferson at the start of the 19th century have lead to increased speculation about his private life, thrusting DNA testing to the forefront some 200 years later to determine the facts. Thomas Jefferson is credited as having written the Declaration of Independence, and is given iconic status in the US history books. But his reputation was dealt a blow when in 1802 it was exposed that he may have fathered children to one of his slaves, Sally Hemmings, by a local journalist. The matter was never to be categorically resolved, although thanks to technological advances centuries later, genetic material was able to be extracted and tested to determine whether the children could have been those of Thomas Jefferson. This issue was of particular controversy at the time it was raised, particularly given Jefferson’s opposition to interracial marriage, thus any interactions with Hemmings would be seen as scandalous. Allegations were made public through a press report, and there was never any public confirmation or denial made by Thomas Jefferson as to its accuracy or otherwise. In recent years, the issue has been brought back to the forefront in numerous academic and scientific studies of the evidence. DNA Testing – Indications not conclusions A study of DNA material conducted in 1998 revealed that between the Hemmings children and Thomas Jefferson, there was indeed some genetic link, although it did not conclude positively that that link was from Thomas Jefferson himself.  However subsequent to that study, further reports examining the findings have claimed that Jefferson is most likely to have fathered the children of Sally Hemmings as is alleged, although Thomas’s younger brother has also been proposed as the potential link. Unfortunately, it is impossible to know at this stage whether Jefferson was the father of the children of his slave. This is of particular historical importance, given the stature of Thomas Jefferson in American history, and one which has certainly received its fair share of media attention in recent years.  However, with a number of reports suggesting the evidence to be inconclusive, it’s impossible to be sure at this stage whether or not that relationship existed. And what of young Randolph Jefferson, the alleged alternative father and Thomas Jefferson’s younger brother? He was recorded as having visited Thomas Jefferson on four occasions, of which none would seem to neatly correspond with the likely dates of the conception of the five Hemmings children. Thus while this may be alleged by some parties to be answer, there still remains a few awkward questions that would need to be satisfied were Randolph to be confirmed as the father of the Hemmings children."
11,The Credit Crisis Is Fueled By Fuel Prices,politics," The threat of recession and economic disaster facing many areas of business, its effect on employment and income levels, personal debt and security of homes is solvable. If the root cause is not addressed then the financial crisis can only deepen causing financial misery throughout both the developed world and emerging nations. Earlier this century the world largest economy, the US experienced problems and potentially faced moving into a period of economic recession. The Federal government reacted to the problem and over borrowing by reducing interest rates to very low levels. Reducing bank interest and borrowing rates to such low levels dealt with the symptoms of the problem not the causes. In fact the action to lower interest rates not only put off the inevitable financial crash but made it worse as money was borrowed and used to finance house purchases and house price inflation beyond the economic resources of the borrowers. The current credit crisis affecting the US and all western nations certainly has a partial cause in too much credit being served by banks and financial institutions, The financial crisis which was not solved in the early part of the century was dealt with but only put off and has returned and deepened, Banks have written off billions in losses, credit is difficult and expensive which is inevitably leading to crashes in house prices, people losing employment and financial security. The world economy and all western nations trade on credit which is the building block of confidence and it is confidence that needs to be restored to the world financial markets to solve the credit crunch. Lowering interest rates and pumping money into the system is the same as taking medication for a cold. It doesn't cure the cold but can smooth over the symptoms. The solution is more fundamental. In the current world economic crisis of over borrowing and cheap credit which has tightened considerably there is also a major problem of rapidly increasing prices across the full spectrum of goods and services. One of the economic factors driving the higher prices and inflation is potentially higher costs and the larger business organisations protect themselves by increasing prices to maintain profit margins. Large business fully understands that profit margins have to be increased not just to cover increased costs but also potential losses Those increased prices rapidly filter through the whole market and the consumer suffers financial disaster further affecting confidence. A principal driving force of the current economic downturn is the price of fuel and energy. Fuel and energy costs are a part of every product and service and in recent times fuel costs have escalated to stupid proportions. Reduce fuel costs and the consumer benefits from lower costs in petrol, diesel and business costs reduce through lower overheads and cheaper products. As a result demand from consumers can increase in line with increased disposable income and business profits stop heading downhill and confidence returns. The present high levels of fuel prices which at the time of writing is 120 dollars a barrel bears no relation to the cost of production. The fuel prices are purely market driven due to concerns over future supply exceeding demand. The solution to the credit crisis is then to reduce demand for oil and increase production. When supply exceeds demand prices fall. Demand for oil is increasing worldwide both from western countries and the emerging dominant nations of India and China while production is not increasing at a rate to meet the increased demand. Climate change is an issue that needs addressing medium and long term to reduce the demand for fossil fuel which could be in danger of running out this century. In the short term oil production has to be substantially increased to activate a fall in fuel prices. The oil producing nations and OPEC in particular are less interested in increasing demand due to the extortionate prices obtained for oil when demand exceeds supply. Compared with a market price of 120 dollar a barrel the production cost of that barrel of oil is as low as just 2 dollar a barrel. OPEC has been requested to increase supply and the response was negative. The solution to restore confidence in the world economies is to request oil production is increased. If that request is ignored then further diplomatic discussions must take place to ensure supply is increased. If diplomacy fails then negotiations must get tougher until a solution is found to increase supplies of oil. In the end game if the oil rich nations refuse to increase oil production then the diplomats should enforce production increases even if that results in potentially confiscating oil fueled investments worldwide and putting the billions raised back into the economies and the hard working people of this world."
12,How Consuls Were Elected in Ancient Rome,politics," The division in provinces of the Roman Empire Each year, senators decided the tasks that would be divided among the new consuls and praetors. After the election, the new consuls cast lots to determine the consular assign¬ment each would have, while the new praetors shared out their tasks in the same fashion. Alternatively, the members of each group also had the right to determine assignments by mutual agreement before lots were cast, a process known as com¬paratio. Romans believed the casting of lots to reflect the will of the gods; this method also avoided contentious debates in the senate as rival magistrates sought to convince their fellow senators to give them the most attractive assignments. Roman officials abroad often had considerable freedom of action to wage war, make alliances, and set the terms of peace perhaps greater freedom than many senators found desirable. In practice, most sanctions took the form of judgments on a magistrate’s actions after he had returned to Rome and left office. Even so, the senate sometimes refused to accept treaties that a commander had negotiated, leaving his successor to establish new arrangements. On several occasions, senatorial decrees sought to force officials to free defeated enemies who had been improperly enslaved, but efforts to remedy such injustices were seldom wholly successful. The most persistent problem, however, concerned charges of extortion and corruption. In the late third and second centuries, prosecutions for official misconduct, such as cowardice, incompetence, and corruption, served as the primary means of controlling an official’s behavior in office.This said, such prosecutions could only take place after an official had returned to Rome and laid down his office. Engagement beyond Italy grew steadily during the second century, but still this extension of Roman power and influence developed very unevenly and with much variation, as officials and senate responded to events. The creation of ""provinces"" was the main vehicle for Roman expansion. In modern English, a province usually denotes a subdivision of a larger state or country with well defined borders and a capital of its own; today, a state’s creation of a province often involves the formal subordination of the territory and its reorganization according to a definite plan. In time, the Latin term provincia would gain this meaning too, but for long it did not denote anything so fixed or definite. In the late third and early second centuries, and probably earlier, the term merely denoted the sphere of operations given to a Roman official, defined by task and location. In theory, colleagues in office all possessed the same powers and functions, but in practice they were usually expected to exercise them separately. Some served at the same place, but had different provinciae: Of the two praetors who usually remained in Rome, one, known as the ""urban"" praetor, was assigned the supervision of lawsuits between citizens, while the other, called the ""peregrine"" praetor, handled disputes involving noncitizens. Consuls and praetors who were assigned the command of armies as their provincia typically campaigned in different regions, although in large scale conflicts more than one could be assigned the same region and they then had to share authority somehow. Provinciae could be short lived and ill defined, although their number at any one time could never exceed the total of available consuls, praetors, and promagistrates. In some cases, officials were assigned provinciae that remained in existence only for a single project, campaign, or war. In others, provinciae remained in existence for some time, receiving new officials as soon as the previous ones left office. Aconsul’s or praetor’s provincia was primarily military in character. Equally, a governor’s actions were largely shaped by his need to command his and his allies’ army against Rome’s enemies, to protect friendly cities from attack, and to obtain the money and supplies needed to support his forces. Gradually, in the longer lasting provinces, governors took on other tasks, such as arbitrating disputes between cities, hearing legal cases, and supervising financial arrangements. The Roman elite did not believe its leadership to be restricted to the regions  more or less well defined where Rome happened to be maintaining provinciae. Whenever a community surrendered or put itself under Rome’s protection, mag-istrates and senate thought that it thereby became part of the imperium of the Ro-man people (imperium populi Romani). Although this word is the root of the English ""empire,"" the Latin term does not denote a clearly delimited territory, nor does it imply any administrative responsibilities by the victors or prescribed duties by the defeated. As was the case with the imperium of magistrates, the Roman leadership considered that it had the right to command the defeated and to be respected by them, even though it did not necessarily make such demands very often."
13,Why Are Gas Prices So High and What Can You Do?,politics," The cost of fuel is getting completely out of hand recently. There is something we can do. Agreed, some will be equivalent to the horse pulling the train backwards, however some are useful. None are easy, but the more we can do together, the more we will accomplish. Why are gas prices so high? Supply and demand is the simple answer. Demand is enlarging faster than supply is enlarging due to global pressure for gasoline It would appear the age of cheap oil and gasoline are gone forever. America has chosen not to produce and refine more oil. The excuses are anyone's guess.  It is clearly understood that oil drilling and new refineries will have an ecological footprint; however the impact on the ""ice turtle"" has to be equaled with the impact to our economy. Many Americans feel the anguish every time they go to the gas pumps. This is senseless. America has the resources to reduce its dependence on foreign oil, but chooses not to use them. What can you do about high gas prices? Call every elected official you can find a phone number for. Ask them to explain exactly why gas prices are so high. Ask them why the US hasn't constructed a new refinery in 30 years. Ask them why they don't support drilling in ANWR. Short of drilling for oil in your yard, this is the all you can do to affect supply. So, why are oil prices so high? Demand is the one thing you personally can have some control over. Only 20-30 years ago operating a vehicle required more than just turning a key and going. You had to check your oil every week. You had to change your own flat tire. You didn't have cruise for instance. You had to adjust the choke. To affect demand you will have to stretch your comfort zone. What does this have to do with high gas prices? You need to be prepared for the price of doubling your gas mileage Eventually auto manufacturers will produce alternative energy cars in 15 to 30 years. You can wait, and continue paying $3.50 a gallon for fuel, or you can do something else NOW. Alternative energy is not new. People have been using power from nature from the beginning. Think sailboat, water mill, wind mill, hot springs, wood, whale blubber, oil, horses, oxen, and fire. As a means of transportation these all leave something to be desired, especially when you already own a car. Now it is possible to burn hydrogen gas obtained from water, on an as needed basis, mix it with gasoline, ignite it in your engine, and increase your efficiency. You can construct a device from everyday materials for under $60 that will accomplish this. It will take you a late evening with simple tools to assemble, and under an hour to install it. The hook is, you will have to maintain it, which might take a half hour a month. Are you willing to give up your time to save between $1 - $1.50 on every gallon of gas you buy? Why are gas prices so high? They don't have to be."
14,Passion and the Democratic Party,politics," I was recently reviewing some comments to one of my articles published on the net and noticed one comment mentioning how ""passionate"" I seem to be about this primary season.  And they are absolutely right -- I am. There are many reasons for that passion -- foremost is the direction I have seen our country go since the beginning of the Bush administration.  My father, my uncle and my only male cousin all gave their lives for this country -- for the rights we have as Americans.  But with a few Presidential signing statements or things just not told to Congress, I have watched those rights eroded -- little by little, bit by bit.  I have seen the war in Iraq -- an unnecessary war -- which destroyed a country and killed 4000+ Americans and by some estimates 800,000 Iraqis' (most of them innocent). I have seen bad decision after bad decision trickle down to me -- to one layoff after another until now I can only get temporary or contract assignments which have no healthcare insurance.  I have two chronic medical conditions -- so ask me if I am better off than I was seven years ago.  I have seen my life go from being really great with a stable income and insurance to a battle just to continue to live day after day.  I am one of those people who has to split medications in half so the prescriptions will last longer. I have had to work under bosses who have absolutely no business in a civilized society much less supervising staff.  So, after working for people who have no idea how to run a business and to save gas -- I have started my own small business working on the internet from home.  Thank God my family believes in me for I have had to totally depend on them to keep everything going.  Soon, I am applying for a small business grant or loan from the government but I am sure with the Republicans in charge that will be a total nightmare also. I have watched while millions have lost their homes because of predatory lending companies selling very creative financing and also because so many owners have seen their jobs shipped overseas. I have also seen a surplus turn into a massive debt owned by countries who we have issues with.  Example China -- we owe them trillions and we have trade problems with them.  Now, you tell me, how do we go to our ""banker"" and complain about the way they are ""running their other businesses"". China uses the interest we pay on the debt to buy oil from the Sudanese government and remains Sudan's major weapons provider -- weapons which are passed down to armies who continue the genocide in Darfur. I have sat and watched one of our major cities destroyed by a hurricane and the government waiting a good week to help the people who lost everything.  What I still don't understand is if the news could show video of dead bodies floating in the flooded streets of New Orleans, why couldn't our government get there faster with water and other supplies?  (Heck of a job, Brownie!) Passionate - - passionate???  No -- actually I am damn angry ' I want my life back, my stable income with my healthcare benefits.  I am angry and I have no idea what to about it except to make sure that the next president will at least be a person who has a clue what is going on in this world.  And I guess if that doesn't work, I will join the movement to replace our government, which our Constitution tells us to do when the old government isn't working anymore."
15,Robert Shapiro on Bill Pavelic,politics," Robert Shapiro, one of the nation’s best-known attorneys is most notable for being part of the defense team which successfully defended O.J. Simpson. He is also a co-founder of LegalZoom and a partner of Christensen, Miller, Fink, Jacobs, Glaser, Weil & Shapiro, LLP, a full-service law firm with approximately 120 attorneys. In his book entitled, The Search For Justice: A Defense Attorney's Brief on the O.J. Simpson Case, Shapiro had many things to say about Bill Pavelic. Below are actual excerpts from The Search For Justice concerning Bill Pavelic…. ""....I then called my friend Bill Pavelic, a retired nineteen-year veteran of the L.A.P.D., with eleven of those years spent as a detective supervisor. Bill is perhaps the most anal-retentive, thorough investigator I have ever seen, and he is passionate about police integrity and behavior. During his time on the force, he received more than two hundred commendations, including ones from the U.S. Justice Department and Los Angeles County District Attorney Gil Garcetti. Pavelic misses nothing. Not only can he find the needle in the haystack, he can tell you who dropped it there and when. If there is a mistake made in police procedure, protocol, or timing, no matter how insignificant it may appear to the layman, he will find it. Most important, Pavelic himself has absolute integrity, as well as an indefatigable work ethic. When he agreed to come on the case, I felt that one of the strongest links in the chain had been forged....."" ""....This changed significantly when Bill Pavelic contacted Gary Randa, Cathy Randa's adult son, and in essence hired him as our video archivist. Gary's mission was to tape, each and every day, anything on television regarding O.J.'s case. That included news segments in the morning, both local and national, all the talk shows throughout the day, the evening news wrap-ups, and everything on Court TV and CNN. Every few days, the defense team and the investigators would go through the tapes, paying close attention to the ""court of public opinion'' that was transpiring outside our office door..."" Read more about Bill Pavelic at his official site, BillPavelic.com ""....In the meantime, Bill Pavelic was trying to find out who Ron Goldman was and where he fit into the mystery. Was he a boyfriend? Was he a bystander?..."" ""....So initially it appeared that we might have a reasonable basis for exploring a narcotics angle. Bill Pavelic was looking into the record of 911 calls in the area on the night of the murders; there had been reports of prowlers, and we couldn't dismiss the likelihood that if they were borne out, they could have some connection to the crime. At the very least, we had an obligation to investigate further, if only to rule out the possibility. Ultimately, our investigation was to discover much information about Nicole that was of an intimate and possibly inflammatory nature. It was relevant to the case and we chose not to use it as part of the defense. I choose not to use it now...."" Read more about Bill Pavelic at his official site, BillPavelic.com ""....And when we announced an 800 number, along with a $500,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the murderer(s), fiber-optic hell broke loose: within the first two weeks, Pacific Bell's voice-mail system had recorded and logged 250,000 calls - one a minute - which we then had to log and store on cassette tapes as part of the investigation. Callers who couldn't get through on the 800 number reverted to calling the office number. Every hour or so Bonnie had to ""dump"" the voice mail and then record the messages in her computer, deciding which ones were genuine and which ones were cranks, and pass them along to Bill Pavelic. We couldn't possibly deal with every call, but it was difficult to dismiss the possibility that among the callers who received radio signals in their fillings or saw the killer's name in their tea leaves might be the one solid lead we needed...."" ""....In addition to DNA, the issue I was most focused on was the search-and-seizure procedures of the investigating police officers. Armed with the L.A.P.D. procedures manual and his own extensive experience, Bill Pavelic began a log that cross referenced official procedure with what the police investigators had actually done at the crime scene. Very quickly, he came up with a damning list: they had failed to notify the coroner in the prescribed time; they had failed to complete individual chronology reports; they prepared erroneous property reports; they misrepresented the facts in the search warrant affidavit on the first day of the investigation; they carried forensic evidence from Bundy to Rockingham, rather than taking it to a lab; they didn't secure evidence (Nicole's home, O.J.'s car) in a timely manner; they used the crime scene at Bundy as a staging area for their investigation, using the phone inside the house to make their calls, and the furniture inside to sit on while they talked, rather than cordoning it off completely; and finally, of the chronology reports that were completed, not one was contemporaneous. No one, it seemed, made notes while they looked at their watches. No one had even looked at their watches. Pavelic was irate. As a senior police detective, he had actually been responsible for auditing the department's ""murder books,"" the step-by-step records investigating officers complete for each case. He well knew what an acceptable level of procedural error should be; in this case, they were way over their limit. ""I've never seen a police investigation so screwed up in the infancy stage,"" he told me. ""If there's an anatomy of how not to do an investigation, this might be it..."" Read more about Bill Pavelic at his official site, BillPavelic.com ""....The sudden prominence of Mark Fuhrman in the preliminary hearing rang all of Bill Pavelic's alarm bells. Prior to that, we'd barely been aware of Fuhrman's involvement in the case, let alone that he was a key - if not the key - police detective in the investigation, at least in the all-important first hours. In the early reports provided to us by the prosecution, Mark Fuhrman's name never appeared at all: He wasn't in the arrest reports filed on O.J. and A.C.; the property reports didn't mention him; the coroner's report didn't mention him; the June 15 follow-up report didn't mention him; the murder reports didn't mention him; the June 13 and June 28 search warrants and affidavits didn't mention him. Furthermore, nowhere was it stated, in any L.A.P.D. report, that Fuhrman was the one who discovered the glove at each scene...."" ""....Why are they shielding him?"" Bill wondered. He had a nodding acquaintance with Fuhrman; they'd both once moonlighted for Johnny Carson. In addition, we had reports that Fuhrman was involved in a lawsuit, in something called an officer-involved shooting"" case. Months before jury selection had begun and soon after Mark Fuhrman had testified in the televised preliminary hearing, Bill Pavelic reported that he was in communication with an attorney named Robert Deutsch, whose client Joseph J. Britton was suing the City of Los Angeles for excessive use of force. In the fall of 1993, Britton was apprehended while fleeing from a robbery which he'd committed. Mark Fuhrman had been one of the police officers involved, and he had reportedly fired ten rounds at Britton, both as he was falling and after he was down on the ground. Britton took five bullets, and his injuries were quite serious. Fuhrman's personnel records were included in the records Deutsch had compiled in the suit, which was eventually settled by the city for $100,000. As a consultant to Deutsch, Bill had done what he calls a ""biopsy'' of the case, reconstructing the time line in conjunction with the police logs and Britton's testimony. He came to a strong conclusion that the knife Britton had dropped while running from the police had later been planted near his body in order to justify the shooting...."" ""....After Fuhrman's televised session at the preliminary, we started receiving phone calls on both the 800-number line and the office lines, from attorneys who'd had dealings with Fuhrman, from anonymous police personnel, and from anonymous people who had known him. Everybody had a Mark Fuhrman story. Bonnie passed these messages on to Bill; Bill checked out the ones that he could. In the meantime, Gerry Uelmen and I immediately prepared a motion to obtain Fuhrman's police department personnel records, certain of which were already part of the lawsuit against him...."" Read more about Bill Pavelic at his official site, BillPavelic.com ""....In addition to the information we'd gathered on Mark Fuhrman's racial attitudes, we had also been contacted by a woman named Kathleen Bell. After talking to Bill Pavelic, Bell, a white woman, ultimately filed an affidavit with the court that reported a casual conversation she'd had with Fuhrman in the mid-eighties.  He'd told her that in his capacity as a policeman, he frequently pulled over cars driven by black men, for no particular legal reason, and he especially did so when he saw black men with white women. Mark Fuhrman had met Nicole in the mid-1980s when he was the responding officer on a call Nicole had made initially to the Westec security service. In that incident, she reported that O.J. had shattered a car windshield with a baseball bat. What, then, must have gone through his head when Fuhrman arrived at Bundy and realized who the murdered woman was?...."" ""....Bill Pavelic, our investigator, kept reminding me that the district attorney's office hadn't turned over to us the police logs and tapes for June 13. Some months before, he'd heard from a source inside the L.A.P.D. that Fuhrman and his partner, Detective Phillips, were using a department-issued cellular phone in the early morning hours of June 13. This source contended that Fuhrman and Phillips called from outside O.J.'s house to the West L.A. police station, where Sydney and Justin had been taken, and asked the watch commander to find out from the children where O.J. was. Pavelic's source reported that the kids had said something to the effect of ""out of town for business."" Therefore, contrary to what they'd testified in the preliminary, the police knew quite early that O.J. was not at Rockingham.  This meant the police had no reason to scale the wall in order to notify him or protect him from danger. Pavelic was adamant that we obtain the watch commander's log and the cellular phone records to document this call, because his informant was suggesting that it was made before the robbery/homicide detectives, Lange and Vannatter, were in the picture-which gave Fuhrman time to manipulate evidence...."" ""....Hodgman knows how important this stuff is,"" Pavelic fumed, ""and he and Clark are deliberately withholding it."" I told him there was a more likely explanation. ""It's the L.A.P.D. that doesn't want us to have it,"" I said, ""not the D.A. That's why they're stalling. I'll bring it up before Ito again, he's already told them at least once to turn it over. Don't worry, Bill, our chance will come...."" ""....Over the long Thanksgiving weekend, I visited O.J. twice, once on Thanksgiving Day itself, which, since he was away from his family, was a very hard day for him. On the following Monday, Bill Pavelic and I spent four hours at the jail, going over and over the now-familiar details with O.J. I suspected that if he took the stand he would be a typical witness-that is, not as good as he thought he would be. I often tell clients that they must learn to be witnesses. They must take their time, listen to questions, and answer them simply. Testimony is definitely not social discourse.  Over the course of the trial, Bill spent endless hours with O.J., keeping him informed and getting his input. During their conversations he subtly encouraged O.J. to control his constant storytelling impulses. In the time they spent together, the two men formed a bond of trust and true friendship. But that didn't mean O.J. didn't get as impatient with Bill as he did with the rest of us....."" ""....One day, in complete exasperation, O.J. said, ""Bill, I hope - this doesn't perjure me, and I haven't really told anyone until now, but I just remembered . . . somewhere, sometime that day, I spent some quality time in the head!...."" ""....Then Bill Pavelic called me to report a phone call he'd received from John McNally on Christmas Day. ""Hey, Bill,"" McNally had asked him, ""what're you going to do once Shapiro's bumped from the case?...."" ""....Pavelic was alarmed. ""Bob, you know the files that left your office? They didn't go to Florida,"" he said. ""Everything went to Cochran's office."" Linell had been monitoring the goings-on with a growing concern. ""Bob, something weird is going on here. What are they doing to you?...."" ""....In his carefully detailed report to Skip Taft a few weeks later, Bill Pavelic wrote that his investigation had revealed a systematic and elaborate campaign of disclosures to the press, principally to columnists for Eastern papers, CNN, and supermarket tabloids. The object . . . to denigrate Shapiro's skills and his ability to keep client confidences, and to enhance Bailey's own modest role in the case so far...."" Read more about Bill Pavelic at his official site, BillPavelic.com ""....Soon after the Bailey fallout, I was at home, on a conference call with Johnnie and Bill Pavelic. Bill was outlining the point by-point chronology of everything Bailey had done, in the weeks before I was in Hawaii, and in the days since, including the leaks to the press about conversations only the lawyers could've been privy to. I was adamant that Bailey be removed from this case, from anything having to do with O.J. and the upcoming trial...."" ""....On March 9, Detective Mark Fuhrman took the stand as another star witness for the prosecution, and a suddenly charming Marcia Clark treated him like he was a poster boy for apple pie and American values.  He had never been alone during the entire first morning of the investigation, he told her earnestly, except when he was taking notes.  Bill Pavelic believed that he hadn't taken contemporaneous notes but rather had carefully–and neatly–crafted his report much later, to support his version of those events. ..."" ""....Shortly after the Fourth of July weekend, our investigator Bill Pavelic informed me that a friend of mine, a lawyer from San Francisco, had called him several times about Mark Fuhrman. This lawyer was someone Bill had worked with before, on my recommendation. The lawyer was aware, as anyone paying even mild attention to the case would have been, that Mark Fuhrman was of key concern to the defense team. ""A lawyer in Los Angeles is offering to sell audiotapes of Mark Fuhrman that will blow your case wide open,"" our contact told Bill. He had heard this from two tabloid reporters, who were as curious to hear the tapes as one might expect but who were also concerned about being victims of some kind of scam..."" ""....The Los Angeles lawyer's name was Matthew Schwartz, and he represented someone named Laura Hart McKinney. She was a screenwriter and had recently interviewed Fuhrman as part of a film project she was trying to develop about Los Angeles cops. Schwartz stated that the tapes contained many, many examples of clear perjury on the race issue, and the use of the ""N"" word in particular. Furthermore, they were a police ""textbook"" on framing blacks and planting evidence. There were fifteen hours of tape, approximately three hundred transcript pages.  The bidding price of these tapes was slated to start at $250,000...."" ""....A licensed attorney making these representations would expose himself to major criminal liability if he was trying to perpetrate a scam. I tried to maintain my own skepticism while hoping all the while that Schwartz and his tapes were for real. I instructed Bill to pursue whatever avenues he could to find out if the tapes existed, and if they actually contained what the lawyer and Schwartz said they did. Bill Pavelic needed to act as fast as he could. If what the lawyer was telling us was true, I figured we had about one day to stay ahead of a tabloid bidding war. I didn't intend to meet or match anybody's price; I wanted the tapes subpoenaed...."" ""....Pavelic was told how to contact Matt Schwartz and Laura McKinney. In turn, Bill instructed the lawyer to call Carl Douglas and investigator Pat McKenna. Douglas would prepare the subpoena; McKenna was supposed to serve it. However, Gary Randa, Cathy Randa's son, got the subpoena assignment instead. When he went to Matt Schwartz's office, he was told that Schwartz was ""on vacation."" The person who told him this, we later discovered, was Matt Schwartz, who evidently wanted to keep the bidding war open...."" ""....The television tabloid show Hard Copy knew about the tapes; so, suddenly, did a lot of reporters. It was time to go directly to the source-McKinney-and to do that we had to go to North Carolina, where she now lived...."" Read more about Bill Pavelic at his official site, BillPavelic.com"
16,The Folly of Making Ethanol from Food Crops,politics," Why is it that stupid ideas find so many followers?   European Governments, the US Federal Government, and an increasing number of US State Governments have issued legislation that requires the use of ethanol in cars. Making ethanol from corn was promoted by the US agricultural lobby as the best approach for producing biofuels.  None of the decision makers listened to the advice of scientists, who pointed out correctly, that the benefits of ethanol were minute.  Ethanol is incapable of reducing consumption of petroleum-derived fuels and of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Almost all of the food producing acreage in the US must be converted to growing corn before a sizeable reduction in foreign petroleum imports can be expected. For the agricultural lobby the financial rewards of the ethanol craze have been spectacular.  When future prices of corn began to escalate, more and more farmers decided to plant corn in favor of other crops like soybean and wheat.  Predictably, food prices started soaring. Now we must deal with the sorry political mess that the ethanol subsidy of the US Federal Government has left behind.  Poor countries have been hit hard with escalating prices for grains and other basic food staples.  Protests are growing across the globe demanding price reductions or price controls.  Demonstrations are stoking social unrest in many countries.  Demands are growing to prohibit the production of biofuels altogether. What originally began as an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and an attempt to reduce consumption of fossil fuels and petroleum, may instead be perceived as a worldwide failure of renewable biofuels.  Such result would be unfortunate and ultimately disastrous. We know for sure that petroleum reserves are getting scarce and will be depleted soon.  We know for sure that global warming is caused by greenhouse gases produced by fossil fuel combustion.  We know for sure that economies will begin to fail, when liquid motor fuels become scarce and unaffordable. We must replace fossil petroleum sources with an alternate source for liquid fuels or world economies are doomed to fail and contract.  Only biomass meets the requirements for such a new energy source.  However, virtually all the biomass crops, which are being used, have one common shortcoming.  Instead of using plants with exceptionally high energy yields, we are converting low-energy food crops into ethanol, a low-energy fuel. Only high-energy crops can become the savior of our huge transportation sector.  The wellbeing of this sector is absolutely vital for the continuing functioning of world economies.  Famines will result if we convert instead low-energy food crops into liquid fuels.  There are not enough arable lands on this Earth to provide food for an additional three billion people during the next fifty years and grow simultaneously sufficient amounts of low-energy biomass for replacing petroleum as source for liquid motor fuels. Substitution of petroleum with motor fuels derived from coal or oil shale is not sensible, either.  These synthetic fuels will increase greenhouse gas emissions and will accelerate global warming.  Therefore, there remains only one single choice for securing the supply of affordable transportation fuels; we must learn to convert high-energy biomass into standard motor fuels. This will involve the development of new approaches and new technologies for finding, breeding, and growing high-energy crops on fallow and arid lands.  We must protect tropical and primal forests and we must assure that arable lands are sustained properly.  Arable lands will become scarce and must be protected from exploitation. The world has huge areas of deserts and arid lands with exceptionally high solar irradiation.  We must learn to grow biomass with high-energy yields on these ignored and neglected lands.  We must develop new irrigation and cultivating technologies for arid areas and we must learn how to achieve high-energy biomass harvests without excessive water use and without the wasteful and expensive fertilizer runoff. High-energy plants need plenty of sunshine.  We must breed new high-energy plant hybrids and we must develop new agricultural techniques that are effective under these adverse conditions.  We must prevent exploitation of forests across the world and we must find ways to protect and preserve tropical and primal forests. It is mandatory that we bring the recent inflationary wave of food prices under control soon.  It is important that we prevent any speculative manipulation of grain prices and that we avoid any irrational reactions to this artificial food crisis. Above all, we must not blame the concept of renewable biofuels for the artificially created food crisis.  Liquid fuels from biomass are our only hope for simultaneously controlling global overheating and preventing hyperinflation of liquid fuel prices. If we fail to succeed in this crucial and fateful endeavor, we must prepare the world for the collapse of world economies and the disappearance of civilizations."
17,The Campfires of Fools,politics," While Obama, Clinton, and McCain tell their flag-waving supporters about what a wonderful country we have and they all sing out ""God Bless America"", these politicians know, if the others don't, that at that very moment evil is taking place in Guantanamo Prison and in a half dozen other prisons as it did in Abu Ghraib. Let us all be grateful that this Jehovah, like Allah, is only a paper god, because a god who went to the trouble to carve the Ten Commandments in stone would make it clear to us that it was not the Ten Suggestions that Moses brought down from Mount Sinai. The United States, with the exception of the first twenty-five years or so of its beginning, has never been what we have laid claim to, but it did at least bear a resemblance to the image that was disseminated to the world. Nevertheless, the desire for control and the fear of losing this newfound diamond in the rough began the slow process of undermining every decent principle this country was built on. Still, brave men and women with more integrity than greed did a reasonably good job of keeping the ungodly, self-serving sociopaths from seizing total control. That all ended the moment George H. W. Bush and his gang sit up shop in the Oval Office in 1981. The old actor, Ronald Reagan, was hired to play the part of headmaster, and he gave an Academy Award performance; but policy, especially foreign policy, was not his to command. Those policies were drawn up in the basement of the Department of Defense and were implemented by the Central Intelligence Agency. Having worked in the sewers of the Federal government since 1958, I can tell you that it's not humans, but pit vipers that crawl in and out of the CIA headquarters located in Langley, VA. One can only pity the uneducated young fools who consider Osama bin Laden the creator of terrorism. Official documents from the U.S. government, formerly classified as Top Secret and Eyes Only for the President, were recently declassified, thanks to the Freedom of Information Act. These documents indicate that between October 1960 and April 1961, in Cuba alone, the CIA introduced 75 tons of explosives in 30 secret aerial missions, and 45 tons of weapons and explosives in 31 Marine infiltrations. These materials were used to perpetrate 310 attacks with bombs, derail 6 trains, and set fire to 150 factories and 800 plantations. Between 1959 and 2003, more than 800 terrorist attacks were performed, including 78 bombings against civil populations and 61 airplanes hijacked. These documents also linked CIA agent and Cuban exile, Luis Posada Carriles, with many terrorist attacks, including the bombing of a Cuban airliner in 1976 that killed 73 people. As for biological aggressions, the African Swine Fever Virus was introduced, forcing the sacrifice of half a million pigs. During the ""Reagan and Bush Sr. administrations"", the dengue hemorrhagic fever was introduced, affecting about 344,203 persons, with the record case of 11,400 who fell ill in a single day-July 6, 1981. Like all other humans on earth, I cannot present one ounce of proof that humankind was ever destroyed by a flood. I suspect this interesting little story about Noah and his Ark is like the Jonah and the whale yarn, meant to be used for entertainment only, not fodder for a holy book. But, let there be no doubt that the right-wing idiots’ jokes about global warming will wilt and crumble right along with their great, great grandchildren. Be it God or man, the world as we now know it will be changed forever by the campfires of fools."
18,Deforestation,politics," Deforestation is basically the loss or destruction of forest habitat, primarily from the action of human beings. It is the single largest source of land- use greenhouse gas emissions, and accounts for around 18 -20% of global greenhouse gas emissions. We know from a previous article, trees and vegetation act as sinks or stores for carbon dioxide, one of the most important greenhouse gases. Stored carbon taken out of the atmosphere by photosynthesis through decades of growth is released back into the atmosphere as vegetation and trees are cut down and burnt, or, as unburned organic matter slowly dies. This process contributes to atmospheric CO2 levels. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) who are the leading source for information on the status of the worlds forests define forests as, ""land with a tree canopy of greater than 10%, and an area of more than half a hectare"". The organisation defines deforestation as, "" the conversion of forest to another land use or long term reduction of the tree canopy cover below the minimum 10% threshold."" Land change and co2. Land use changes are driven almost entirely by emissions caused through deforestation, which is highly concentrated in a few countries. Indonesia contributes approximately 30% of land use CO2 emissions with Brazil around 20%.  It is estimated that about 80,000 acres or 32,000 hectares are being lost every day. This is the equivalent of about 117,000 km2, (45,173 sq miles) each year. Total world rainforest cover is now about 6 million km2, (2,316,602 sq miles), which equates to about 5% of Earth's land surface. Only a few thousand years ago, rainforests covered about 12% of the worlds land surface, around 15.5 million km2, (6 million sq miles). A quick calculation reveals that if forest cover is being lost at the rate of 117,000 km2 a year, then it will only take in the region of 51 years for the world's rainforests to be destroyed! (6,000,000 divided by 117,000). Destruction at this level would lead to the release of vast amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere, further thickening the CO2 ""blanket"" that surrounds our planet and no doubt lead to an increased warming of the atmosphere. Between 2000 and 2006 Brazil lost nearly 150,000km2, (57,915 sq miles) of forest, an area the size of Greece, and since 1970 over 600,000 km2, (231,660 sq miles) has been destroyed. It is now estimated that almost 20% of the Amazon has been destroyed, which is considerably alarming when one considers that the Amazon rainforest represents about 50% of the worlds tropical rainforests. There are various causes for deforestation, and they include, Cattle ranching, Activities of farmers, fires, mining and road construction and of course logging and commercial agriculture. It's not entirely fair to blame the developing nations for all the deforestation however. Whilst countries like Brazil and Indonesia may be the main culprits now, up until the early 20th Century emissions of CO2 through land use changes came from developed nations. It's a natural step for developing nations to clear forest-land for agriculture and habitation. The fact is that as developed nations have already deforested many areas long ago, there is more pressure on developing nations to preserve what is left. Of course population growth is another major factor which will be discussed in a later chapter.  Another significant point is that trees in topical forests typically hold on average about 50% more carbon per hectare than trees outside the tropics. Therefore deforestation in these areas causes greater amounts of CO2 to be released into the atmosphere than deforestation outside of the tropics. Future of the forests. Remarkably when talking about land use change emissions, countries such as the USA, Europe and China were in the year 2000 net absorbers of CO2 as a result of their aforestation (planting new forests) and reforestation (re establishing old forest areas) programs. However, the planting of one tree does not offset the damage caused by the removal of another, as trees absorb CO2 very slowly. It could take 100 years for a growing tree to recover all the CO2 released when a mature tree is cut down!. For this reason, carbon offset programs which suggest planting a tress to offset co2 produced are pretty worthless, due to the time it would take for that tree to remove co2 from the atmosphere. There is some good news however, as in 2006 the Brazilian government announced a sharp drop in deforestation. Loss for the year 2005/6 was 13,100 km2, (5,057 sq miles) down more than 40% from the year before.  Its too early to say whether this is a declining trend, or just one good year out of the previous eight where deforestation levels were all in excess of 16,000 km2, (6,177 sq miles). As the worlds forests are being destroyed, huge amounts of CO2 are being released back into the atmosphere. The forests that were once able to absorb and store this potent greenhouse gas, will no longer be standing which will push CO2 levels up higher, thereby contributing to the warming of Earth's climate."
19,Boycotting Beijing: A History of Politics at the Olympic Games,politics," China recently demonstrated its willingness to brutally suppress stirrings of Tibetan sentiment. Angry protestors in Paris and elsewhere then seized the occasion of the Olympic torch's passing to express their ire toward the hosts of this year's Games. Some foreign dignitaries have acknowledged that they will not attend certain events, and others have refused to confirm that they will travel to Beijing at all. The big B-word has been vocalized. However it is unlikely that a large-scale boycott will come to pass for two reasons.  The first is that the fate of most economic powers is now more closely intertwined with China's than they would care to admit; for practical reasons, they are not inclined to antagonize a Chinese government which has made clear that any boycott will be considered a national insult.  The second is that more than three months remain before the opening of the Games.  The human mind often maintains a very short-term horizon; it is likely that the current uproar will soon come to pass.  China, newly aware of the foreign attentiveness, will defer further hammering of domestic political opponents until the closing ceremony. But as the specter of a boycott is raised, what does the action of Olympic boycott really mean?  ""One of the basic principles of the Olympic Games is that politics plays no part whatsoever in them."" These are the words of Avery Brundage, then chairman of the U.S. Olympic Committee, in 1936.  Brundage and the American political leaders of the time sent American athletes to compete at Munich in the Games hosted by Hitler's rising Nazi Germany.  The black American sprinter Jesse Owens claimed four gold medals; Hitler refused to shake his hand or present the medals to him on the stand.  These were the early days of the Olympic stadium as the arena of high politics. Athletes have since on various occasions used the Olympics for the articulation of political messages (or in 1972, once again in Munich, as a stage of political action; the capture of eleven Israeli athletes by Palestinian gunmen reached an ending only with their deaths after a botched rescue attempt).  The first large-scale boycotts of the Games came shortly thereafter. Most think first of the American-led boycott of the 1980 Moscow games when confronted with the notion of Olympic boycott.  But the truth is that the first mass-scale politically motivated absences came at the previous 1976 games in Montreal.  In that year, a group of twenty-eight African nations refused to participate in protest at New Zealand's presence.  South Africa had been banned from the Games since 1964 because of its apartheid regime of institutionalized racism, and these countries were angered by the previous year's South African tour of New Zealand's 'All Blacks' rugby union.  Iraq and Guyana too joined the boycott when the International Olympic Committee refused to bar New Zealand from participating.  Also in 1976, the IOC refused to allow Taiwan to participate under the name ""Republic of China"", leaving only the People's Republic of China (Beijing) to carry that name.  Taiwan would only compete again in 1984 under a new flag and the name ""Chinese Taipei"". After the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, U.S. President Jimmy Carter issued an ultimatum stating that the United States would boycott the Moscow games of 1980 if Soviet troops did not withdraw by February of that year.  When Soviet troops remained, the boycott was joined by Japan, West Germany, Canada, China and sixty others.  The United Kingdom, France and Greece were sympathetic to the boycott but allowed their athletes to participate of their own volition if they so wished.  Italy's government also supported the boycott.  Those of its athletes who were members of the military corps did not compete. In 1984, the U.S.S.R. responded by refusing to take part in the Los Angeles games, citing ""chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-Soviet hysteria being whipped up in the United States"".  The U.S.S.R. was joined by thirteen of its allies, while post-revolution Iran also joined, making it the only nation to boycott both the 1980 and 1984 games. In any gathering of international delegations, sporting or otherwise, political tensions are bound to run high.  My favorite story comes from the 1956 Melbourne Olympics in which Hungary and the Soviet Union engaged in an impassioned water polo match as Soviet tanks rumbled into Budapest.  The water was, the story goes, tinged red at the match's end.  Melbourne concomitantly saw the first-ever Olympic boycotts; the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland refused to attend because of the events in Hungary, while Cambodia, Egypt, Iraq and Lebanon boycotted owing to the Suez crisis. For better or for worse the Olympics have become the playing ground of high politics.  However it is a high politics that remains highly symbolic.  Should any major powers eventually choose to boycott Beijing, it would serve only to showcase their unwillingness and inability to press for real change to China's abominable human rights record.

20,10 Patriotic Quotes to Celebrate Cinco De Mayo,politics," You read it right -- these ten patriotic quotes are to celebrate Cinco De Mayo, an often misunderstood holiday. Many Americans do not understand the significance of the holiday. Many believe it is strictly a Mexican affair. I'm here to tell you that Cinco De Mayo should be celebrated by Americans too! After all, the celebration of the holiday has to do with Mexico defeating the French, which prevented Napoleon (who hated the United States) from supplying the confederate rebels for another year. With that in mind, here are ten patriotic quotes celebrating Cinco De Mayo and democracy in general! ""Cinco de Mayo has come to represent a celebration of the contributions that Mexican Americans and all Hispanics have made to America."" ~ Joe Baca ""If liberty and equality, as is thought by some, are chiefly to be found in democracy, they will be best attained when all persons alike share in the government to the utmost."" ~ Aristotle ""People often say that, in a democracy, decisions are made by a majority of the people. Of course, that is not true. Decisions are made by a majority of those who make themselves heard and who vote - a very different thing."" ~ Walter H. Judd ""Democracy is the government of the people, by the people, for the people."" ~ Abraham Lincoln Freedom is when the people can speak, democracy is when the government listens."" ~ Alastair Farrugia ""I like to see a man proud of the place in which he lives.  I like to see a man live so that his place will be proud of him."" ~ Abraham Lincoln  7. ""Honor to the soldier, and Sailor everywhere, who bravely bears his country's cause. Honor also to the citizen who cares for his brother in the field, and serves, as he best can, the same cause."" ~ Abraham Lincoln ""The history of every country begins in the heart of a man or woman."" ~ Willa Cather ""True patriotism hates injustice in its own land more than anywhere else."" ~ Clarence Darrow ""There is something magnificent in having a country to love."" ~James Russell Lowell So on the fifth of May, when you see the flags and the celebration of Cinco de Mayo, understand that it is not just Mexico that is being celebrated. It is victory, democracy and a love of one's heritage.  Why not invite friends over for a Cinco De Mayo party and educate them as well?"

1,Political Corruption in New York State,politics," State officials take down a respected health care facility because they were too successful. Despite the recent atrocities in New York that caused the removal of a now former Governor, Eliot Spitzer, what most people are unaware of is that the corruption doesn't stop there.  The State of New York has been trying to lower its Medicaid spending for a while.  The Medicaid system provides a health care benefit to the indigent population, funded in part by the State.  However, behind closed doors, the State recognizes that the indigent population is predominately a population that doesn't vote, so depriving them of benefits usually doesn't have many consequences to politicians. When figuring the majority of the Medicaid expense, it doesn't take too much to determine that most of the money is going toward paying for substance abuse treatment.  Statistics indicate that a large portion of the Medicaid population require some type of alcohol and/or drug treatment.  Therefore, State politicians found that an inordinate amount of Medicaid dollars were going to substance abuse treatment facilities.  These facilities aren't billing Medicaid illegally.  It just so happens that a great number of patients covered under the Medicaid program require alcohol/drug treatment. Since politicians are not known for their business skills or ability to properly manage money, New York State officials, in their infinite wisdom, felt that the only way to control Medicaid spending was the take down the medical facilities that were billing the most.  It didn't matter to the State that these facilities were billing Medicaid legally, nor did it matter to them that patients were actually getting better by receiving the treatment services that they needed.  Behind the scenes, the State launched a diabolical plan to systematically destroy large alcohol and drug treatment centers in New York in an effort to cut spending. Crossings Recovery Centers was one of the State's victims.  Crossings was the largest provider of outpatient substance abuse treatment on Long Island up until 2006 when the New York State of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services (OASAS) conjured up some bogus charges, devising an excuse to shut the agency down.  Up until then, Crossings had not had any blemishes on its record in the almost 2 decades that their clinics had been in existence.  In an effort to justify their unlawful actions, the State of New York had to claim that Crossings had numerous violations but the fact is, Crossings was targeted in accordance with the State's efforts to bring down agencies that were successful. Frank Buonanotte, the former CEO of Crossings Recovery Centers is in the process of suing OASAS, the State of New York and Henry Zwack, who was the State's spin doctor.  At the time, Zwack was the head of the General Counsels office at OASAS.  Prior to that, Zwack was ousted from his position as County Executive of Rensselaer County as a result of several counts of corruption.  Henry Zwack had 15 indictments under his belt before he participated in the deliberate destruction of Crossings.  Now Zwack is a judge in the New York State Court of Claims.  Who knows how much havoc he's causing there. Buonanotte won his first bit of success in his lawsuit against the State when a Federal Court judge dismissed the State's motion to dismiss the case.  The Judge felt that there was enough evidence of wrong doing on the State's part to proceed with a trial.  Buonanotte expects depositions to begin this summer and plans on being in front of a jury in the fall of 2008.  Buonanotte is suing Henry Zwack and the former Commissioner of OASAS, Shari Noonan in Federal Court and is suing OASAS in the New York State Court of Claims.  The irony of this case is that Buonanotte's lawsuit against the State is to the tune of $90 Million which is far more than Crossings had ever billed Medicaid for treatment. Neither Frank Buonanotte nor Crossings were charged with Medicaid fraud.  Only petty paper violations that Buonanotte describes as ""dotting i's and crossing t's"" citations.  Such citations could be found in any medical facility across the State.  It also appears as if the State of New York has targeted other substance abuse treatment agencies in the same corrupt manner in which they did Crossings.  There is now a 6-8 week waiting period before patients can be treated at any of the existing alcohol and drug treatment centers on Long Island.  Oddly enough, no one has been able to realize that this is the reason why DWIs and alcohol/drug related crimes and deaths are at an all-time high on Long Island. Everyone wants their taxes to be lower but at what expense?  Another question is how much more will it cost taxpayers in terms of crime and wrongful deaths to have alcoholics and drug addicts go untreated?  An even better question is how much will it cost taxpayers to pay for the State's unlawful actions if Buonanotte wins his lawsuit?"
2,Three Challenges Defining Social-Political Sustainability,politics," The subtle difference between pure social development and social-political sustainability is very central to the pursuit of sustainable development. Just as economic development accomplishes little if the achievements heralded are unsustainable, so too must social enrichment go hand in hand with a concerted effort to ensure its persistent viability. Open, contested political arenas offer the only means to this end—arenas that are contested by you. These three phenomena endanger the sustainability of our social-political processes; they beg our devoted attention. The most insidious danger of all is that of prevalent political apathy.  If the population at large cannot be convinced that its fate is sufficiently at stake to engage itself actively, then all hope surely is lost.  The causes of apathy are many; clearly the simplest is inner-focused individuals who are more concerned with personal than societal enrichment, or who believe that the benefits derived from social engagement will not be commensurate with the time and resources invested.  This phenomenon can be likened to game theory and political science notions of the ""tragedy of the commons"".  A related cause of political apathy is blind faith in social and political institutions.  But we must remember Sartre's espousal of the one who ""is loyal to a political and social ensemble, and who never ceases to contest it"".  There is no contradiction in believing that a nation's social and political processes are the best ever conceived by mankind, and still rising every morning to challenge them.  Indeed, this is the very essence of democracy. The existence of social inertia is different from apathy.  We human beings are creatures of habit.  Even when informed and acknowledging of specific problems, we can be resistant to the specter of addressing them aggressively via political mechanisms if so doing entails a rupture with time-honored cultural tradition.  In a 2006 poll, eighty-five percent of Americans indicated their belief that global warming is ""probably happening"", while half asserted that the issue of global warming is ""extremely important"" to them.  Yet the ubiquity of single-occupant vehicles on America's highways remains undiminished. When the general populace is involved and engaged, this can often pose problems of social-political inefficiency.  This issue can be particularly acute in nations which are large in population and geography.  An inability to reach consensus can sometimes lead to paralysis.  Under an autocratic establishment, the government can execute changes to social-political institutions with an alacrity that is sometimes enviable.  But this, of course, is not consultative; sustainability of the social-political dimension is only ensured in the long run if it is reflective of the collective will.  A different sort of social-political inefficiency arises when there is no obstruction to consensus but when channels for initiating change (particularly in the judiciary) are constrained, convoluted or overloaded. Political apathy and social inertia can only be combated in ongoing daily efforts to inform, arouse and provoke.  Happily, social-political inefficiency can be addressed more methodically.  Governments, businesses, non-governmental and not-for-profit organizations alter and influence the state of our social and natural environment every day.  Actors which seek to bridge the gap between these entities and the general populace and to facilitate their interaction, aided by extraordinary new technologies of participation, have a grand role to play in the future of social-political sustainability. An evocation of these challenges would not be complete without a consideration of the dynamic interactions the social-political domain engenders with other elements of sustainable development.  Economics is the science of resource allocation, the study of the ways in which we satisfy human wants and needs.  No human need is more fundamental than that of nourishment.  In a revealing illustration of the interdependence of sustainable development's three constituent parts, rising world food prices now pose a grave threat to social-political sustainability around the globe.  One need only turn to recent social unrest and political instability in Haiti, Egypt and the Philippines to be assured of that.  These rising prices stem from uncertainties regarding the sustainability of our agricultural processes.  To be specific, some have very explicitly cited efforts in the West to subsidize and encourage biofuels production as a leading inflationary factor (though burgeoning middle classes in India and China seem surely to be responsible for other upward price pressures).  And all this as the viability of biofuels falls under a penetrating scrutiny. These challenges of social-political sustainability will remain inextricably bound to the future of sustainability as an enterprise."
3,Are Republicans Thugs?,politics," In order to answer the question, Are Republicans Thugs?, it'll take coming to grips with the fact that the Republican Party is not the same party one's grandparents voted for. To grasp what has taken place, one must understand that from the late 1800s thru the mid-1900s, the Democratic Party was controlled by the unions in the United States. At that time, the US manufactured 90% of the goods Americans used and 30% of those used in other countries; the Democrats ruled through labor. Although there was enough lies and stealing going on to tilt Earth on its axis, the jobs and money stayed in the United States. That made for a very strong country and dollar. Business owners who weren’t happy with just making a living, in many cases less net income than the union bosses, set out to fight political corruption with political corruption. They started heaping money and favors on Republican politicians who were, for the most part, considered political nerds by the Democrats. While these politicians were by no stretch of the imagination nerds, they were a minority. Gaining a little dignity and getting even was a far stronger pull than doing well for their country, especially since they had no real say in the status quo anyway. With the new money, these Republican voices began to be heard. They were being heard because these business owners did another very smart thing--they cut back or closed down the businesses that the unions were controlling and bought newspapers, radio stations and all other forms of the media and then set out to destroy their arch enemy, the unions. While the cigar-smoking, do-nothing Democrats were telling jokes about the nerds who had actually won a couple of unexpected seats in Congress, the American voters were not laughing; but the American business owners were starting to smirk. The Republican Party's rise to power was nothing short of Cinderella or Robin Hood, at least for a brief moment. As the leaves fall in late autumn because of the lack of nutrients, so did the infrastructure and well-being of the United States. It is very easy to see how this corporate leadership has just about destroyed the greatest country in the history of the world in just a few short years. Whereas 90% of the revenues of corporate America stayed at home under union control, and was divided up reasonably equal by those doing the work, the new Republicans and their bosses divided the money using a ¼ split system. Top management took a ¼ from the top regardless of the outcome of their leadership, they sent a ¼ to their political puppets, another ¼ was sent out of the country for cheap labor, and they graciously allowed Americans to divvy up the rest however they saw fit. One might argue that this still left 3/4 of the money in the US, and that would be true. The problem is half of that money was split up between 300,000 instead of 300,000,000. Add to that the fact that a large percentage of this money went into tax free shelters that were then invested in the overseas companies that were getting the jobs once done by Americans, and it's a triple whammy. Being a Republican, I can't say for sure if we're thugs or not; but if we're not, we'll do until some thugs come along."
4,"Anti-Terrorist Campaigns, U.S.A., 1900-02, 1905-07",politics," 1900–1902 The Philippine Insurrection is an American term for what a number of Philippine historians would call The Philippine Revolution for Independence. The first Philippine leader of the Insurrection/Revolution was a charismatic young man called Emilio Aguinaldo y Famy who started a rebellion against the Spanish in 1896.  When he won a few victories the Spanish offered him a bribe of a half million dollars if he would lay down his arms and go into exile, which he did. Aguinaldo returned to the Philippines during the Spanish American War and helped capture Manila.  He then declared himself President of the Philippine Republic, that the Islands were now independent, and that the Americans should leave. But President McKinley did not feel that ""the little brown men"" were ready for self-rule, had no idea of democratic self-rule, and that Aguinaldo would become a dictator.  McKinley’s well meant, but decidedly ""racial superiority,"" views were encouraged by American Missionary and business interests. Therefore, Aguinaldo’s movement had to be suppressed for ""the good of the Philippine people"" even though either by desire or coercion most of the native population appeared to support him. Frank King and his outfit, Company G, Eighth Infantry were sent to Malolos the former insurgent capitol where they set up camp. From there they fought to Laguna, north west of Malolos where they experienced the horror of ambush in the sea of grass that grew five to eight feet high that was suddenly alive with rebel faces swinging deadly machetes with great accuracy.  Frank saw his friend Dan beheaded with one stroke! The campaign carried Company G to San Marcos and Calumpet without apprehending Aguinaldo.  For the rest of 1900-1901 they went on numerous expeditions until March 24, 1902 when Aguinaldo surrendered, took an oath of allegiance to the American Flag and retired to his home at Kawit. Company G, Eighth Infantry returned to the United States in June of 1902. 1905–1907 In March 1905, the Eighth Infantry returned to the Philippines to Fort San Pedro on the Island of Panay.  They were there because despite Aguinaldo’s surrender in 1902, some bands of insurgents still harassed and killed the ""American invaders"" whenever they could catch them unaware. This campaign was the real anti-terrorist campaign that would be labeled as such even in the early years of the twenty-first century. On the island of Leyte the insurgents were a band of natives called the Pulajanes, whose leader was Faustino Ablen who had been an illiterate small farmer near Ormoc.  But at the age of thirty two, he organized a fanatical religious movement called the Dios-Dios or God-God movement, and declared himself a prophet who had supernatural powers.  He would absent himself from time to time, saying upon his return that he had been on a visit to heaven. Beginning in 1903 his movement became violent making repeated attacks, killing and robbing American soldiers and others. He suffered a major loss in 1905 just prior to Company G, Eighth Infantry’s arrival.  Thereafter he employed hit and run tactics becoming active and then disappearing. For fifteen months Frank’s outfit searched the jungles for him without capturing him but decimating the ranks of his followers. Ablen, who had renamed his group the Pulajan or ""Reds Organization"" suddenly attacked Buranen, killed six policemen and stole fourteen rifles and a revolver.  The Eighth Infantry continued to pursue him throughout 1906 and early 1907 without capturing him. Ablen was a great organizer.  He had divided his followers into two groups, the larger group grew crops to feed the organization and the smaller group ""the warriors"" did the fighting. He was still the Prophet, healer, and divine delegate.  He now gave to each follower ""anting-antings"" or pieces of cloth or papers inscribed with nonsensical words or characters.  If they wore these mask-like cloths over the whites of their eyes then they would not be harmed.  If they were, they would go straight to heaven! But after many expeditions and a number of American casualties, Frank was one of the fifteen men of Company G to set out on another expedition on May 29, 1907.  The next day they captured Ablen’s wife and child. Their force of fifteen was augmented by twelve more men  and they continued deeper into Panlanayan country. Finally on June 12th, 1907, they captured a badly wounded Faustino Ablen and the campaign was over."
5,Foreign Aid and Why it should stop,politics," Foreign aid. Watching a recent political debate between parties, I was struck at the opposites of what the debate was on and the advertisements coming at the breaks. While the politicians of this great nation were discussing the rate of homeless now in the country, the number of families living below the poverty line, the number of students who are unable to read, the number of jobs lost, and the number of foreclosures happening there was an advertisement of one of our tax paid politicians promoting aid for a third world country. I have been unable to get a straight answer from any of the local politicians that represent my district to a simple question. How much money is spent each year in foreign aid. Foreign aid to make sure other people of other countries get the medical treatment they desperately need. Foreign aid to building housing. Foreign aid to give food to those that are hungry. Foreign aid to build schools to educate their children. Why is the United States trying to take care of other nations when it can not take care of its own people. We allow so many foreigners to come into our country both legally and illegally and we support them. The government helps them realize the 'Great American Dream'. Yet that same dream is out of reach of the average American today. Scholarships are given to those coming here to study, when many of our own children can not read let alone pay for a college education. I was interviewing an elderly woman in March about her social giving back to the community, she got up to take her medication and was cutting it in half. I asked her if she needed help and her reply was no, but thank you. She went on to explain that she cuts her medication in half so it lasts longer as she can not afford to pay for taking the prescribed amount. These things are amazingly difficult for me to understand with the knowledge that millions perhaps even trillions of dollars are sent out from our own government to other countries for economic aid. I get angry when I see my tax dollars paying for a politician to travel overseas to see if the foreign aid we have sent is being used to help the people, especially when while there they take the publicity opportunity to do a paid endorsement commercial for a private organization trying to raise money to help this other nation. If Oprah wants to send her personal money to Africa, that is her prerogative. It should not be the prerogative of our government to spend our tax dollars outside our country for anyone's aid. Especially when they turn around and cut programs for our children, elders, jobs, or any number of programs. Where is the accountability to our own tax paying citizens?"
6,Citizenship and Immigration,politics," For many Americans, their U.S. citizenship issued at birth is something they don’t think twice about. But for applying immigrants, citizenship is a serious goal. Hopefully most American natural born citizens understand that citizenship is one of the most greatly desired gifts this country’s government can bestow on its citizens. For those of us who have not had to go through the process of becoming a U.S Citizen apart from being naturally born here, there is only one other way to become U.S. citizens and that is by the often times-lengthy process of what is known as ""naturalization"". Naturalization can often times be a complicated process so you should consult with an immigration lawyer rather than attempting this yourself. Even something as simple as travel within the country or state is something that a person needs to know the rules about and this is where an Immigration lawyer is needed so that you have someone to ask questions such as ""How long does it take for USCIS to issue work permission and travel permission?"" or ""When should I renew my work and travel permission?"" Learning about your new country and its rights and the responsibilities that accompany citizenship is an important part of being a good citizen and at the USCIS and the Office of Citizenship they have developed a great amount of resources and a variety of educational materials that allow immigrants to learn more about U.S. history and government as they prepare for the naturalization test. A final thought on the naturalization process; in addition to finding good counsel and being represented by an immigration lawyer, there are general requirements that the USCIS will look for by those who look to make our great country their home, to name just a few: good moral character, a knowledge and understanding of U.S. history and government, and favorable disposition toward the United States."
7,Immigrant Visas and Non Immigrant Visas,politics," What is a visa and how does it relate to immigration? If you’re a citizen of this country by birth, either within the territory of the United States or to U.S. citizen parents, most Americans don’t know how visas work. But if you’re a citizen of a foreign country you will need one to come into the United States. A visa is an application to enter the United States not a permit. It has been read by a consular officer at the American embassy or consulate and has been reviewed for the determination of eligibility to enter the United States for a specific purpose. There are different types of visas and one in particular is the ‘B-1 Visitor for Business’ which permits a foreign national to enter the U.S. to conduct business associated with international trade or commerce. This particular visa would also allow you to travel to the United States as far as the port of entry (airport or land border crossing) and ask the immigration officer to allow you to enter the country. The immigration officer would then allow you entrance and also decide for what length of time you would be permitted to stay for that particular visit. Matters of responsibility to immigration are that of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. U.S. visas fall into two categories: immigrant and nonimmigrant. The differences are as such; for those whom intend to live permanently within the U.S. the Immigration visa is considered, and for those with a permanent residence outside of the U.S. and are only temporary visitors for such things as medical treatment, business, temporary work or study this would be the visa for them. Now with regards to the nonimmigrant visa, the U.S. law requires the applicant to provide evidence that they don’t intend to immigrate to the United States. And one must keep in mind that providing the requested document does not guarantee that they will receive a visa, there is no entitlement when it comes to a visa and you should consult an immigration lawyer rather than attempting to do this without counsel. When it comes to a visa there is no one condition that accompanies or influences all the facts or information surrounding the information needed for the application. Each person may have a different situation and those applying for the same visa may be asked different questions and may be asked to submit different documents. And lastly under U.S. law, when it does come time to issue or refuse a visa, it is the consular offices abroad that have the final authority to decide whether the evidence submitted in support of an application is adequate to establish eligibility of an applicant for a visa."
8,Calvin Coolidge: The Focal Points of His Value System,politics," On the 10 Reasons Why Coolidge and Dawes Should Have Your Support card used in Coolidge and Dawes’ 1924 Election campaign, seven of the ten reasons for supporting Coolidge for President speak directly of how his character that had and would directly affect his performance in public office. ""One – The standard bearers of the Republican party are first of all typical Americans.  One (Coolidge) came from a farm in Vermont,….Both represent the best in American tradition and training. Two – Both have spiritual qualities which fit them for leadership.  By the light of a flickering oil lamp on his father’s farm in Vermont, Calvin Coolidge’s first statement as President to the American people was: ‘I have faith that God will direct the destinies of our nation. Three – These two men are simple and direct.  There is a common bond between the man (Coolidge) who wrote to the cobbler at Northampton ‘I want you to know that if it were not for you, I should not be here,.… Four – Calvin Coolidge took his place on the Republican ticket for Vice President in 1920, a nationally recognized progressive. (underlining is mine)  Both Coolidge and Dawes stand for sound progress.  They stand for simplicity, the absence of red tape and quick, forward-looking action. Five – A high type of courage is required of men who serve as President and Vice President of the United States. Courage has marked every step in the lives of Coolidge and Dawes.  Particularly did Coolidge prove this when he made and upheld the great issue of law and order during the police strike in Boston. Six – Both men are essentially human.  Of Coolidge it has been said: ‘He personifies the plain, simple virtues of our citizens at their best.  He is close to the American People because he is so much one of them. Seven – Both are men of decision.  They have demonstrated this in the effective way in which they have served the nation and their communities…(follows is a list of Coolidge’s Offices) …he has won widespread admiration for the fearless, honest way in which he has stood for the best interests of the people.""1 As the reader of this article on Coolidge can easily see, I have very positive feelings about Coolidge the man, and the public servant.  But thanks to William Allen White’s book I grew up believing in a far different Coolidge stereotype. It was not until the John F. Kennedy Library, in cooperation with The Calvin Coolidge Memorial Foundation sponsored a conference on July 30-31, 1998 (on the 75th Anniversary of the beginning of Calvin Coolidge’s Presidency) entitled ""Calvin Coolidge: Examining the Evidence"" that the stereotype of Coolidge which follows, changed. ""For more than half a century, at nearly all levels of American historical scholarship and education, Calvin Coolidge has been characterized as a complacent, lazy and humorless man and an extreme reactionary—hostile to government and progressive legislation, oblivious to the needs of working Americans and devoted only to the material wealth of the nation and the interests of business.""2 The conference revisited the evidence on this stereotype and a whole new image of Calvin Coolidge emerged. I attended the celebration in Northampton and in Plymouth Notch at which various participants in the conference gave summary reports on the real Calvin Coolidge – not the one portrayed by William Allen White! The video and other recordings of the talks given at this conference are available at Forbes Library in the Archives Room attached to the Museum. The Calvin Coolidge described in my article is the real Calvin Coolidge that an honest and thorough examination of eyewitnesses and written records indicate.

9,"Coolidge, Culture, and The Great Generation",politics," ""We do not need more government. We need more culture."" 1  Coolidge’s concept of culture was directly related to his work ethic of industry, ambition, and untiring effort or persistence.  The application of this ethic to one’s life was the way to wealth.  A community needed a certain amount of accumulated wealth to provide the good schools that would insure knowledge in all areas, broaden its citizens outlook, and make possible the expansion of liberty. The culture of the Plymouth Notch in which Coolidge was raised revolved around the farm work tied to each season. There were husking bees, apple paring bees and singing schools in the winter.  Husking bees were a time to help a farmer husk his dried corn and then have a party.  In my day, at mid-twentieth century, if you found a red kernelled ear, you could present it to a girl of your choice.  If she accepted it, you got a kiss.  I doubt that that was the case in the 1880’s in Plymouth Notch! There were plays and dramatic exhibitions but no public dances that Coolidge was allowed to attend. In ""the summer we usually went to the circus…. In the autumn we visited the county fair."" The holidays were all celebrated in some fashion.  The Fourth of July, his birthday, was a time for fishing with his dad and a picnic celebration after. 2 ""Thanksgiving was a feast day for family reunions at the home of the grandparents.  Christmas was a sacrament observed with the exchange of gifts, when the stockings were hung, and the spruce tree was lighted in the symbol of Christian faith and love."" (28) On other days when the work was done, Calvin would drop in at the store ""to get the mail, exchange views on topics of interest"" and meet some interesting visitors who might have dropped in. (28) Finally, Coolidge’s concept of culture was also tied in with equality – no class distinctions – only contempt for ""those who assumed superior airs. Whenever the hired man or the hired girl wanted to go anywhere they were always understood to be entitled to my place in the wagon, in which case I remained at home.  This gave me a very early training in democratic ideas and impressed upon me very forcibly the dignity and power, if not the superiority of labor."" (29) Character, idealism, exaltation of thrift and hard work, and culture were the focal points of Coolidge’s value system.

10,Calvin Coolidge's Exaltation of Thrift and Hard Work,politics," Thrift and hard work were very much a part of the Puritan Ethic that framed Calvin’s growing up years and became part of who he was as an adult. Although his family was economically upper middle class and ""Whatever was needed never failed to be provided,""1 nothing was wasted that could be used ""Waste not, Want not!  The ideal was the self-sufficient small farm that Calvin’s father operated after spending thirteen years as a successful storekeeper at Plymouth Notch, Vermont. It had been John Galusha Coolidge’s farm that his son, John C. Coolidge took over when Calvin was a little over six years of age.  They had been living in what is now known as the Coolidge Homestead since 1876.  Besides running the farm Calvin’s father opened the old Blacksmith Shop and hired a blacksmith at  $1.00 a day.  The   blacksmith did most of the ""smithing"" and assisted with some of the farm work like haying.  John liked to work in the shop but only went there when a project demanded precision work like careful welding.  As Calvin relates, ""If there was any physical requirement of country life which he could not perform, I do not know what it was.  From watching him and assisting him, I gained an intimate knowledge of all this kind of work."" (12) Calvin also grew up participating in and observing the workings of local government because in addition to all the other work he did, John Coolidge was also a Constable or a Deputy Sheriff, and sometimes both nearly all his life as well as being a notary public and at times a Justice of the Peace! (24) Calvin writes that his father had ""such a broad knowledge of the practical side of the law that people of the neighborhood came to him seeking his advice, to which I always listened with great interest.  He always counseled them to resist injustice and avoid unfair dealing, but to keep their agreements, meet their obligations and observe strict obedience to the law."" (25) Calvin’s work ethic was exactly what he had learned from his father! His value of thrift can be seen in the fact that he and his wife Grace moved to one half of a duplex on Massasoit Street in Northampton, Massachusetts shortly after their marriage, lived there continuously from August 10, 1906 until he became President of the United States on March 4, 1925.  When his second term as President was up they returned there from March 4, 1925 until May 17, 1930. Lack of Privacy after his Presidency trumped his thriftiness and on May 17, 1930 they bought their first home, The Beeches on Hampton Terrace in Northampton, Massachusetts and moved there.  It was there that Calvin died suddenly on January 5, 1933. Endnote 1  The Autobiography of Calvin Coolidge,  Cosmopolitan Book Corporation, New York, N.Y., 1929, 1989 edition,  p. 9.

11,"""Silent Cal"": His Idealism",politics," The basic elements of Coolidge’s Character as presented in ""The Man and His Character"" and ""The VilliagerThat Raised Him"" are the foundation stones of his idealism. Coolidge believed that the principal ideal of the American people was (and I believe, is) idealism itself. 1  This idealism is grounded in the first two sentences of paragraph two of our Declaration of Independence. ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the Governed."" 2 This Declaration is the reason why the United States of America exists as a sovereign and independent country though we had to fight a Revolutionary War to put this Declaration into effect. The basic concepts of these two sentences are: There is a Creator. That all humans are created equal by this Creator.  How they are created (evolution or direct creation) is not specified. That this Creator endows humans with certain inalienable rights.  The State/Government is not the source of these rights. Governments exist to secure, make operable, these inalienable rights. Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.  That is why we have elections, the right to petition, etc. Calvin Coolidge’s idealism is directly grounded on these five basic concepts.  In his Wheaton College speech cited earlier, he says we need more spiritual development, more religion, and more of the things that are unseen.  These three ""needs"" are the foundation stones for moral power and character. Calvin saw Faith in God as the Being who created humans out of love.  He wished to share his life so he made humans in his image, ie. gave them the power of reflective thought.  Humans can ponder their actions and will to change them.  Faith provides humans with a meaning for their lives, a conviction that there is an eternal plan for every human life thus motivating us to achieve. In speaking of his time at Amherst College and the required daily assemblies that were chapel exercises during the week and a regular church service on Sunday morning with Vespers in the late afternoon, he writes ""Of course we did not like to go and talked learnedly about the right of freedom of worship, and the bad mental and moral reactions from which we were likely to suffer as a result of being forced to hear scriptural readings, psalm singings, prayers, and sermons. …. If attendance on these religious services ever harmed any of the men of my time I have never been informed of it.  The good it did I believe was infinite.  Not  the least of it was the discipline that resulted from having constantly to give some thought to things that young men would often prefer not to consider.  If we did not have the privilege of doing what we wanted to do, we had the much greater benefit of doing what we ought to do. It broke down our selfishness, it conquered our resistance, it supplanted impulse, and finally it enthroned reason."" 3 Calvin saw religion as basic for a self-directed people who would do the right thing (obey the law) most of the time because it was the right thing to do, not because they were forced to do so by law and penalty.  By religion he meant the Judaeo Christian ethical system found in the Bible, in the Ten Commandments, and in the teachings of Jesus Christ especially the Beatitudes found in the Sermon on the Mount.  Together these precepts make for a largely self-regulating and more humane society.

12,Open Letter to Cable News Personalities,politics," You have really made me angry tonight.  It is my opinion that your ""opinions"" of Senator Clinton's Bosnia trip, have gotten old and I am sure many viewers agree with me.  Do you realize how very ""silly"" your ""news"" stories are becoming on this one ""news"" item. You are all just nothing but ""gossip"" reporters. Have none of you ever exaggerated a story in order to prove a point?  Frankly, I believe you do it every night.  What is the point of this ""news"" story about Clinton and Bosnia?   She is not basing her whole foreign policy experience on that one trip; she is just telling a story.  She has probably told it a thousand times over the years and the times I have seen her tell it; it is quite a funny story.  Have you never told a funny story and as the years go by, you add to the story to better make your point?   Sure you have, I watch you do it every night. Chris Matthews: Lighten up Chris! Why don't you ""report"" the positive side of Clinton's trip?  For example, just the fact that she was in Bosnia is an interesting ""news"" item.   Did Clinton perhaps carry any ""message"" from our President to the President of Bosnia or the negotiators?  Why don't you ""report"" on her meeting the soldiers in Bosnia and how much she cares about our soldiers?  And the refugees, talk about them; did she meet them and speak with any of them? Keith Olbermann: Why don't you ""report"" where the video came from?  Who taped the video?  Who edited the video?  It was edited; my old eyes with my bifocals can even see that.   Was the video taken on the tarmac or in front of the base?  Who verified that?  Who is your facts checker? Mr. O'Reilly:  What did the pilot tell Clinton about snipers in the hills?  What were the pilot's instructions to Clinton and the people with her?  Has anyone ""interviewed"" the pilot to ask him ""exactly"" what he told his passengers?  What was the pilot's name? Sean Hannity and Alan Colmes: Why don't you ""gossip"" about whether Clinton had a bullet proof vest under the long coat she was wearing?  How many Secret Service agents were surrounding her and her daughter?  Why don't you ""speculate"" whether she was scared of any danger or concerned for her daughter's safety? All of you; stop ""talking"" or ""reporting"" or giving your ""opinions"" on a story about something that your viewers are tired of!   Don't be so extremely negative all the time.  Now, I do realize that the 24/7 news cycles have changed the way that the news is ""reported"" and perhaps you often need to ""speculate"" and ""gossip"" to make your interview shows more interesting; but you are ""beating a dead horse"" on this story.  (And no, I am not saying that people are tired of Hillary nor am I comparing her to a dead horse!) Do something useful, like ""vet"" Obama so our country doesn't elect another arrogant, inexperienced President. All of you are acting like ""love sick"" teenagers when it comes to Senator Obama. Of course, all of this is just my ""opinion"" but then I don't claim to be a news journalist either."
13,Fossil Fuel-based Travel and the Hospitality Industry's Impact on Global Warming,politics," The stresses of daily life are growing increasingly pervasive and it seems harder and harder to find time for yourself and your family. Doesn't a week-long trip to the tropics sound refreshing? I'll say! Unfortunately, vacation traveling is a major contributor to global warming because it is very energy-intensive (read: it burns a lot of fossil fuel). The Main Problem With The Hospitality Industry Is It Encourages People To Travel By Burning Fossil Fuels Most people have, at some level, an innate desire for adventure. By creating an allure of locations that are often far-off, the hospitality industry capitalizes on that feature of your psyche. Indeed, the hotel industry in the US alone posted a profit of $16.7 billion in 2004 according to Smith Travel Research. For mother earth, the downside of this manipulation is that getting to these enticing locales in the speed and comfort expected by most Americans requires the burning of fossil fuels on a tremendous magnitude. The Main Issue Isn't the Hospitality Industry, It Is Fossil Fuel-Based Travel With the recent renewed interest in global warming and heightened concern for environmental degradation and social justice, many people have started to pay attention to the impact of the hospitality industry on the environment and on local peoples. As a result there has emerged a new sector of the hospitality industry known as ""eco tourism"" or ""green travel"". Eco-tourism is defined by the Global Development Research Center as ""responsible travel to natural areas which conserves the environment and sustains the livelihood of local people"". While ecotourism may look like a positive step, what this approach fails to address is what many scientists consider the biggest challenge modern humanity will face: global warming. Beginning around the 1850s, humans began using copious amounts of fossil fuels, adding an abundance of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, the result of which has been a steady increase in the average temperatures of the earth's surface. While eco-tourism provides some benefits to the local ecosystems and communities which its clients patronize, it fails to combat the tremendous amount of fossil fuels that are consumed in delivering said clients to and from those locations. If You Want To Help Prevent Global Warming I Suggest You Stop Focusing On The Hospitality Industry And Turn Your Attention To Vacationing Without Burning Fossil Fuels! Most people do not have a clear understanding of how the earth's atmosphere functions. Since it's hard to observe changes in the atmosphere with the naked eye, you wouldn't be likely to connect the act of taking a long vacation with the occurrence of a natural disaster. However, the events are linked through the exorbitant amounts of C02 emitted from the plane. Climatologists are expecting an onslaught of various consequences linked to the combustion of fossil fuels: more extreme hurricanes, greater flooding (which may cause desertification), landslides, loss of habitat and species extinction, water scarcity, and the spread of disease. Furthermore, some of the effects of global warming will contribute to further climate change, in what is known as a positive feedback cycle. When framed in this light, you may begin to change how you feel about burning fossil fuels for amusement. Don't despair though! The pundits would have you think otherwise, but making ecological choices doesn't have to be an exercise of self-deprivation. How you ask? It's easy - the next time you're planning a vacation, make it a priority to reduce the total miles you travel. Traveling is bound to be linked to some form of fossil-fuel based transportation, even though it may be greatly reduced. To address this you can travel using methods that contribute less to global warming. Traveling by train is one such choice that results in far less fossil fuel consumption. In some cases, it may seem like too much of a hassle to avoid driving, but remember: you can still help stop global warming by learning how to drive as efficiently as possible. If you want to set an outstanding example, choose a vacation that can be enjoyed while using bicycles as a primary means of transportation. Don't let this seemingly insurmountable global problem paralyze you-it is possible to make conscious decisions that are consistent with your desire to help stop global warming. This can have a profound effect in the sense that it is likely to draw others' attention to the fact that you are making a conscious choice."
14,The Last King Of Spain?,politics," A young King Juan Carlos helped steer Spain from a dictatorship to a modern democracy after he came to the throne some 32 years ago, and his achievements include defending the fledgling democracy in 1981 from an attempted coup. Once popular and regarded as a man of the people, recent times have been more troubling for the king as political groups on both the left and right have called for an end to the Spanish monarchy. 1981 it could be argued was the height of the King's popularity when some army officers stormed the Spanish Parliament. Spain had been ruled by the dictator Franco until his death in 1975, and the King appeared on television to order the army back to barracks, in the process saving the young democracy from returning to dictatorship. While the royal family spend their summer holidays on the island of Majorca at the Marivent Royal Palace and the rest of the year near Madrid his popularity carried through to all regions of Spain. Recent comments from the King though have made many Spaniards uneasy about how close he is coming to interfering with politics, and this has not helped his popularity - although the people of Majorca might disagree as the royal family's holidays give the island an upmarket image elsewhere in Europe, and the hotels and Majorca villa holidays travel market have thrived in recent years. He made a surprise visit to Spanish troops in Afghanistan just before Christmas, but controversially visited two Spanish enclaves in Morocco which have been in dispute over sovereignty since the 15th century. But last year saw protestors burning photographs of the King in the Spanish city of Girona, a sign of his declining popularity, but Spain and the wider world sat up and took notice when he famously told the President of Venezuela to shut up at a summit in Chile. While most saluted his stand, some saw it as another sign of his interference in politics, going far beyond what would be acceptable in other European countries from their respective royal families. Majorca Flights The King wants to be king of all Spain, and not have different regions strongly in favour of the monarchy and others against. Spain's economy has done well under King Juan Carlos, and his intervention to prevent a coup in 1981 has benefitted in particular the tourism market, with Spain and her islands now the destination of choice for more Europeans than any other country when taking a holiday. And it's not just the holidays in Majorca market where the royal family spend their summers that have done well over the last twenty five years. The Costa del Sol and Costa Blanca are well known as holiday destinations, and before King Juan Carlos replaced fascist leader General Franco the holidays market was limited as many Europeans would not holiday in Spain, knowing their tourist money would support an unacceptable regime, in the same way many people boycotted South Africa while it had apartheid. Cheap flights to Majorca airport from the United Kingdom for example have seen the island's economy transformed. And Spanish airlines operating both from the mainland capital Madrid and from Barcelona have also taken advantage of the travel market today, with millions of Spaniards employed in the airlines, hotels and holidays industries. While Spain used to in the early days of her tourism be known as a cheap holidays destination, the country has moved into the upmarket leisure scene too, and new hotels in Majorca are being built, one of which will be the best hotel in Spain. Overall, Spain's economy has done well since Juan Carlos became king, the country has joined and is a fully active member of the EU, and political parties of different persuasions have held democratically elected power with the PSOE, Spain's Socialist Party, recently winning the general election and entering their second term in office, with all these things highly unlikely if Franco's successor had been another fascist. At 70, hopefully it will be some time before the question of a new monarch is asked. Majorca will certainly want that!"
15,"Calvin Coolidge: The ""Villiage"" That Raised Him",politics," Calvin Coolidge’s grandfather, Calvin Galusha Coolidge,  felt so strongly that tilling the soil was ""the only real, respectable way to get a living"" (15), and hoping to keep Calvin from going into trade as his father John had, deeded ""forty acres, called the Lime Kiln lot…. With the rest (of the farm) to my lineal descendants, thinking that as I could not sell it, and my creditors could not get it, it would be necessary for me to cultivate it.""1 ….""My own wish was to keep store, as my father had done. They all taught me to be faithful over a few things.  If they had any idea that such a training might some day make me a ruler over many things, it was not disclosed to me.  It was my father in later years who wished me to enter the law…"" (16 –17) Calvin evidently believed that ""it takes a village to raise a child"" though the saying was not coined until the second half of the twentieth century. ""The neighborhood around the Notch was made up of people of exemplary habits. ….speech was clean….lives above reproach.  ….no mortgages.  ….credit was good and …money in the savings bank.  ….(worked from dawn until dusk).  ….kept up no church organization….(so) little regular preaching (or) outward manifestation of religion through public profession, but…a people of faith and charity and good works.  They cherished the teachings of the Bible and sought to live in accordance with its precepts. The conduct of the young people was modest and respectful."" (17) Calvin attended regular Sunday school classes superintended by his grandmother Sarah Brewer Coolidge and later by his father.  He spent a lot of time with her at her farm….""she had much to do with shaping the thought of my early years. ...The Puritan severity of her convictions was tempered by the sweetness of a womanly charity.  There were none she ever knew that had not in some way benefited from her kindness."" (17-18) From his mother, Victoria Moor Coolidge, he learned to love the beauty of nature.  The purple sunsets, evening stars, and the colors of each season so richly displayed in the fields and on the mountainsides of Plymouth Notch, Vermont.  Upon her death in March 1885 when Calvin was only twelve years old, he records in his autobiography, ""The greatest grief that can come to a boy, came to me.  Life was never to seem the same again."" (13) In the early fall of 1891 just before Calvin began his freshman year at Amherst, his father married Carrie Brown,  ""One of the finest women of our neighborhood.  I had known her all my life.  I was greatly pleased to find in her all the motherly devotion that she could have given me if I had been her own son.  …Loving books and music she was not only a mother to me but a teacher.  For thirty years she watched over me, welcoming me when I went home, writing me when I was away, and encouraging me in all my efforts."" (52) At the age of thirteen having mastered the basics of reading, writing, arithmetic, and United  States  History  at  the  Notch  School,  Calvin  looked  forward  eagerly  to attending Black River Academy in Ludlow.  He would be mostly his own master – no more farm life drudgery – no more cowhide boots. But as he notes there were other ""atmospheres more monotonous and more contaminating than anything in the physical atmosphere of country life."" (32) He would  discover this  later in  life when it was  a joy for him to return to his roots at  the farm for vacations.  For now, at age thirteen, he was ""perfectly certain that I was traveling out of the darkness into the light."" (33) He relates his final thoughts written in 1929 over his ""village upbringing."" ""We have much speculation over whether the city or the country is the better place to bring up boys.  I am prejudiced in behalf of the country, but I should have to admit that much depends on the parents and the surrounding neighborhood.  We felt the cold in the winter and had many inconveniences,  but we did  not mind  them because we supposed they were the inevitable burdens of existence.  It would be hard to imagine better surroundings for the development of a boy than those which I had.  … Country life does not always have breadth, but it has depth.  It is neither artificial nor superficial, but is kept close to the realities."" (33) Endnote 1     The Autobiography of Calvin Coolidge.

16,Social-Political Sustainability: The Human Element,politics," It is commonly accepted that the project of sustainable development is conceptually composed of three constituent parts. These parts are (1) environmental sustainability, (2) economic sustainability, and (3) social-political sustainability. The United Nations 2005 World Summit refers to the ""interdependent and mutually reinforcing pillars"" of sustainable development as environmental protection, economic development and social development. The interdependency of the first two is evident; it is perhaps the greatest challenge of our time to satisfy the needs and wants of burgeoning populations within the binding constraints imposed by our physical environment. But what is this great hoopla about social development and sustainability of politics, and what exactly is its place? If environmental protection is concerned with the preservation of our natural environment and resources, and economic sustainability is concerned with seeking durable growth solutions therein, then the social-political sphere can be thought of as representative of the more purely human element in the equation.  Social development and social-political sustainability are intimately related concepts but they are not in fact entirely interchangeable.  It is important that we understand their symbiotic relationship and its implications for the broader sustainability project. Social development is a concept that is familiar to most of us in its many and varying forms.  Within any given society there are opportunities to improve and enrich each of its composite parts in many ways.  Of sometimes greater importance is the need to harmonize relations amongst these various and sometimes opposing elements.  Those actively engaged in the process of social development include agents acting within its institutions to effect change via established channels.  Of more notice, however, are often those who act from the outside, those who reject the society's institutions as inadequate, and who advocate wholesale social and political change as the only true path to social enrichment and development. It is in this transformational role that we begin to touch on the realm of social-political sustainability.  Within any given social context, social development can be pursued with the simple granting of budgets.  Financial and human resources are utilized to strengthen and enrich societies by improving educational opportunities, by embracing the marginalized and the forgotten, by making improvements to healthcare and hygienic conditions and by endearing knowledge of financial and entrepreneurial activities to name just a few.  Here, the distinguishing feature of social development is that it is executed within the institutional mechanisms and constraints prevailing in that given entity. Social-political sustainability too is very much concerned with physical and material standing of peoples, but further than this it is concerned with the state of their civil society.  Social-political sustainability is differentiated from pure social development in that its sphere is expanded beyond the employment of simply monetary means.  Social-political development entails not only the engagement of institutional mechanisms, but also their modification and advancement.  Social-political sustainability thus seeks pathways to durable social enrichment and development via the vibrancy and health of a society's political processes.  At its core, there ultimately is little more than an absolute faith in the functioning of liberal democracy.  Despite the frequent changing of the guard and the potential for policy discontinuity this entails, it is believed that representative republican government bolstered by mass public awareness and participation provides the best model of a sustainable body politic. In addition to social policy, environmental and economic policies are clearly dictated in the political realm as well.  It is in the creed of the sustainability project to hold that healthy political bodies which are truly representative of the collective will can show us the path forward.  Recognition of the strain to our natural environment that unrestrained industrialization and consumption have brought depends upon it. The French political thinker and historian Alexis de Tocqueville long ago warned Americans that their political structure (and indeed that of all democracies) could fall hostage to a ""tyranny of the majority"".  To illustrate the weight of these words, consider a scenario in which a pluralistic political majority were unwilling to adopt legislation which combatively addresses climate change issues, while the autocratic but highly environmentalist ruler of another nation prosecuted an aggressive climate change agenda with gusto.  In the face of peril, such a situation would revive human moral and ethical dilemmas of the highest order. Faith in democracy and the ideologies it espouses transcends the purely political arena.  In a free and wealthy society, those in the pursuit of scientific truth battle only scientific obstacles.  If the danger is real, the truth will be brought to bear.  But even in the face of incontrovertible truth, can the titanic inertia of human complacency and comfort be overcome and conquered? Many scientific and economic authorities now believe that emissions caps are insufficient in the battle against climate change.  They call for a massive mobilization of public funds for investment in research with the goal of discovering new low-carbon-emissions technologies, and this on the scale of the Manhattan Project that delivered the first atomic bombs. We will be watching.  This, folks, is nothing less than a test of social-political sustainability in action. Copyright (c) 2008 Jackson Kern"
17,Book Review: 'Real Change' by Newt Gingrich. Read it.,politics," Gingrich is probably the smartest man in US politics and political activism – at least as far as real policies based on real world demands are concerned. His latest book, 'Real Change' is a synthesis of what his new organisation American Solutions [www.americansolutions.org] has been working on, to give policy makers some ideas to fix key problems in US society and politics. For anyone interested in fixing parts of America which do not work, this book is a good overview of what ails America and what can be done to fix it. As one may expect, it is government, the bureaucracy and the fantastical naive and bloody-minded faith in government, which is in need of real change. Gingrich outlines why that is. Keynesians, the eco-cult fanatics, the race reductionists, the protectionists and the appeasement minded would of course, never read such a book. For these happy little Marxist minds, the warm blue blanket of the nanny state and creating clients out of citizens, is the main objective. Security, risk reduction, guaranteed incomes and jobs, and total safety are the primary concerns of these chattering trolls. These ideals are the root of the issues facing America and every other industrialised state for that matter. In order to break the current vicious and immature cycle of broken behavior and bankrupted systems, some real change as Gingrich outlines, is urgently needed. Gingrich summarizes quite well and transparently, why government fails and what can be done to correct these failures. He discusses the key subject areas facing the US and then proposes some common-sensical and relevant options to change the system. Importantly he focuses on results – applying simple models and patterns to solve questions and then monitoring the outcomes. Metrics, and implementing concepts which actually work, are anathema to government and bureaucracies. Some topics Gingrich discusses: These ten pages on what went wrong in Iraq and also in Afghanistan [pp 107-118] are perhaps the most interesting in the book. Gingrich has over 30 years affiliation as a trainer and confidante of the military. From 2003 until the 2007 surge, Iraq as a policy was failing, and it was the fault not of the military personnel on the ground, but of the civilian and military bureaucracy outside the war zones. As Gingrich relates: -In 2003 after a stunningly successful 3 week invasion, the Bush administration reduced Iraqi intelligence resources [which were vital to secure the country]. -Instead of using the Iraqi army to help police the country, the military bureaucracy disbanded the Iraqi armed forces. -The Iraqi adminstration under Paul Bremer did not learn from Afghanistan where you had to liberate and not occupy the country. Instead of using Iraqi's and an Iraqi bureaucracy to help stabilise and rebuild the country, the American administration acted as an occupier not a liberator. This directly gave rise to the insurgency and general malcontent in Iraq. -No civilian support in infrastructure, economics, health or energy was forthcoming. The State Department and the military bureaucracy had no plans nor any ideas about how to stabilise a failed state like Iraq. -Billions of dollars were spent in Iraq with no results and no metrics. The US bureaucracies totally failed in their objectives to help the military rebuild Iraq and to take active and productive roles in stabilising a failed state. As Gingrich rightly points out, basically the US military was asked to perform 2 impossible tasks – win the war and act as a functioning bureaucracy. The second task is not something a military can credibly do. Even in Afghanistan, the bureaucracy was the problem. As Gingrich states, 'In 2002, I learned that the United States had been unable to pave a single mile of road in Afghanistan during the summer season.' This was due to bureaucratic incompetence not a lack of money. Like Iraq, billions were spent in Afghanistan with no results, no metrics and no rush to implement something which would work. Thousands of swarming bureaucrats covered both countries like locusts, bunkered down, meeting, meeting again, meeting some more, with no view on being effective and without a coordinated and intelligent plan about meeting key metrics in energy, transportation, infrastructure build, policing or public safety. The burden was placed solely on the military. Gingrich voted for the Reagan amnesty bill of 1986 because it promised to be a one time deal. The deal was simple: illegal amnesty would be granted once; border security and control would be effected immediately; and there would be a verification of all foreign workers now and going forward. Only the amnesty occurred. The US now has most likely over 30 million illegals. It is a cultural, social and economic burden that is unsustainable. Contrary to myth uneducated illegals are a net drain on the US economy – by at least $50 billion per annum. According to Gingrich and American Solutions over 75% of Americans want the border secured and do not want amnesty given to illegals; and they want more skilled workers on work visas. Yet they will most likely receive the opposite of that from their politicians. The border remains – even with the building of the southern fence – open with all the risks regarding terrorism and fascist Islam that entails; and most politicians eying the Hispanic and minority vote want to appear sympathetic to the idea of amnesty. The idea of extending skilled workers visas does not sit well with protectionists, unions and those who prefer illegal immigration to legal, documented visa based immigration. Only a few politicians really believe that government is fundamentally too large, and that taxes are ridiculously high. For most politicians the tax payer is a faceless robot, who should pay more into the system to establish more programs and more welfare services. Gingrich outlines why historically, regimes with high taxes and big government have failed. Dynamic and productive societies have a true belief in entrepreneurship, capital formation, science and technological innovation. Static and regressive states do not. Gingrich and his organisation are calling for some needed and dramatic fiscal reforms including: tort and legal liability reform; a national flat tax on consumption with a change in the constitution to prevent income from being taxed in the future; abolishing all other taxes on income and capital gains and reducing non-essential spending by over half. If even a small part of this plan was adopted the US economy would add millions of jobs literally over night and be running huge federal budget surpluses. These are just some of the issues Gingrich discusses. He goes into market based reforms of Social Security, Health Care, Education, Crime, Energy and the need for overhauling the Judicial system. Neither major US party believes that fundamental change is needed. The Democrats are witless and clueless and would return America back to the days of Herbert Hoover, FDR or Peanut boy Jimmy Carter. The Republicans are big spending conservative statists, who believe in tax cuts, but also in ramping up the size of government in every possible sphere even as they subsidise huge corporations in auto manufacturing, ethanol development, agricultural production or sundry other industrial segments. As Gingrich observes it is only the American people who will effectively force change by demanding results across a broad range of important issues, accountability, fairness and wealth creation, not destruction. For those interested in thoughtful intelligent policy, this book is a great primer. For people interested in real change which would effectively help cure what ails parts of America, this book is indispensable."
18,Why So Corrupt?,politics," Recently The New York Times (3/16/08) reported that up to one third of the oil supplies from an Iraqi oil refinery in Baiji are being stolen and sold on the black market. The reporter, Richard A Oppel, Jr., noted that most if not all of these stolen monies are going to insurgents and, thus, being used to kill Iraqis and Americans. Oppel writes: ""The sea of oil under Iraq is supposed to rebuild the nation, then make it prosper.  But at least one-third, and possibly much more, of the fuel from Iraq's largest refinery here [in Baiji] is diverted to the black market, according to American military officials.""  He continues to note that oil tankers are being hijacked, drivers are being bribed, papers forged ""and some of the earnings go to insurgents who are still killing more than 100 Iraqis a week."" This is a very unfortunate situation--not only that the oil is being diverted away from needed domestic purposes but that so many Iraqis are being killed every week, if we can believe these figures. One wonders why, after five years of this conflict, we are in this position. Why are we not able to control this kind of corruption? Why is not the Iraqi Army able to ""stand up"" and defend its own oil resources?  (Remember when we were told that Iraqi oil revenues would pay for this entire conflict?  Why then are we now spending upwards of 10 billion a month to fund this war?) Perhaps it is the case that those who are doing the stealing are people who want to heat their own homes, who want a steady stream of electricity into their living rooms. All reasonable desires. Perhaps it is also the case that those who are engaged in fueling the insurgency in this way are participating in the on-going feud between Shia, Sunni and Kurds. It may also be the case that our ""winning"" with the Surge, as some claim,  has not gone far enough to quell this kind of internal strife amongst the various parties. More recently, the fighting in Basra between Shia militias and Iraqi Army forces, indicates that even with our Surge troops in place we haven't helped these rival groups reconcile with each other. I wonder when we will realize that the force of armament alone, as General David Petraeus has often asserted, will not be sufficient to bring stability to Iraq. When will we realize that it is up to the politicians to effect national reconciliation?  Perhaps it is a lot easier to wage military combat than slowly develop and foster the institutions required for democracy--those local and national forums where all can discuss and debate important issues."
19,Clinton Pushes for Delegate Switch,politics," Earlier this week, Clinton was vocal in pointing out the ability for delegates, even those who had already pledged their support to a particular candidate, to make a switch from one candidate to another. The Democratic National Convention fact sheet confirms that delegates may cast their vote for whichever candidate they choose at the convention, regardless of whether or not they have already pledged their support for a particular Presidential hopeful. The fact sheet does, however, urge the delegates to ""reflect the sentiments of those who elected them."" Mixed Feelings on Clinton’s Motivations While pretty much everyone agrees it is unlikely to see delegates switch their votes from those already pledged, Clinton wishes to remind Democrats that the unexpected has already happened and could happen again before the final nomination is decided. Some supporters of Obama have referred to Clinton’s tactics as ""slimy,"" reiterating there is no way they would even consider changing their vote unless urged to do so by Obama himself. So far, there have been no confirmed reports of Clinton’s campaign contacting anyone seeking a change in vote. While she may remind the delegates of the option to switch, to be so forward in pushing for it would be viewed as questionable business tactics. Others, though, say she is well within her rights to remind the delegates of their right to change their mind. Some believe the motivation behind the move is to create an environment in which the superdelegates would not be so hesitant to overrule the will of elected delegates. As of right now, Hillary Clinton is trailing Barack Obama by 120 delegates, with 580 delegates remaining. Many feel that the final decision as to who will run for the White House on the Democratic ticket will fall to the superdelegates to decide at the Democratic National Convention, which is still five months away. As of right now, with Obama leading in delegate votes, many feel the superdelegates would be extremely reluctant to overturn their will. It is seen as a very perilous and lonely position in which the superdelegates may find themselves. Who are the Superdelegates? The superdelegates are those who are not elected by voters but still hold an automatic vote when the Democratic National Convention rolls around. This includes governors, members of the Democratic National Convention, former leaders including Al Gore, and members of the United States House of Representatives. While Clinton may be hopeful that some delegates may decide to change their votes before the convention begins later this summer, most view it as wishful thinking and unlikely. One Democratic strategist who has pledged support to neither candidate, Chris Kofinis, suggests that Hillary Clinton’s mere mention of the idea of delegates switching sides is ""comical."" Once a spokesman for John Edwards, Kofinis says he does not see it happening at all. Meanwhile, the Democratic nomination is still up for grabs, with no clear-cut winner as of yet. The Pennsylvania primaries could prove to be a turning point in the nomination process, and if Clinton loses Pennsylvania, which is unlikely, there is a good chance of the party calling for her to resign her pursuit of the White House. For right now, though, it is anybody’s guess as to who will finally run on the November Democratic ticket."
20,Politics in the Media: Reading Between the Lines,politics," A vast amount of information is being thrown at the American people at break neck speeds these days, with the election race being at the top of the agenda. One minute we're hearing about this senator, that senator, this mayor or that governor. The human brain is good, but it isn't that good. It quickly uses what's available which draws upon our individual experiences--our maps. It is now more critical than ever to learn how to adequately sort through all of the information and draw rational, sound conclusions allowing us to take decisive action. The reason it is more important than ever is because we have been at war for quite some time now, and there seems to be yet another war on the horizon--Iran War. Now I can't speak for anyone else, but it is of my opinion that war should be avoided at all costs, wherever possible, namely because of the waste and carnage of the lives of human beings it leaves behind. As a success coach and specialist in NLP, I make it an essential point to stay abreast of all the current events and topics that people deem as significant. I also spend a great deal of time exploring the responses of the people to these issues and news events. One of the chief ways I do this is by reading the comments posted on the various message boards and in chat rooms.  And the conclusions that I've come to as of late, is that our people are very tired. We are angry and upset with all of the events that are taking place, as we are seemingly helpless, and not making many of the decisions that affect us and our children. One of the principle presuppositions of neurolinguistic programming (NLP) is that ""the map is not the territory.""  What that really means is that everything isn't always as it seems. My beliefs, no matter what the issue will be different from yours. What I believe to be essential and important are going to be different for you.  There is no right or wrong in that; it's just simply what it is. The beliefs and tenets we use to navigate our way through our world essentially is our reality, so if my experience is such that I view certain things to be a certain way, then my map(what I use to arrive at conclusions) is going to be my territory. This kind of thinking will be limiting to my personal growth.  I have observed this in people and have helped many overcome. The problem is, they are relying on outdated maps, because as you know these things must change over time in order to effectively serve the people using them. Those responsible for deciding what gets aired, and how have decidedly their own maps as well. This is the first election cycle in our nation's history when a woman and an African-American are seriously being considered for the highest office in our land---President of the United States. Whether either of them actually takes office is incidental; the key is to realize that this is an apparent sign that the territory has changed; so now our maps must change as well. Now whether we are able to achieve that feat remains to be seen. The reality is, until we find a way to accomplish this, we collectively will reap many consequences in the not so distant future. ! A Call-To-Action: As you read and listen to the various news media and politicians, learn to read/listen between the lines. Ask yourself, ""What are they really saying to me, without exactly saying it?"" Tune into, but do not immediately turn on. Use critical thinking skills first and foremost even with those candidates you particularly like. Listen to candidates whose views you do not agree with and pay attention to news sources from different parts of the world. Whether your chosen candidate wins or not, understand that election cycles are always a time for learning, development and growth. Copyright (c) 2008 Aunice Reed"

1,Could You Answer Some Questions,politics," Senator Obama, I thought I would write and ask a few questions about some things that just don't seem right to me. First, how did you manage to get Gov Richardson to give you his endorsement this week?  As we both know, Gov. If it were not for the Clintons,  Richardson would not be in the position he is now.  He held two prominent positions in the Clinton administration and the ex-president campaigned for the Gov. when he first ran for the governorship of New Mexico.  So, my question is what did you promise Gov. Richardson in exchange for his endorsement? I know that some political deal was made.  Did you offer him the Vice Presidential position in your administration? It must have been something great for Richardson to stab both of the Clintons in the back.   As time goes by, you are showing me more and more that you are just a typical politician and not a person who could be a leading statesman for our party. My second question is why are you standing in the way of a re-do of the Florida and Michigan primaries.  Senator Clinton has raised all the money to pay for these primaries so it would cost you nothing - so what are you afraid of?  Is it that she might overcome your delegate lead or popular vote lead?  Both you and I know she already owns the vote in the Electoral College.  By disenfranchising 3 million democratic voters, this will call into question the legitimacy of your nomination if you win.  Remember 2000 - Bush v Gore when the courts decided that Bush had won the election.  Bush's whole presidency his first term was considered stolen from Gore and Bush was not the legitimate president - do you want this to happen to you - for without Florida and Michigan, I assure you that many will feel that way.  It could even cause the Republican candidate to win the election.  Is this what you want Senator Obama - a loss for your party.  Do you want to be president that badly that you would screw your party and 3 million democratic voters in order to become president?  What are you really afraid of?  You are only 45; you have years left to run for this office so why can't you wait 4 to 8 years?   You are running from something - what is it Senator.  Is it the Drudge report I found buried deep in the archives where no one knows it is?  What are you afraid of Senator Obama? The American people deserve to know and if you don't answer these questions, you will be seen as just another political hack and I for one will not be able to support you.  And I will continue to write articles and post them all over the internet until you are honest with the America people. Copyright (c) 2008 Mary Ann Boulette"
2,What Have You Done?,politics," This Easter Sunday only days after the 5th anniversary of the beginning of the War in Iraq, we reached another milestone - the 4,000th American was killed. Four thousand - which means that 4,000 mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, wives or children's lives, will have been changed forever.  Four thousand families have been visited by a uniformed officer and a chaplain who delivered in person the news that their family member had been killed. Of course, the other side of this issue must be looked at.  It has been estimated that 80 to 100 thousand Iraqis have been killed in this war.  To get your mind around this number of people who have been affected by the last 5 years is almost impossible to do for the numbers are so large. Then there is the debt that our country has accumulated.  Somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 trillion dollars.  10 trillion!  We have borrowed from other countries, 10 trillion dollars, the largest amount from China, a communist country.  So we are basically owned by other countries.  The interest on this debt is paid by all the income tax that is collected each year. The last 5 years have produced these numbers, 84,000 killed and 10 trillion dollars of debt.  Not to mention, the thousands of Americans who will need their country to care for them for the rest of their lives because of lost limbs or brain trauma.  Injured soldiers who in another war in a past time would probably not have survived their injuries. What have we done to our country?  Will God forgive us?  Forgive us for wasting the treasure of our country.  Instead of bringing peace to this world, we have done just the opposite and put our immortal collective souls in danger of eternal damnation. This is why I keep writing because it is all I can do.  At the end of my days when my Savior asks me what I have done - I can say that I spoke out until I did all I could to stop the waste of the war.  I spoke up for the 4,000 and 80,000 and against the 10 trillion in debt and I will continue to speak out until I change hearts - one at a time. And when these changed hearts stop the endless waste of money and lifes, then I will stop writing.  I will not stop until the war in Iraq is ended and our soldiers are home.  I have no choice because it is all I can do. What can you do?"
3,Key Energy Technologies for Booming World Economies,politics," Modern economies are unthinkable without plentiful and affordable energy supplies.  The double threat of global warming and climate change makes it mandatory to look for new, non-polluting energy sources.  When searching for future energy supplies we must be very much aware of the critical role that energy plays in modern economies.  It is imperative that we keep in mind the immense investments and the priceless inventories that were made by previous generations when building existing energy supply infrastructures. Electricity has become the predominant energy form used by industry, commerce, and consumers alike.  Transportation is a close second with industry, commerce, and individuals virtually incapable to maintain economic activity without immediate access to affordable liquid fuels for cars, trucks, ships, trains, and airplanes. Continuing use of fossil fuels will result in unacceptable levels of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere.  We have learned that this accumulation is responsible for global warming and that it is the root cause of climate change and its many incarnations.  The world does not have a choice any longer.  We must completely halt carbon dioxide emissions before the year 2050 or the world will have to deal with escalating and uncontrollable climate changes. The costs of dealing with climate change can potentially overpower world economies, can inflict extreme suffering on most of the world's peoples, and can eventually lead to a worldwide economic collapse.  Such a collapse will be the precursor of the disappearance of our civilizations. Changing over from polluting fossil fuels to clean, new energy sources will be expensive.  Trying to replace well performing industry segments would not only be foolish; it could be suicidal.  We cannot dare to slow the world's economies.  Economies must be highly productive when we attempt to halt all fossil fuel combustion and begin instead to use only clean, renewable energy sources.  The changeover will create much additional economic activity, which can result in an overall positive effect on world economies during the next two generations. In our efforts to change to new energy sources we must try to modify rather than replace existing energy consuming, energy converting, and energy distributing systems.  We are well advised to continue the use of existing electricity generating plants, electricity transmission grids, petroleum refining plants, gasoline and diesel fuel distribution systems, inventories of cars, trucks, ships, trains, railways, airplanes, and airports.  We must continue to use our manufacturing plants to produce these valuable and life supporting devices and the service systems with their trained personnel to keep them running. Replacing even a part of this infrastructure would last generations and would cost trillions upon trillions of dollars.  Replacement costs will be out of reach for even the most wealthy, most industrialized, and most technologically advanced countries.  We must find solutions that keep much of the existing energy infrastructures in place.  We must develop new technologies, which will not overburden our economies and which will not risk economic slowdowns, recessions, or total economical collapse. The puzzle we have to solve is very complex.  There will be more than one solution.  To put our task into sharp focus let us state the problem this way: How can we best preserve as much of our infrastructure as possible, stop burning fossil fuels, and replace fossil fuels by only consuming renewable and alternative energies?  Most importantly, how can we stimulate and maintain economic growth concurrently? One such practical and actionable solution is based on the complete cessation of all fossil fuel burning.  There is absolutely no way that we can prevent carbon dioxide accumulation in the atmosphere by sequestering carbon dioxide for more than a few decades.  Therefore, we will have to convert all our energy sources entirely to the exclusive use of solar energy, wind energy, marine energy, geothermal energy, and nuclear energy. Fortunately, there is enough solar energy to last us forever.  Nuclear fission energy will last for centuries.  Geothermal energy resources are huge but will be expensive to exploit in most locations. Continuing shortsightedness and greed are still keeping us on the march into certain disaster.  This is tragic and unacceptable.  We must force our governments to accept change.  New technologies are available that can give us the means and the tools to not only avoid disaster but make this world a better place to live in.  All we have to do is to act with foresight.  Most importantly, we must subordinate the interests of the few to the wellbeing of the many.  What must we do? We must continue to use the existing inventory of energy consuming machinery and appliances.  We must preserve our marvelous transportation systems that deliver unerringly the goods, foods, and all necessities for us to live and for everybody to pursue business and pleasure.  We must keep the electric transmission nets and grids that cover the world.  We must keep the distribution systems that deliver motor fuels to neighborhoods and to the farthest corners of the world.  We must keep the power plants, our manufacturing plants, and the refineries that convert crude energy into motor fuels.  We must save our buildings and our homes. We must concentrate our intellectual efforts and our financial resources on the development of a selected, few technologies.  It appears entirely feasible to develop and demonstrate these few key technologies in less than two decades.  Above all, we must act very, very soon or we will leave to future generations a very hot and barren world."
4,"Petroleum, the Triple Threat to World Economies",politics," World economies are facing a triple threat.  Oil reserves will be close to depletion by the year 2050.  Damages from climate changes caused by escalating greenhouse gas emissions will become substantial.  Rising transportation and food costs will slow economic growth rates.  The results will lead to worldwide economic stagnation without hope for escape or reversal. Future generations will have to pay dearly for the failure of previous national governments to eliminate carbon dioxide emissions and to change world energy supplies.  Our dependence on fossil fuels must be terminated completely within the next three to four decades or the world will self-destruct. Let's us look at the facts that lead to these frightening conclusions. Statements about petroleum reserves have been dubious in the past.  In 2007, lowest figures are in the range of 1 to 1.3 trillion barrels.  A figure as high as 2.3 trillion barrels has been proposed but will not find many supporters, not even in the oil industry. At the 2006 rate of oil consumption of 31 billion barrels per year, these reserves could last 32 to 74 years.  Such figures are often quoted but are much too high because annual oil consumption is continually rising.  The growth rate is approximately 2% per year.  Projecting steady growth to the year 2050, the actual consumption is going to be 60% higher.  This increases the average annual consumption rate between 2006 and 2050 to a very realistic 50 billion barrels per year.  Time to depletion is reduced to a time span of 20 years to 46 years.  Most likely, neither figure is correct.  However, it is reasonable to assume that a figure between 20 years and 46 years will be most likely. Combusting 1 to 2.3 trillion barrels of oil will add a huge amount of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.  The amount is 0.42 to 1 trillion tons of carbon dioxide.  This huge mass will increase the carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere by 55 to 125 ppm.  Only a small percentage of this additional mass will be absorbed in the oceans.  Most of it will lead to a substantial increase in the atmosphere's carbon dioxide content. During the same time, an even larger amount of carbon dioxide will be added to the atmosphere from the accelerating burning of coal and natural gas. There is a direct connection between carbon dioxide accumulation and global temperature increase.  During the last 30 years, this correlation amounted to approximately 2 degree C per 100 ppm carbon dioxide.  If we accept this correlation as valid, we are faced with some very ugly numbers.  During the next 46 years, we will increase the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration by at least 200 ppm.  In turn, this increase will result in a rise of global temperatures by 4 degree C.  This means that by the year 2050, the world will have warmed by 5 degree C!  This figure is more realistic than recent IPCC forecasts. The robust growth of world economies and the exceptionally fast increase in energy consumption in China and India will result in much higher energy consumption and in a much faster growth of greenhouse gases than originally predicted.  Two other accelerating factors are the failure of the Kyoto Protocol to perceptibly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the decision of the USA to delay any countermeasures. In view of actual, past developments and by accepting a realistic future outlook, we must draw several, inescapable conclusions.  The increase of global temperatures on Earth will become faster, transportation of commodities and goods will get extremely costly, and the effects of global warming on climate change will continue to become more numerous and more destructive.  This confluence of future developments will lead inescapably to a major threat to all world economies. Once world economies begin to contract and collapse, national economies cannot marshal any longer the necessary resources that could have saved the world.  Installation of effective countermeasures will require a minimum time of thirty years.  Once economies contract, there will be no resources and no time left to implement solutions. The world will have lost the ability to install any of the promising, renewable technologies, which are able to produce electricity and liquid transportation fuels without the emission of any destructive greenhouse gases.  The world as we know it will cease to exist."
5,Calvin Coolidge Man of the Great Generation,politics," Introduction The heroes of the Greatest Generation were made well known to us through Tom Brokaw’s best selling book.  These were the children of the Great Generation who lived and shaped our nation from the 1870’s to the 1950’s. They were the principal players in the Spanish American War, The Philippine Insurrection, World War I, The Roaring Twenties, Prohibition, and the Great Depression of the 1930’s. Calvin Coolidge: His Origins and Career Calvin Coolidge was born into this Great Generation on July 4, 1872 in Plymouth Notch, Vermont, and died on January 5, 1933 in his home, the Beaches, in Northampton, Massachusetts as the Great Depression was wreaking its havoc on our country. He received his formal elementary school education at Plymouth Notch and graduated from Black River Academy, Ludlow, Vermont on May 23, 1890.  That fall he was on his way to Amherst College when he became ill with a severe cold.  He was unable to complete the entrance exams and had to return to Plymouth Notch.  In late winter he resumed his preparations for Amherst’s entrance exams at Black River Academy and then went to St. Johnsbury Academy for the spring term. He did so well that the principal, Dr. Putney, gave him a certificate that allowed him to enter Amherst without entrance exams, in the fall of 1891. He graduated from Amherst on June 26, 1895. Instead of attending a formal law school he took the option of reading law with the Northampton, Massachusetts firm of Hammond and Field from September 23, 1895 until he passed his examination and was admitted to the bar in Northampton, Massachusetts on July 2, 1897. On December 6, 1898 he was elected to his first public office as City Councilman from Ward 2 in Northampton, Massachusetts.  Subsequently he was elected City Solicitor by the City Council from January 18, 1900 to January 16, 1902.  He was appointed Clerk of Courts for Hampshire County in Massachusetts on June 9, 1903, and elected Representative to the Massachusetts General Court from November 6, 1906 until November 1908. With his election as Mayor of Northampton, Massachusetts on December 7, 1909, Coolidge began a continuous career of public service until March 4, 1929. He was Mayor for two terms (1909 – 1911), and State Senator of Massachusetts from 1911 – 1915, serving as President of the Senate from 1913 – 1915. On November 2, 1915, he was elected Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts, serving three terms until November 5, 19l8 when he was elected Governor, serving two terms until November 3, 1920, when he was elected Vice President of the United States. Just prior to midnight on August 2, 1923, Calvin Coolidge learned of the death of President Warren G. Harding.  At 2:45 a.m. on August 3rd, by the light of a kerosene lamp, in the small sitting room of the Coolidge Homestead at Plymouth Notch, Vermont, the ceremony began. His father, a Notary Public, administered the Oath of Office and Calvin advanced from Vice President to become the Thirtieth President of the United States and finish out the rest of Harding’s first term of office.1 Coolidge decided to run for the Presidency.  He was nominated as the Republican candidate on June 12, 1924, elected to office on November 4, 1924, and inaugurated on March 4, 1925.  At this inauguration, Calvin placed his hand on the Bible opened to the first chapter of the Gospel of John, in memory of his first reading it at the age of six to his grandfather, Calvin Galusha Coolidge, as he lay dying.  His grandfather had done the same for his grandfather many years before.(16) He chose not to run for a second term of his own and returned to Northampton, Massachusetts on March 4, 1929 following the inauguration of Herbert Hoover.

6,March Madness on Capitol Hill (And I Don't Mean Basketball),politics," Well, I've had quite an exciting week. First of all, the team here at the Advocacy Associates empire organized hundreds of Congressional meetings for two different Washington, DC fly-ins, both of which occurred on March 11th. That wouldn't be notable in and of itself except that one of them took place at the Mayflower Hotel here in Washington, DC. Yes, THAT Mayflower hotel - the very one where Governor Spitzer, ummm, ""stayed"" in February. So yours truly had the joy of being at the Mayflower the day the news broke. We were so swamped with phone calls and meeting changes during the day that I didn't even hear the news until I called my husband at 6:00pm to say, without understanding the humor at all, ""well, I just finished my day at the Mayflower and now I'm going home."" Really. That's what I said. The silence on the other end of the line was deafening (although perhaps he was laughing so hard he couldn't speak). More important though is the fact that March 11th was perhaps one of the busiest days I have ever witnessed on Capitol Hill. There were literally tens of thousands of advocates in town all seeking meetings with their elected officials. Unfortunately, many offices simply couldn't accommodate all the requests, and some advocates were turned away. From the advocate perspective, I can certainly sympathize. It's frustrating to come all the way to Washington, DC only to be told that one of your Representatives simply can't meet with you. At the same time, as a former staff person, I empathize with the Congressional offices. Imagine, if you will, hundreds of your clients, patrons, patients, supporters, employees -- whoever it is that comes to you on a daily basis - calling you and saying ""Hi, I'll be in town from 10 to 2 on Thursday. I'd like to meet with you and I won't take no for an answer."" Many of the staff we talked to this week were in that situation, and no matter how much they wanted to do so, there was no way to fit hundreds of individuals into one four-hour period. Frankly, the combination of increasing numbers of advocates attending fly-ins with decreasing or stagnant Congressional staff levels spells disaster. I think we're heading toward a show down in the not too distant future. How can you avoid being part of the problem? Following are some ideas, using the ""March"" theme (just to keep things interesting): ""Beware the Ides of March"" (Shakespeare's Julius Caesar): Take the soothsayer's advice and stay away from DC in early to mid-March. Don't believe me? Type the phrase ""lobby day March 2008 DC"" into the search engine of your choice - you'll be surprised at what you find. From the AMA to the National Recreation and Park Association to the American Wind Energy Association, everyone under the sun shows up in DC in early March. In fact, while at the Mayflower on Monday and Tuesday, I saw both the National Funeral Directors Association and the Americans for Tax Reform conducting their lobby days - I guess it's true that nothing's certain but death and taxes. ""March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb"": Even moving your event to April can help ease the scheduling crunch. The groups holding events in April, May, September and October tend to have longer meetings and a more energetic response on the part of the staff. ""But wait,"" you're thinking, ""our group has appropriations issues. Don't we HAVE to be here in March?"" First of all, there are more ways to get your message across than just a DC fly-in (see the note below). Certainly you want your folks communicating early in the appropriations cycle. Fortunately, there are dozens of ways to do so without dragging them all to DC. Second, when was the last time you saw Congress actually adhere to its self-imposed budget / appropriations deadlines? I've been here twenty years and I haven't seen it happen yet. ""March to the Beat of a Different Drummer"" Fly-Ins are great, but don't focus exclusively on Capitol meetings as your main (or only) advocacy effort of the year. Consider the example of the American Library Association, which holds a ""virtual legislative day"" for ALA members who cannot get to DC for their May lobby day. Library supporters from around the country are encouraged to contact their elected officials from their districts while their cohorts are in DC. Or, take a page from National Public Radio's playbook. They are working with Congress to declare April ""Public Radio Recognition Month"" and are coordinating a DC fly-in for public radio stations as well as in-district activities throughout the month. These ""one-two punch"" approaches serve to magnify your voice in the Capitol - even during the busy season. ""Our life is March weather, savage and serene in one hour"" (Ralph Waldo Emerson): Don't like the weather in March? Wait a minute, it will change. The same is true of Capitol Hill. Political alliances, perspectives and positions are constantly evolving. If you're not completely satisfied with the responses you're getting from your elected officials, continue to be polite, firm and persistent - you may be able to change their mind yet! ""Crazy as a March Hare"" (Alice in Wonderland): Sometimes the people in Washington, DC do seem as crazy as March Hares. When you find yourself wondering whether you've accidentally fallen down the rabbit hole into some kind of fantasy world, it's time to take a step back and realize that some things are out of your control. Events can overtake even the best planned lobby days, leaving you with advocates trying to have coherent policy meetings while the main things on everyone's mind are gas prices, or blizzards or shenanigans in fancy hotels. Please remember our ""march"" ideas as you ""march forth and advocate"" - although as one advocate told me recently, that applies only to March 4th. Ha-Ha."
7,Misogyny--Alive And (Never) Well?,politics," Gender and race in Politics: Is it real? Is it important? Is it a distraction? Is it a way to divide and separate people from important discourse and meaningful discussion? Or when someone blurts out a statement that is innocent enough, and then is twisted and pigeon-holed into race and gender stereotypes,  I have to wonder--are these statements bringing controversies out of the proverbial closet and making people look carefully at themselves? Or instead of looking at themselves, allow buttons to be pushed, become angry and take to making self-righteous commentary, as Keith Olbermann did the other night in response to Geraldine Farraro's remarks that started by saying that if her name was Gerald instead of Geraldine, she never would have been chosen to be Walter Mondale's running mate in the 1980's. Why does Keith Olbermann, who denies making an endorsement of either candidate, seem to be endorsing Barak Obama? Olbermann didn't make a commentary when a woman on Obama's campaign staff called Hillary a monster. And why? Because he wasn't angry enough. He is siding with the obvious media favoring of Barak over Hillary. I was also guilty of not liking Hillary. Again, this dislike was key for me to look more deeply into who I am as a woman. Why wouldn't I support a thoroughly capable, brilliant and experienced woman to be our next President? She's a woman with years and years of political experience that spans prior to her marriage to Bill Clinton. Is the reason I wouldn't support her BECAUSE she is thoroughly capable and brilliant, and I am afraid I am not? When I disliked Hillary, I projected these insecurities on to her. Now that I love Hillary, I project my own capabilities and brilliance outside of my self, to her. Funny how love works. Frank Marafiote, in the Hillary Clinton Quarterly, wrote a great piece called: ""Women Who Hate Hillary Clinton."" Marafiote says that professional women hate Hillary because no matter what they've accomplished, Hillary is smarter, has earned more, and has ""mashed more men"" than they have. Professional women feel that their accomplishments pale beside the likes of Mrs. Clinton. Marafiote says that feminists hate Hillary because she is living proof that for women to get ahead in the world, they must subjugate themselves to the white male power structure, use their married name, change their hair, clothes and values to make it in a male dominated world. Why do country club Republican wives hate Hillary? According to Marafiote, these are the women with expensive degrees from Vassar, Smith, Mount Holyoke and Wellesley who for years coasted on their inheritance or the support from their wealthy husbands. And who are the people who love Hillary? White, middle aged, middleclass men. These men love Hillary's competence, as compared to the incompetence that surrounds them and all of us in the work place all day long. Hillary's the one they thought they married 20 years ago. And she's far less threatening than their own wives who are statistically more than likely to leave with their children, their homes and their bank accounts. So why do I love Hillary? Because she is gutzy, beautiful, brilliant and resilient. She will bring out those qualities for all women, if she is our next President."
8,Big Bizarre of Narcotics,politics," Narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, barring some minor exemptions here and there based on the historical and cultural compulsions of some nations, are banned across the globe. All the nations, including those harboring the perpetrators, have consensus on this subject, aegis United Nations. Drugs are therefore banned. In fact, drugs are only banned. Alcohol, tobacco, arms including fissile material, rapes, murders and for that matter nothing is so banned as drugs. No licenses are given to trade and no allowance for personal consumption except some very mild derivatives if prescribed medically that too in few of the countries. I have never done drugs and have no qualms in accepting that I have literally half knowledge of the subject I am trying to dabble with. An incorrigible inquisitive being as I am will some day take a shot, God forbid. I, during my job in an anti-smuggling agency, came across hundreds of shocking and surprising cases of narcotics smuggling. I have seen officers hating to do seizures of narcotic drugs given the relatively arduous and meticulous task of prosecution in these cases.  Believably most of those involved in legislation and enforcement of laws related to narcotic drugs have also never tried drugs. Like me they too have an unshakable belief in the laboratory tests proving that these drugs are highly addictive, and hence morally destructive. Drugs can ruin generations and nations, everyone agrees. Let me play devil’s advocate and ask-what will happen if the ban is lifted and those who desire to deal in drugs are asked to set shops? One scenario, I can assume, that everyone will be doing drugs. But the second but more probable outcome I can see is that the economy of drugs will come crashing down. Poppy, marijuana and cannabis are the herbs as old as any other medicinal herb or any other weed. The law was never so stringent and the threat never so alarming. It was the emergence of synthetic drugs that took the trade to dangerous proportions. The game became bigger and the nexus all-powerful. Narcotic drugs are consumed by a vulnerable and spoilt section of the society. There have been cases that the drugs are used for adulterating the street food for ‘hooking’ the innocent youngsters. Mostly these are found to be stories blown out of proportion by anti-drug campaigners. Drugs are mostly consumed by rich and spoilt kids at ultra end of the spectrum and by the destitute at the infra-end. There is a very large section of the society, called middle class that has nothing to do with drugs. Even in upper and lower classes it just stray people doing drugs. In that case what this Big ado is all about. A person knowingly taking drugs is a deserving case to suffer of its effects. The state needs to be sensitive to the spread of ills in the society and take adequate measures to stop it. But how one will justify the severity of punishment, going up to life imprisonment and capital sentence in a trade however illegal that may be. The drug dealers are doing it for money. The damages caused to the society and humanity are irreparable but to some extent incidental. The consumer of drugs is by any means more responsible for the affliction than the trafficker. The narcotics trade has to be dealt with an iron hand but not by draconian laws. The incommensurate scale of punishment has promoted the trade of drugs more than deterring it. It has taken the margin of profit to such an obnoxious level that the drug mafia has become the financier of all other illegal trades such as arms, money –laundering, smuggling, human trafficking. The drug lords wield so much of power that they can buy political protection. That makes the nexus powerful enough to influence legislation. Sometimes you are forced to think that there is a design or a tacit understanding to have this kind of enactment. If not then there should be some attempt to review and retook. Take the example of flesh trade.  By relaxing the law it becomes a legitimate way of earning for the victim and a social stigma for the exploiter. Narcotics are more or less a social problem and needs to be dealt as an offence against society and not a crime against humanity. The vested interests will perhaps not like that. For them, the economic and political stakes are too high."
9,Needed: Curious Leaders,politics," Lee Iacocca has just published a book entitled Where have all the Leaders Gone?  In it he claims that the most important quality of a good leader is possessing a sense of Curiosity.  A good leader is someone who reads widely, who thinks beyond his own comfort zone, and who stretches himself or herself into new dimensions of knowledge.  I take curiosity to mean someone who regularly poses questions about strange, perplexing and incongruous situations.  The curious person questions the givens in any situation,  persists in seeking out causes and consequences, and who, as Jack Welch noted,  wonders ""What if?"" and ""Why not? And ""How come?""  Iacocca and Welch, two noted former corporate CEOs, know the value of having someone in a leadership position who is restlessly curious, who wonders not only about world of work but also about nature and her magnificence.  Our future leaders must be people who ask hard questions of the status quo. They need to challenge such common wisdoms as: America can bring about democracy in other countries by force of will and arms wherever and whenever we choose. Political accommodation in Iraq will follow the military successes of the Surge--or vice-versa, that we need the establishment of viable political institutions before we can quell the insurgency. We can have large government programs and keep everybody honest. Success in the ""war on terror"" can be achieved without a national commitment, a degree of ""shared sacrifice."" Our leaders of the future must be curious about seeking causes for current events such as: The current meltdown in the housing market and related banking institutions . Earth’s warming. The astonishingly poor rates of graduation from high school in many large cities. So many millions of Americans who do not have medical insurance. New leaders for tomorrow must be able to ask, ""What if. . ?"" Current trends continue up to 2060 when we will have over 100 million more illegal and legal immigrants. We continue to borrow so many  billions from China. The number of divorces continues to keep two parent families at about 51%. Political partisanship proceeds unabated. We need to heed Brigadier General Scott Wallace’s call for leaders, not only in the army, but in politics as well who ""relentlessly question everything we do.""  In the US Army one such way is to conduct After Action Reviews, a post operation reflection composed of these three questions:  ""What was our goal?  What actually happened? How do we account for the differences between the vision or goal and the perceived reality?"" Would that we had leaders who continuously asked those kinds of questions about our pre-emptive strike against Iraq; about the attempt to alter Social Security;  the attempts at Israeli-Palestinian reconciliation; or why it will take another 12-18 months for the Iraqi Army to ""stand up."" Leaders are those who make decisions, but too often those decisions seem to have resulted from a rigidity of thinking that failed to consider all options.  Recently (9/10/07), Admiral Mike McConnell, Director of National Intelligence, noted that he had successfully instituted a process known as ""red teaming,"" a form of playing Devil’s Advocate that former CIA Directors had contemplated but prior to 9/11 had not brought to pass. With such Red Cells in place policy makers must consider alternative and dissent points of view to avoid the ""assumption trains"" that the US Senate Intelligence Committee said got us into such trouble prior to our invasion of Iraq. The 9/11 Commission recognized a failure of imagination in our pre-9/11 thinking.  Administration officials said, ""No one could have imagined. . .There were, however, those like Tom Clancy. We need leaders in all walks of life who work toward the Commission’s recommendation to ""routinize the practice of imagination.""  This means having a deep sense of inquisitiveness about personal and professional experiences, about living in the world and about our foreign and domestic policies.  It means ""relentlessly questioning everything we do"" and not accepting the common wisdoms whatever they may be.  And which of our common wisdoms should we challenge today?"
10,HAPPY BIRTHDAY MR. PRESIDENT - Jean Pierre Boyer,politics," Jean-Pierre Boyer (February 28, 1776 – July 9, 1850), Haïtian soldier and President of Haïti (1818-1843), born a free mulatto in Port-au-Prince, and educated in France. He fought with Toussaint L'Ouverture and then joined André Rigaud, also a mulatto, in the latter's abortive insurrection against Toussaint. He returned in 1802 with the French army of Charles Leclerc, but later joined the patriots under Alexandre Pétion, who chose him as his successor. Haïti, which gained its independence in 1804, was split north–south two years later following the overthrow of Emperor Jean-Jacques Dessalines into two separate realms, belonging to Henri Christophe and Pétion. Boyer was made the successor of Pétion and took control of the south following his death in 1818. When Christophe committed suicide in 1820, Boyer secured the northern Kingdom of Haiti. When Spanish Santo Domingo became independent in late 1821 Boyer was quick to invade and thereby unite the entire island by February 9, 1822. Boyer ruled the entire island of Hispaniola until 1843 when he lost the support of the ruling elite and was ousted.[1] Boyer received an education in France at a military school, due to the influence of his father. After that he joined the French Republican Army and after short period of time his status grew to that of a battalion commander. Next he joined up with the French Commissioners and returned to Haiti to take part in the fight against the white people and royalists in Haiti. Shortly after this, Haiti was invaded by the English. After this event Boyer went to Jacmal where ""he joined forces with the mulatto leader, General Riguad."" While all of the mulattos were surrendering to Toussaint Louverture in southern Haiti, Boyer and his new found friend Ruguad went to France. On his way to France Boyer stopped in the United States for his first and last time. He only visited the United States that one time but ""he always remembered it vividly."" After that visit Boyer stated that he had a high regard for the Quakers and their charitable ways which they showed to him throughout his stay in America. Shortly after this the Franco-American crisis ended, Boyer returned traveled to Paris where he stayed until 1801. Next, he returned to Haiti to protest Toussaint Louvetures newly gained independence. During this time it was uncovered that the French were planning on taking away the mulatto’s rights and beginning slavery once again in Haiti. Boyer was not going to just sit back and watch this happen. ""The collaboration of Negroes and mulattos brought an end to French domination."" Haiti Invasion of Dominican Republic On the eastern side of Hispaniola, the Spanish side, the Dominicans, led by José Núñez de Cáceres had just declared independence from Spain (December 1, 1821) and founded the new nation in a period that would later be referred as the ""La Independecia Efímera"" (Ephemeral Independence). Boyer wouldn't allow its neighbors independence, so he quickly trampled the resistance and entered Santo Domingo just two months after the declaration of independence. At that time, the Dominican Republic had a small population of 80,000 people (1/10th the population of Haiti), no armed forces and greatly deprived public administration that sought it's affiliation to the new Gran Colombia nation founded by Simon Bolivar. Purchase of Haiti from France Internationally, Boyer was anxious to remove the threat of France and opened negotiations. An agreement was reached on July 11, 1825, when with fourteen French warships off Port-au-Prince, Boyer signed an indemnity, stating that in return for 150 million francs paid within five years, France would recognize Haïti as an independent country. While this sum was later reduced to 60 million francs (1838), it was a crushing economic blow to Haïti, and cruelly Boyer had to negotiate a loan from France of 30 million francs in order to pay the first part of the indemnity. The Haïtian population meanwhile was retreating into an agricultural subsistence pattern, defying the initial plan of Boyer to enforce the semi-feudal fermage system. The people of Haïti were aggrieved at their situation and in order to placate them, Boyer resurrected a land distribution program, attempted and then abandoned during the initial revolution. The large plantations were broken up and the land distributed, the rural population were tied to their smallholdings and given production quotas. Boyer's rule lasted until 1843 when the poor economic situation was worsened by an earthquake, and the disadvantaged rural population rose up under Charles Riviere-Hérard in late January. On February 13, Boyer fled Haïti to nearby Jamaica before eventually settling in exile in France, dying in Paris. Descendants of Boyer live in the impoverished Haïti to this day. Haitian independence was claimed on January 1st, 1804, under the rule of the soon to be known, Emperor Jacques I. The Emperor was then killed in 1806. This caused Alexandre Petion to become President of the Republic of Haiti in the South. This is when Jean Pierre Boyer came to be the ""republican heir.""  He helped Petion to create a Republican Constitution very similar to that of the United States. During his presidency Petion set up many precedents and basically showed his successor what to do and what not to do. During this time Petion really won over the hearts of his people and grew to be the most liked out of any leader. After creating the Constitution in 1806 and amending it in 1816, it was stated that the President would be able to choose his successor. This would have obviously been Boyer. Petion died in 1818 and the Senate met immediately to approve his choice. Then Boyer was elected. Boyer believed it was necessary for Haiti to be acknowledged as an independent nation, but realized this could only be established by cutting a deal with France, so he did. On July 11, 1825 Boyer signed an indemnity saying he would pay France a certain amount of money in order to be recognized as independent. Haiti’s motto is ""in unity there is strength""  and apparently the same went for Boyer. As soon as he came to power he was faced with a very large hurdle. He had to go up against the leader of the north, Henri Christophe, who was an extreme threat to the south. This was a difficultly though, because of the great ""fortress"" that was built up in the north, compared to the smaller one Boyer himself was ruling. Boyer did not really have to worry about getting rid of Christophe however; his next move did this for him. He had two women put to death for praying that he would die which created havoc and caused people of all classes to unite against him. His soldiers began to rebel against him in 1820, and Christophe ended up killing himself, making Boyer a conqueror without fighting a single battle. Welcoming Freed Americans Boyer began encouraging freed Americans to emigrate back to the Republic of Haiti. The way in which he went about promoting this was by advertising in newspapers and by ""promising free land and political opportunity to black settlers"". This was not to benefit them however; this was to get skilled laborers to Haiti to benefit Jean Pierre Boyer. Haiti was treated as a ""pariah"" or as an outcast by other nations. It was feared that President Monroe would have been forced to ""take action"" against Haiti for not only agreeing to take in rebel slaves but suggesting and promoting it. Pierre Boyer had actually made the effort to contact people within the United States of America, who had claimed that they wanted to work with the Haitian government to bring the displaced African Americans there. Boyer had sent agents to the black communities to convince them that Haiti was a sovereign state, which was open to all that looked to be truly free. These actions were noticed by the American Colonization Society, who were looking to send and in the beginning processes of colonizing Liberia in Africa for the former slaves. Prior to learning about Boyer’s enthusiasm about emigrating other ""lost"" blacks in other countries, the organization had been trying to use a voluntary system, in which they would try to persuade former slaves to leave voluntarily. Loring Dewey had toured around the east coast in 1817, starting in New York. This process was ultimately a failure for both the organization and Dewey, who had figured that he would be able to remove close to 100,000 freed blacks within a 10 year span. With calculation continuing, they came to the conclusion that should they continue to remove freed and enslaved Africans, they would obliterate the African American population in America. Dewey had abandoned the idea of colonization for emigration in his travels in New York. Meeting with a Haitian citizen, who argued that Haiti was ideal for emigration due to its weather conditions and the independent Negro government which governed the island, Dewey began to think of the idea of using Haiti to send the free blacks. Dewey began writing to Boyer at this time, asking if he was still interested in emigrating freed slaves to Haiti, posing them as an ""unhappy lot"".  Almost immediately, Boyer had begun corresponding to Dewey, with the interest of his unhappy brothers and sisters in mind. Boyer received a list of question to the regards of the Haitian government and its support of the incoming migrates from the A.C.S. He was confident that his government would be able to receive these people, but also saw that Dewey was trying to sneak in a few requests that Boyer smoothly responded to. One of these request concerned the finances of transporting the families to the Haiti, in which Dewey seemed to try and get Haiti to pay for most or all the transportation fees, which Boyer responded that the government would pay for those who cannot afford it, but the American Colonization Society would have to take care of the rest of the finances. This was a smart move since Haiti was already in debt to the French who were making the Haitian basically pay for their independence. Spending the millions of dollars to transport all of the families would have put the already in debt Haitians into further debt. Dewey also requested a colony to be put on the island that would be separate from the rest of the island with its own laws, legislature, etc. This idea of the colony showed both that America was beginning to show interest in expanding in to the Caribbean and to colonize the recently freed Latin American territories. Boyer was fully against the idea of having an American colony on the island since the Haitians had already experienced the threat of re-colonization from the French. He responded to Dewey stating that the laws of the Haitian government were general and no particular laws can exist. All other requests though were about opportunities for the freed slave in regards to land, money, education and government support. Boyer had pleasant answers for all these questions claiming that there was plenty of land for the people to call their own, money to be made through the import and export of goods, school were found in almost every community and the government was more than willing to help the migrates settle into their new surroundings. Exile and Death He left Haiti on February 13th, went to Jamaica then he was exiled to France. He died in 1850 and was succeeded by Charles Riviere-Herard.

11,The A-Z of Global Warming: Biofuels,politics," This second article from The A-Z of Global Warming deals with biofuels, which will undoubtedly be a phrase that will be heard a lot more often over the coming years, but what are they?, where do they come from?, and what is their significance in relation to global warming? Biofuels can be described as any fuel that is derived from biomass ie living organisms or their metabolic by-products. For example, crops such as corn and dung from living animals Although there is still somewhat of a scientific debate going on over the advantages of biofuels, it is thought that the main advantage over fossil fuels (coal,oil and gas), is that the burning of biofuels to release energy does not cause a net increase of CO2 levels in the atmosphere. This is because the source of the biofuel, crops for example, have already taken a corresponding amount of CO2 out from the atmosphere during their growth cycle when they photosynthesise. When this occurs, plants/crops release oxygen and retain the carbon to use as energy. The carbon is then released when the crop is eventually burnt in order to release its energy. As long as new crops are planted in place of the ones that are burnt, there will be no overall increase in the amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere. So, whilst crop based biofuels don't reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, they are thought to be more or less carbon neutral. The difference with fossil fuel deposits such as coal is that the coal deposits have been formed in the earth over millions of years and are therefore considered to be energy deposits rather than part of the energy cycle. The burning of fossil fuels on a scale required to satisfy mankind's energy needs, over a relatively short period of time, hundreds of years as opposed to the millions of years it has taken the deposits to form, means that the burning of such fuels, adds considerably to the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. This in turn adds to the greenhouse gases already present in our atmosphere, and contributes to the warming of the Earth's climate. Forms of biofuel Biofuels can either be in solid form or liquid form. Solid biofuels such as wood or even manure (dried cow dung) can be burnt to heat water which can then be used to power a turbine, which can generate electricity. Liquid biofuels, such as ethanol can be used as a substitute or be mixed with traditional fuels in automobiles. Biofuel uses The major benefit however probably comes from liquid biofuel, for the creation of Ethanol or biodiesel. Ethanol, a substitute for fossil fuel based petrol, and biodiesel, which is just diesel made with crops in place of oil which is a replacement for traditional diesel fuel in diesel motor vehicles. Whilst diesel cars are more fuel efficient than their petrol counterparts, biodiesel vehicles produce even less carbon dioxide. Neither are as efficient however as vehicles running on mostly ethanol-based fuels. To run on fuel which has a greater than 10% mix of ethanol however, vehicles need a flexi-fuel modified engine. The USA grows mainly corn crop, which can be converted to ethanol. In Brazil sugar cane is grown, and in the UK rapeseed is used. Brazil is at the forefront of biofuel use, using it as a fuel in automobiles which have the flex-fuel engines needed to be able to run on pure ethanol. Environmentally friendly or not? Despite the benefits of using biofuels, there is a drawback however, which is the amount of land required to grow the crops necessary for the biofuel in the first place. There are already concerns that vast tracts of tropical rainforest like the Amazon in Brazil, are being cleared to plant sugar cane and other crops for biofuel production. Another problem is the cost of corn, an essential ingredient for basic food is also escalating causing further problems as the cost of certain products become unaffordable to many.  It would clearly be counter productive if such a situation were to develop where the CO2 absorbing tropical rainforests were being destroyed to plant crops to turn into environmentally friendly biofuels! There is also a concern that as a by-product of growing the corn or other crop used for biofuel production environmental damage is caused by the fossil fuelled tractors, processes, fertilisers etc used in the growing process, meaning that they are not truly carbon neutral at all. Recent research indicates that prairie grasses actually take out more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during their growth than they emit when being converted to biofuel, meaning that they may well be truly carbon neutral. It would seem more research is needed into biofuel production and use, but if grown responsibly, i.e not on land cleared of rainforest, a benefit may well be had for the environment by their use."
12,What is the Outlook for the Availability of Fossil Fuels?,politics," I think this article is comparable to the people who slow down on the highway to look at an automobile accident. You are not involved in the accident, yet you surely are curious about what is happening. At the present time we can sense the presence of a disaster, but we do not have enough information to feel that we can get involved. My push to adopt renewable energies is based on our continued polluting of the environment with the burning of fossil fuels. We know that we must slow down this pollution so that our quality of life will not be severely degraded. There is another piece of information needed to prod us into action, and that is how long do we have before we run out of fossil fuels? As a current member of the earth, I am concerned that we leave future generation's sufficient energy to bridge the gap from fossil to renewable fuels. This, to me, is looking at the car wreck. How long do we have until we are the ones involved in the wreck? The majority of Americans now think that climate change is a problem and that global warming is real. But there still is not a sense of urgency. Every year the US emits CO2 that equals the equivalent weight of 1.2 billion elephants (2 trillion pounds using average size elephants). It is time to stop ignoring 1.2 billion elephants in the room. It is time to implement a plan that will adopt renewable energies at a pace to stabilize the environment from CO2 pollution and then, hopefully, start to reduce the amount of pollution we must derive this plan with an eye to how long our reserves of fossil fuels will last. Once we derive this plan we then can look at future generations and inform them ""Here is the plan"". The development of modern civilization has been dependent on both the availability and the advancement of energy. We have witnessed a progression from animal and steam power to the internal combustion engine and electricity generation and to the harnessing of alternative sources of energy. Because of our reliance on energy sources, it is also important to understand the impact of energy use on the environment. All aspects of energy, the way it is produced, distributed, and consumed, can affect local, regional, and global environments through land use and degradation, air pollution and global climate change via greenhouse gas emissions. Over the foreseeable future, it is very likely that fossil fuels will remain our largest source of energy. However, fossil fuels are finite resources and there is concern not only about both domestic supply and U.S. reliance on foreign supplies but, also, with the increasing cost of these fuels. The research on the longevity of fossil fuels is an exciting adventure in itself. I will touch on some of the theories before I conclude this series of articles. Given the slack of a decade or two, the best summation of the longevity of fossil fuels is presented in ""Wikipedia, Fossil fuel: Years of production left in the ground with the most optimistic reserve estimates (Oil & Gas Journal, World Oil)"". Oil: = 45 years Gas: = 72 years Coal: = 252 years With the slack of plus or minus 10 years, most projections are consistent with the Wikipedia numbers. . The popular Hubert peak theory projects that for any given geographical area, from an individual oil-producing region to the planet as a whole, the rate of petroleum oil production tend to follow a bell-shaped curve. ""Olduvai revisited 2008"" from The Oil Drum blog is an amazing study. This theory was first laid out by Richard Duncan in1989 when he observed that world energy per capita had been declining for a decade. The Olduvai waveform for oil starts in 1950 which is consistent with the Wikipedia projections that the waveform will be completed by 2053. The energy consumption of a nation is proportional to its Gross National Product (GNP).i.e. (The higher the GNP of a nation, then the higher its consumption.).To maintain our accustomed standard of living, we require the amount of energy that we are burning now to maintain our lifestyles. With the depletion of fossil fuels this will require renewable fuels to fill in the gap. How do we hammer this information into a plan?  A roadmap needs to be derived that utilizes the adoption of solar, wind, geothermal and biomass energies into our energy consumptions needs. Technologies such as stuffing CO2 into caves should not be adopted until they are proven. A plan that incorporates renewable energies with fossils fuels usage would be more realistic for our country to follow. How do we proceed? We must continue tax incentives for the renewable energy sectors to incubate their growth. Our House of Representatives in Congress has passed a bill to renew the energy tax incentives that are due to expire December 31, 2008. President Bush threatens to veto this bill because it taxes the Oil Industry $19 billion dollars from multi-billion dollar profits. The president's premise is that the oil companies require these profits to continue exploration of new oil.  Politics aside, we desperately need to find new sources of renewable energy. We need to demand that our local and national leaders produce renewable energy action plans. There are pockets of leadership like Arizona and California. This leadership needs to be at a national level to be successful for the USA. Once this is accomplished we will be well on our way for future generations."
13,Can the USA Be Fossil Fuels Independent by 2050?,politics," This question is becoming a key cornerstone in our prediction for the health and prosperity of the future United States of America. Experts are beginning to predict that our worldwide sources for crude oil will have peaked in production by 2050 at the latest and the production quality will then be declining. If we stay dependent on this declining resource we will forever be held hostage to the Middle East oil producing countries. Today, each man, woman and child in the USA (300,000,000 citizens) on the average sends $40.00 per day or a total of $500,000,000,000.00 per year (oil priced at $100.00 per barrel) to the oil producing countries in order to maintain our addiction to fossil fuels. There are no indications that the price for crude oil will be declining significantly. We will have market fluctuations but the overall trend is a continuing increase in the price of a barrel of crude oil. We, in the US, need to retain these dollars on our shores and break the hostage chains of crude oil from the Middle East. If this is accomplished then we can determine the future health and prosperity of the USA. In the January 2008 issue of Scientific American Magazine, Ken Seibel, James Mason and Vassals Fthenakis published an article "" A Solar Grand Plan"". They proposed that by 2050 solar power could end U.S. dependence on foreign oil and slash greenhouse gas emissions. They propose that a vast area  of photovoltaic cell be erected in the Southwest. Their proposal would store excess daytime energy in underground caverns to be tapped during nighttime hours. A direct-current power transmission would have to be built to deliver this power across the USA. They estimated that $420 billion in government subsidies from 2011 to 2050 would be require to fund this project. They estimated that this proposal could supply 69 percent of the U.S. electricity and 35 percent of its total energy by 2050. On the first reading this article sounded great but far reaching. Where could we get the leadership to accomplish this task? In the short period between the January article and late February two major announcements leads us to embrace ""A Solar Grand Plan"" as a major component to reduce our fossil fuel payments to the Middle East . The first event is the announcement from the Associated Press entitled ""Can Arizona becomes the Persian Gulf of Solar Energy?"" The Spanish company Abingdon Solar and Arizona Public Service Company are planning to take 3 square miles of desert southwest of Phoenix and turn them into one of the largest solar power plants in the world. ""Their proposal would yield a 280 MW capacity electrical generating plant.This is accomplished on a 3 square miles of desert. The energy plant would supply electricity to 70,000 homes. The Knowledge Problem Blog extroplated the available data to estimate future generation potentials. Three square miles yields a 280 MW capacity plant. Using the 70,000 homes number, a little calculation gives a 38 percent capacity factor for the plant, so that implies the plant will produce about 932,000 MHz per year. If all of the state's electric power needs were generated using similar technologies and assuming constant economies of scale, it would take about 236 square miles (or about 1.2 percent of the land within the state) to accommodate the necessary solar power plants. A further calculation estimates that 36,000 square miles of land would be require generating the U.S.electrical needs. The American Scientific article estimates that there are 250, 000 square miles of land in the Southwest that is suitable for the use of solar generation. How do the residents of Arizona feel about this land use potential? Arizona governor Janet Napolitano has been quoted as saying, ""There is no reason that Arizona should not be the Persian Gulf of solar energy."" Arizona passed state laws to support solar energy starting in 2003. Pilot programs were approved to accelerate the market development for distributed PV installations in schools, public buildings, and individual residential and small business establishments. The support for these programs has continued to strengthen. It is viewed as a major job producing effort, a project to maintain reasonable electrical costs and the major benefit of non polluting energy. The second major announcement is the desire of Abu Dhabi to spend $15 billion makes the oil-rich emirate an epicenter of green technology. Called the Masdar Initiative, it's best known for plans to build Masdar City, a ""zero-carbon, zero-waste"" urban center. Actually, the far range objective of the Masdar Initiative is to establish the Silicon Valley of renewable solar energy in Abu Dhabi. The intent is to cover the whole value chain - from research to labs to manufacturing to the deployment of technologies. To that end, Masdar is collaborating with European and U.S. universities, including MIT and Columbia, to develop a research institute.  We in the US should find condolence that the $500,000,000,000.00 dollars that we are sending to the Middle East are being spent widely. A country that is sitting on an oil rich desert is building solar power plant to free themselves of the escalating cost of fossil fuels and be ""zero-carbon, zero-waste"" urban center. If the United States continues to stay addicted to the oil of the Middle East we will be paying with inflating costs as the oil fields deplete. So Yes to the question ""Can the USA Be Fossil Fuels Independent by 2050?"". But, we will require strong leadership with the visions being demonstrated by Arizona and Abu Dhabi The leadership will have to politically lead our congress to continue the tax incentives to adopt renewable energies credits. Fossil fuels independence will require solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear technologies which other countries are demonstrating."
14,The Invasion of Santo Domingo,politics," There were several attempts at various times to forcefully unite the two colonies of Hispaniola. The imperial powers of the period, from the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries, strived to possess or repossess Hispaniola as one nest egg for the crown heads in Europe. At that period in time, Hispaniola was very rich in agricultural products desperately needed in Europe. These included sugarcane, coffee and peppers.  Apart from these agricultural products, the gold mines on both sides of Hispaniola were still productive. Added to these sources of wealth was cheap slave labor to work the mines and plantations, at minimal cost to their owners. Toussaint Louverture’s Invasion of Santo Domingo The first attempt of takeover of Hispaniola as one single colony was made by Sir Francis Drake in 1586 on behalf of the English monarchy when he captured Santo Domingo. However, this merely provided comical relief, as he and his adventurers were driven off by the Spaniards, after occupying Hispaniola for only one month. Imperial France had always wanted to annex the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo to its own Saint Domingue to form one single prosperous colony. By the Treaty of Bale which was signed by France and Spain on July 22, 1795, Spain ceded its colony in Hispaniola to France. However, France could not take physical possession because it had virtually lost its own colony, Saint Domingue, to the forces of Haitian Revolution under the leadership of Toussaint. France was then faced with a dilemma because it did not want a united Hispaniola under a black Governor General. Nevertheless, an astute diplomat that he was, Louverture went on to invade Santo Domingo, ostensibly to implement the Treaty of Bale on behalf of the French Government. He now set out to claim France's authority over the entire island of Hispaniola. The invasion was swift and decisive. Though he encountered some military resistance on the way to the capital of Santo Domingo, Toussaint Louverture triumphantly entered Santo Domingo City on January 26, 1801. Toussaint Louverture thus became the Governor General of a united Hispaniola. However, his reign or rule was short-lived. Napoleon Bonaparte, who was soon to become Louverture’s nemesis, seized power in France. Toussaint then became Napoleon’s most feared General. Having decided to reintroduce slavery in the French colonies, including Saint Domingue, Napoleon dispatched a large expeditionary army under the command of his brother-in-law General Charles Leclerc to re-establish slavery in Hispaniola. Although the military confrontation was indecisive, Louverture was tricked into relinquishing power to Leclerc and allowed to retire to his farm estate. Leclerc soon broke the accord, seized Louverture and had him deported to France where he died soon after. Dessalines attempted Invasion In March 1805, Emperor Jean-Jacques Dessalines set out with his Haitian army in an attempt to take the city of Santo Domingo by force and thus reunite the two separate entities of Hispaniola, independent Haiti, and colonial Santo Domingo. He had to abandon his dream of reuniting the Island when he was informed that a French naval squadron was approaching Haiti. He hurried back home in order to defend his capital against the impending French invasion. Thus the plan for reintegration of Santo Domingo into Haiti was shelved and put off till a more auspicious time. Jean-Pierre Boyer’s Invasion of Santo Domingo What turned out to become the most successful integration of the two politically distinct parts of Hispaniola into one single unit started with the colony of Santo Domingo declaring its independence from Spain on November 30, 1821 with its name changed to Spanish Haiti. Jean-Pierre Boyer who had succeeded Alexandre Petion as president of Haiti, when the later died in 1818, moved to consolidate his hold on the whole Island of Hispaniola. In 1822, Boyer led an invasion of Spanish Haiti, quickly conquering it and thus holding the entire island in the name of Haiti. His was a master stroke. Spanish Haiti (Santo Domingo) was weak militarily and could therefore not offer much military resistance to Boyer’s military might. There was also the ever present fear that the resurgent French, still smarting from their defeat at the hands of Black Haitians, would return to invade Hispaniola, reclaim their plantations and reintroduce slavery. The French did return later and forced Haitian President Boyer to do their bidding, by signing an outrageous indemnity of one hundred and fifty million franks, as payment for loss of French colonial plantations. This money was to be paid by Haiti within five years. Meanwhile, Boyer moved to consolidate his authority over the whole island of Hispaniola. He established two parallel administrations, one with the seat of government in Cap Haïtien, and the other in Ciudad Santo Domingo. In order to streamline the administration of the whole island, Boyer embarked on a number of administrative hreforms. He abolished slavery in Santo Domingo and promised land to all libertos. To be able to meet the demand for land by the newly freed slaves, Boyer overhauled the Spanish land tenure laws, and substituted them with the more modern French laws which provided for private ownership of land. The Spanish laws on land tenure made land a communal property. This would have been an obstacle to Boyer’s desire to give land to the newly liberated slaves, the libertos. Boyer’s administration was patterned after that of his mentor, Alexandre Sabès Pétion. He, like Petion, was generous and egalitarian. However, his land hreforms pitted him against the large plantation owners of Santo Domingo, including the Catholic Church which owned lager parcels of land. His greatest undoing however, was the agreement that he signed with the French government to pay a colossal sum of 150 million franks as reparation to French plantation owners who had fled Haiti during the revolution. The resultant economic and tax burden caused by the reparation on the people forced them to turn against him. He was chased out of his palace and had to run away to escape being lynched by his own people"
15,Dutty Boukman - Samba Boukman,politics," Throughout the history of the human race, even up till the present moment, one of the most potent forces which men use to rally oppressed peoples together, in their drive towards freedom and emancipation from their oppressors, is religion. Men who have successfully led their enslaved peoples from bondage and servitude to freedom; have at one point or the other, mobilized their people with a rallying cry and an appeal to a deity, which had its origins in the subconscious of their people; for deliverance from slavery, servitude and oppression. Human history is replete with examples of this recourse to supernatural intervention, by oppressed and disenfranchised people. Some of the most famous narrations of such recourse to theosophical interventions are found in the Jewish Pentateuch and the Christian Bible. In these narrations, Moses, the divinely appointed leader of the children of Israel, rallied his compatriots; who were then being enslaved by Egyptians, with a call to keep a divine appointment with Yahweh, in the desert of Sinai at Mount Horeb. His efforts paid off. Israel was led from slavery to freedom by Moses with the guidance of God. Dutty Boukman at Bois Caïman In the same vein, the historical deliverance of Black African slaves of Haiti from French colonial servitude was in no small measure aided by an appeal for help to the well known African deities particularly Shango, god of thunder and Ogun, god of iron and war. To prod Shango and Ogun to action, a ceremony of covenant with the Almighty Voodun was held by the African slaves of Haiti in Bois Caïman in April 1791. The leader of the Maroons at this religious dedication ceremony to the ancient African deities and spirits, which marked the beginning of the rebellion of Haitian slaves in 1791, was a priest of Voodun. He was variously called Dutty Boukman, Samba Boukman. Dutty Boukman was said to have been born somewhere on the West African coast, probably old Dahomey. He was captured, enslaved and shipped off to the West Indies as a young man already versed in the esoteric knowledge and nuances of his religion, the worship of Voodun. A man of imposing stature and granite features; Boukman was tall and huge. He was first sold into slavery on the sugar plantations of Jamaica, but later found his way to Hispaniola, where he joined the bands of Maroons. In Egun dialect of Yoruba language, Voodun can be translated as Almighty God, the Overall Supreme Deity. Ogun, the god of iron and war, is regarded as man’s ultimate mediator with Voodun in times of civil conflict and war. Therefore, Boukman’s appeal to Voodun through Ogun to come to the aid of the African slaves in their time of distress was very appropriate. The dedication of all those present at the ceremony to the god of war was also timely; because the beginning of the slave rebellion in August 1791 coincided with the annual festival of worship of this fearsome deity. It was at the beginning of the season of heavy rains. As thunder rumbled and lightening tore through the skies, as if in affirmation of the presence of Shango, men and women danced convulsively to the scintillating sounds of ‘bata’ drums and chanting of sacred songs. Boukman’s Invocation To climax the ceremony, Dutty Boukman rendered his famous Invocation to Voodun. ""The god, who created the earth, who created the sun that gives us light. The god who holds up the ocean; who makes the thunder roar. Our god who has ears to hear. You who are hidden in the clouds; who watches us from where you are. You see all that the whites have made us suffer. The white man's god asks him to commit crimes. But the god within us wants to do good. Our god, who is so good, so just, He orders us to revenge our wrongs. It's He who will direct our arms and bring us to victory. It's He who will assist us. We all should throw away the image of the white men's god who is so pitiless. Listen to the voice for liberty that speaks in all our hearts."" The worship of Ogun normally involves blood sacrifice. The sacrificial animal’s throat is slit, and the blood is poured out. All those attending the ceremony then made a covenant with Ogun and other African deities, by dipping their hands into the sacrificial blood and took an oath to serve the deities for the rest of their lives. At the end of the ceremony on that fateful day in Bois Caïman in August 1791, erstwhile timid men and women went forth, emboldened by the assurance that Voodun through his messenger Ogun, would lead them to victory over their oppressors. The oath of vengeance taken by these oppressed men and women would later translate to massive destruction of lives and properties of their slave masters. Dutty Boukman’s Place in Haitian History Dutty Boukman therefore deserves the honor as the first leader of the African slave rebellion which eventually led to freedom for the oppressed peoples of Saint Domingue, and the birth of Haiti as the first autonomous Black Republic in the World. Those who took over the mantle of leadership of the African slaves of Saint Domingue from Boukman Dutty, after he was captured and beheaded by the French colonists, were all present at the now unforgettable and landmark dedication ceremony to Ogun at Bois Caïman on August 14, 1791. The roll call: Cecile Fatiman, Georges Biassou, Jeannot Bullet and Jean François Papillon. They all became leaders of the early stanza of Haitian Revolution. In Present day Haiti, the memory of Dutty Boukman is venerated and highly regarded, as the first leader of the Haitian Revolution. Bois Caïman is now a Haitian national heritage site where all devotees of the ancient African religion, now corrupted as voudou, gather to pay homage to Ogun, and the memory of Dutty Boukman. It is now widely accepted that the religious ceremony to the African deity of war, Ogun, at Bois Caïman on August 14, 1791, was the starting point for the Haitian Revolution."
16,The Haitian Revolution,politics," Much has been written from the historical point of view about that unique and pacesetting revolution called ‘The Haitian Revolution’. It is unique and pacesetting because it is the only successful slave revolution known to human history. The Haitian revolution was a many faceted and long drawn out conflict between privilege and liberty. There were several unequal groups in Haiti. The first group, made up of those who had privileges of both birth and position, clung desperately to their position and privilege in Haitian colonial society. This group did not want to lose any of their privileges which they took as their inalienable birthright. These were the landed French gentry. They did not want any of the other groups to join them, or share in their privileges. They were free men who also owned other men as slaves. Overview, Class and Racial Divisions in Haiti The second broad group was made up of those who by accident of birth became a bridge between master and slave. They were the mulattoes. These were the product and consequence of the concupiscence of white male colonists for their black female slaves. Mulattoes were free men and could and did inherit properties of their white fathers. These properties of course included black African slaves bought by their white fathers. However, there was a limit to their freedom and privilege. They could not participate in the political process of governing Haiti. Initially, this was all the deprivation which the mulattoes suffered. When the Mulattoes started agitating for equality with their ‘lily white’ half brothers, additional roadblocks were put on their way. They were banned from such prestigious vocations as Law and Medicine. The Third group which occupied the bottom rung in colonial Haitian society comprised black African slaves owned by the other two groups. These had neither freedom nor privileges. They were regarded as disposable commodity by their owners. The struggle by the mulattos to attain equality with the whites set the stage for conflict between the first two groups on the one hand. The desire of the black slaves to throw off the yoke of slavery, and attain freedom and some modicum of human dignity, was the platform for war with the two privileged, slave owning groups. Then add to the equation the untenable position of the runaway slaves, called Maroons, who were being hunted like wild animals by their former owners; and you have a perfect recipe for a murky conflict in which alliances kept changing from one day to the next. Initial Skirmishes Hostilities between the three broad racial groups in Haiti predates the year 1791, when full scale rebellion broke out in what is generally hreferred to as the ""Slave Rebellion"". Right from the onset of massive importation of black Africans as slaves in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, enslaved men and women had always wanted to regain their freedom from the dehumanizing state of slavery. Before the general uprising of 1791, there were some notable rebellions which could be said to be direct preludes to the main Haitian revolution. The main revolution in Saint Dominique beginning in the year 1791 and culminating in declaration of independence for Haiti on January 1, 1804, cannot be fully appreciated, unless we look at social developments in Saint Dominique in the period preceding 1791. The Maroon Challenge The runaway slaves, otherwise called Maroons, were the arrowhead of the Haitian Revolution. But for the Maroons, led by capable men like Makandal, Boukman, Toussaint Louverture, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, it was doubtful whether the Haitian Revolution would have succeeded. After running away from the plantations and their cruel and inhumane masters, the slaves blended together in communities hidden in the virtually inaccessible mountains and forests of Hispaniola. From their hideouts, Maroons bands emerged in the dead of night to terrorize their erstwhile slave masters. They burnt down ‘white’ owned plantations and slaughtered their owners. With their knowledge of herbal preparations, Maroon leaders like Makandal, poisoned crops and animals on the plantations, in addition to dealing severely with plantation owners. The French colonists on their part showed the same degree of vicious cruelty to any Maroon leader who was unfortunate to be captured. They were hanged in the public square and their heads displayed on stakes as an example and a warning to other would be rebels. The clashes between Maroons and French colonists continued for a very long time until the showdown of 1791. The Mulatto Challenge As offspring of the same white fathers, and being equally educated as the whites, if not better, the mulattoes could not understand why they were being treated as second class citizens by the whites. They therefore challenged the status quo, sometimes through peaceful means, and at other times through armed rebellion. The French colonists ignored the peaceful approach, and when mulattoes resorted to armed conflict, their rebellion was forcefully and brutally put down, and their leaders hanged in the public square. Being so outsmarted and outgunned by the whites, the mulattoes were conveniently obliged to embrace the equally rebellious Maroons. This marriage of convenience evolved into the biggest and most efficient fighting force in human history at that period. Prosecution of the Revolutionary War The Haitian Revolution was truly a war of liberation. In order to claim equal rights with their white French half brothers, the Mulattoes sought total emancipation from the role of second class citizens. The domestic and plantation slaves of Saint Dominique along with their runaway brothers, the Maroons, wanted nothing less than total liberation from the shackles of degrading, dehumanizing slavery. The three groups, Mulattos, Maroons and docile slaves thus had a common cause, which required a common approach, armed confrontation with white French colonists. Each group spawned great military strategists as leaders. The Mulatto forces under the capable leadership of André Rigaud, Alexandre Pétion, captured the west and south of the colony. The Maroon forces were initially led by Boukman. Upon his death, overall control of all black fighting men fell to François-Dominique Toussaint Louverture. The colonial army was reinforced by thousands of troops from France. The war campaign was vicious. Each of the antagonists came up with a policy of taking no prisoners. With a battle cry taken straight from the revolutionary mouth of Thomas Paine ""give me liberty or give me death"" the forces of black liberation eventually went on to win freedom and liberation for the slaves of Saint Dominique. From the ruins and ashes of war torn Saint Dominique, the first Black Republic was born and christened ‘Haiti’ taken from the Arawack name for the island: Ayiti."
17,"Haiti's Political Parties, Why so many?",politics," Over two hundred years have passed since its Independence, and Haiti remains trailing behind the developing world. Now that we have entered a new and strange phase in Haiti, perhaps the lowest ever, from sporadic kidnappings, murders, to a society of lawlessness, should we sit and wait for solutions from a dubious International Community? Or should we be seeking our own solutions to our existing problems? The country that used to be the model for freedom lovers now finds itself in a different kind of a struggle, a struggle where poverty, public safety, education and unemployment become the core enemy of its inhabitants. What should we do to eradicate Haiti’s rampant problems? Where should we begin?  Or should we even bother? Others, including myself, would argue that, amongst other things, Haiti’s political party system is a menace to its political stability. Thus, we cannot turn our backs on Haiti. We must help control and reduce the problems of Haiti. The land of Toussaint Louverture, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Mackandal, after all, my land has amassed so much unsolved political mysteries that I frequently wonder where to start in the process of solving its dilemmas. Though I find it difficult to pinpoint the real reasons behind Haiti’s troubles, to not attempt to seek possible solutions is adding to its misery. I would say that one of the reasons why Haiti is trailing behind the developing world is the weakness of its political party system. In fact, it seems that Haiti’s political party system has greatly contributed to its current stalemate. Following the fall of President Jean-Claude Duvalier, political parties have mushroomed throughout the country. Haitian ""leaders"" from all over the world, especially from the U.S, France and Canada invaded the streets of Port-au-Prince hoping to succeed Duvalier. It was a ""marathon"" to the presidency. Such an attitude was then understandable for there was a vacuum in the Haitian political system. However, I’m afraid that it continues till today. To mock the people, the word on the streets of Haiti was then ""no more presidents for life"". While the ""leaders"" are calling for changes and ""saying"" no to president for life, they are elected for life within their own political parties. Isn’t this ironic? We can take RDNP/Lesly F. Manigat, MDN/Hubert Deronceray, and KONAKOM/Victor Benoit as examples of leaders who are elected for life within their political parties. It is a presidential ego that is driving them so blindly that nobody seems to notice the outcry of the Haitians to the political party system. The truth is such that these ""leaders"" would take a five years sabbatical from the public after loosing a presidential election, however, if there’s a coup d’état, they would resurface hoping to be offered the presidency. I truly am certain that these ""leaders’"" sole purpose is winning a presidential election. There is no evidence to support the contrary. These aforementioned ""leaders"" could have been remarkable lawmakers or great mayors but, in Haiti, there is a myth about the presidency. One has to become president to prove his patriotism or to prove what he can do for the Republic. Having said this, I would argue that political party reform is necessary and must take place in Haiti for we cannot let such a weak and poorly organized system decide on the future of the country. I mention the future of the country because; I believe that, the well-being of Haiti is fundamentally rest on the direction taken by its political party system. It is also true for long term political stability to take place in Haiti. In fact, long term political stability in Haiti is contingent upon a complete political party reform. The current system is problematic and an invitation to voting flaws and chaos as it has been proven to be so. The question becomes why so many Parties? There are more than sixty-seven political parties in a country of approximately eight and a half million souls. This is a staggering number that tends to grow daily. Though successfully organized, the last presidential election in Haiti proved the weakness of the political parties to compete. Among 34 candidates running for the office of the presidency in February 2006, 33 of them ranked on the bottom 13% of the vote tallied. What this is suggesting is that a win for President Preval could very well be a loss for Haiti, that is to say, in the absence of a strong political process, the winner is deemed to be irrelevant. Because of so many candidates, the political process becomes a joke and, quite frankly, most Haitians are not willing to laugh at Haiti’s sadness; and so they would stay home and not participate in the electoral process. As such, the legitimacy of the vote will always be questioned. Whereas, has there been a three to four political party system, the electorates would have had a greater influence in choosing the highest authority figure of the land. As Haiti tries to get back on track, with the new elected government of Preval/Alexis, there isn’t a better time to challenge the political party system of Haiti. This government should make political party reform one of its priorities in order for political stability to take place in Haiti. Sadly, in Haiti, if one disagrees with all of the existing political parties, he will gather a few friends, sometimes reactionaries, and form his political party. This practice is unacceptable and it must be stopped. Most of Haiti’s political parties are frankly what is known to be organization of peers and associates rather than political parties. We must set a clear difference between a political party and an organization of gangsters. A political party entails broad wisdom instead of the savoir-faire of a few narrow minded individuals whose sole purposes are trying to earn a living and winning a presidential election. When engaging in politics is no longer viewed as a way of earning a living, the number of Haiti’s political parties will be dramatically declined. What I’m suggesting here is that, when life becomes unbearable in Haiti, one forms a political party as a way of dealing with the hardship of life. This practice cannot be continued for it will ruin the country to the point of no return and we must therefore call for a complete political party reform in Haiti. An alternative could be a Three Grand National Political Party System. As I attempt to address the problem of Haiti’s political party system, I would suggest the following 3 parties as an alternative to the current brouhaha: 1- LAVALAS 2- CONVERGENCE DEMOCRATIC 3- INDEPENDENT (including the group of 184) As the principle political actors of Haiti, both LAVALAS and the CONVERGENCE DEMOCRATIC have proven to be well known, competitive and dominant. What is left to do is naming an Independent party. I would further argue that the group of 184 is perfectly fit to become the Independent party of Haiti. With these changes in place, Haitian ""leaders"" would be forced to depersonalize the political parties and work together by putting forth concrete ideas to better their respective parties. It would be excited to see Haitian ""leaders"" competing with each others in primaries within their own parties, wouldn’t it? At one point, when the Convergence Democratic emerged, I have sensed a change in the direction of the political party system in Haiti; but the vision of this group was far from what I propose above for the idea behind it was not for the love of Haiti but the hatred of Aristide. Anyone who followed Haitian’s politics of the past decade would concur that these 3 political entities combined would easily claim about 85% of the Haitian electorates, thus any other parties would be seen as a lesser figure in Haitian politics. Is such a proposition realistic in Haiti? Some of us would be apt to argue that Haitians are not capable of working together for they are not trustworthy when it comes to defending the interest of Haiti. Nevertheless, I believe that we can go beyond our misgivings of each others and work together in the interest of Haiti. Should it be exactly my proposition? Absolutely not, but we must agree that Haiti’s political party system is in a dire need for reform. Political party reform is a necessary endeavor that sooner or later must take place in Haiti seeing that the consequences of it not taking place are greater than we could imagine. The road to a political party reform in Haiti is not at all trouble-free; however, we cannot afford standing, hoping for a miracle from outsiders, while the country is draining away. Haiti is loudly crying for help and it will take courage, discipline, leadership, responsibility and sacrifices to meet its needs. As citizens of this lost paradise, it is our civic duty to put aside our political differences, come forward and launch a crusade behind political party reform in Haiti. We must fearlessly and vehemently come together and demand that our political party system be reformed, and to do the contrary, is simply saying ""hell"" to the spirits of our ancestors."
18,"Bahama Mama, Oops! Obama Mama",politics," Handsome, young, smart and full of charisma, Obama Mama!  Barack Obama is history in the making, so believes everyone.  To his credit, Senator Obama has thus far defied the impossible and continues to do so.  He is so successful on the campaign trail that I started to question the reality behind his success.  The mere idea of White Southerners cheering for an African American candidate to the presidency troubles me and I’m beginning to wonder and question the sincerity of his followers, especially the so-called White independents and Republican voters who support him in the primaries.  Granted, this is year 2008 not 1908, but are we to believe that white America is ready for such a bold and challenging change? This does not smell good at all based on the experience of my community in terms of race relations in America.  Looking at the rate of race relations in America, I would be very cautious to claim that America is ready for an African American president; such is the belief in my community.  I would rather argue that it is a set up; one that would pain America for decades to come.  It is kind of giving Obama the benefit of the doubt, but at the end of the day, America would go back to its ordinary way of doing business. On the contrary, could it also be argued that the overwhelming support of Obama over Clinton by African Americans is in itself another form of racism?  I believe that the answer is open for debate, however, I do believe that African Americans do choose race over issues in these primaries.  The thinking in the African American community is that the Clintons would understand since Obama is the very first African American, whom they have led to believe, with a good chance of becoming the first African American president; after all, Bill Clinton was dubbed the first Black president.  But I see it as a rhetorical mistake on the part of African American.  Like we say back home in Haiti, ""pa j’anm jeté kiyè izé pou kiyè nèf"", don’t ever throw out your old spoons for new ones. I predict a wave of political revolts should it be proven that Obama was racially set up to facilitate a Republican win in November.  Nobody has truly explained the machine behind Obama’s winning spree except to say that he is eloquent, speaks well and that he is bringing change to America, whatever this notion of change means.  We have yet to see any real substance that would back up his winning spree and yet he is winning over the most powerful woman in America.  Isn’t it too good to be true?  How long ago was the so-called Jena 6?  Who are we kidding here?  Has America really changed to the point of electing an African American to the Presidency?  Or are we witnessing history unfolding before our eyes? Could it be that Dr. King’s dream has finally materialized?  To anyone who thinks that this country has reached the point of ""one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal"", I would kindly ask you to put down the Bahama Mama.  This is not the case.  Perhaps it could be that Senator Obama is being used to make a statement; a statement that would imply that America is ready to move forward in light of its miserable race relations and let bygone be bygone. Remember, race relations is an ongoing and scary issue here in America.  Nobody wants to address the issue of race for fear of being labeled racist and so everyone addresses the issue with a smile, e.g. brush it off quickly.  Why should I believe that America is ready for Obama when nooses are being hung in High Schools, Universities and behind pick up trucks as late as last year all across the nation?  I am a Black man, not to be confused with a Blind man."
19,It's Broke Let's Fix It,politics," In my advanced years I tend to desire contribution to my society.  The best way for me to contribute is to elevate social consciousness by opening a dialog on the subjects that most disturb me.  In this treatise, I am not going to analyze social behavior, except where it impedes our development.  I'm not going to criticize affiliations except where they obviously deteriorate our country.  I am going to outline the subjects that we as citizens must address because our government is broken and needs fixing. Understand clearly that I LOVE MY COUNTRY, and it's people, but even the most delusional among us can't deny that the Political Elite have abandoned the people.
First, the most broken part is Congress.  Sure the Presidency is important, but Congress is a sewer.  We need to remove those who are entrenched, both Democrat and Republican, in the primary process.  What about experience you ask?  You mean the experience of making back room deals, and catering to special interests and lobbying.  Our Congress was supposed to be a balance of power.  An honest steward of our resources.  As a Congressional leader, if you couldn't convince your fellow congressmen, in sufficient number, that what you proposed was valid, you didn't get the votes.  We even took it one step further by separating Congress into two bodies as an extra protection.  Now, look at what it has become.  Earmarks-Pork Barrel-Bribery, whatever you want to call it, has perverted the process.  Lobbyists, those who represent special interests, and buy the favor of Congress, through political contribution, payoffs, and manipulation keep essential progress from happening by protecting their special interests at our expense.  Why do you think we are in such trouble over energy?  Because we use too much?  Because we are not ingenious enough to craft a solution? Don't be stupid.  We are in trouble over energy because Congress has sold out to Oil interests.  Fifty years ago, we should have issued huge grants to develop clean alternative energy.
The problems in the Middle East are financed by petrol-dollars.  Your money pays for your problems.  Then on top of that we hire a president who made his fortune in Oil. A pursuit he failed at until the Saudis underwrote his enterprises. Good Pick!  One that has seriously tarnished the Republican Party.  If we had been willing to use our own abundant resources, we would have been free of this Middle Eastern highjacking, but our ecological concerns restrain us.  So how is it that we did not use our endless creativity to avoid our dependency on cultures that our diametrically opposed to our own.  Think about it, and the path will lead back to corruption in Congress.
Not only does your Congress spend your money irreverently, but they also steal it from you to begin with.  Congress feel obliged to Tax you, and they do so with a system that constantly changes giving favor to one group over another, but that isn't the half of it, let's really understand the total disregard for you the citizen.  You bust your backside to get ahead, part of the American Dream, and not only does Congress tax you, but they additionally rob from your estate after your death (Death Tax).  So, any chance that you might have had to help your family deal with an uncertain, ever more expensive future, has been stolen from you after your death. If you perish without a will your fortune is probated and exurbanite amounts are given to the government in the process.  Even if you die with a will, the taxation is based on the appraised value of your estate and not your equity in it.  In other words the Government can take it all.
If your Congressional leaders were honest Americans, these conditions would not exist.  There is no way; you the citizen can continue to ignore these offenses.  We must dismantle Congress and Fix it.  The Concept of Congress is sound, the members are not.  Now what can we do? Feeling helpless is how we the citizens buy into Victim status, which only leads to the destruction of your civilization.  You can insist that your political parties present candidates who will address these issues, and take the old corrupt members out by primary selection.  There, that's a plan.  If you can suggest a better one, I'm all ears.
There is plenty of room in America for social disagreement and debate, but these essential economic issues are universal and beyond party affiliation.  They are American survival principles, a true fairness doctrine and not the contrived diversions of a Congress that seeks to keep you ignorant and uninvolved.  Be an American hero and make a difference - get involved in the cleanup process, before you wake up without a voice in your future.  If we the citizens can open a dialog between us that focuses on our shared burdens and not our differences we can make a difference.  Please join with me and speak out for Truth, Justice, and the American Way, before we become a third rate country
When you think about it, you should be off the chart angry.  How dare they think that sending you a few hundred bucks is going to fix the stupidity that the Wall Street Elite have thrown you into.  It should drive you up a wall that Congress can spend millions of your dollars holding mock trials on steroid use and obesity legislation instead of solving the problems of government waste and irrelevant social programs.  If you examined the give away programs provided to aliens for education, housing, and transportation, when citizens don't qualify for these grants, you would be astounded.
When you examine the activities of Congress, look for the hook.  The members are bought and paid for, so their actions are special interests driven.  Look for a benefit to the trial lawyers.  Look for the benefit to the drug industry.  Look for the benefit to the industrial military complex.
Despite our philosophical differences, we must unite to make our government responsive to the PEOPLE and not their special interest contributors.  Write your political party and demand new untarnished candidates for Congress.  Ask them to draw from the Middle Class and not the Economically Elite.  Don't be a follower be a leader.  MAKE YOUR VOICE BE HEARD. Help save America instead of complaining about it.  It's easy to find critics; it's hard to find contributors and problem solvers.
Thank you for considering."
20,Can Sustainable Development Be Clean AND cheap? A Promising 'Carbon Credits' Case Study,politics," Must the costs of clean development necessarily be prohibitive for developing nations? Let's take a closer look at exactly how this is called into question. There is a common belief that the most efficient way to rein in greenhouse gas emissions is to implement a two-tiered regime in which developed nations will shoulder a much greater burden.  The justification for this belief is that because it is wealthier, the necessary foregoing of present consumption will be much less as a proportion of national income.  The hardship endured will therefore be substantially less. There are a number of arguments as to why the nominal costs of developing green infrastructure and power generation should be greater or lesser in developing countries.  Those who suggest the costs are greater point to the need to import (often expensive) hardware and foreign technical expertise.  Those who argue that it can in fact be less costly point to lower labor costs in developing countries and, sometimes, cheaper domestic inputs.  The true answer of course is case- and industry-specific.  For simplicity, let's assume that the costs are broadly the same at the aggregate level. But what if the costs of ""green investment"" in developing countries could be defrayed or even offset entirely, and this without increasing tax strains or calling for foreign donors to foot the bill?  Innovating intermediaries such as UK-based EcoSecurities have been so bold as to make this seemingly improbable end a reality.  The concept is delightfully simple; as allowed for under the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), developing nations which reduce their greenhouse gas emissions are entitled to carbon credits which can in turn be sold on an open market.  These credits are readily purchased by developed-world producers that need them to be in compliance with emissions caps.  And the developing-nation party has found an essentially zero-cost avenue to sustainability. For a better understanding of the mechanism and the championing role played by the intermediary, let's take a look at an EcoSecurities case study.  The process begins with an assessment of a company's assets to determine the emission reduction that can be achieved.  In the project development phase, the necessary ""green investment"" is implemented with zero capital investment by the contracting company.  Finally, EcoSecurities guarantees that it will purchase the carbon credits generated after implementation.  The Celulose Irani biomass-to-electricity project in Brazil is an exemplary case.  With the help of EcoSecurities, this paper producer was able to find a clean and renewable source of energy by utilizing the biomass that is a by-product of its production process.  EcoSecurities provided financing for the project, and lent its technical know-how of biomass energy production to Irani through the implementation of the project.  After completion, EcoSecurities purchased Irani's new carbon credits for resale.  Without this involvement, Irani's expanding production would have continued to apply pressure to the traditional fossil fuel-derived grid. There are currently more than 900 registered CDM projects underway around the world, about 60% of which are to be found in Asia and the Pacific.  The viability of these projects is, of course, dependent upon the continuing ability to sell the acquired carbon credits.  This means that the project would become unsustainable if the market for those credits were ever to dry up (for example if developed nations, pursuing their own green projects, no longer needed to purchase carbon credits to comply with emissions caps). In a world where the United States alone accounts for a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions, provided that some permutation of the two-tiered international agreement can be reached, this seems rather a distant scenario.

1,The Humiliation Of A Proud Country,politics," The Ukraine is a country in trouble. It is a country of huge natural and human resources that seems lost. Whilst the politicians argue and fight the country seems as a boat in a storm without a captain. Can this great country find a way forward? I should first confess to having no qualification, or authority of world affairs and even less of former FSU countries, but as an outsider I see a country with enormous potential and much to contribute, struggling, or worse, seemingly rudderless, in the storm of world economics and world affairs. Why? As a European, The Ukraine first came to my attention through its beautiful women, I do not apologise, I was single and with an internet connection it did not take long to discover this, but slowly I came to both admire and love the country. Something is wrong! There seems to be a complete lack of progress. It does not take very long to realise that this was once an important country, the magnificent Architecture in the centre of the bigger cities bears testimony to this fact. The centre of the capital Kyiv is stunningly beautiful and this beauty is reflected throughout the country. As I say, my only qualification in writing this article is that I am not Ukrainian and through the eyes of a European the situation in this country seems to be frustratingly hopeless. Some four years ago there was a peaceful revolution. It was the orange revolution, but it did not work, through egotism, or fundamental disagreements is not clear. It is difficult to see any effective leadership, or sense of direction from the current government or any previous government since then.  A long time. This is a country with huge potential; many highly educated young people, a country of high moral values, rich in culture and history. Did you know that the world famous Cossack dance is from The Ukraine and not Russia? Russia clearly invested heavily in The Ukraine during the days of the empire and left behind them a good basic infrastructure and many fine examples of Soviet Architecture, unfortunately it is some 16 years since the collapse of that system and so much of this investment has been neglected, that now the task of renewal, or upkeep is huge The country is being run, is functioning from the bottom up. It is the functionaries, the beauracrats  that are keeping this country going, albeit on a very basic level, but without this we are talking complete chaos, complete social breakdown. Contributing to the problems seems to be that during the 70+ years that this country shared as part of the Soviet Empire there was much integration of Russian people into The Ukraine. The south of The Ukraine in particular became very popular with the people of Russia and became a very popular summer holiday destination. So now there is a dual language population. This need not be any problem at all (the languages are very similar), but seems to have become so. As an outsider it is very difficult to grasp, or understand, but since the ""Orange revolution"" there seem to have been a very small group of politicians competing for power. Some are pro Russia and some pro the west, but for the day to day life of the people of this country it does not seem to have made much difference. Nothing changes, very little improves and the impression, is of a political elite so busy with self survival, or inter rivalry that the country is being largely neglected A small example, there is a bridge halfway down the country that spans the Dnieper river a huge river that runs from Russia and spills into The Black Sea. This bridge has been closed for 1 year!  Almost certainly this bridge was erected during the FSU, but now it has fallen into disrepair. This is a very important bridge, running through the centre of this country and the detour is 100,s of kilometres. It is difficult to understand the priority of the leadership that something so fundamental does not seem to be of great importance. What is high on the list of any military stategy in crippling and overcoming the economy and communication of a country? What will they first attack and seek to destroy? These guys do it to themselves? Frustratingly through the eyes of an outsider it is difficult to see why things are so bad? Two language country? No problem. Part of the population for Russia and part for Europe, or the West? Why should this be such a huge problem? Is not democracy a freedom of choice? A respect of differences? To the president of this country Victor Yushchenko and the current Prime Minister Julia Tymoshenko, I say look at your country, look at your people, they are suffering and why? You have so much potential, you can and should be an important country, of huge intellectual, cultural and artistic influence. Why is this country in such a dismal situation?"
2,Barack Obama a Candidate for Christians,politics," First let me begin this article by stating that I understand the sentiment to have an African-American president. Although you couldn't tell it from my photo my grandfather William Johnson was an African American, he married a white woman in the 1940's and has my utmost respect for making that decision amidst the pressure he must have faced. I would like nothing more than to see the United States of America led by an African American president, it would be a symbol of truly healing the national wound we have had in this country since the days of slavery. I cannot cast my vote for Mr. Barack Obama in '08 in good conscience. Mr. Obama Consistently votes in support of even the most brutal practices of our greatest national sin today... abortion. This is altogether surprising to me considering how abortion effects the African American population. Let me give you some very surprising and even more appalling statistics. Even though African Americans make up roughly 12% of the American population yet 33% of all abortions are performed on African-American women. Hispanics make up 1% of the American population yet an astounding 15.1% of abortions are performed on Hispanic women. This means that 48.1% of all abortions are performed on 13% of the population, some might call this a coincidence, I call that planned eradication of minorities. Planned Parenthood, the leading provider of abortion services in our nation specifically targets urban areas with a higher percentage of African Americans and Hispanic-Americans. This may seem a bit conspiracy theorist, but the following quotes from Planned Parenthood's founder Margaret Sanger reveal what their true purpose was to be. On blacks, immigrants and indigents: ""...human weeds,' 'reckless breeders,' 'spawning... human beings who never should have been born."" Margaret Sanger, Pivot of Civilization, referring to immigrants and poor people On the purpose of birth control: The purpose in promoting birth control was ""to create a race of thoroughbreds,"" she wrote in the Birth Control Review, Nov. 1921 (p. 2) On the extermination of blacks: ""We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population,"" she said, ""if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members."" Woman's Body, Woman's Right: A Social History of Birth Control in America, by Linda Gordon Someone might argue that the viewpoints of Planned Parenthood have changed over the years, but their actions say their views remain steadfast and unchanged. What does all of this have to do with Mr. Barack Obama as a presidential candidate? Plenty if you look at his voting record. Voted against banning partial birth abortion. (Oct 2007) Voted NO on notifying parents of minors who get out-of-state abortions. (Jul 2006) Voted YES on $100M to reduce teen pregnancy by education & contraceptives. (Mar 2005) Mr. Obama plainly supports abortion, even though it is the leading cause of death among African-Americans more the heart disease more than Aids, more than violent crime. Abortion is a targeted measure to wipe out minorities in America. His stance on abortion alone should be enough discourage any christian from voting for him but let's look at his voting record concerning the marriage amendment, which would define and protect marriage as a union between one man and one woman. Vote 163: On the Cloture Motion: A Senate cloture vote on the gay marriage amendment failed, effectively killing the amendment. Voted NO Mr. Obama supports the union of same sex marriages, while Christians shouldn't persecute people based on their sexual orientation, homosexuality is a sin, and endorsing gay and lesbian marriages would bring the judgment of that sin from the partakers of that sin to a national level. God deals with and judges nations today just as he has in the past. If we want the blessing of God to pour out into our nation today as it has in times past we need to protect our nation from committing national sin. If you look at violent crimes , pregnancy in 12-14 year olds, illiteracy levels, un-employment and many other factors since 1963 when we first began taking God out of our society they have all increased astronomically, the only way to reverse these trends is to continue making progress in our government in acknowledging our creator. When we eschew evil and turn back to God our nation will return to the prosperity our fore-fathers saw. Continuing with the theme of restoring our christian identity to our nation, we need judges that will be strict constructionists or adhere to the constitution as it is written without putting their own interpretation on it. Mr. Obama supports the ""Living Document"" judges, the ones that change their interpretation of the constitution based on their personal beliefs instead of what the founding fathers intended to be enforced. His voting record clearly brings out where he stands in regard to judges. President Bush has appointed 2 judges to the supreme court, both of which are strict constructionists, both of whom Mr. Obama has voted against. 1/31/06 Vote 2: On the Nomination: Confirmation of Samuel A. Alito, Jr. to be an Associate Supreme Court Justice. Voted NO 9/29/05 Vote 245: On the Nomination: Confirmation of John G. Roberts, Jr., to be Chief Justice of the United States. Voted NO In short Mr. Obama stands against every biblical guideline we have for voting, as much as I would love to cast my vote for an African-American president, I have to wait until a candidate comes along that truly represents my core belief system, and the betterment of the African-American community."
3,"Sustainable Development on the Stump: Environmental Policies of Obama, Clinton, and McCain",politics," How will U.S. environmental and energy policies look in 2009? With the primaries winding down, we're starting to get a better idea. Senator Barack Obama fancies himself on this issue, as on most, a man of vision. Senator Clinton calls above all for accountability. The presumed nominee of the Republican Party, Senator John McCain, has very noble beliefs. Because recent polling shows that environmental issues like global warming aren't at the top of voter priorities, it is doubly important to press candidates about clarifying their positions. So, what are candidates saying now about environmental and energy policies? Obama's rabble rousing oratory capacities have awed and inspired many; however if you watch a clip of him on the stump it is easy enough to see how he is guilty of espousing what one journal describes as a ""vague uplift"".  While hardly a death blow, this claim is at present especially damaging for its implicit contrast to the ""crisp detail"" famously proffered, and willingly delivered on cue, by the Clinton machine. Not so in the policy literature.  Hillary's showing is respectable, to be sure; however it is Obama's campaign webpage that wins my top marks for clear, effective and economical presentation of his intended approach.  In the field of carbon emissions, he aims to impose a market-based cap-and-trade system with the ultimate goal of reducing emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels by mid-century.  He would utilize some of the revenues generated in carbon-credit auctions to ease the burden of those negatively impacted by the enormous economic transition. Obama believes in a massive investment in clean energy initiatives.  As president he would ""invest $150 billion over 10 years to advance the next generation of biofuels and fuel infrastructure"", with the specific goal of ensuring that newly developed technologies are commercialized and brought to market in the United States and beyond.  He would pursue an ambitious campaign to double funding for energy research and development.  He would invest to ensure labor supply in a ""clean technologies workforce"" and to bring clean technologies to manufacturing centers such as Detroit.  Obama would actively pursue the development of coal technologies cleaner than those which are presently in use.  His hope to move toward oil independence is founded on the improvement of fuel efficiency standards.  To do this he would provide guarantees to auto manufacturers that experiment with new engines and lightweight materials.  This would be parcel to a broader national campaign of efficiency improvement; other incentives would include grants for local governments that implement building codes more favorable to energy efficiency. The final pillar of his environmental policy is the restoration of American leadership on climate change.  He would create a new Global Energy Forum to facilitate communication amongst the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases, and would further pursue coordination within the framework of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. Senator Clinton's proposals are remarkably similar to Obama's on a number of levels.  She too favors a cap-and-trade system which would see 100% of permits auctioned; she too hopes to invest $150 billion over ten years in ""new energy"" (some of the bills to be footed by corporations); and she too hopes to double federal investment in energy research.  She has established timetables of national goals for energy reduction and use of clean energy similar to those of Obama.  And finally, she too favors efforts to increase automobile fuel efficiency, specifically through the provision of $20 billion in ""Green Vehicle Bonds"" to American automakers.  It would be interesting to see a chronological side-by-side of their respective policy evolutions. In her traditional mass appeal to America's middle and lower-middle classes, there is finally something of a differentiation, if it is more one of form than function.  In addition to supporting ""green collar"" jobs, she would seek to modernize 20 million existing low income homes to improve energy efficiency.  She would initiate a ""Connie Mae"" program to ease the acquisition of green homes by low and middle-income Americans.  And finally she would require all new federal buildings to comply with zero-emissions specifications. There is one commendable initiative unique to Clinton.  She would oblige publicly-traded companies to include estimations of financial risk posed by climate change in annual reports submitted to the federal Securities and Exchange Commission.  However such a policy might be of limited effectiveness if companies included the estimations only to appease the requirement without genuine regard for its implication. To end the investigation, it is John McCain who receives poor marks, not for benevolence of intentions but for clarity of vision.  In five short and murky paragraphs, it is he who commits the sin of ""vague uplift"", failing to elicit a single clear policy initiative through verbose allusions to the forces of a cap-and-trade regime.  In the spirit of Teddy Roosevelt he believes in preserving America's natural majesty.  His belief that ""America's economic and environmental interests are not mutually exclusive, but rather inextricably linked"" is all fine and well.  But I would hope to see a more clear-eyed expression of his means to this end.  In a video clip tagged to the page, the Senator expresses his belief that the United States should join the Kyoto Protocol if China and India could be brought onboard.  This suggests another debate which I evoked in last week's column concerning the respective sacrifices of developed and developing nations in the battle to cut greenhouse emissions.  Finally, citing the instability of many oil-producing states, McCain too advocates energy independence for the United States.  America has been a net importer of oil for decades; true independence is only achievable through the intensive use of renewables and a great push to improve conventional fuel efficiency. I hazard to presume that more specific policy proposals will become readily available from the McCain campaign as November approaches. Copyright (c) 2008 Daniel Lafleche"
4,Barack Obama - How To Connect On The Internet,politics," Barack Obama - How to Connect on The Internet by Scott Porter, Managing Partner MarketBuilders Barack Obama has redefined the landscape of American politics. The impact of Obama's current campaign for the U.S. Presidency cannot be overstated and may be one of the true 'defining' moments in American political history. Currently leading in the race for delegates, a significant number of Americans are now convinced Barack Obama is the best choice to be the next President of the United States. So, how has a junior Senator from Illinois achieved such an incredible ground swell of support during the past year? The short answer is Barack Obama has deployed a formidable political campaign, anchored by his remarkable ability to connect with people from all backgrounds - and from all parts of the country. No doubt, Senator Obama is a skilled communicator and has proven himself to be one of the great speakers of our time - first demonstrating his ability to connect with a national audience at the 2004 National Democratic Convention where he made an impression that still lingers. What else sets Obama's campaign apart? I don't want to underestimate Obama's ability to impact potential voters with his speaking ability, but he's only one guy! He can only be in one place at a time as far as I know. Ah, but we have the tube you say, and Obama's television ads have obviously been effective. But, we have to consider the fact the tube costs money, big money - and Obama's got it and getting more every day. This is the interesting part of the story. Sure, Barack Obama has received sizeable donations from wealthy supporters, Corporations and Special Interests, but not as much as the Clinton Machine has raised in this way. Barack Obama made US political history in January by raising a staggering $32 million in contributions, the largest amount ever reported in such a short time. Barack and his team beat the Clinton Machine like a drum - with Hillary raising only about $13.5M. What's going on? Where are the contributions coming from? In short, the Barack Obama team has the best Internet Marketing strategy ever deployed by a political candidate - with deference to Ron Paul's amazing Internet success. Actually, there are many similarities between the two candidates' strategies - both make (or made) excellent use of Social Media Marketing, submitting new posts daily on the major social media sites like Digg, Technorati, YouTube, MySpace, Facebook, Flickr, etc., and both make excellent use of their blogs to communicate their message, to attract more supporters, and most importantly, to raise a significant amount of campaign contributions. Although starting slowly on the Internet, in the past six months, Barack Obama's team has been early and aggressive online, making use of YouTube, MySpace, and Google AdWords - to communicate his message of change and to counter campaign attacks, like one lunatic who actually suggested he is Muslim! Barack Obama's Website The Obama website is very well designed, visually appealing, and includes compelling topics that lure you in by making information readily available from a variety of links. Presentation is the key to grabbing viewers' attention on a website, but it's particularly important on a political candidate's website. The same kinds of information found on Barack Obama's website can be found on other candidate's sites, but it's presented in a way on the Obama site that makes it easy to find. While reviewing Obama's website, I noted subtle changes over time. Obama's website is not static, it's constantly changing, or rather evolving as his campaign rolls on. When I first reviewed Obama's website, well over a month ago, I found it to be nicely designed - and I had no problem finding the information I was looking for. Looking at the site now, it's even simpler to traverse and to find current information. The Obama team updates the website daily with news and links to articles, videos, and the latest Barack Obama appearances. The website makes it a snap to volunteer, to make calls in support of Senator Obama, to make contributions, and even to register to vote! Much like Ron Paul, Barack Obama has become very web savvy in a short period of time and it's paying off in dollars and Delegates. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Looking at the 'Barack Obama for President' website, the Obama team has applied some effective SEO tactics, but they probably could have done more to make the website even easier to traverse and to make it a little more Search Engine friendly. When the website first appears, the viewer sees a 'splash' page - an entry page with a video and a signup form to join the Barack Obama 'team' - basically to receive Email concerning the Obama campaign. Splash pages are fine, but they make the job of the SEO webmaster a little more difficult and I think a case can be made that 'splash' pages interfere with the usability of a website. In fact, I think 'splash' pages often hinder people from getting to what they really want - in this case, information about Barack Obama! Beyond the splash page, the website content is compelling and is well designed. Title tags are different for each page, but only the ending portion of each Title Tag. Unfortunately, the Meta descriptions are the same for each page across website, so the Search Engines generally choose their own description to display with the listing of each page. One positive is that most of the images on the website have descriptive Alt tag descriptions and the team also made good use of header tags (h1, h2,). Often cited as a disadvantage, the fact Barack Obama has a very unique name actually works to his advantage when searching for information about him on the Internet. A search for ""Barack"" or a search for ""Obama"" across all 4 major search engines has his Presidential campaign website ranked #1 for either name. Overall, the Obama team has done a very nice job with the foundation of the website. If the team made just a few modifications to their website, they might be even more amazed by the results they may achieve. Social Media Marketing Basically, MySpaceBasically, Barack Obama and his team have discovered Social Media, have become experts in a short period of time, and are actively using it to connect with supporters and potential voters from every part of the country. Barack Obama's early success in Iowa may have a lot to do with the Social Media network they've developed. On MySpace alone, Obama has over 350,000 friends, Facebook shows over 270,000, and YouTube shows over 24,000 in subscribers. The Obama site promotes its own group and event system with the my.barackobama.com section (you can set up your own group, blog, etc.) but I don't believe it connects with s like Eventful, Meetup or Upcoming. Barack's also integrated Flickr & Videos into his website as well. This adds a nice multimedia / social media touch to the site. I think they should also integrate YouTube a bit more into the main website (not just on the blog) and add better descriptions to their Flickr images. These changes could help them take advantage of the audiences they already have on the social sites as well. Sponsored Listings & PPC As far as we know, the only other candidate to have a sponsored listing or PPC strategy was Republican Fred Thompson. We found Barack Obama's campaign is purchasing advertising based on his name across GoogleAs Google, Yahoo & . From what we can tell, Barack Obama is making the best use of sponsored listings of all candidates we reviewed. Live To improve here, Barack's team could also consider purchasing advertisements based on ""Democrat Candidate for President"" or ""Presidential Candidate"". As it is, unless the searcher uses his name in their search they may not know that he's running for president. Of course, you'd also have to be living in a hut in Montana not to have heard of Barack Obama at this point, so scratch the last point. Blogging Barack has a blog that is very well integrated with his website. His campaign team are very active bloggers as posts are made continually throughout each day. Before I started this article they had just posted videos (uploaded to YouTube) concerning a new TV ad which will be running in Wisconsin. It was posted about an hour ago and it already has over 325 comments ... So people are watching and reading Obama's blog very actively. I must admit the ""Community Blog"" they have launched is a bit confusing. There's also no RSS button to subscribe to, just the campaign blog and the social media buttons to promote the blog at the bottom of the main blog page. You can RSS to the comments, but I searched everywhere for an RSS button for the campaign headquarters' blog and I couldn't find one. Summary Overall, the Barack Obama Presidential campaign and his Internet Marketing strategy are hitting on all cylinders. Yes, Obama's team could make a few modifications that may help, but with well over a million visitors to the Barack Obama for President Website last month, it's worth standing back and admiring for a moment. Nice job, Barack. The Obama team has proven that Internet Marketing is a formidable tool in major political campaigns and, along with candidates like Ron Paul, has changed the way political campaign strategies will be developed and orchestrated in the future. It seems to me the real Barack Obama story is about connecting with people. The Internet is just another way for Barack to connect with others - and he does it very well. The fact that Barack Obama's Internet Marketing strategy is a reflection of Obama himself is a testament to his design team as they have captured the simplicity and elegance of Obama himself. Well done - the results speak for themselves. There are at least a few Internet service firms who could learn a lot from taking a closer look at Barack Obama's Internet strategy. Like the candidate, it sure looks like a winner. Scott Porter, Managing Partner MarketBuilders"
5,Obama’s Education Opinion is the Right Stuff,politics," Springfield, PA – Dr. Stephen Jones says there is a national education crisis and Barack Obama has the right stuff to solve it.  Barack Obama used a recent speech in Virginia as an opportunity to state that testing alone is not the solution for improving K12 student performance. The countries financial investments should support better K12 teaching not testing.  In his opinion we are attacking the education system which we should be trying to bolster.  Obama said too much time is spent preparing students for No Child Left Behind testing.  The results of these failed policies are putting a strangle hold on education.  Student’s minds are no longer nourished by the knowledge that teachers impart.  How can a teacher focus on course content when their schools very existence hinges on testing scores? Obama says we need to make a greater investment in changing education. He also stated that teachers should be paid higher salaries.  The teaching profession has lost its glimmer because our country is not investing in K12 education.  Obama’s opinion in this area shows that he is looking at the future.  Within the next ten years a massive number of teachers will retire.  It will be difficult to replace them if teachers cannot make a living wage.  These potential teachers will go into other professions.  Teachers want to work in a country where they do not have to struggle due to financial obligations after college. Our country needs new leadership to effectively craft teacher and student friendly education policy.  Obama is striking the right cord with many educators who are in higher education.  He has taken his campaign to college campuses around the country.  He is demonstrating how much he values the opportunity to be educated.  Obama’s family could not afford to send him to the most expensive K12 schools but he still learned the value of education.  He wants to open the doors for many United States citizens who feel that the doors of higher education will never open for them. Obama is demonstrating the true qualities of a leader.  His history of serving as a volunteer in his community has put him in touch with the education gap that is like the Grand Canyon in many of our nation’s inner cities.  His thirst for change in the way that we educate our nation’s youth is a fresh breath of air.  Obama has an opinion that United States citizens are uniting around. The country needs to remain competitive in the global markets of the world.  Obama says that if our current lack of investment in education continues we will not compete with the rest of the world.  Based on a recent assessment the United States ranks twenty-ninth in math and science knowledge.  The country is losing its place as a world leader.  All of the other countries around the world are increasing their investment in education.  The United States continues to flounder at implementing strategic education policy.   The country needs a plan that positions our workers to be the most educated workforce in the world. Based on the response of voters around the country they are looking for a leader who will stand up and speak out on education.  Obama has the right stuff because he knows the boundaries that a limited education can cast on a child’s entire life.  When a young person desires to learn is extinguished in the forth grade they will never recover.  Obama has the attitude and motivation of a Presidential candidate that wants education to take its rightful place in our society. Dr Stephen Jones is a national education consultant who can be contacted at 610-842-3843."
6,Sustainable Development: What does it mean and who wants to tell you?,politics," Today's journals of trade and popular culture are all but awash in the buzzwords 'sustainable' and 'sustainability'. Here, we are obliged to raise the red flag and warn of lurking danger. These diverse and many advocates do a great disservice in more ways than they know. For in this great sea of 'sustainability', which spans business strategies and regimens of weight loss, one all too easily loses sight of the real battle. We know that over-use of a term can have an unintended blunting effect. But the word is so much in vogue, and its employment so overzealous, that it has in many instances become obscured entirely. So, you ask, what is sustainable development? Who are its proponents and antagonists? And, oh yes, why exactly is it to be so desired after all? Ours is an age in which we have come under the twin pressures of burgeoning population growth and an accompanying intensification of economic development. This development is necessary for the provision of the surging population's needs and wants. Though rates of population growth show signs of slowing, the number of earth's inhabitants will continue to expand massively in the foreseeable future. With the added variable of impending climate change, there is a sudden and new awareness of the potentially destructive nature of the human project. These realities have given immense weight to calls for an oversight which explicitly takes account of the fate of future generations. Many nuanced definitions have been devised, but the most commonly evoked is that sustainable development ""meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."" General consensus holds that the sustainability project spans three interactive domains; these are (1) environmental sustainability, (2) economic sustainability, and (3) social-political sustainability. Environmental sustainability is concerned with the preservation of resources and our earth's natural environment. In the strictest sense, any process which allows natural capital (the net sum of all natural resources and other bounties of the earth) to be depleted faster than it can be replenished threatens its ability to function and to serve us properly and indefinitely. Advocates of environmental protection actively seek solutions which will minimize the present and future burden to our natural environment of industrial and other pursuits. The best solutions are those which find ways to incorporate renewable methods of resource exploitation. The notion of environmental sustainability is thus inextricably bound to the premise of economic sustainability. Rapid advances in new technologies and production techniques are constantly altering and expanding the boundary of production possibilities. But ultimately, economics is the science of the allocation of a finite resource pool. Promotion of economic sustainability thus seeks to allow for future generations to reach their own optimal allocations free from constraints imposed by our own patterns of exploitation in the here and now. The sphere of social-political sustainability is interesting in that it expands beyond the simple necessity of economic growth and its effect on the natural environment to more directly include the human element in the equation. Social-political sustainability promotes social harmony and continuity of healthy political institutions so that a mechanism is in place for the enactment of the collective will (presumably a will which is favorable to sustainability). The project of sustainable development has inevitably encountered resistance. Some are eager to point out that any economic pursuit which entails resource depletion is by that very fact unsustainable. But to make this charge is to reduce the debate to semantics; to contend that the impossibility of an absolute application invalidates the endeavor wholesale is to court the ridiculous. Another more prominent criticism is slightly more troublesome to counter. Available evidence seems to confirm the wisdom that as nations emerge from poverty and amass wealth they are more willing to dedicate a portion of their incomes to combat pollution and other unpleasantries. The wealthy industrialized nations of the world at one time advanced through dirtier stages analogous to the present progress of developing economies. However at that time there were no monitors or whistle-blowers. This school of critics cries hypocrisy. They uphold ""dirty"" mediums of economic growth that wealthier nations can now afford to bypass as the only hope to elevate massive populations from abject misery. In so doing, they seek to force arbiters of sustainable development into the unenviable position of choosing between the welfare of the earth's poor and that of the earth itself. In the face of these criticisms, proponents of sustainable development strive for the national and international coordination of environmental, economic and sometimes social policies in the advancement of responsible progress. They are mindful that the world more than ever is a system of actors, none of whose actions bear no consequence for others. Their goal is the day-to-day management of policy decisions such that humanity might enjoy the bounty of our natural environment without exhausting it, and without selfishly revoking the privilege of coming generations to do the same. Without sounding the bells of certain alarmists, sustainability of this color is to be venerated and upheld. Dilution of the term's strength by those who would seek to hijack its nobility is, on the other hand, to be regretted and indeed resisted. Copyright (c) 2008 Daniel Lafleche"
7,When Can the USA be Fossil Fuels Independent?,politics," We know the technologies that could lead the USA to fossil fuels independence. These technologies are (1)wind, (2)bio energy, (3)geothermal, and (4)solar energies. We collectively need the resolve to adopt and execute a roadmap to use these technologies and install renewable energy electrical generation plants. This resolve has to start with our politicians to adopt and fund a bold plan to free ourselves of fossil fuels. If left unchecked heat trapping emission such as carbon dioxide, CO2, are projected to cause dangerous global warming that threatens our health and environment. Increased energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy would provide a roadmap to reduce fossil fuel demand, thereby reducing CO2 emissions from the largest US source: Electrical Power Plants. Reducing and eventually eliminating fossil fuels for our electrical power generation would make America's energy supply more reliable and secure. The use of renewable energies could free our citizens from the chains of increasing oil and natural gas prices. The use of renewable fuels could actually put dollars back into the pockets of consumers. Just as importantly, we could reverse the pollution of our atmosphere and provide a brighter future for our heirs. Of the four renewable energy technologies, solar has the greatest potential to universally replace fossil fuels. The energy in sunlight striking the earth for 40 minutes is equivalent to global energy consumption for a year. The U.S. is endowed with a vast resource of at least 250,000 square miles of land in the Southwest alone that would be suitable for constructing solar power plants. That land receives more than 4,500 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu) of solar energy a year. Converting only 2.5 percent of that radiation into electricity would match the nation's total energy consumption in 2006.The Southwest is used as an example and one could also think of land holdings in the south to accomplish the same mission. There have been great strides in the past several years in the development of materials for solar energy photovoltaic cells and modules. The modules account for 65% of the cost of a solar installation. Current developments project that thin films made of cadmium telluride or copper indium gallium diselenide  (CIGN) will be the least expensive materials for solar modules. To provide electricity at six cents per killo-Watt-hour (kWh) , thin film modules would have to convert electricity with 14 percent efficiency, and system would have to be installed at $1.20 per watt of capacity. On January 28, 2008 Global Solar Energy Inc. (CSE) claims to have achieved 10 percent efficiency for copper indium gallium diselenide on a flexible, lightweight substrate over several production runs. The company is demonstrating its confidence in this development by expanding its production with a new plant in Tucson in addition to a new plant in Berlin which is slated for production in mid-2008. Scientists express confidence that continued developments in the next several years will achieve the 14% conversion efficiency. Cadmium telluride cells at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are now up to 16.5% and rising. Today, the lowest thin-film module price is at $3.66 per watt from a European retailer. With the rapid development and increasing installed manufacturing capacity one can readily project the $1.20 per watt capacity with 14 % efficiency by 2015. These milestones would yield six cents per kWh. As comparison commercial electricity generated by fossil fuels today is nine cents, and rising, per kWh . We can realize major savings to the consumer and reduction in environmental pollution with the projected solar energy plants. There are other major intra structure projects to complete in order to utilize the solar farm. The generated energy would have to be stored to provide electricity 24 hours a day. Molten salt storage could store the solar energy and generate steam to drive a turbine for the hours of non sun generation. The first plant using this technology is being built is Spain. To transmit the power for the solar farm we would need to build new high-voltage direct current transmission to replace our AC current grid. This will be necessary for any future grid to provide a more reliable, robust transmission of power. This replacement will have to be done in the future or we will be subject to shortage of power like California. has experienced. The good news is that DC grids are cheaper to build. To build the solar farm the federal government would have to invest more than $400 billion over the next 40 years to complete the installation. It is a substantial investment but our return on investment is greater. The plan would save billions of dollars in fuels each year. Six hundred coal and natural gas power plants could be replace eliminating the pollution that they produce. The solar farm described above can technically be built. It will require a lot of money and strong leadership to start and complete. At the project completion we would have cheaper electricity and reduce our pollution for future generation. When it is possible please write or speak to your political representative to campaign solar energy electrical generation for a brighter tomorrow."
8,"Less on the Beets, Please, and More on the Budget",politics," Thanks to some fearless investigative journalism by the Associated Press, voters can now ponder revealing new facts on what the presidential candidates hate to eat. We guess that's handy if you're expecting them to drop by for dinner. Don't serve liver if it's Rudy; lose the beets if it's Barack. Meanwhile, info on what our budding presidents would do about the country's massive budget problems doesn't seem to be on the menu. Most of the press lets candidates slip by with the usual lip service to ""balancing the budget. The Republicans say they'll do it with spending cuts -- but don't worry, it won't affect anything you care about. The Democrats say they'll raise taxes on the very rich, but they have quite a few plans to spend more as well. So far, there's almost no serious discussion of the country's long-term budget problems -- problems much too big to be nipped and tucked way.  Knowing how the candidates will handle the country's finances and whether they're going to saddle the next generation with colossal debt is a lot more important than knowing what they don't like to eat, but it looks like voters will have to fend for themselves on this one. It won't be easy. Even voters who follow the issue carefully may feel like they're trapped inside an echo chamber of contending facts. ""Federal Deficit Falls,"" one headline reads. ""Budget Surplus Projected for 2012."" That's true as far as it goes, but skip to another story, and you'll see ""Federal Debt at $9 Trillion and Counting."" For most Americans, $9 trillion is a completely unfathomable number, but this can't possibly be good. No one expects voters to be budget wonks, but there are some essentials we all need to absorb. This budget problem is real, and it's really, really big. Here's one way to get a handle on how big the federal debt is. The annual interest we pay on that $9 trillion costs us more than the war in Iraq. Mindboggling, isn't it? And while getting out of Iraq could save massive amounts of money -- not to mention irreplaceable human lives -- it won't solve our budget problems. As of June 2007, we've spent more than $600 billion on Iraq, Afghanistan and the rest of the ""war on terror.""  In the same time period, we added over $2 trillion to the country's debt. So it's not just Iraq  -- not by a long shot. Somebody say surplus? Don't count on it. Yes, it's true that projections from the Congressional Budget Office show a surplus by 2012. But that's only if Congress lets every single one of the Bush tax cuts expire. Not even the Democrats are pushing that. And remember, even those Democrats who want to raise taxes on wealthy Americans generally have other plans for the money, namely expanding health care coverage. Counting on that surplus is burying our heads in the sand. Falling deficit? Don't uncork the champagne yet. Yes, it's better than having the deficit go up, but this is no time to relax about Washington's penchant for red ink. The country has spent more on programs than it has collected in taxes for 31 out of the last 35 years. Going into debt is the easy way out in Washington, and they've been doing it for years. Balancing the budget is not enough. The country's long-term financial problems are much worse than the year-to-year budget shows. Going cold turkey on deficit spending is certainly a good thing, but it isn't enough to put the country back on a stable financial path. Unless we reform Social Security and Medicare -- unless we raise revenues or trim benefits or cut health care costs or do some combination of all three -- the huge debt the country has accumulated over the years will skyrocket. The heart-stopping little factoid circulating in D.C. policy circles? Just a few decades out, if nothing changes, the country will need nearly every tax dollar it collects to pay for Social Security, Medicare and interest on the debt. Back in the day, Ross Perot pulled out the pie charts and put the country's budget problems front and center in his campaign. It doesn't look like that's going to happen this time around. This time around, we're just going to have to do that for ourselves.

9,Abortion:  Legalized Child Sacrifice On The Altar Of Humanism,politics," How ironic is it that millions of babies are murdered every year in the name of human rights?  How is it that we, Americans especially, proudly call ourselves sophisticated and cultured while continuing to worship in the temple of humanism? Humanism is a god -- little ""g"".  It is lustful and insatiable.  Humanism is deceptive in its premise and destructive in its course.  Humanism is powerful enough to convince you that life is not life, death is not death, and that education and culture make you impervious to both of them.  Humanism is a spirit that demands the daily and unrepentant slaughter of innocent lives while simultaneously singing ""Kumbaya"" and seeking world peace. If you are pro-choice, you should be crystal clear about one thing, abortion is murder.  And, pre-meditated at that.  Period.  Individuals have spent their respective lifetimes in prison over less.  The only difference between you and someone on death row is one thing, the law.  I dare you to try and explain pro-choice to a convicted murderer.  They will most likely find your argument laughable.  I'm sure many of them would love to know how to write a law to justify their unjustifiable behavior.  You don't want criminals living among you, but you want to engage in criminal behavior.  Not criminal, you say?  Oh, legal.  Forgive me.  Legalized child sacrifice rather than criminal child sacrifice.  Like I said, the only difference is that you've got the law on your side. At the heart of the lie that ""abortion is okay because it's legal"" are two very simple concepts: It's not a baby. It's my body. Let's clear that up, shall we? In order for something, anything, to be born, it must be alive to begin with.  Life does not evolve from death.  Life is a force unto itself that has the power to create and sustain.  Death on the other hand, well, you get the picture.  The ovum and the sperm are alive inside the contributing parties which means that any resulting offspring is not dead at its genesis, but very much alive.  Possibly even more alive than you are, but at no point, less alive than you.  Unlike a Chia Pet which has to be seeded and watered to grow, human development in utero is precipitated and facilitated by the force of life.  Therefore, life has to always be present in that process, which is exactly the reason women get abortions, to interrupt life.  There's a name for that choice, it's called murder.  ""It's not a baby""...case closed. As for the body bit, it's not your body and it never will be.  The spirit of humanism  - worship of all things human including self - dictates such a belief.  However, just for the sake of argument, stop reading this for a moment (if you can find the strength to put it down) and try this.  Stop breathing until you die, then, bring yourself back to life.  If you can do this, Congratulations!  You are GOD.  If you cannot do it, or if the thought of trying makes you weak in the knees, you've just gotten only a small taste of how much control you don't have over ""your"" body.   If it's your body and you have so much control over it, then tell it not to get pregnant when you have promiscuous and unprotected sex.  But, don't exact your revenge on underdeveloped, defenseless, and innocent human lives; they can't help it if they wound up with you as a mother. The United States of America can count herself among the nations that is proud to legally practice child sacrifice.  Yippee!  For the record, did you know that in the Old Testament entire nations were wiped out for this very reason?  What makes the USA so special?  Nothing really.  We will face the same judgment unless we get the abortion issue right, which means making abortion legally wrong.  And, all of this while we whine about children working in foreign sweat shops making a penny a week. In a day and age when ""The Secret"" is touted as an original compilation of universal wisdom, America should be universally recognized and, in fact, is recognized as a perpetual violator of every universal law by virtue of silent acts of complicity with regard to abortion.  I sacrificed one of my own children on the altar of humanism many years ago, and I swore never to let it happen again.  My healing and recovery, spirit, soul, and body, was long and often agonizing.  For the most part, I was entirely oblivious to the fact that some critical issues in my life were manifesting as a result of that single act. If you, however, still want to participate in this abominable national ritual either by observation or participation, like a bully beating up on the new kid, any inferred reference entirely intentional, take my advice and pick on someone your own size.  Death row has a cell with your name on it."
10,Obtaining an Apostille or Embassy Legalization Online,politics," If you are reading this article it means that you are in need to legalize a document internationally.  Not to worry, this article will explain what you need to know about the process and who you should contact for your needs. An apostille allows a document to be legally accepted internationally under the terms of the 1961 Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalization for Foreign Public Documents.  All countries that have signed the Hague Convention will recognize your document if they are accompanied with an apostille.  These countries include: Albania, Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium, Belize, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, China (Macau), China (Hong Kong), Colombia, Cook Islands, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Estonia, Fiji, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Grenada, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Korea, Republic of, Latvia, Lesotho, Liberia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malawi, Malta, Marshall Islands, Mauritius, Mexico, Moldova, Republic of, Monaco, Namibia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Niue, Norway, Panama, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, San Marino, Serbia and Montenegro, Seychelles, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Suriname, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, FYR of Macedonia, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom (U.K.), United States of America, and Venezuela. Most all legal documents will have the ability to be used internationally.  Common documents allowed include: birth certificate, adoption documents, marriage certificate divorce decree, death certificate, report of birth abroad, single proof letter (to marry), naturalization documents, power of attorney, diploma and/or transcripts, corporate documents, certificate of good standing, incorporation documents, ISO certificate, bylaws, affidavits, identity documents and/or passports, proof of citizenship, deeds or titles, wills, agreements, assignments, trademark and patent documents, letter of invitation, letter of debt, invoices, bills of sale, proof of ownership, police records, and private documents. If you need to have documents transferred to a country that is not part of the Hague Convention you will need to have the document legalized through the Embassy of the given country or directly with the country. The great news is both apostille and embassy legalization services can be initiated online, legalized, then mailed directly to your door step.  Different services made available by the internet have made it possible for professionals from all over the country to provide you with expedited service to have your documents taken care of in a timely manner."
11,Government Info,politics," Government JobsThe federal government is the largest single employer in the united States, with almost 2 million civilian workers. Government Work Government at the city, county, state, and federal level is a very large natural resources employer.  Government Job Hiring Set to SoarOver the next three years, the federal government -- the nation's largest employer -- is projected to hire nearly 193,000 new employees to fill ""mission critical"" positions in almost every occupational field, according to an new report from the non-profit Partnership for Public Service. The Federal Government recognizes that people with disabilities have a right to full and fair consideration for any job for which they apply.

Under Employment Opportunities, you will find everything you need to explore exciting careers in state government. State Government State government usually has three different sections or branches, and each branch has its own job to do.  Government at the city, county, state, and federal level is a very large natural resources employer. Other Departments To streamline administration of health, human and rehabilitation services, we propose merging the majority of agencies and programs, with the exception of the Medicaid program, into two departments: a Department of Health Services and a Department of Rehabilitative Services. Each has laws and regulations, provides many services, develops lands and operates departments, ministries and crown corporations. Services Common internal services, likehuman resources, purchasing and accounting, should be consolidated to achieveeconomies of scale and reduce duplication. Laws Laws, after passage but beforeenactment, can be reviewed by the Constitutional Council. Students Students will understand that the United States government is divided into executive, legislative, and judicial branches, each with specific responsibilities and powers. Students write Legislative branch on the red sheet, Executive branch on the white sheet, and Judicial branch on the blue sheet. Students need to understand the importance of separation ofpowers, checks and balances, and judicial review. General law cities derive their powers from and organize their governments according to acts of the legislature. General law cities nevertheless also have considerable choice in their form of municipal government, and fairly broad powers over local affairs.

15,Most Important Weapons of Choice for US Navy SEALs,politics," As can be imagined, the array of weaponry that is used by Navy SEALs is extensive and sophisticated. This state-of-the-art weaponry is not only made in the United States, but is sourced from all over the world. Most weaponry has been specifically designed for the use of SEALs or the Special Operations Forces in general. This elite group of warriors has the freedom to choose Navy SEALs weapons with a specific set of parameters; this includes the primary as well as secondary weapons. Standard Issues Weapons like the highly accurate M4A1 Carbine are standard issue for all Navy SEALs; as they are known for their versatility. Pistols are also commonly used, but they are more of a back up weapon then a front end weapon. The Weaponry Navy SEALs weaponry, is mission-dependant, and as, aforementioned, there is large amount of choice available for them. Given below is a small list of weapons, which is representative of what the SEALs use. The Handguns MK23 Mod 0.45 cal SOCOM Offensive Handgun This is an offensive handgun, specially developed for U.S Special Operations Command. Very soon, its inherent capabilities saw it being used frequently as a service pistol. The MK 23, offers a Navy SEAL unmatched accuracy and comes good on all operational requirements that one expects from combat handgun. M11 Sig Sauer P-228 This is one of the favorite weapons of the Navy SEALs as its light, has deadly accuracy and its small size, makes it easy to conceal.

The Assault Rifle M4A1 with SOPMOD Accessory Kit It’s the weapon of choice, which is used by all Navy SEAL operators. The Navy in conjunction with the U.S Special Operations Command or USSOCOM was instrumental in developing what is known as the Special Operations Peculiar, or SOPMOD, Accessory kit that made this rifle even more effective, lethal, and versatile. The Machine Gun M60E3 Machine Gun and MK43 Mod 0 This is a light machine gun; whose operational features are that it is gas operated and air cooled. A disintegrating M13 link belt provides it with a 7.62mm round firing power. Introduced way back in 1957, this weapon is still used by Navy SEALs, although, in its many variants. The M60E3 is a lightweight version whereas the M60E4 is a designated MK43 Mod 0 version. This is just an overview of the weapons that are used by Navy SEALs and is by no means the complete list. However, one thing is certain; all the weapons are deadly and provide all the help the SEALs need, in their dangerous missions."
16,How to Become a Navy SEAL,politics," You can’t just become a SEAL; you have to earn your Trident. It’s a long and difficult process that requires intelligence, endurance, and loads of guts. The process is not complicated, but it’s quite difficult. The Age Requirement Applications are only accepted from those who are 28 years and above. Some Navy SEALs aspirants are given an age waiver, but only for those between 29-30 years of age and not above. The Gender Requirement In a nutshell, the Navy SEALs program does not accept woman applicants. This is because, according to a policy set by the Congress, women are excluded from active combat duty.

17,Ten Most Famous Navy SEALs,politics," Everyone, who has an aspiration of serving in the armed forces, harbors dreams of becoming a Navy SEAL, but only a small percentage, realize this dream. Moreover, the exploits of the SEALs are largely secretive, and more often than not away from intensive public scrutiny. Given below is a list of 10 such famous Navy SEALs. Roy Boehm Arguably one of most famous of all Navy SEALs, and considered the godfather of all SEALs. He was the first officer in charge of SEAL Team Two. Roy. H. Boehm served the military for 30 years in various capacities, and rose from the enlisted ranks to develop, and lead what was to become an elite combat force called the US Navy SEALs He was instrumental in not only designing and developing but also implementing and leading this commando force. Rudy Boesch This retired Navy SEAL became popular for his stint in the reality series Survivor: Borneo, and for being its oldest competitor. Moreover, he finished in 3rd place. He had an enviable record as a SEAL, and was a team leader, who had 45 years of uninterrupted military career. Scott Helvenston The youngest Navy SEAL, to complete the rigorous BUD/S, he worked for Blackwater Security post retirement. He was sent to Iraq, but was killed in the infamous Fallujah ambush, within a few days of his arrival in the country. At a young age of 16, he was given special permission to join the Navy, and had an unblemished 12 year career before he left. Eric T. Olson He is the current head of the United States Special Operations Command or USSOCOM and is the only Navy SEAL to have achieved such a distinction; moreover he is also the first Naval Officer who has been given the charge of USSOCOM.

It will come as no surprise that after the rigorous military training, and unimaginable feats of bravery, Navy SEALs go on to achieve things, which very few can achieve. This is just a small list of these over-achieving individuals who have stood out and become famous for their accomplishments."
18,"Navy SEALs vs Green Berets (Differences, Similarities)",politics," Both Navy SEALs and Green Berets are special covert groups they differ in function, but to a large extent are trained in almost the same skills. The Navy SEALs generally do not interfere in matters of politics and international coalition on foreign soil, while the Green Berets have a greater part to play in those matters. Green Berets The Green Berets also known as ‘United States Army Special Forces’ were formally established in 1952, by Brigadier General Robert McClure with the purpose of carrying out sensitive operations for the United States. Joining the Green Beret’s is no easy task, only trained soldiers are permitted. The process is long and tedious and designed to discourage the weak willed. Instruction and Preparation: a thirty day course to instruct and brief the soldiers for the physical and mental pressure they will undoubtedly undergo. The Sifting: a daylong event dedicated to determining that only the finest will be able to proceed further for the Special Forces training. Instructions: on language, cultures, customs and traditions of numerous countries where they are likely to be posted. SERE (Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape): Prisoner of War training, which includes resistance to torture. Navy SEALs The Navy SEALs, although dating back to the time of the invasion of Japan by America, only became an official body in the early 1960’s. A Navy SEAL is trained to handle missions on the sea, in the air or over land. Operations include underwater demolitions, over land missions, infiltration, rescue, reconnaissance, unconventional warfare and anti-terrorist activities. Selection Rigorous training is required to become a Navy SEAL. A seven month long course covering, general instruction, conditioning, underwater demolition and on-land combat as well. Known to be one of the most physically grueling and mentally challenging trainings known to man, it’s no surprise that very few who start it, actually mange to finish. During the training the candidate undergoes the following: Indoctrination: to mentally and physically prepare them for the training ahead. Basic Conditioning: Aimed at conditioning the body and testing the limits of physical endurance. SCUBA training:  two and a half months of water based training in sabotage, underwater demolition, infiltration etc. Land-warfare training: roughly three months of on the ground training in weapons combat, hand-to-hand combat and other land warfare. Similarities Both Green Berets and Navy SEALs have to undergo very concentrated and demanding training programs to qualify. The physical aspects of both training programs are very similar. The U.S. Navy SEALs and the Green Berets are both Special Forces trained to perform various combat tactics and reconnaissance; the Green Berets officially hold the title of Special Forces. Differences Unlike Navy SEALs, Green Berets are also trained in languages, diplomacy, politics, culture, disinformation and psychological warfare. While Navy SEALs assist in providing security, The Green Berets also work with foreign governments in areas of operation to advice on Political administration and Economical situations. Most Green Berets are highly educated before entering the program itself; some with even a postgraduate degree."
19,"Navy SEALs vs. Army Rangers (Differences, Similarities)",politics," Both Navy SEALs and Army Rangers are highly respected but distinctly separate wings of the United States armed services. Army Rangers and Special forces both roll up to the U.S. Army, while on the other hand Marines and Navy SEALs roll up to the U.S. Navy. Army Rangers With origins dating back to colonial times the Army Rangers are part of the US Operations Special Forces that became a more permanent part of the military around the 1970’s. Army Rangers are front line special light infantry American troops and their primary focus is on infiltration by land, air or even sea they are specialized in the recovery of personnel and special equipment, conducting raids and direct action operations. Selection To be selected to be a Ranger a soldier has to prove his physical capability through various endurance tests designed to establish that he's physically capable of entering the program. Once into ‘Ranger School’ his training is categorized into three phases namely Crawl training, Walk training and Run training. Crawl training: is to develop the foundations and trains the soldier in hand –to hand combat, immersion in water and the use of fists and sticks in combat. Walk training: covers rappelling, ambush training, knots tying and intermediate level airborne operations. Run training:  is the advanced training covering such aspects as water bound infiltration, troop extraction in hostile situations, working with explosives, skills for sabotage, navigation and reconnaissance Only on completion of the above does a Ranger officially graduate from Ranger School. Navy SEALs The Navy SEALs were established formally around the 1960’s but have their roots dating back to the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Navy SEALs specialize in sea, air and land specific missions and operations, Basic Underwater Demolitions (BUD), reconnaissance, information warfare, personnel recovery, unconventional warfare, counter terrorism, internal defense on foreign soil, and security assistance. Selection In order to make it as a Navy SEAL an individual has to undergo a seven month long Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) training which is divided into phases: Indoctrination: to prepare the new initiates physically and mentally for the gruelling training ahead and the ways of the Navy SEAL. Similarities Both Army Rangers and Navy SEALs undergo very Intense and gruelling training programs designed to weed out the ones who just don’t cut it. The U.S. Navy SEALs and the U.S. Army Rangers do not recruit women. Women do however work in several significant posts in support levels with the Navy SEALs, and serve at group levels in the U.S. Army Special Forces. Both elite units exist for covert operations and while there are several differences in the way they operate there are definitely areas of overlap in terms of functions. Differences Rangers operate in platoon sized or larger units and are capable of handling direct action missions while Navy SEALs operate in smaller teams and handle specialised covert operations. Rangers primarily perform military support functions while Navy SEALs are primarily for selective roles and most often not directly get involved in ""front line"" combat. The Rangers are typically known to be ready for rapid deployment, has an airborne advanced infantry and generally tends to fight primarily using conventional warfare. Navy SEALs on the other hand are responsible for unconventional warfare, they are all trained paratroopers, they integrate with foreign forces, are generally independent and have high sustainability working within small groups with limited or no support; they specialise and execute underwater reconnaissance , infiltrations and demolitions. While both Army Rangers and Navy SEALs are highly skilled specialized forces whose functions tend to overlap, the Army Rangers specialty is land warfare, while the Navy SEAL as the name suggests excels where water bodies are involved."
20,"US Navy SEALs: Myths, Legends, and Truths",politics," Formally founded in the 1960’s with their origins dating back to the bombing of Pearl Harbor in the early 40’s, the Navy SEALs (an abbreviation of ‘Sea, Air, and Land’) is truly an enigmatic group. The US Navy SEALs are the special elite force that most individuals only dream to be able to join. To a lot of people the mere mention conjures up imagery of covert operations and heroic reconnaissance missions; and while a lot of men aspire to be a part of it, few even survive the grueling training required to make the cut. The records of the US Navy SEALs are filled with numerous stories of successful missions, daring rescues, and phenomenal feats so much so that there are myths and legends out there that need to be separated to highlight the truth. Myth About Women Navy SEALs You’ve probably heard some people say they know women who are Navy SEALs, well the truth is there are no women Navy SEALs, chances are they are talking about a woman marine. The truth is the Navy SEALs do not recruit women; few men, let alone women are capable of passing the stringent physical fitness requirements that it takes to become a SEAL. Hell Week During the rigorous training for basic conditioning to become a Navy SEAL the fourth week is known as the legendary ""Hell Week"". During this period students are subject to five days and five nights of relentless training with a total of only four hours of sleep. Extreme training and obedience to orders during this five and a half day period are vital elements of a Navy SEAL’s training to ensure that for future operations are not compromised and that the US Navy SEALs are able to function oblivious to temperature, terrain or personal physical comfort. Legends World renowned as probably one of the toughest Special Forces programs to complete the Navy SEALs have turned out several individuals who are legends by their own right thanks to former training, discipline and skills acquired through various mission as Navy SEALs. Former Navy SEALs like Richard Marcinko, Chris Cassidy, Jesse Ventura and Chuck Pfarrer, to name a few, are veterans that have accomplished a great deal and have literally raised the bar of achievement through their successes. The Reality Joining the US Navy SEALs is no doubt tough and the reputation of being one of the hardest programs to pursue in the America is undoubtedly a challenge to invite the very best who seek the Navy SEAL label. Only after completing normal Navy training do SEALs get to volunteer for the Navy SEAL training program. However the rigorous training and mission requirements often result in a lot of volunteers being unable to cope with the demands of being a SEAL and ultimately dropping out, while the determined ones take on the SEAL training program more than once in a bid to succeed."

1,Navy SEALs vs Foreign Commandos - Differences,politics," There are many different special operation military units across the world. Different nations have their own set of Special Forces which are trained to perform in very volatile political or battle conditions. These units indulge in some dangerous military operations, which are not usually undertaken by their Army or Naval bases. These Special Forces are smaller groups of specially trained personnel who perform a multitude of such activities on need basis. Navy SEALs The Navy SEALs are considered the elitist of the US Special Operation Forces. SEAL is an acronym which stands for Sea, Air and Land. This is because the Navy SEALs operate on all the three, under any given conditions. The Navy SEALs work in small units or teams. They are known for their ability to complete any operation, be it destroying or picking up targets, or completing rescue missions with minimal or no detection. Note worthy foreign commando units Many special military operation units from various nations have made a name for themselves, following their heroic accounts of success in countering terrorism, reconnaissance operations and courage under battle conditions. Some of world famous foreign commando units are the renowned ""Parachute Regiment"" as well as the Special Air Services unit of the UK Special forces and the British Army. The courageous Russian Spetznaz unit has also earned a name for themselves among the best Special Forces in the world. The Italian special force unit known as ""9th Parachutist Assault Regiment"" is also quite famous and is comparable to SAS in their overall operations. Differences between the Navy SEALs and Foreign Commandos All Special Forces have their own unique set of elements that make them different from one another. While some are different on aspects of training, others are different in their goals and mission. A couple of differences between the Navy SEALs and foreign commandos are cited below. The selection age for a Navy SEAL recruit is under 28 years and can be extended to 30 years under special circumstances. Special Forces around the world have different age criteria. For example, the British Special Forces usually allow an upper age limit of 32 years for selection into any of its Special Force units. The Navy SEALs only recruit Men. Other foreign commando units do at times recruit women. While the Navy SEALs are trained to carry out operations on land, sea and air, most foreign Special Forces train special groups of personnel to battle in specific conditions. Among the Russian Spetznaz, for example, while all recruits of the Alfa brigade receive training in Air Combat and Firearms, about one third are given rigorous training in mountaineering while the other third specialize in counter sabotage diving. It is a well known fact that Navy SEALs’ fitness and training regime is the toughest by far. This is primarily, because, this unit focuses especially on physical and mental endurance, based on the operation goals. Comparatively other Special Forces like SAB of the Royal Marines have less exhaustive physical workout sessions since their mission is quite different. The Navy SEAL recruit does not undergo language training; a couple of foreign commando units like the Britain based Special Forces recruited to fight Al-Qaida include language classes as a necessary part of their training curriculum."
2,European Special Operation Units,politics," Today, the world has joined hands to battle the forces of terrorism which are threatening our nations. The countries of Europe are no exception. Every nation has offered the alliance of their specific special operation units in an effort to show their commitment to eradicate terrorism from the face of this earth. History of European Union The nations of Europe have played an important part in global affairs since the 16th century. After colonization, European countries dominated most of Americas, Africa as well as Asia. However, after the divide of Europe, since its fall in World Wars I & II, they integrated finally to form the European Council as well as the European Union which now encompasses Central, Eastern and Western Europe. Activities undertaken by various European special operation units Today, the main goal of the European Special Forces is to counter terrorism on a global level. To aid this goad, these forces are geared to participate in covert and special reconnaissance as well as offensive attack or action and surprise capture. Committed towards a high level of interoperability and goal-based interaction, these special operation units are also part of operations which include countering revolutionary warfare, infrastructure disruption, capturing ‘specific interest’ subjects etc. The Special Forces are also used in the line of battle in the cases which demand battle space preparation, reconnaissance in battle situation as well as participating in offensive operations. The nations in Europe are also using these special operation units to train armed forces in other nations in special areas of guerrilla warfare tactics. These activities are conducted with a view to share knowledge as well as learn specialist methods to collectively fight a common goal. Such training of external armed forces is also conducted under defence diplomacy. Important special operation units in United Kingdom With the rich military background of the various nations in this continent, today, there are various special operation units in Europe.  After the integration of the European Union, some special forces which existed during World War I & II were disintegrated, while many others continue to serve the various nations even today. Of the most important special operation units, the ones widely talked about are the Special Forces of United Kingdom. This includes ‘Special Air Service Regiments’ or SAS which are manned by the British Armed Forces and the ‘Special Boat Service’ or SAB which is manned predominantly by the Royal Marines. Special Forces in France and Germany Among other nations of the allied European Union, France and Germany are the other two predominant nations with the maximum number of Special Forces. The French Army has such units like the ‘Army Special Forces Brigade’ (BFST), Intelligence Brigade etc. while the Airforce has many  units like ""Commandos Parachutiste de l'Air"" and ""Division des Operations Spéciales"" as part of their elite Special Forces. The German Army or Deutsches Heer has various ""Division Spezielle Operationen"" like the Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol and the ""Kommando Spezialkräfte (KSK)"". The Deutsches Marine too have various ""Spezialisierte Einsatzkräfte Marine"" or (SEK M) which serve the German Navy till date."
3,Special Operations Units of the World,politics," The term, ‘Special Operation Units’ is used to refer to highly specialized and extensively trained military operation units who are known to perform highly volatile military operations. These forces are specially trained to participate in unconventional warfare tactics, reconnaissance as well as counter the highly dangerous terrorist activities. Around the world, in various countries, these ‘Special Operation Units’ are also termed as ‘Special Forces’ or ‘Special Operation Forces’. Specialty of special operation units Special Operation Units typically comprise of small teams of highly trained military personnel. These units are unique because unlike other military platoons, they operate on the principles of self sufficiency, speed, stealth and are extremely dependent on team work. These elements are what make these special operation units highly desirable for volatile and dangerous missions. The units are usually trained in using exclusive armament and special equipment to aid in their equally special operations. Special Operation Units are called upon by the government to handle specialist situations like terrorism activities and other such dangerous activities both on the international and domestic front. On some occasions, such units are also termed as ‘force multipliers’ when they are used to train indigenous military forces in the specialist technique of guerrilla warfare. Historic account Special Operation Units have played a significant role in the shaping of nations and their respective militaries, the world over, since time immemorial. History has abundant accounts of the heroic tales of Special Forces across the world, who have played an important part in changing the destinies of nations. The special operation units are known for their sabotage and surprise ‘hit-and-run’ warfare techniques. They do not indulge in traditional face-front combat. Such units act as a single entity during the operation, which is the secret of their success. History has tales of ancient Chinese and Japanese Ninjas. These were special troops skilled in Martial arts, who indulged in espionage and specialist guerrilla warfare. Special operation units in the world wars Many such special operation units were part of World War I and World War II as well. The Italian ""Reparti d'assalto"" was famous for their shock attack techniques in World War I. In World War II, Winston Churchill also formed various specialist British operation units like Long-range Desert Unit, Special Naval and Air Service, various Raiding Forces etc. Special operation units in the 21st century In the early 21st Century, Special Forces were using by both sides in the effort to win sub-military operations. Examples can be cited from the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, War in Kosovo, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka etc. The most recent accounts of the special operation units can be cited from the recent war on Iraq, launched by the US to counter terrorism. The specialist force called the ""Navy SEALs"" were an important part of this operation. Using their shock and awe techniques, they defeated the Iraqi forces."
4,US Navy SEAL Missions History,politics," The Navy SEALs were commissioned by President Kennedy. It was his foresight to start a force that could engage in unconventional warfare. Since then there has been no looking back. The Navy SEALs of today are highly proficient and skilled in various tactics of warfare. Here are some of the missions the SEALs started from the initial years till date. Pacific and Atlantic fleets It was during the year 1962 on January 1st at 1300 hours that two Navy SEAL teams – team one and team two were deployed to the Pacific and Atlantic fleets respectively. They were commissioned to these two separate areas in order to engage in unconventional warfare also known as UW. The first Vietnam War In the year 1963 shortly after the establishment of the Navy SEALs the Vietnam War started. The Navy SEAL team one was sent to Danang province in Vietnam to serve below the directives of the CIA command of the Chief of Station. This was the very first time that the first war detachment of Vietnam from elements of the Navy SEAL team was deployed. Later on during 1964 the Navy SEALs became a part of the CINC or the commander in chief of the theater forces of Vietnam. Special operation involvement As more and more special operations commenced, the original name of Naval Operations Support Groups was renamed to Naval Special Warfare Groups also known in abbreviated form as NSWG. It was much later during 1983 that all the current UDTs was called as Navy SEAL teams or SEAL delivery vehicle teams. Also during this time all the prerequisites for the hydrographic reconnaissance as well as underwater demolition tactics came to be called ‘SEAL missions’. DEVGRU It was during the year 1987 that the original Navy SEAL Team SIX came to be called as DEVGRU also called DEVelopment GRoUp. On 16th April 1987 at the Naval Amphibious Base Coronado at San Diego, the Naval Special Warfare Command was commissioned here. The objective of this command was to make preparatory actions for all the special naval warfare forces to implement all the designated missions and also to create new strategic warfare tactics and operations. Operation Anaconda In March 2002 the Navy SEALs started the famous Operation Anaconda as part of the US invasion into Afghanistan. Later on in 2002 the Operation Enduring Freedom – Philippines was conducted during which the key ASG terrorist leader was captured and killed. During March of 2003 the US Navy SEALs took part in the invasion of Iraq. This Navy SEAL mission was called Operation Iraqi Freedom. During this war, a holistic and dominant tactic of shock and awe was used."
5,US Navy SEAL Teams Brief History,politics," The US Navy SEALs has had a veritable past and a rich history of its own. The earliest veterans to man strategic missions were the Operational Swimmers of the Office of Strategic Services or OSS who manned many such missions before the Navy SEALs did. Initial training The initial training started in November 1943 in the Camp Pendleton. This training camp then moved to Catalina Island during January in 1944. Later on within 3 months the training camp finally moved to the Bahamas. These early versions of the US Navy SEALs initiated various Navy SEALs equipments such as flexible swimming fins, diving equipment which was closed circuit in nature, submersible swimming equipment, as well as diverse combat swimming tools. The first OSS mission It was in May of the year 1944 that General Donovan who was the current head of the OSS, segregated the entire team into various groups. Group 1 was headed by Lt. Choate to Admiral Nimitz in order to initiate this early Navy SEALs team into the Pacific Theater. In July 1944 this team became a part of the UDT-10. In the first submarine Navy SEALs operation performed by the OSS a team of 5 men carried out this task. The Granite Plan It as Admiral Nimitz who formed this special strategy called the ‘Granite Plan’. For effective combat in the Pacific region the Navy SEALs operations required a lot of strategy, skill and plenty of amphibious force. Usually the typical targets were coral atolls in which the natural reefs provided good cover for the Navy SEALs. In the initial part of November 1943, the SeaBees tried out some experimental blasting operations under the water. The need for unconventional warfare It was the wish of President Kennedy to initiate and develop an unconventional tactic for warfare. As part of this plan the US Navy initiated the first Navy SEAL teams in 1962 – Navy SEAL one and two. These teams were established from the personnel taken from the underwater demolition teams and the first mission of these Navy SEALs was to perform guerilla warfare in riverine and maritime environments. The Vietnam War One of the first Navy SEALs mission was the Vietnam War. It began shortly after the Navy SEALs were established and it was mandatory for the team to participate in it. In various maritime operations of a clandestine nature, the Navy SEAL advisors taught the Vietnamese in performing these operations. The UDT type of training course was also started for the Navy SEALs during this time. It was used for the Commandos of Biet Hai as well as the Junk Force Commando Platoons located in Danang. It was during February of 1966 that a small Navy SEAL team one came to Vietnam to perform missions involving direct action."
6,US Navy SEAL operations in Afghanistan,politics," Operation Red Wing which was a US led expedition to hunt for Al Qaida guerillas and the Taliban was conducted in the rocky region of Kunar. Only the top quality Navy SEALs were involved in this strategic Navy SEALs mission. The team The Navy SEALs operation Red Wing comprised a small team of just 4 members namely Lt. Michael P. Murphy, PO Danny Dietz, PO Matthew Axelson and PO Marcus Luttrell. The mission started on June 28th 2005 and during the Navy SEALs operation 3 of the members were killed. Only one survived. The fourth Navy SEAL was miraculously protected by the local villages and later on rescued by US military forces. This story of rescue was so mysterious and interesting that it reached the cover story of Time magazine. The story was called – How the Shepherd Saved the SEAL’ on the 2005 issue of Time magazine. The mission The Navy SEALs mission was to hunt for Ahmad Shah who was an important Taliban leader. He was said to be located in eastern Asadabad. Unfortunately for the Navy SEALs it was a local shepherd who located the SEALS and instantly alerted the Al Qaida and Taliban forces. Soon the small team of 4 was encircled by the Taliban forces and a massive fire fight ensued. Lt. Murphy’s courage The number of Taliban forces far outweighed that of the Navy SEALs who were just 4 in number. As a result they were easily outdone. However even in the face of such extreme conditions, Lt. Michael P. Murphy or ‘Murph’ as he was popularly called, managed to keep cover long enough to send radio signals to ask for backup. He suffered rifle shots in the stomach as well as on his back but somehow managed to send the comms signal for cover. It took 2 hours, gruesome fighting and the death of dozens of Taliban forces before the three Navy SEALs succumbed to their injuries. The rescue As a result of Murphy’s distress calls to the Bagram Air Base, soon after a helicopter called MH-47 Chinook which carried 8 Navy SEALs and 8 nightstalkers came to the rescue of the team. They tried to extract the team members from the Kunar province in Afghanistan. However even after repeated attempts to rescue they failed. The escort helicopters for attack saw the whole sequence of firefighting which was conducted by the 4 member Navy SEALs team and called it ‘an unbelievable fight’. Miraculously even though the team was small in number they managed to put up a very good fight to the Taliban forces. Luttrell’s rescue With the Chinook helicopter down, Luttrell was now all alone left to fend for himself. He had been severely wounded in the firefight. He somehow managed to extract himself away from the firing zone and hid for cover while he waited for rescue. In the meantime this Navy SEAL was spotted by an Afghan man who said he was not from the Taliban. Soon after more Afghan men came to the scene armed with AK-47 rifles. They took away Luttrell from the scene and carried him to the Sabray village. They nursed Luttrell and cared for him and even protected him from the Taliban soldiers who came to search for him."
7,US Navy SEAL operations in Iraq,politics," In the recent past the US Navy SEALs has been in the news for its operations in Iraq. It all began in the year 2003 when President George Bush ordered the Navy SEALs to invade Iraq. This Navy SEALs operation was called ‘Operation Iraqi Freedom’. Why it started It was generally believed at the time in 2003 that Iraq possessed and was also developing on an active basis, weapons of mass destruction or WMD. This was strictly in violation of the 1991 agreement between the US and Iraq that stated these WMDs needed to be given up unconditionally. Bush’s aim was to get rid of Saddam Hussein’s support of terrorism and eventually free the citizens of Iraq. This is how the Navy SEALs mission began. While this mission was led by the US it also had the backing of Britain, Poland as well as Australia. The fated day On March 20th in the year 2003 at around 2:30 UTC, a series of explosions were heard from Baghdad. It has only recently been found that these explosions were a result of the group of special forces such as British SAS, US Delta Force, US Navy SEALs, Australian 4RAR as well as SASR etc. It has recently been proven that these troops headed straight for Baghdad even before the air war had started. The Shock and Awe technique In military parlance this term is commonly used to refer to the use of overwhelming force, dominant maneuvers and power displays to cripple the enemy’s power to fight. In order to accomplish victory as soon as possible the US strategy in Iraq involved the simultaneous usage of ground and air attacks to immobilize the Iraqi forces. Thus while the US army was attacking, the US Navy SEALs were also assaulting the forces in Iraq. Many Iraqi military units were bypassed successfully as part of the Navy SEALs operation. Crippling the center The idea behind the strategy of attack in Iraq was to immobilize the center of the Iraqi command as soon as possible while also ensuring that civilian deaths and loss of infrastructure were kept to a bare minimum. It was also estimated that once the leadership of Saddam Hussein was weakened it would automatically entail crippling of the Iraqi forces. The US Navy SEALs also hoped that in this context the Iraqi native people would be open to the US instead of Saddam’s terrorist rule. The closing During the closing hours of March 20th there were several amphibious attacks, as well as assaults carried out simultaneously by the British 3 Commando Brigade, the Royal Marines as well as US Navy SEALs to secure oil fields in Iraq. However in the course of this Navy SEALs mission close to 44 oil wells were destroyed and exploded by accident or by explosives launched by the Iraqi forces."
8,History & Background information on Congressional Medal of Honor,politics," The Congressional Medal of Honor is one of the most revered awards given to valiant soldiers and pilots in war. This medal is provided to the US Navy SEALs for their brave acts during war with an enemy. The medal is conferred by the President of the US and is given in the name of the Congress thereby getting its name – Congressional Medal of Honor. The symbolism The Congressional Medal of Honor has a certain symbolism and meaning attached to the shape and the motifs inside it. For example the inverted 5 pointed star has a cluster of leaves of laurel along with oak on each point. These leaves signify victory, while the oak symbolizes strength. Both these attributes are absolutely essential in any officer going for a Navy SEALs mission. Outside the circular insignia are 34 stars which stand for the number of stars in the US flag. Within the circle are two engravings. On the right is Minerva the Roman Goddess of War. Perched on her helmet is an owl which again symbolizes wisdom. Moving away from Minerva is a man who is carrying a bunch of snakes in his hands. He is known as Discord. An impressive past It might be surprising but the Congressional Medal of Honor has a rich past spanning over 140 years. It was during 21st December in 1861 that the first 200 medals of honor were produced. Then a few months later in February 17th 1862, there was a bill passed to authorize the President of the US to distribute the medals. This bill was then signed by President Abraham Lincoln and it was then that the Army Medal of Honor was created. During 17th September more than 20 army soldiers of US performed heroic acts on a Navy SEALs operation which got recognized later. On 25th March 1863 six of the first Medals of Honor were presented by Edwin Stanton, the Secretary of War to 6 surviving members of Andrew’s Raiders. On 6th April in the year 1865 almost 56 soldiers won Medals of Honor in Deatonsville at Sailor’s Creek in VA. One of them was the brother of the famous General Custer – second Lt. Thomas Custer. The first Medals of Honor to be ever given on foreign soil was on 9th June in the year 1871. Three soldiers received these Medals of Honor for their bravery in Korea. Over the course of the next 2 days more than twelve Americans, comprising 6 marines and 9 sailors won these Medals of Honor. Recent achievements Among the more recent achievements in the last century on 20th July in the year 1950, General William F. Dean as well as George Dalton Libby were the first recipients to earn the Medals of Honor for their contribution in the Korean war. While Libby succumbed to his injuries during the war, Dean was taken hostage as prisoner. However no matter what the cause all Navy SEALs soldiers dream of receiving the Congressional Medal of Honor some day."
9,Lt. Thomas R. Norris,politics," One of the most revered veterans of the Vietnam remains Lt. Thomas R. Norris. He was part of several Vietnam Navy SEALs mission directives. He is known for his immense courage and sheer dedication to his country under some of the most trying circumstances. Heavily guarded Quang Tri Province Lt. Thomas R. Norris is mainly known for his unsurpassed victory in being able to rescue 2 downed pilots from the severely enemy infested province of Quang Tri. On 10th of April in the year 1972, Lt. Thomas R. Norris lead a team of 5 men on a Navy SEAL patrol to the province. This province covered an area of almost 2000 meters and every inch of it was severely guarded. It was during daybreak that Lt. Thomas R. Norris was able to locate one of the two downed pilots. He then returned to the FOB or the Forward Operating Base. A day later, having borne the brunt of severe mortar and rocket attacks on the FOB, Lt. Thomas R. Norris returned with his 3 remaining men to rescue the second pilot. Clever tactics Lt. Thomas R. Norris was known for his presence of mind, even under the most difficult situations. On the 12th of April, Lt. Thomas R. Norris and his Vietnamese friend disguised themselves as fishermen and went through enemy territory at night, while also using a sampan. After an extensive search during this rescue Navy SEALs operation, Lt. Thomas R. Norris and his Vietnamese friend were able to locate the second downed pilot at almost dawn. The return journey Lt. Thomas R. Norris and the Vietnamese friend then covered the injured second pilot with bamboo as well as vegetation and then carefully made their way back. In the process of this most strategic Navy SEALs mission they were also able to successfully avoid a North Vietnamese patrol too. While they were coming near the FOB or the Forward Operating Base, they suffered heavy machine gun firing from the enemy. In a battle of wits, Lt. Thomas R. Norris was able to call in an air strike which in turn provided for suppression fire as well as a smokescreen. Dedication and courage In spite of having faced such extreme opposition from the enemy and with limited resources, Lt. Thomas R. Norris was able to successfully save two downed pilots of the US Navy SEALs. He displayed tremendous courage, dedication to serve his country and also displayed a great deal of presence of mind even under such trying circumstances. In this manner Lt. Thomas R. Norris indeed enhanced some of the best traditions of the US Naval Service. Lt. Thomas R. Norris served many years in Vietnam during which his series of successive rescue operations have also been captured into a movie called BAT-21 which stars Danny Glover."
10,Petty Officer Michael Edwin Thornton,politics," Petty Officer Michael Edwin Thornton is known for winning the revered Congressional Medal of Honor and also saving the life of Lt. Thomas Norris during October in the year 1972. Thornton has always been renowned for his fighting spirit, never say die attitude and a relentless passion for his country. His contribution to the Vietnam War still remains a source for inspiration for all Navy SEALs mission soldiers. Beyond the call of duty The only thing that distinguishes an average soldier from an outstanding one is the ability to serve the nation without caring for one’s life. One such shining example is Petty Officer Michael Edwin Thornton. He was an assistant to the US Navy Advisor at the time and was accompanied by a Senior Advisor with a 3 member team of the Vietnamese Navy SEALs patrol. They were supposed to gather intelligence as well as capture prisoners in a naval river base that was being occupied by the Vietnamese soldiers. Heavy firing What followed was an intensive round of heavy firing from the enemy. Even during such unfavorable circumstances Petty Officer Michael Edwin Thornton managed to call in additional naval gunfire support and also began to engage the Vietnamese enemy in fierce firefighting. They then continued this firefight to result in many enemy casualties. Subsequently they went back into the waterline to prevent the entire Navy SEALs patrol from being encircled by the enemy. His devotion to his leader Petty Officer Michael Edwin Thornton stands out in the history of the Vietnam war because he saved the life of his Senior Advisor. In spite of having returned to the waterline, Petty Officer Michael Edwin Thornton went back to the enemy center of firing after he learnt Lt. Thomas Norris was injured and was supposedly dead. Managing to return to the area amidst heavy firing from the enemy, Petty Officer Michael Edwin Thornton managed to kill 2 enemy soldiers and also simultaneously managed to remove Lt. Norris to the water’s edge. Then he was able to inflate the lifejacket of Lt. Norris and then towed him towards the sea successfully. He kept towing Norris for almost 2 hours at a stretch until he got picked up by the support craft. It was only due to his unswerving dedication and risking his life beyond the call of duty that Petty Officer Michael Edwin Thornton was able to successfully save Senior Advisor Lt. Norris. This was a Navy SEAL mission with a difference. Courage under fire One of the great things about Petty Officer Michael Edwin Thornton is his dedication to his country. Having graduated from High School in the year 1967, soon afterwards Petty Officer Michael Edwin Thornton enrolled in the Navy SEALs and was soon after sent to Vietnam as the situation became tense. It was here that Petty Officer Michael Edwin Thornton displayed his immense courage, his dedication to save his Senior Advisor and protect his country’s honor."
11,"Lt. Robert ""Bob"" Kerrey",politics," An ever smiling face coupled with great courage even under distressing situations – such is the personality of LT (jg) Robert ""Bob"" Kerrey. Having led numerous combat battles in the notorious Vietnam war, LT (jg) Robert ""Bob"" Kerrey has always been a guiding beacon of hope among all aspiring Navy SEALs. His strategic war plans It was mainly due to LT (jg) Robert ""Bob"" Kerrey’s ingenuous plans during the Vietnam war that many of the combat battles were successfully won. In fact one of the most memorable was when he and his team members climbed a steep 350 foot cliff just to attack the enemy by surprise! As part of this Navy SEAL mission LT (jg) Robert ""Bob"" Kerrey and his team mates climbed the mountain to reach the ledge on which the enemy was situated. Then he divided his team into 2 sections and while supervising them both, LT (jg) Robert ""Bob"" Kerrey descended downward into enemy territory. As soon as he and his team reached the foot of the mountain he and his teammates suffered heavy injuries due to severe firing from the enemy. The presence of mind LT (jg) Robert ""Bob"" Kerrey displayed tremendous amounts of both courage and presence of mind during this famous Navy SEALs operation. He not only directed his team mates to fire into the heart of the camp of the enemy he also used his radio to call in the second portion of the team for additional fire support. This confused the Vietnamese soldiers who didn’t know which team to tackle first. The immense courage LT (jg) Robert ""Bob"" Kerrey displayed his calm nature and collectedness in spite of having such severe injuries. His injuries prevented him from moving even an inch and in spite of such excruciating pain he was able to successfully and cool headedly guide his teams to secure as well as defend an extraction site. He was directing his men even when he was on the verge of becoming unconscious. He was eventually rescued by a helicopter after this most taxing Navy SEALs mission. However he lost a leg during this operation. The critical importance The reason why LT (jg) Robert ""Bob"" Kerrey is so revered in the history of the Vietnam war is because not only did he and his team mates wreak havoc on the Vietnamese enemy soldiers, but many of the captured soldiers provided valuable inputs and secret information to the allied effort. LT (jg) Robert ""Bob"" Kerrey’s unrelenting devotion to the nation’s honor, his immense courage even under the most taxing situations and his heroic spirit is what inspires Navy SEALs even to this day. LT (jg) Robert ""Bob"" Kerrey has even become a US Senator for Nebraska State and currently he has retired from political life."
12,Lt. Michael P. Murphy,politics," The Congressional Medal of Honor is perhaps the single most fitting tribute to our heroes of war. Having special significance among Navy SEALs this Medal of Honor serves to pay homage to all war veterans. One such leading man killed during Operation Redwing was Lt. Michael P. Murphy. That fated day It was during a special operation conducted in Afghanistan that Lt. Michael P. Murphy was killed during his Navy SEAL mission. He was leading a SEAL team comprising 4 members and it was on June 28th in the year 2005 that ""Murph"" or Murphy breathed his last. The team of 4 members comprised of the following members: Matthew G Axeson, Marcus Luttrell, Danny P. Dietz and Lt. Michael P. Murphy. The task at hand The task of the 4 member SEAL team was to try and locate an important and strategic leader of the Taliban. They were on their Navy SEAL operation located at a strategic tactical location when they encountered heavy enemy firing. This 4 man team bore the brunt of the firing without submitting to them or giving up. In addition to the heavy enemy firing a heavy grenade propelled by a rocket was hurled at the team. All died except Hospital Corpsman Second Class Marcus Luttrell. Soon after the grenade exploded all the team members were hurled into a ravine while being thrown over a massive ledge. The killing rampage Soon after the grenade was exploded, a rescue helicopter was immediately dispatched to the site to help save any survivors. However even the plane which had over 16 rescue members were all shot down with a rocket fire. All people on board were instantly killed. This massive killing spree caused one of the biggest and most devastating losses of life in the Navy SEALs mission Operation Enduring Freedom. Risking his life Lt. Michael P. Murphy was already in a very bad state, having suffered severe injuries on account of the grenade explosion. However, in spite of all his injuries he decided to touch base and establish a comms signal with the SEAL base. He advanced into the open ground, not caring for his life and also testing his level of Navy SEALs fitness in the process. He was instantly targeted with numerous fire shots by the enemy and in spite of heavy bleeding he managed to relay his position and ask for instant fire support from the SEAL base. The recognition It was on the day of October 11th in the year 2007 that the Whitehouse announced the posthumous award of Congressional Medal of Honor to Lt. Michael P. Murphy. The courage that Lt. Michael P. Murphy showed coupled with his immense bravery and presence of mind even during such a strenuous Navy SEALs mission just goes to show the kind of dedication this Lieutenant had for our country."
13,"Pakistan, & the Myth of Islamic Terrorism",politics," President Musharraf has supposedly been fighting Islamic terrorism since he took control of Pakistan in a coup eight years ago. Benazir Bhutto repeatedly justified her role in a future Pakistan by claiming to be a champion of democracy; Nawaz Sharif is also citing to his highly dubious democratic credentials at every opportunity on the campaign trail. In Washington, both Republicans and Democrats regularly reiterate the link between Islamic radicalism in Pakistan and the safety of the American homeland. Across the porous border in Afghanistan, NATO forces also claim to be fighting Islamic insurgents. And just recently, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh declared that India was facing a common threat with Pakistan, the threat emanating from religious extremism. But who exactly are these Muslim men (and women, in some instances) who have been painted with the broad terrorist brush since 9/11? Following a recent trip to the restive Swat Valley, a student leader of the Peshawar-based Awami National Party said that ""virtually every single armed follower of Mullah Radio [Mullah Fazlullah] comes from the most marginalized section of society; these men don’t have jobs, their families find it difficult to put two meals on the table, and they have been in some form of bondage—to warlords, landowners or smugglers—for decades. They are the ones being killed in the face of a brutal onslaught by the Pakistani army."" So let’s get the facts out first; we will get to religious fanaticism later. Which segment of the Pakistani population do these ""terrorists"" come from? Firstly, the armed fighters in the North West Frontier Province are essentially landless and unemployed men who are caught up in the vicious nexus of deeply-entrenched commercial interests representing the Pakistani army, large landowners, market traders, village mullahs and drug kingpins. Secondly, those taking orders from warlords in the neighbouring tribal areas are not only landless and unemployed; they are, for all practical purposes, living under the worst form of modern-day feudalism, whether in Pakistan or in Afghanistan. In fact, in the days following the Taliban’s downfall in late-2001, a veteran spokeswoman for the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA) had warned that ""the complete failure of governments in this part of the world to resolve basic issues like land titles, and to implement genuine land reforms, has already created an economy which is entirely conditioned by the trade in drugs and arms; our young men have nowhere else to go in order to find work and to fend for their families."" In effect, the so-called Islamic militants are, in fact, unwilling mercenaries, within the context of the Afghanistan-Pakistan theatre. They may or not be devout Muslims, but they certainly are not committed to the destruction of Pakistan, India or the West. As harsh and alarming as it may seem, more than 95% of them are paid, directly or indirectly, to protect or further vested commercial interests. Shortly after the Soviet Army marched out of Afghanistan, a veteran Peshawar politician (who dare not speak on the subject openly today) was left wondering whether anybody in the West understood that ""the Great Jihad of the 1980s was a myth, and that people like Osama Bin Laden and Gulbuddin Hekmateyar were basically running mercenary operations and protection rackets with money from the Gulf and from Saudi Arabia, with arms provided by the CIA and MI6, and with the protection of Pakistan’s notorious Inter Service Intelligence (ISI) agency."" To take the example of Swat, there are some disturbing underlying economic issues which have been demanding urgent attention ever since the establishment of Pakistan. It is common knowledge that nearly 85% of the 1.7 million residents of Swat’s seven sub-districts live below the poverty line. Unemployment rates exceed 75% in many parts of Swat, if underemployment (casual and seasonal labour) is adequately recognized, regardless of misleading government data. Agricultural productivity has actually diminished during the previous three decades, dictated no doubt by minimal inputs in infrastructure in low-lying areas and by the exploitation of forests in the mountains. Swat’s relatively small market centres are in a state of total decay. Corruption in the police and bureaucracy has deep roots. In the midst of this already depressing scenario, the rebel cleric, Mullah Fazlullah, allowed his gangs to collect tariffs and taxes, to organize Sharia courts and to impose strict restrictions on women. Mullah Fazlullah himself obviously claims to be implementing God’s laws, but the facts suggest otherwise. Mullah Soofi Mohammed, Mullah Fazlullah’s father-in-law, was known to have the backing of powerful local smugglers. ""The same smugglers who backed Mullah Soofi are now backing Mullah Radio,"" the Awami National Party student leader confirmed. ""The battle in Swat is nothing but a turf war, between the alliance of smugglers, loggers and clerics on one hand and the collective interests of the bureaucracy, the police and small-city businessmen and traders on the other."" Outside observers have been questioning why the Pakistani Army delayed entering the fray to restore a semblance of order for so many months; interestingly, today, the snowbound mountains to the west and north of Swat have already curtailed mobility, and the route leading to the Karakoram Highway is under the control of armed criminal groups [also called Islamic militants] owing allegiance to renowned Swat-based smugglers and loggers. As a result, the much-publicized drive to bring peace to Swat by the Pakistan Army is unlikely to produce anything sustainable. For that matter, over 10 long years, the West has failed to recognize that, that the Islamabad establishment and Pakistan’s mainstream political parties have been fundamentally misrepresenting the true nature of the social fabric in the badlands of Waziristan. The reality of Swat speaks for itself. ""Nobody expects anything to change out here,"" a Swat sub-district official, who is currently packing up to go back to his hometown of Lahore, told an Al Jazeera stringer last week. ""The Army is not going to dismantle the power structures here, a few hundred armed men and civilians will die, and then the local, low-intensity conflicts will continue, like nothing ever happened."" Now for the critical question: Is the West pursuing phantom terrorists in the Afghanistan-Pakistan theatre? The answer is an unequivocal YES. An overwhelming proportion of those pitted against regular military forces are not Islamic militants; in fact, Islam has got nothing to do with their compulsion to work for warlords, smugglers, intelligence agencies or the Pakistan Army’s vast industrial empire. Devout, mosque-going Muslims they might be; but it is not religion which is driving them to kill and destroy. If anything, the terrorism which we need to be concerned about is the terrorism to which the people of Swat, the rest of the North West Frontier Province, the tribal areas and, to set the record state, the rest of Pakistan are being subject to in their daily lives; the kind of terrorism only poverty can bring---malnourished children, abused women, dismal healthcare, impaired education, high unemployment and ever-rising levels of household debt owing to local money lenders. The true nature of Al Qaeda and the Taliban needs to be thoroughly reviewed, without spin and propaganda. Are these loosely knit outfits, at the end of the day, mercenary outfits using religion simply as a convenient cover for personal gains? The threat from the phenomenon of Political Islam—i.e. from parties like the Jamaat-e-Islami—is an entirely different type of threat altogether, rooted in the lower middle classes in the towns and cities of Pakistan. That threat can easily, and only, be countered if the struggle of impoverished Pakistanis in the countryside gathers momentum. India offers a unique insight into that threat: without a genuine and powerful indigenous movement to resolve poverty and marginalization in the rural context, nothing can stop right-wing Hindu groups, backed by huge sections of the urban middle class and led by people like Narendra Modi, from sharply increasing their influence over Indian society within the next 1-2 years."
14,Republic Day – an important day in the history of India,politics," Republic Day is one of the significant national occasions in India. Celebrated on 26 th January every year, Republic Day marks a major incident in the history of the country. It was on this day in 1950 that the Indian Constitution came into effect, declaring the country a Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic. The initial decision taken by the Lahore Session(1929-30) of the Indian National Congress was to regard 26th January as the Independence Day of India. However, the country achieved its independence on August 15 th and the day was recognized as the official Independence Day of India. It was decided that 26 th January would be given its due importance and it became the Republic Day of India. Republic Day is celebrated with aplomb throughout the country. However, the grand celebrations in the capital, New Delhi, eclipses all others. The address by the President of India initiates the ceremony. Through the inaugural speech, the President pays tribute to the Indians who sacrificed their lives to free their country from foreign rule. He presents the awards to the brave soldiers belonging to the different wings in the armed forces of India. Civilians are also rewarded for their acts of bravery and courage. The Republic Day Parade marches past the Rajpath, one of the important roads of Delhi. The different exhibits featuring the Army, the Navy and the Air Force of India showcase the progress of modern technology and its utilization in enhancing the security of the country. The weapons, tanks, aircrafts, submarines, etc are displayed during this parade. The Republic Day Parade also reflects the core concept which the country represents, 'Unity in Diversity'. The floats from the states of India are the major attractions of the parade. Aesthetically designed, the exhibits provide a glimpse of the culture of every Indian state. Singers and dancers also accompany the floats. Republic Day celebrations demonstrate the popularity of this occasion among the Indian populace."
15,The Barak Obama is a Muslim Controversy,politics," Daniel Pipes has regurgitated the highly disputed March 16th article printed in the Los Angeles Times to once again bring Senator Barak Obama's religious history into the spotlight.  The following is an excerpt from his article which appeared the Frontpagemag.com website on Dec. 26, 2007: Summarized, available evidence suggests Obama was born a Muslim to a non-practicing Muslim father and for some years had a reasonably Muslim upbringing under the auspices of his Indonesian step-father. At some point, he converted to Christianity. It appears false to state, as Obama does, ""I've always been a Christian"" and ""I've never practiced Islam."" The campaign appears to be either ignorant or fabricating when it states that ""Obama never prayed in a mosque."" As a red-blooded American Muslim it makes my blood boil to see that being Muslim today is seen as something un-American and un-holy.  Muslims are the new communists as far as these right-wing, conservative people are concerned.  This is nothing but a propaganda smear campaign against Senator Obama and Islam meant to put fear in the hearts of American citizens who know little or nothing about Islam and what it teaches. Let's look at some facts.  First off, Senator Obama denies that he is a Muslim.  I think we have to take his word on that since no God fearing Muslim would ever deny his religion for fear that God would then deny him on the Day of Judgment. Second, according to the family of Obama's late step-father, he was a non-practicing Muslim who loved women and alcohol.  In fact, he died of several health complications, one of which was a deteriorated liver from excessive alcohol consumption, hardly the image of a pious Muslim. Third, Senator Obama did spend time in a Muslim country and undoubtedly had many Muslim friends growing up.  He has been to a mosque and even learned about Islam for two hours each week at school.  I think that this gives him qualifications far superior to any other candidate we see today when it comes to International politics and getting a handle on the war in Iraq and the complete meltdown in the Middle East we are witnessing today.  We need a candidate that has a basic understanding of Islam and Muslims.  We need a politician who knows more about Islam than what was shown on FOX News. It is interesting to note that Daniel Pipes, the author of the above mentioned article, is reportedly advising Rudy Giuliani on his campaign for president.  It is clear that the radical right wing will continue to use ugly smear campaign tactics and tell tall tales until the very bitter end.  Save democracy, vote Democrat."
16,The Bush Doctrine works,politics," The Bush Doctrine works – when it is applied properly. It follows in the same path laid out by past US hegemonic aspirations at new world orders. Wilson, Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy [all Democrats]; and Reagan had their own doctrines. Past calls to reform the world or combat evil in various forms always involved moral clarity; military power; financial resources; and ultimately patience and intelligence. The Bush Doctrine, aimed at fascistic Islam, and 'draining the swamps' of the Middle East is no different. The Bush Doctrine is of course much maligned. Criticism of the doctrine comes from all over the ideological map and most of the criticism is invalid. The media and educational establishments of course rejoice and report every dissenting view – but offer nothing in the place of the Bush Doctrine. The Bush Doctrine is the right way forward – but only if military might is used properly, which for 3.5 years in Iraq [as many of us knuckle dragging 'neo-cons' screamed], it was not. What is the Bush Doctrine and why doesn't the media report what the doctrine is, in its entirety? The Bush Doctrine is based on a realistic assessment of the challenge posed by radical Islam. It can best be summarised by a speech Bush gave on September 20th 2001: 'We have seen their kind before. They are the heirs of all the murderous ideologies of the twentieth century. By sacrificing human life to serve their radical visions, by abandoning every value execpt the will to power, they follow in the path of fascism, Nazism, and totalitarianism. And they will follow that path all the way to where it ends – in history's unmarked grave of discarded lies.' This is brilliant. In one paragraph Bush summarizes what is at hand with the radical elements of Islam. First, Islam is an ideology of 'will to power' [male Muslims must rule, Islam must dominate etc]; and is inherently fascist [no free will]. Second, Islam follows Nazism and Communism in its commitment to eradicate civilisation, justice, morality and the juridical personality. Third, Islam for all its murderous pagan energy, is doomed to failure – as long as we can recognise the ideology for what it is. This one paragraph is the best short summation of what is at stake. Now flowing from this rationale comes the Bush Doctrine. The doctrine itself rejects all previously inept and failed attempts to address, appease, rationalise or reason with Islam. For over 50 years, various US policies have tried and failed, to either modernise Islam, contain it, or seek an accomodation with it. Various 'isms' – realism, liberalism, and internationalism primary among them – were tried and they failed. The Bush Doctrine broke with all past frameworks and adopted a new, and singularly logical plan to deal with Islam – use exogenous force to change radical, terror sponsoring Muslim regimes, their society, and ultimately their culture. By definition the Bush Doctrine is ineluctably a military-based option. Military power, combined with economics, new pluralist democratic structures, and at some level, a new culture, must or at least has the potential to, refashion the states of the Middle East. It does not require a military occupation of every state, but only the key states which will form the basis for regional-wide change. The Bush Doctrine is bold and risky – but ultimately right. As Bush said numerous times between 2001 and 2004 – usually on deaf media ears – you cannot wait until threats are imminent. By this he meant that terrorists and fascists usually don't write love letters to their victims identifying the time and place of the next tragic, murderous rampage. They usually just kill and talk later. In a compressed world of lethal weapons of all sizes and shapes, and with inter-continental logistics capability available to even the poorest of states, waiting around until murder strikes is simply an abdication of responsibility and ensures carnage. The Bush Doctrine then is premised on pre-emptive strikes, an assertion of national privilege and security, and the belief that forcing democratic change onto the fascist regimes in the Islamic world, is the best hope for long term international peace. He is right. Every other policy tried by conservatives and liberals alike in the past 50 years, regarding Islam, has failed. Realism and balance of power politics [play Iraq off against Iran for example], failed. There are many who whine that the US created Hussein or the Taliban for instance, in the American zeal to counter Russian Communism. Liberal internationalism in the guise of the UN, or endless diplomatic talking shops, have been useless endeavours, never once stopping Islamic terror and violence [see Israel as an example]. Appeasement and isolationism, as witnessed by Reagan's withdrawal from Lebanon in 1983 after hundreds of US marines were killed by Hizbollah over a 6 month period involving multiple attacks; or Clinton's cowardly conduct in Somalia and East Africa, only emboldened the enemy. So what else is left? Not much. You can't pull up the drawbridge and hide behind porous national borders. Neither can you outsource your foreign policy [as the US State department does] to the Europeans or the UN. Neither is trustworthy. With only a few countries possessing any military with power projection capability[France, Israel and the UK are the others]; the US is forced into unilateral action. Invading and draining the swamp of Iraq is the right policy. If the US had used proper military force and fought the Iraq war to win, Iraq today would be stable. At least after 3 years they finally got the right ideas and the right generals to do what should have been done from day one. WMD has been found [along with sales of Hussein's stock identified, going to the Russians, various Arab states and Syria]. Iraqi terror financing has been halted. Iraq now has a government that is our ally. And radical Islam has most likely lost 60.000 men killed and scores more wounded. Iraq is a colossal defeat for the Islamists. Along with the occupation of Afghanistan some notable things have happened. Iran is now encircled making an invasion certainly easier and quicker. The 'winds of change' are slowing blowing throughout the Middle East. The Arabs and Muslims now comprehend that the US is in the region to stay – and to reform. This significant fact means that further societal, cultural and economic changes will surely follow. The fight against Islam has been taken to the heartland of the Arab cult. The pschological effects on Islamic populations, of winning in Iraq and Afghanistan and challenging Iran directly, will be enormous. Liberal internationalism, and the cult of politically correct Marxism, is a scam. There is nothing intelligent in ignoring reality and pretending that the world is a multi-cult paradise and that Islam means peace. Preposterous. It is also morally hypocritical. US 'allies', excluding Britain, but including the weak militaries of most of the EU, and Canada did not join the US invasion of Iraq with any degree of force or military power, for the following reasons: 1. They possess no military. 2. The EU, Russia and China had business interests, including oil rights, worth billions per annum that could not be disturbed. 3. Iraq was the UNO’s largest ever revenue program and the UNO stole about $21 billion in monies from this program over 10 years; and 4. Domestic politics in the socialist and relativist nations [each with sizeable Arab and Muslim lobby groups], means anti-Americanism pays off at the polls and in election campaigns. The opposition to the Iraq invasion was not based on moral grounds. Islamic terror necessitates a multi-level, and complicated response – but it is still, as in times past, primarily a military and financial response which will ensure victory. Diplomacy without strength is useless. Since 9-11, 60.000 people have been killed in acts of Muslim violence and 90.000 wounded. This excludes Darfur and Iraq. The Bush Doctrine of 2001-2002 was right. Islam is the natural heir to the fascist-totalitarian ideologies of Nazism and Communism. In the Middle East and elsewhere Islam has proven itself a failure and if not reformed, Islamic doctrine will only produce more fascist tyranny, hopeless economies and hate sated youth dying for martyrdom. Smashing directly or indirectly Syria, Iran and Saudi Arabia which spend each, $500 million; $ 1-2 billion; and $3-4 billion respectively per annum in sponsoring terror and fascist Islam around the world, should be the number one foreign policy mandate of the West, after stabilising Iraq and Afghanistan. There is nothing wrong with a crusading, imperialist policy. Especially if our national security is at risk. After all the Arabs under the banner of Islam, have been waging war against 'the others' for 1400 years. Acting like children will not make the nightmare go away. The Bush Doctrine is the mature and responsible heir to policies espoused by Wilson, Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy and Reagan. There is no other option."
17,Mourning Not Celebration: Panamanians To Commemorate Date Of US Invasion,politics," December 20th 2007 marked the 18th anniversary of the 1989 American Invasion of Panama. I was in a meeting and asked to be reminded of the date. The quick response that came was, December 20th Invasion Day. At first, I didn't get it. With all the 'days' we have been having since November, I was lost as to which particular celebration I just forgot. Come to think of it, there was no parade so maybe that's why I forgot? A Panamanian Anniversary And No Parade? And then it sank in that this was a Day that does not warrant a celebration for Panamanians. This was never to be forgotten. It was a day to remember. I commented on it to my member and he replied that it is difficult to forget when there are so many reminders of the US occupation of Panama and for him 'a lot of it was negative'. He continued, ""Take for example the leftover landmines...."" Yes, let's take those 'landmines' in a minute. US Invasion No Celebration After he left, I scoured the news and my jaw dropped when I came across an article which was yet to make the headlines of any of the major US papers. The International Herald Tribute reported: - Panama declares US invasion date a national day of mourning See why I'm scooping my jaw off the ground? The news confirmed what I just heard in my members comments. Imagine that. How long had this been brewing. The report quoted a representative of the ruling party as saying:- ""This is a recognition of those who fell on Dec. 20 as a result of the cruel and unjust invasion by the most powerful army in the world,"" said Rep. Cesar Pardo. He is a representative of the Democratic Revolutionary Party. They hold majority votes in the legislature."" The article also claimed that US officials downplayed the story; and, that the officials affirmed the wonderful relationship between USA and Panama. I think this is where I return to the other 'landmines'. Post-Occupation Leftovers and Legacies I have been meaning to take pictures of the signs that run along the main road from Gatun Locks (Panama Canal) to the community of Pina, where one of our missions is located. I first came upon the signs a year ago, while I was chasing my favourite Panama butterfly - the Blue Morpho butterfly. It flew off in the bush with me in hot pursuit like a camera happy tourist gushing at its beauty. Enthralled, I almost ran into a rusting yellow sign. I could make out the danger symbol and momentarily forgot my butterfly chase. MUNICIONES NO DETONADO jumped out at me from the sign. (Gulp) OOps. Even my rusty Spanish could handle that one. Nevertheless, I shouted for translation help to my companions in the bus. A rapid response came, ""No! Don't go any further. There are active landmines in the bush. Leave that butterfly and come if you want to remain in one piece."" I was not about to argue with that English translation! Mourning Lest We Forget Those signs have been bothering me since. Even moreso, the allegations that indeed persons have been maimed and killed in the bush by leftover ammunition  planted during the time of US military operations in Panama. I have since come across this report in the Landmine Monitor on the situation in Panama. While there seems to be no active landmines per say, there is enough undetonated explosives left in the ground to put many lives in extremely poor neighbourhoods at risk. The report says, UXO contamination in Panama is limited to three former US military bases along the Panama Canal, which are said to still contain a total of around 110,000 pieces of UXO.[15] According to a UN 2002 report, approximately 3,250 hectares of land (32.5 square kilometers) in the Piña, Balboa West and Emperador areas are contaminated, putting more than 100,000 individuals in 81 communities at risk.[16] I am saddened by those signs and what it reminds me of. Imagine the Panamanians; especially those in Costa Abajo. After 18 years, Panamanians choose mourning as the appropriate way to remember December 20, 1989. There are those who would want to forget or erase it from their minds. Many are still tormented by their inability to move on without knowing the truth of what happened to their relatives who went missing. Still others are diligently seeking to uncover the truth and press for justice in Panama."
18,Witness to History... again!,politics," Last year in December, I was on my way to the bank when I witnessed history in the making. The streets were cordoned off by police and thousands and thousands of people of all races and nationalities were flooding the streets. My bank is on the same block as the Apollo Theater in Harlem, New York City. I witnessed thousands who came out to pay respects to the late James Brown, The ""Godfather of Soul"" music. James Brown's body, had been placed in a gold casket, and was being driven through the streets of New York City to the Apollo Theater in a white, glass-encased horse-drawn carriage. It was a magnificent sight to behold. I was a lucky witness to history. On Monday, I was a lucky witness to history, again. I was out for a walk, coming over the Madison Ave Bridge which stretches from the Bronx and into Manhattan. I love to walk over the bridge. Off to one side of the bridge you can see the ""House that Ruth Built"", Yankee Stadium (now partially obscured by the construction of the new Yankee Stadium). Off to the other side of the bridge, you get a sweeping panoramic vista of New York City and an unobstructed view of the mighty Empire State Building, a truly spectacular sight. As I come off of the bridge I can see across the street, in front of the Chase bank, about 5 police cars blocking off the street and a crowd of onlookers. My first thought was that the bank must have just been robbed and I started to cross the street, wanting to stay out of the way of any potential trouble. But my curiosity got the better of me and I ambled into the crowd to see what was going on. Standing in front of the bank was none other than Congressman Charles B Rangel, (Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means and Chairman of the Board of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee). Congressman Rangel is the principal author of the five billion dollar Federal Empowerment Zone demonstration project to revitalize urban neighborhoods throughout America. At his side was the Honorable Percy E Sutton. (As a lawyer Percy Sutton seized his place in American history by fighting for civil rights with the NAACP and as the council for Malcolm X). Sutton, in the late 60's was The Manhattan Borough President. He co-founded the Inner City Broadcasting Corporation, which purchased WLIB-AM radio, making it the first Black-owned station in New York City. Sutton was a member of the delegation of leading American business people selected by U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown to represent the United States at the G-7 round table meeting on Telecommunications and High Technology. Percy Sutton was also the responsible party for the refurbishing and reopening the historic Apollo Theater in Harlem. Congressman Rangel was making a speech and announcing to the world an historic event... 5th Ave at 135th Street was being renamed ""Honorable Percy E Sutton Way"". A Black Man having a street named after him on prestigious 5th Ave in New York City. Once again I was a lucky witness to history in the making"
19,The Danger of Keeping Candidate Faith Under Wraps,politics," Exactly what does Mitt Romney's public address reveal about the significance of candidate disclosure of faith? The American electorate cannot be expected to buy into the myth that a candidate's faith will not influence their electability.  Platform and politics over prayer.  Spin over spirit.  Facts over faith.  The electorate needs to reconsider its position in the coming season of elections, especially as it votes for the next President of the United States.  The vote should not be political, the vote should be prayerful which means it will require faith. In so many ways, Governor Romney was cautious to say that his faith would not influence his decision-making process as President.  The question that must be asked is what, then, will his decision-making be influenced by?  Every American should demand an answer to that question.  Full and honest disclosure of every candidate's faith is fundamental to the democratic process.  It is not optional. A candidate's knowledge, as defined by education, experience, and intellect, is important.  But, it is what a candidate believes, as evidenced by their faith, that shapes the value system which will serve as the foundation for their ability to govern.  There must be an inherent level of integrity within each candidate that calls for an end to duality.  Any candidate that implies that their choices will not be influenced by their faith is deceived about what faith really is, and as a result, not worthy of a vote.  According to the old adage, stand for something or fall for anything.  It is not acceptable for any candidate to shirk their faith in an effort to win votes.  A candidate's faith must be the foundation upon which their candidacy rests, and if this is not the case, they are not fit to run the concession stand at the Friday night football game let alone a country. The American people deserve to know what every candidate believes.  The faith question must be answered by anyone who wants to see their name up in lights in November 2008.  The faith declaration must be made, honestly and openly, by every candidate.  Spin-free.  Why?  Because candidates are not robots despite the fact that they, oftentimes, seem to be.  Candidates are human.  Compartmentalizing will not prevent them from reacting out of their humanness; this will be particularly true in times of challenge.  In the times of personal or national crisis that are certain to ensue, the incumbent will not persevere because of what they know or how much experience they have had.  Their university, their party, and even their constituents will be unable to get them through.  The only force that any candidate will instinctively rely upon in times of tragedy and crisis will be the force of their faith, what they believe, their ideology.  Faith, then, should not be just an issue in the next Presidential election, it must be the issue that decides the next Presidential election."
20,16 Winston Churchill Quotes to Celebrate His Birthday,politics," Power, prominence and a bit of a rebellious nature thrown in -- Winston Churchill quotes are definitely some of the most interesting you'll ever come across. For someone who was said to have a speech impediment, his words and message definitely did not suffer. This month, as we celebrate his birthday, let's remember Sir Winston Churchill with these 16 quotes. ""A fanatic is one who can't change his mind and won't change the subject."" ""A prisoner of war is a man who tries to kill you and fails, and then asks you not to kill him."" ""Criticism may not be agreeable, but it is necessary. It fulfills the same function as pain in the human body. It calls attention to an unhealthy state of things."" ""There is no such thing as public opinion. There is only published opinion."" ""An appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile -- hoping it will eat him last."" ""Once in a while you will stumble upon the truth but most of us manage to pick ourselves up and hurry along as if nothing had happened."" ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" ""If you will not fight for right when you can easily win without blood shed; if you will not fight when your victory is sure and not too costly; you may come to the moment when you will have to fight with all the odds against you and only a precarious chance of survival. There may even be a worse case. You may have to fight when there is no hope of victory, because it is better to perish than to live as slaves."" ""If Hitler invaded hell I would make at least a favorable reference to the devil in the House of Commons."" ""A love for tradition has never weakened a nation, indeed it has strengthened nations in their hour of peril."" ""Never, never, never believe any war will be smooth and easy, or that anyone who embarks on the strange voyage can measure the tides and hurricanes he will encounter. The statesman who yields to war fever must realize that once the signal is given, he is no longer the master of policy but the slave of unforeseeable and uncontrollable events."" ""Never give in -- never, never, never, never, in nothing great or small, large or petty, never give in except to convictions of honor and good sense. Never yield to force; never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy."" ""The price of greatness is responsibility."" ""The farther backward you can look, the further forward you are likely to see."" ""Difficulties mastered are opportunities won."" ""It is a good thing for an uneducated man to read books of quotations."" So there you have it -- a glimpse inside the mind of an extraordinary man. Honor, courage, bravery -- think it's the stuff fairy tales are made of? Guess again. These 16 Winston Churchill quotes show us just how real they can be in the right man."

1,Pennsylvania's Single Payer Health Care Bill,politics," Pennsylvania is in a unique position. She has a Single Payer Health Care Bill, HB 1660, that has a great chance to eventually pass in the House. Of all the State sponsored bills, this one is the strongest. This is a solid bill, one Pennsylvanians can trust that insurance companies will be fully exempt from corrupting. Democracy For America promoted house parties across the country November 14, where thousands of people watched Sicko, then listened to a conference call with  film maker Michael Moore and DFA President Jim Dean for more than thirty minutes. Or if people were watching on the West Coast, they tuned into the conference call before they watched the DVD. In any case, a certain percentage of watchers had never seen the movie before, so Jim Dean and Michael Moore were careful not to divulge key movie points. I saw Sicko for the third time that night and thoroughly enjoyed watching it with my Progressives For Pennsylvania friends, a handful of union leaders, and a few liberals I grew up with in my hometown. The conference call itself was inspiring. Michael Moore was asked about state sponsored versus federally sponsored bills, and which did he support. For instance, John Conyers and Dennis Kucinich have a National Single Payer Health Care Bill, H.R.676. Moore said we need a National Single Payer bill, thus supported the Conyers/Kucinich bill. John Conyers has said he supports the bill here in Pennsylvania, HB 1660. Having said that, and given the current stranglehold on anything good coming out of Washington these days, I believe we have no choice but to develop a model Single Payer Health Care Bill that other States and eventually the Country are free to adopt. Another point in the call was how the propaganda machines like to stop all discourse on a real Universal Health Care Plan that covers all Americans minus Insurance Companies, by stating that such plans are Socialized Medicine. Michael Moore said Single Payer is not Socialized Medicine, but rather is Christianized, Krishna-ized, Mohammad-ized Medicine because of the impetus for caring for every citizen in America in a true spirit of service. The question arose about the supposed waits that people have in the Canadian health care system, (although Canadians in the movie told us that they really don't have the waits that the propaganda machines in this country want us to believe). Moore said that when 50,000,000 people are taken out of the health care equation, obviously our waiting times at the doctors, those of us with Health Insurance, will obviously be shortened. When we add the 50,000,000 people back into the system, yes, we will have longer waiting times. Isn't this preferable to making Health Care unavailable to so many millions of citizens? Governor Rendell of Pennsylvania has a Health Bill before the Pennsylvania House of Representatives called Prescription for Pennsylvania. This bill is losing support with only 8 sponsors as of this writing. HB 1660 currently has 35 sponsors. Why is HB 1660 superior to Prescription For Pennsylvania? HB 1660 guarantees health care protection for all Pennsylvanians thus delivering quality, comprehensive health care. Rendell's plan does not. HB 1660 takes Insurance Companies out of the equation. Rendell's plan does not. HB 1660 preserves the rights of patients to choose their own doctors with out deductibles, co-pays or life-time caps. Rendell's plan does not. HB 1660 allows for prescription drug and behavioral health care coverage. The Rendell plan does not. Alternative Medical Modalities are allowed in  the HB 1660 plan. Not so with Rendell's plan. A comprehensive comparison between the two plans can be accessed at: http://www.progressives4pennsylvania.com Progressives4Pennsylvania plans to create teaching workshops about HB 1660 and present these to Labor affiliated groups, retirement homes, small businesses and other potential arenas. Health Care For All Americans started with a vision that Pennsylvania birthed and now shares with the nation. John Edwards is the only candidate running for President who has a plan to deliver health care to all Americans without the interference of Insurance Companies. He needs Health Care Reform Activists to work with him. He cannot do it alone. And neither can we."
2,Boom!: Voices of the Sixties,politics," In 1962, I had an entry-level reporter's job at an Omaha television station. I had bargained to get a salary of one hundred dollars a week, because I didn't feel I could tell Meredith's doctor father I was making less. Meredith, who had a superior college record, couldn't find any work because, as one personnel director after another told her, ""You're a young bride. If we hire you, you'll just get pregnant before long and want maternity leave."" In retrospect, the political and cultural climate in the early Sixties seems both a time of innocence and also like a sultry, still summer day in the Midwest: an unsettling calm before a ferocious storm over Vietnam, which was not yet an American war. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was confronting racism in the South and getting a good deal of exposure on The Huntley-Brinkley Report on NBC and The CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite, the two primary network newscasts, each just fifteen minutes long. In the fall of 1963, first CBS and then, shortly after, NBC expanded those signature news broadcasts to a half hour. As a sign of the importance of the expansion, Cronkite and Huntley and Brinkley were granted lengthy exclusive interviews with President Kennedy. ABC wouldn't be a player in the news major leagues until the 1970s, when Roone Arledge brought to ABC News the energy and programming approach he had applied to ABC Sports. Kennedy, America's first truly telegenic president, was a master of the medium, fully appreciating its power to reach into the living rooms of America from sea to shining sea. During our time in Omaha, John F. Kennedy was not a local favorite. The city's deeply conservative culture remained immune to Kennedy's charms and to his arguments for social changes, such as civil rights and the introduction of government-subsidized medical care for the elderly. I'm sure many of my conservative friends at the time thought I was a card short of being a member of the Communist Party because I regularly championed the need for enforced racial equality and Medicare. One of the most popular speakers to come through Omaha in those days was a familiar figure from my childhood, when kids in small towns on the Great Plains spent Saturday afternoons in movie theaters watching westerns. Ronald Reagan looked just like he did on the big screen. He was kind of a local boy who had made good, starting out as a radio star next door in Iowa and moving on to Hollywood, before becoming a television fixture as host of General Electric Theater. Reagan's Omaha appearances were part of his arrangement with GE, which allowed him to be an old-fashioned circuit-riding preacher, warning against the evils of big government and Communism, while praising the virtues of big business and the free market. He was every inch a star, impeccably dressed and groomed. But those of us who shared his Midwestern roots were a bit surprised to find that although he was completely cordial, he was not noticeably warm. That part of his personality remained an enigma even to his closest friends and advisers throughout his historically successful political career. In Omaha the only time he lightened up in my presence was when I noticed he was wearing contact lenses and I asked him about them. He got genuinely excited as he described how they were a new soft model, not like the hard ones that could irritate the eyes. He even wrote down the name of his California optometrist so Meredith could order a pair for herself. (Later, when he became president, I often thought, ""He's not only a great politician, he's a helluva contact lens salesman."") President Kennedy also passed through Omaha, but only for a brief stop at the Strategic Air Command headquarters there. In those days, SAC was an instantly recognized acronym because the bombers it comprised -- some of which we could see because they were always in the air ready to respond in case of an attack -- were a central component of America's Cold War military strategy. More memorable for me was a visit to SAC by the president's brother Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. The younger Kennedy was a striking contrast to the president, who had been smiling and chatty with the local press and even more impressive in person than on television. Unlike the president, who was always meticulously and elegantly dressed, the attorney general was wearing a rumpled suit, and the collar on his blue button-down shirt was frayed. He was plainly impatient, and his mood did not improve when I asked for a reaction to Alabama governor George Wallace's demand that JFK resign the presidency because of his stance on school desegregation. Bobby fixed those icy blue eyes on me and said, as if I were to blame for the governor's statement, ""I have no comment on anything Governor Wallace has to say."" I was on duty in the newsroom a few weeks later when the United Press International wire-service machine began to sound its bulletin bells. I walked over casually and began to read a series of sentences breaking in staccato fashion down the page: Three shots were fired at president Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas . . . Flash -- Kennedy seriously wounded, perhaps fatally by assassin's bullet . . . President John F. Kennedy died at approximately 1:00 pm (CST). John F. Kennedy, the man I had thought would define the political ideal for the rest of my days, was suddenly gone in the senseless violence of a single moment. In ways we could not have known then, the gunshots in Dealey Plaza triggered a series of historic changes: the quagmire of Vietnam that led to the fall of Lyndon Johnson as president; the death of Robert Kennedy in pursuit of the presidency; and the comeback, presidency, and subsequent disgrace of Richard Nixon. On that beautiful late autumn November morning, however, my immediate concern was to get this story on the air. I rushed the news onto our noon broadcast, and as I was running back to the newsroom, one of the station's Kennedy haters said, ""What's up?"" I responded, ""Kennedy's been shot."" He said, ""It's about time someone got the son of a bitch."" Given the gauzy shades of popular memory, the invocations of Camelot and JFK as our nation's prince, it may be surprising to younger Americans to know that President Kennedy was not universally beloved. Now Kennedy was gone, and this man was glad. I lunged toward him, but another co-worker pulled me away.

3,Reasons Why People are Anti Bush,politics," George Bush has been one of the most controversial political figures of all time. He is the eldest son of the former president of the United States George Herbert Walker Bush, and is currently serving his second term in office. Bush won the election in 2000 in a controversial turn of events which seen him lose the popular vote but win the electoral vote. Here's a list of reasons why people hate George Bush: Before the September 11 attacks, George Bush is alleged to have given $43 million to the Taliban so that US oil companies could get access to their supplies. He supports the Patriot Act which, some claim, provokes fear and promotes patriotism as a means of making Americans give up their constitutional rights. Bush pulled America out of a global warming treaty, and has shown a lack of regard for any issues that relate to global warming. Bush has cut tax by $2 trillion. Sounds great? 43% of this goes to the wealthiest 1%. Some say that the pursuit of the American dream makes people back these policies. Others say that it is underhand and done by Bush as a favour to friends and a way to gain support from the nation's most powerful people. Bush has appointed right wing federal judges which are there to save his political aims say some. Bush halted international talks on biological and chemical weapons. Since doing this they have became more significant, especially with fears as to what role they will play in terrorist attacks. Bush refused to testify under oath to the 9/11 commission. To some, especially considering his religious stance, this appeared as though he had something to hide. After the United Nations was not willing to support the War in Iraq, Bush went ahead with it anyway. This was Bush going against his word, and also a sign that he was only willing to work as a team when everyone does what he says, according to some critics. Bush promised $15 billion for Africa however left it out of his budget. Some people have raised claims as to whether or not Bush wants Africa to ""get better"".  At the moment America is in competition with China, which has a massive trade surplus. Is it not likely that Africa, too, would have a healthy trade surplus if it gains economic momentum? Bush cut billions from the Veterans Administration Budget. Some say that this is a sign that Bush is willing to work his soldiers much harder than they have ever worked before but that they should not be paid fairly for it. Bush cut funding for finding renewable energy sources by 50%. Some critics point out that he has many friends and interests in oil companies. Bush has long been said to not support women as much as he should. Some say this case was strengthened when he opted to close the White House Office for Women's Health Initiative and Outreach . Bush has refused to release federal funding for stem cell research."
4,"Alternatives to Torture, 1",politics," We live in a tough old world. As a recent film tries to tell you, it's possible that you will be snatched off the street tomorrow by people you don't know, bound and gagged and flown off to some far-distant part of the world where you can be interrogated. Oh, all right, then, we'll tell the truth. You'll be tortured. Pain will be inflicted on you as a way of encouraging you to confess the crimes that you're planning, such as terrorist attacks on the Western world. This is all in the name of 'security', patriotism and anti-terrorism - all good stuff. If all goes well, you'll tell them what they need to know and lives will be saved. That is, if you are a terrorist. Things start going wrong if you aren't. Let's imagine, purely for the sake of argument, that you aren't a terrorist, haven't been and don't plan to be. You're strung upside down and people you don't know and haven't been properly introduced to are beating the soles of your feet with iron bars. They ask you questions, and you hesitate, because you know you don't have any answers. In fact, as soon becomes clear, these people are pretty sure they already know the answers to the questions they're putting to you  they just want you to confirm their suspicions. What do you do? At first you might figure they will come to their sense, realise you aren't a threat and let you go. If they don't seem willing to do that, you might come up with another plan: you'll admit anything they put to you. That way, at least they'll stop the pain. Of course they won't let you go either, but at least you might get a day in court and then you can plead your innocence. Trouble is, you've just admitted your guilt. Not to worry, you'll tell the court your story, tell them you only made an admittance so that they'd stop doing the bad things they were doing. So they might believe you. But they won't. The record shows that people who admit their guilt  such as the Birmingham Six in Britain in the 1970s  and then retract their forced confessions on the grounds it was beaten out of them - aren't believed later. So, torture works. At least, if you are the person aiming is to find someone to admit to being guilty. Like the Birmingham Six, you then have people you can blame for the bombing of civilians and the state can send them to prison and announce that justice has been done. In that case, unfortunately, as it emerged later, they got the wrong men. It took many years but it was later proved that they had nothing at all to do with the crime. The judges had to let them go. But why? Why were they in jail? Because they'd admitted they had done it. Why? Why would anyone admit they were guilty unless they were? Because they were smacked around for days, deprived of sleep and threatened. This, in a civilised country like England. In any other part of the world it would be called 'inhumane and degrading treatment', in other words, torture. Not here. We don't do torture in Britain,  (we say.) But we did once. It was back in the time of Shakespeare and shortly after. Then we tortured witches, regularly. We know they were witches because they admitted they were witches. That's why they were then killed, because of all the evil things they admitted to doing, like consorting with the Devil and flying around on broomsticks. Now here's the problem. No one does that sort of thing anymore, (at least, as far as we know). Oh sure, there are some people who call themselves White Witches and claim to mix potions and cast spells  but only to do good. So here's the issue: we live in a scientific age and think that talk of witchcraft is nonsense. No one can really fly around on a broom, (except in movies). But did they ever? If they did, then why can't we do it now? If they didn't  because it's impossible, we know  why did they ever say they did? We know they said they did, because we have the records. Why would people say such a thing? Well, one reason might be because they were routinely tortured. That's how our ancestors extracted the confessions. Maybe, just maybe, there never have been people who can fly or cast bad spells. But that means  well, that the people who said so were in fact lying, for some reason. In order to stop the torture, perhaps. In the modern world it's different. We know that terrorism exists, because we've seen it happen, and we know that terrorists are out there somewhere, planning it. The problem is, using torture, that we have no way of knowing  for sure  if the people who admit to it are being genuine, or lying, to save themselves pain. Ah, you say, but if only one life is saved - yes, well then, any amount of inflicted pain might seem justified. The problem with that is that we aren't being told if it's currently effective, for the sake of 'security'. Well, sorry, but that doesn't add up. If our side uncovered a terrorist cell because we had a spy in their camp, then no, we wouldn't want to reveal the source and so ruin their placement. But if we torture information out of a person? Well, then we already have them as a prisoner. It does no harm to reveal who they are and what they've alleged, does it? So we should be seeing spy cells broken and terrorists arrested. Regularly. Why aren't we? There could be one simple reason. Maybe the sad fact is that not a bit of useful information is coming from torturing detainees at this present time. The truth might possibly be that doing torture in the modern world is merely 'busy work', making it look as though we're fighting the threat of terrorism without actually doing anything useful   such as catching the real bad guys, perhaps by intelligent means. After all, if we could do that, we wouldn't need to torture anyone, anymore. Is that an alternative?"
5,Technology and Politics; The Internet's Influence on Politics,politics," Can, and will, the next generation of politicians exploit the communication mediums available to them? Will the new communication mediums have the power to influence public opinion? Will politicians be the victims of technology, or will they use it to their benefit? Will one party benefit from the use of the technology more than another? All reasonable questions, considering the role technology plays in today's society. The staggering distribution numbers, through channels like iTunes, YouTube, or podcasting websites, indicate that technology could play a critical role in the upcoming elections. Technology could be the deciding factor in the 2008 US Presidential race, and while distribution has never before been as accessible as it is to today's politicians and political candidates, politicians have far less control over the news and media than their counterparts in previous years. The curious need not look any further than YouTube to find the latest political constituents being haunted by their own words and dogged by their past missteps. Today's politicians have far less control of the news media and messages associated with their candidacy. The Internet and technology is positioned to play a huge role in elections. Whether that truly occurs remains to be seen. What Will Technology Affect? Fundraising Raising revenue for a political campaign is one of the biggest hurdles the candidates have to overcome in order to make a successful political run. We saw this when Howard Dean initially soared to fame as the result of grass roots Internet donations filling his coffers. Yet technology was also Dean's downfall, as the result of the ""Dean Scream"" video getting excessive play time on the Internet and other broadcast media outlets. The recorded spectacle is said to be what led voters to abandon this overzealous candidate. The Power Of Political Pundits With podcasting, everyone is a journalist, regardless of their credentials or credibility. Technology has given self-proclaimed political pundits a pulpit from which they can spread their message. How much these political pundits will be able to influence political campaigns and election results is still unclear. Never Say Never Political videos of nearly every 2008 presidential candidate can be found on YouTube. In many of the posted videos, candidates are engaged in old speeches, contradicting their current political positions. Politicians have yet to learn that their words may come back to haunt them, and it appears that many politicians have ghosts from years past that can be found in the YouTube video library. Older political videos are causing problems for candidates whose positions have changed over the course of their careers. The accessibility of the audio and video clips, and wide media distribution, is breeding distrust amongst voters who support candidates who have had a change of heart. Pushing A Cause To The Forefront Evident in the hit movies ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" by liberal filmmaker Michael Moore, and ""An Inconvenient Truth"" by environmental evangelist Al Gore, these films not only brought in millions of dollars in revenues, but both movies also received Hollywood accolades and raised attention for the issues featured. Technology appeals to a specific demographic: the affluent, the educated, and the young. And while a YouTube video may not sway the Grandparents in the crowd, the youngest voters are listening. Does technology have the power to change the face of politics? The youth in America are not currently an active voting block, but that younger generation will age, and it's only a matter of time before technology plays a critical role in elections."
6,Biography of Hillary Rodham Clinton,politics," Hillary Dian Rodham was the first born child to Dorothy and Hugh Rodham on October 26, 1947. She spent her childhood in Park Ridge Illinois. It was a happy and disciplined childhood. As a child, she loved visiting church and playing sports. She was also a member of the National Honor Society and a Student leader. Dorothy and Hugh Rodham always encouraged her to study hard and take up a career of her own interest. She studied at Wellesley College. Here, she combined excellence with school government she wanted to practice politics and make all that was impossible, possible. Hillary entered Yale law school in 1969. Here, she served as the Board of Editors of Yale Law Review and Social Action. She mixed well with Marian Wright Edelman, Children’s advocate. This resulted in her, meeting with Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton often remembers that meeting in the library when she came up to him and said ""If you are going to keep staying at me, I might as well introduce myself"". Thereafter, the two became inseparable. After completing graduation, Hillary joined the impeachment inquiry staff and advised the Judiciary committee of the House of Representatives. Earlier she advised the children’s Defense fund in Cambridge. After completing these responsibilities she went to Arkansas. Here, Bill has already begun his political career. Hillary married to Bill Clinton in 1975. Thereafter she joined the faculty of the University of Arkansas law school in 1975 and then the Rose Law Firm in 1976. In the year 1978, she was appointed to the board of the legal services corporation by President Jimmy Carter. Bill became governor of Arkansas. Hillary gave birth to a beautiful girl in 1980. She was named Chelsea. Hillary served as Arkansas’s first lady for twelve years. She perfectly balanced the family, public service and law. She worked for the Arkansas educational standards committee and founded the ‘Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families’. She also served on the boards of the Arkansas children hospital, legal services and the children’s defense fund. It was very difficult but Hillary pursued her job of balancing both private and public service well. The turning point in her life was the year 1993 when the president asked her to chair the Task Force on National health care reform. She pursued successfully as a leading advocate for expanding health insurance coverage. She took special care that children are immunized properly and also raised public awareness about health issues. She also wrote a weekly newspaper column with the title ""taking it over"". It emphasized on her own experiences as first lady and her close observations of women, children and families she met across the globe She also wrote a book entitled ‘it takes a village and other lessons children teach us’ in 1996 was a best seller. She also received a Grammy award for her recording of it. She won admirers due to her great support for women across the globe and her commitment to various issues on children."
7,Tatar Jihad against Russia & the Russian Conquest (1200-1953),politics," This article offers the complete history of the military conquests between the Slavic Russians and the Islamic Tatar Jihad in Russia around modern Ukraine. The article also offers the history of the later returning military expulsion and massacre of the Muslims there by the returning Slavs of Russia from 1200 onward, especially under Stalin's sociopolitical policies. The region of the Crimea (today the southern tip of Ukraine) has acted for nearly a millennium as the buffer zone between the west and north (the Slavic Christian world), and the east and south (the Islamic Turkic world). This geographic volatility has caused the region of modern Ukraine and the Crimea to change hands between various Turkic Islamic (Tatar) armies and those of growing European empires. The endless ethnic conflict between the Turkic peoples and the Slavs (which continues today), as well as the war between the the Slavs' Christian colonial conquest and the Islamic Jihad, are all epitomized in the Crimea and the Eurasian steppes. Before the Mongol invasion of the 13th century, Central Asia west of Mongolia was populated by Sunni Muslim Turkic peoples collectively and derogatorily called ""Tatars"" (though today the Tatars themselves have embraced this heritage) who settled in modern Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, the eastern Volga, and southern Siberia. The Tatar Turks were famed for their efforts to raid civilian Christian caravans, though this is probably exaggerated and biased; nonetheless, the Tatars were famed for their corporal will, Islamic piety, and equestrian military prowess. The Tatars were disunited tribal confederations who spoke a language in the Turkish family (today called Tatar), and adhered to the Turkish culture and Islamic faith, as they were of the Turkish race. The Mongol conquest conquered the many Turkic tribes in Central Asia along with the Russian Slavs to the west as part of history's most massive contiguous empire. Instead of simply looting his subjects (and indeed more than 30,000,000 non-Mongol civilians were slaughtered by the Mongols in their short-lived empire), he exploited the equestrian skills of the Turkic peoples by creating vassalized nation-states throughout Central Asia to fuel their need for military regiments. The use of Turkic Muslims by the Mongol invaders is visible today as a legacy, as ethnic Turk nations in Central Asia include Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, whilst ethnic Mongol states include Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan; all are culturally and linguistically Turkic Sunni Muslims because of this heritage. The massive Mongol conquest -- largely with the use of Turkic Muslim soldiers -- forced millions of Slavs in their former unified Russian state of Kievan Rus to flee to the west. These Turkic Tatars settled in these formerly-Russian lands of modern Ukraine and the Volga, having secured a new Turkic empire after the victorious Jihad against the Christian Slavs. The Russian state had been obliterated, its land replaced by Islamic Mujahidin Turks. With the quick collapse of the Mongol Empire into a huge variety of successor states in China, Mongolia, Central Asia, Iran, and central Russia, the Tatar Muslims were divided into a number of ""hordes"" such as the Blue and White Hordes -- all united under the banner of Sunni Islam. The broken Russian Christian Slavs were busy rallying against invading Teutonic Knights of the German Empire, and gradually worked to coalesce together in the face of constant post-Mongol Jihad, though it would not be until the 16th century that the Slavs began to create a unified Russian empire as a world superpower free of Islamic fighters. By 1300, the warring Turkic Muslim hordes and their Mongol leaders had coalesced into a unified state of Central Asian Turks, merging the Blue and White Hordes into the Golden Horde first under Berkei Khan. The new superpower -- whose leaders remained ethnic Mongol Shamanist or Buddhist and their population ethnic Turkish Muslims -- quickly annexed excluded Turkic states, engaged in a bloody and brutal Jihad against Christian Russian states, against the Byzantine Greeks, against Poland, and against Lithuania and Hungary. By 1400, the Golden Horde stretched from eastern Poland to East Turkestan (western Mongolia), and from Siberia to northern Turkmenistan. By the reign of sultan Uzbeg Khan ('2('J:), whose reign ushered in the Golden Horde's golden age, the non-Turkic leaders of the post-Mongol states had formally adopted Sunni Islam as the compulsory religion of all their citizens with the penalty of death. The role of the ethnic Mongol elite gradually collapsed, and the Tatar Muslim population more and more gained authority. With the forced establishment of Islam as the state faith of all Turkic peoples & Tatars, the role of Jihad came to the fore in the many wars against the Christian Slavs of Poland, Lithuania, Hungary, and Russian states. The Golden Horde's conquest and expulsion of the Slavic Christians in modern Ukraine and the Crimea forced millions of Christians to flee to central Europe, causing Slavic states and Hungary in the Balkans to experience a golden age. The Turks of modern Turkey had already entered Anatolia (where Turkey today lies) to the south, where their Jihad expelled the Greek Byzantine settlers in the wake of their mighty horseback armies. The advanced military tactics of the powerful Golden Horde caused millions to suffer death under the blade of their Jihad, making the Golden Horde one of the wealthiest, advanced, and powerful states in Eurasia. The Christian Slavs, expelled from Ukraine (Ruthenia) and the Volga, were far too weak following the Mongol conquest to offer uniform resistance to re-establish their Slavic native statehood. The Golden Horde suffered a gradual decline towards its end, and its mortal blow was not dealt by revolting Christians nor a uniform Christian crusade, but rather ironically by an awesome Mongol Muslim general to the south. The ethnic Mongol (Uzbek) Sunni Muslim Timur-i-Leng of the Timurid Empire (centered in Uzbek Samarqand and Shi'ia Iran) worked to expand one of the world's greatest empires by slaughtering the Horde's largest armies and burning the Tatar capital. More than 10,000,000 Jews, Christians, and Muslims died under Timur's Jihad, making Samarqand (modern Mongol Uzbekistan) one of the world's most glorious and wealthy cultural centers. The conquest in the 1450s by the Tatars' Muslim rivals caused the Tatar Golden Horde to collapse into civil war, ultimately creating a schism between more than 6 regional sultanates and emirates. One of these breakaway states was that of the Crimean Emirate (or Khanate) to the south of the Russian/Ukrainian Slavs centered along the Crimean peninsula. This is the genesis of the split between the culturally-Turkic Uzbeks, Turkmen, Kazakhs, etc. The collapse of the Islamic Tatar Jihad in civil war allowed the Slavic Ruthenians (Ukrainians), Lithuanians, Poles, and Russians to expand and dominate, causing a golden age in all of the Slavic world. Moskva's (Moscow) Russian kings Ivan the Great and Ivan the Terrible expanded Moscow to include nearly a dozen warring ethnic-Russian states (especially Novgorod, Tver, Pskov, and Yaroslavl) in the new Russian Empire. Ivan the Terrible conquered Tatar Astrakhan and Kazan (modern Tatarstan in Russia), foreshadowing a permanent decline of Islam and the triumph of Orthodoxy. The Muslims were expelled from Slavic lands, and Islam was banned. The new Russian state, which included Ukrainians (but not the Tatar Islamist Crimea to the south) soon stretched from the Arctic to the southern Volga. The hegemony wrought by Islam was quickly replaced by the hegemony of the Christian Slavs, whose colonial conquest eventually conquered more than 60,000,000 Muslims -- nearly all of the Muslims of Central Asia, the Crimea, and the Caucasus. An ironic reversal of the social military history of Eurasia. The post-Golden Horde emirate of the pre-Slavic Crimea of modern Ukraine functioned thereafter as an independent staunch Islamic Tatar state whose Jihad against the Christian kingdoms continued until its eventual destruction. The wealthy trade of the Black Sea coast allowed this relatively small Mujahidin (""Jihadist"") state to thrive. The population became known as Crimean Tatars to distinguish from ethnic Turkic Tatars elsewhere in Central Asia. The Crimea, previously inhabited by Slavic Russians and Ruthenians (Ukrainians) before the Mongol conquest, were now instead Turkic Muslim after the conquest and expulsion of the Golden Horde. The emirate of the Tatars also was able to thrive due to frequent and stable trade alliances with the Turkish Ottoman Empire, the Turkmen horde, the Noghai, and other Tatar states based upon common race and Sunni Muslim faith. But the expansive efforts of the European superpowers and colonial kingdoms marked the end of Tatar power in the pre-Slavic Crimea. The Genoese Catholic Italians colonized Kaffa, modern Yalta, and Azow in the middle 15th century. The Russians had conquered nearly all of Siberia, the Volga, and the Ukrainian steppe, effectively cutting off the sociopolitical link of the Crimean Tatars to their Muslim allies expelled by the Russians. A Christian (Genoese) presence in Turkic Tatar Crimea infuriated their Turkish Ottoman brothers, who promptly invaded the Crimea to save the righteous from the infidels invading from the north. The Crimean Tatars and their emirate became vassals of the Ottomans by the end of the 15th century. Turkish support of their Tatar brethren allowed the Tatar Jihad to continue, and independence of the Crimea from the Christian Russians was retained until the late 18th century. The brilliant military and political genius of the Swedish czarina of Russia, Katherina the Great, as well as the increasing decline of the Ottomans allowed the Russian superpower (the world's largest empire) to annex the Tatar Crimea from the Ottomans and the Crimean Emirate in 1783. Cut off from Turkish aid and now ruled by the Russians, the Islamic heritage and faith of the Tatars was quickly banned, their mosques burnt (among them some of the oldest in Central Asia), and millions of Tatars all across southern Russia slaughtered or expelled. Tens of thousands of those who survived fled their homes to the Ottoman Empire or Shi'ia Iran (where thousands were additionally slaughtered as infidels for being Sunni) to escape European persecution and to retain submission to Allah instead of convert to the unclean faith of the invaders. Their traditions were marginalized, their women's veils and headscarves banned, Islam forbidden, their language outlawed, and treated as second-class citizens based upon their non-Russian race as Turks (forever the enemy of the Slavs, as seen above). Nonetheless, thousands of Tatars remained in Russian political land and in the Crimea for several centuries until today. The Crimea and its northern frontiers, previously ethnic Slav and then replaced entirely by Turkic Tatar, was once again almost entirely Slavic Ukrainian and Russian once again. Russia would expand to conquer the Uzbek, Kazakh, and other Mongol Muslim tribes in Central Asia by the 1900 under the Alexandrian reign. The Crimea remained as such until the Communist revolution, when the ethnopolitical situation became complicated. The overthrow of the Russian Empire by the Bolsheviks forced Russia out of the war. A result of the Brest-Litovsk Pact (through which Russia escaped the war) effectively cemented the declaration of independence of non-Slavic Estonia, Latvia, Finland, as well as Slavic Poland, Ukraine, and Lithuania. The fact that some ethnic groups or nations achieved independence but others did not incited the Islamic cultures under Russian rule to seek independence, including the Azerbaijani Shi'ia Turks and the Tatars of Russia. The appointment of Premier Joseph Stalin as absolute leader of the Soviet Union spelled the reversal of their independence hopes. The invading Axis powers (Germany, Finland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, etc.) were surprised to find a faithful ally in the Jihadist Tatars, who joined the German SS (Schutzstaffel) and volunteer legions by the hundreds of thousands. The Muslim Tatars hoped to gain independence via their aid to the Fascists, and the leaders of both sides found a natural bond between the Jihadists and the National Socialists due to a mutual hatred for Jews, Communists, as well as the common rejection of Allied secularism and atheism. After the war and the ascension of the Soviet Union to world geographic supremacy, Joseph Stalin expelled virtually every single Muslim, Tatar, and Turk to Kazakhstan -- along with the Volga Germans -- for their collective treacherous anti-Soviet support for the enemy Fascists. The Tatars, once again, were expelled from their homelands in the Eurasian steppes and in the now-Slavic Crimea. Tens of thousands of others were either executed or sent to gulags for mass forced labor in Uzbek camps or in Siberia in southern Russia. Retaliatory reprisals or Jihad by the expelled Muslims was impossible against an enemy that was responsible for the destruction of even the Axis in its entirety. After the death of Stalin in 1953 and the gradual liberalization of the USSR under Mikhail Gorbachev (and especially the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union), the Muslim Turks, Tatars, and Mongol (Uzbeks, Kazakhs, etc.) cultures were allowed to return to what remained of the Soviet Union. Crimean Tatars returned to the Crimea of the Ukrainian SSR, and Volga Germans fled the Kazakh SSR to West or East Germany based upon ethnic grounds. Such remains today: the now-Slavic Crimea of independent Ukraine is almost entirely Slavic with a tiny minority of Tatars. Officially, only .5% of Ukraine is of the Turkic Tatar race (Source: CIA World Factbook). The endless ethnic, social, and religious conflict between European Christian cultures and the Jihad of Islamic ones is epitomized in the region of the Crimea, where Christendom was destroyed by the blade of the superior Mujahidin, who successively were destroyed by the Slavs once again."
8,History of Yugoslavia (1918-2007),politics," Below is a brief walkthrough of the history of Yugoslavia from its roots as the post-WWI Kingdom of Jugoslavija, to the division of the Jugoslavs over support for Fascism or socialism, to the foundations of a dictatorial socialist power after World War II, until the total decay and collapse under the Serbian regime of Milosevic. Kingdom of Jugoslavija, division during World War II, & the Republic of Jugoslavija: In the 15th century, the awesome Jihad of the Ottoman Turks plunged the blade of Islam into the heart of the Balkans, conquering Albania, what is now Greece, Slavic Bulgaria, Romania, Macedonia, Bosnia, Serbia, and had pushed Hungary and Croatia to their knees. This rule -- along with its often forced mass conversion and compulsory conscription in Istanbul's Janissary elite -- continued for nearly 400 years. To save the Slavic and Hungarian Christians from the Jihad, the massive German empire of Habsburg Austria annexed Bosnia, Slovenia, Croatia, Czechia, Slovakia, and Hungary. Serbia freed itself on its own from Islamic conquest after two brutal wars with German and Hungarian support. These South Slavs (Bosnians, Serbs, Croats, Slovenes, and Macedonian Serbs) united under common ethnic and cultural nationalism under the increasingly socially-unstable Austrian Empire. In 1918, with the closure of the war, the Treaty of Trianon forced Austria's and Hungary's forfeiture of nearly all of their land. Czechia and Slovakia (later merged as Czechoslovakia), Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, and Hungary became independent, and Serbia retained its independence throughout the war. These South Slavs quickly rallied under the banner of their common Slavic racial and cultural heritage behind the Serbian kingdom led by King Piotr I; in 1918, the Kingdom of Jugoslavija was announced after its name changed from the ""Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, & Slovenes"" comprising Serbia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Slovenia, Croatia, and Serbian Macedonia and Kosovo -- all centered at Serbia. This was not a socialist state, but rather a monarchical dictatorship. Again, to learn the exclusive complete historical and cultural relation between these Slavic Serbs, Bosnians, and Croats from 900 until today, read this article. In World War II, Jugoslavija was conquered by Axis Hungary, Germany, Italy, Romania, and Bulgaria. The broken kingdom became split between the political worldviews of Fascist National Socialism and socialism or Communism. The destroyed kingdom was now a warground between socialist rebels like Marshall Broz ""Tito"" and Fascist sympathizers. Most Croats welcomed the Fascist invasion as a solution to Communist overthrow; Croatia became an ally of the Third Reich under the government of Ante Pavelic. Tens of thousands of Bosnian Muslims (having converted as a generally-forced result of the Turkish Jihad) joined the Nazi SS elite (Schutzstaffel) due to mutual opposition of Jews, Communists, and Allied liberalism and atheism. The radical Islamist muftiy cleric of al-Quds (Jerusalem) offered support for the Axis and the Bosnian Muslim SS in their war against so-called ""world Jewry"" of the Allies, as he foresaw the coming creation of a Jewish state in previously-Arab Palestine. By the end of World War II, when it became apparent that liberalism of the West and Communism of the East would triumph, most Croats and Jugoslavs switched to support for a socialist ideal with support of the Soviet invaders. Under the banner of socialism, the Federal People's Republic of Jugoslavija was declared in 1944 when the Germans were withdrawing to fight the invading Americans and Soviets on both fronts. This was a socialist dictatorship centered in Serbia but with relative autonomy for each of its constituent republics: Croatia, Macedonia, Bosnia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Slovenia. This socialist state thrived as a relatively peaceful state free of the Soviet Union's endless wars. Tito became a national hero despite being a dictator, as remains today. Tito set aside political disputes between Serbs and Croats, etc., and treated the South Slavs with relative equality via cultural and ethnic ultranationalism (unlike Milosevic, which caused the nation's downfall), but was far from the equality of the West: Albanian Muslims, Gypsies, and many Jews were treated as anti-social opponents to the states and either killed, expelled, or disenfranchised; Jugoslavija was a socialist Slavic dictatorial state only. Wars of Independence/Breakup following Tito's death: Near the death of the charismatic leader Tito, broad corruption, overspending, and infrastructural and economic decline became disastrous. As the Jugoslav government was centered at Serbia, ""equal"" constituent republic Slavic peoples affixed more and more blame to the self-interested and corrupt Serbs. Tito's death in 1980 exploited the hardships between these Slavic peoples. Jugoslavija was on the verge of collapse. To alleviate the economic hardship and to prevent internal schism, Serbia embraced a militant and expansionist policy, bolstering its strength via force and centralized Serb control. This had the opposite effect: constituent republic Slavic peoples saw this as Serbs taking more control than before for their own already-corrupt self-interest. As Serbia declined, other states therein also considered themselves drained by Serb economic decline, especially the coastal states of Croatia and Montenegro, who were often forced to send their exclusive port supplies and trade goods to the corrupt Serb elite to the east. In 1997, Slobodan Milosevic ascended to power as the president of Jugoslavija, but instead of embracing union and stability, focused on continued Serb centralization to alleviate internal dispute. One of the biggest problems was the violent Albanian Muslim minority in Kosovo and throughout the empire, who frequently fought for statehood (independence) via Jihad and terrorism especially under the Kosovo Liberation Army's Mujahidin (Jihadists). This is the source of Milosevic's and the Serbs' perceived slaughter and war crimes of the Albanian minority. In 1999, the decline had become too apparent. The Ten-Day War for Slovene independence saw a short but bloody war by the Serbs to reinforce their political right to prevent internal schism by ""traitor peoples"". Croatia followed suit in the Croatian War of Independence, a horrific and bloody war in which thousands on both sides were killed, slaughtered, and displaced, leading to American claims of war crimes on both sides (despite this, Croat ""war criminals"" are today treated generally as cultural heroes). The war raged from 1991-1995. Bosnia followed suit in 1992 for its independence war, leading to a great deal of violence for both parties, especially due to Jugoslavs' hatred for the Bosnian Muslim minority that converted as a result of the Ottoman Jihad. In 1992, the new state of Macedonia broke from Serbia (though it was politically a separate state) for the first time with almost no violent resistance due to its uselessness. By 1992 Jugoslavija was no more than de facto Serbia-Montenegro, though this would not be entirely apparent and recognized by the Serbs until 1995 or even later. The Muslim revolt of the Albanian terroristic minority in Serbia's Kosovo region -- as well as claims of war crimes in the revolting regions of Croatia and Bosnia -- caused the supporting US to bomb Serbia for several weeks via NATO. Eventually, as is retained today, the US exerts authority and political control of Kosovo via the UN, and supports independence for the volatile Islamic region despite the brutal rejection of Serbs, Russians, and much of Europe overburdened with Albanian Muslim immigration and crime. The overwhelming expenses and casualties endured by Serbia, US and NATO bombing, corruption, and total bankruptcy caused a new Serb (Jugoslav) regime to be elected by the end of 1999, when Milosevic was turned over to the US (NATO) for trial in the International Criminal Court for alleged (and reportedly true) slaughter of Croatian, Bosnian, and Albanian [rebelling] civilians during the many wars the Balkans have suffered from 1991-2000. As it quickly became apparent that the concept of ""Jugoslavija"" was entirely meaningless as it referred now to no more than Serbia and Montenegro, a new name was adopted for the personal union of the two as ""Serbia & Montenegro"". Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia-Montenegro, Slovenia, and Macedonia were now all independent states. In 2006, further, Montenegro of post-Jugoslav Serbia-Montenegro resolved its political weakness in Serb politics (due to its tiny comparative size) by declaring independence, effecting the schism between Serbia and Montenegro; Jugoslavija had ended for good. Kosovo's Islamic Albanian independence wars: Albanians were once culturally-Slavic tribes occupying the hills of modern Albania. When the Jihad of the Turks came, they coalesced for the first time into their own state with a bizarrely-unique language formed due to isolation under the Christian hero Skanderbeg. The revolt failed, and within 200 years of forced conversion, over 70% of Albanians had converted to Islam. Their own kingdom under King Zogu after 1912 (having been liberated by Serbia, Bulgaria, and Western European allies) collapsed into Communism under charismatic and still-hero dictator Enver Hoxha, who seemed to apply a backward yet fully stable Communist state unlike most others. Outside of Communist Albania, however, Albanian Muslims are famous burdens for Greeks, Slavs, Germans, Italians, and other host nations where they are almost universally hated for poor academics, crime, rebellion, and southern Europe's primary source of terrorism and Jihad. Their violent Jihad against the Serbs (previously Jugoslavija) from 1990-today has left tens of thousands dead on both sides. Serbia suppressed the Jihad uprising of the Kosovo Liberation Army by what the UN and US call the genocide of innocents. For this reason, the US/UN-controlled Kosovo region (after Clinton's bombings throughout 1995-1999), where most inhabitants are ethnic Albanian Muslims, fights violently against the ethnic Serbs via terrorism and Jihad for independence, which the US supports. Nearly all Serbs in Kosovo have fled their homes to avoid persecution and murder by the Albanian Muslims, or so is feared. The US has also welcomed tens of thousands of Albanians fleeing from Kosovo under claims of asylum, where a minority actually continue the Jihad against Europe and America as seen in 2007 in the foiled Albanian terrorist attack on America's Fort Dix military base. To read the EHA's exclusive first-hand social and cultural profile of Muslim Albania from my exclusive vacation to the scarcely-toured nation, read this article. As no independence has been achieved, and the oppressive and genocidal Serbs (as they claim) still dominate the Albanian Kosovars, the US is fighting strongly to force Serbia ultimately to forfeit nearly half its land to those they and many Europeans perceive as Jihadist terrorists. Russia and Serbia officially, as well as the Slavic and Greek public reject the independence of the Albanians. This has led to a major dispute between the US and southern and eastern Europe over the Albanians' independence movement.  In May of 2007, the United States announced that the Islamic region could be given full freedom by ""the end of the month."" The radical far-right Serbian government, elected by the public largely for this very reason, firmly reject the movement. The US and its EU allies is encouraging Serbia to forfeit some 30% of its land with the lure that it will profit from EU membership and American trade."
9,History of Italy & Western Europe: from Roman rule to Germanic,politics," This essay is twofold: firstly, a thorough historical background into the internal decline and external conquest of the Roman empire by ""barbarian"" Germanic, Hunnish, and Slavic peoples, and the shift of historical control and advancement of Europe from Italian to Germanic peoples. Secondly, a first-hand look at the ancient Roman and Germanic Gothic capital of Ravenna Decline and Conquest of the Roman Empire, or the Germanic Political Annexation of Roman Western Europe: By 100CE, the Romans had exerted authority over a domain stretching from the southern moors of Scotland to Iberia, from Dacia (Romania) to Jordan, and from the Greek city-states to Algeria. Despite ruling nearly all of the known world, the Romans were never able to conquer two enemies: the reborn Zoroastrian Iranian state under the Parthian and Sassanid dynasties, and the Germanic ""barbarian tribes"" and confederations to the north. The military invincibility of the Romans ended in embarrassing disaster in 9CE when several Roman legions marching into central Germania were butchered and sent back to Rome after the German cultural hero Hermann (in Latin ""Arminius"") united Germanic military confederated states and tribes into a cultural defensive front against the coming Romans. They never were able to press further. Other peoples outside of ""barbarian Germania"", however, quickly fell victim to the military, economic, and political supremacy of the Romans for the next several hundred years The period of 200-500CE were a period of gradual decline, schism, internal dispute, pretending leaders, and perceived moral decay. The issue of immorality of the Roman people was allegedly so abhorrent that it encouraged the Roman historian Tacitus to travel to Germania in the late 1st century, where he portrayed the Germans in some way as a type of moral and political role model for the Romans. The Germans were portrayed as simple, honest, sexually and socially moral, not adulterous, religiously pious, well-disciplined, less advanced, and talented warriors. This may simply be the ""grass is greener on the other side of the fence"" phenomenon that was an attempt to explain a perceived political and moral decline in the Roman empire, or may be true. Nonetheless, a gradual political, social, and moral decline was detected by the Romans in their own lands even whilst military expansion of Rome was at its height of this most magnificent empire that built much of Europe practically from nothing into advancement. In the early 4th century, a new and near mythified enemy emerged from the plains of the east. Whilst the Germans were deemed too unorganized to directly annex or assault the Romans (though they did both multiple times), this strange force was united under a common banner and leader wise with military and tactical advancement. These were the Hunnish tribes of Atli (or Attila). Their ethnic origin and linguistic roots are today debated. In reality, the steppes of Central Asia from Ukraine  and eastern pre-Slavic Poland to the borders of modern China and down to today's Armenia were populated by Iranian peoples called Sarmatians and Scythians. From 400 onward, Turkic peoples began to appear whilst the Iranians of Central Asia declined to insignificance (most dying or returning southward to their ethnic homeland of Sassanid Iran), expelled by the superior and unified hordes of the Turkic peoples. As the Huns meet this timeframe, it is appropriate to imply that the Huns were a pre-Islamic Turkic people with a Turkic-based or isolated language. Mongol people like the Uzbeks and Kazakhs entered Central Asia much later. These Huns were military geniuses well-versed in equestrian tactics. They soon became the triumphal power of Eurasia. Whilst the Romans were unable to conquer the Germans, the Huns quickly succeeded. The military conquest by the Huns of Central and Southern Europe (all of which the Germanic Gothic peoples previously exerted almost universal authority) triggered a migration known as the Age of Migrations. This caused Germans (who were the buffer between the invincible Huns and the Romans to the south) to not only move westward, northward, and southward, but also to coalesce, advance, and culturally and politically unify in the face of foreign annihilation. The Slavic peoples of Russia also began to move westward, also attacking the Romans on occasion. The Hunnish advance ended and declined quickly and stunningly after the death of Attila, but the legacy of their reign could not be reversed, all at the expense of the Romans. Within 100 years, the Germanic peoples (tribes, confederations, and states) had conquered, populated, and developed a variety of nations and states in Celtic England and Scotland, in Roman-ruled Iberia (Spain and Portugal), in modern France, in all of Germany, in nearly all of the Balkans and southern Europe, had conquered the rich trade city of Carthage in Tunisia, and had conquered most of northern Italy. The new growing superpower in western Europe -- the massive German empire of the Merovingians -- quickly annexed nearly all of France and Germany. Political decline and internal squabbling of the Romans, as well as the Hunnish invasion had quickly caused economic and political control over Europe to shift from the unified Roman empire into a number of non-unified ethnic Germanic-ruled states all across Europe. The Germans -- previously adherents of the religion of Odin, Thor, Tyr, and Baldr -- quickly began to convert to Christendom as a result of internal conversion by their leaders. The duty to spread the faith in Christ and the one true God also accelerated the unification and exertion of force of other previously-tribal Germans into full political states. In 476, the Gothic Germanic king Audawakar (Odoacer in Latin) formally destroyed the Roman Empire forever when he expelled and overthrew the last Roman emperor Romulus Augustus (ROMVLVS AVGVSTVS). This unfathomable triumph was eased by the reality that the Roman state was basically a dead horse for nearly a century prior due to as much internal decline as external conquest. The Roman Empire was in such decline, calamity, and bankruptcy that many Italian leaders and priests encouraged German invasion due to their ability to enforce widespread military authority and control over peoples on the brink of anarchy. The Germanic king Alarik the Great had previously taken Rome in the early 5th century temporarily, revealing that the former Roman superpower was practically in a state of collapse. After Audawakar's conquest, formerly-Roman ruled Italy was then ruled by several German Gothic nations-states. Before the murder of the Roman Empire, the capital had been moved from Rome to Milan, and then again south to Ravenna. This capital of Ravenna became the capital of the new Germanic kingdoms therein. By the 4th century, most of the German leaders had converted from Odinism and Tyrism (today called ""Norse Mythology"") to Arian Christendom, and many had shifted from writing in Runic to Latin-based script. Arianism is a type of heretical Christendom which dictates that Jesus and God cannot possibly be equal, a doctrine formally deemed incomprehensible by the Catholics and the Orthodox. By 500, a German king to the north called Theodoric the Great (Theidareik) of another Gothic kingdom near modern Slavic Slovenia and Croatia offered his service to the church in Italy, promising that he would unify and contain the various German kingdoms in Italy and protect the supremacy of the growing Papacy. Theodoric quickly conquered nearly all of the German nations in southern Europe (killing Odoacer with them), annexing all of Italy. Therefore, from his capital at Ravenna, Theodoric became King of Italy and King of the Goths, and the most powerful man in Western Europe. This domain was short-lived; the Byzantines returned to save their destroyed Roman partners' lands and conquered all of Italy under the glorious Greek (Byzantine) king Justinian I. This authority would soon also be supplanted as another German nation marched westward. These Germanic Lombarden (also Arian-faith Christians by majority) expelled the Greeks, ruling again from Ravenna until they were conquered by the Catholic German emperor Karl the Great (Charlemagne) of his Holy ""Roman"" Empire of the German Nation (heiliges roemisches Reich deutscher Nation) in the 9th century for the final period of German rule in Italy. The Greek superpower built by Alexander fragmented into pieces in under a decade before the Roman conquest, and the Roman empire that built much of Europe from nothing into commercial civilization had collapsed in a similar fashion, with its territory over all of Europe inherited by the ""barbarian"" German kings whom soon brought the collapsed domains of the long-dead Roman state into sociopolitical stability for the time being. This dramatic shift of authority over Europe appropriately inspired German philosopher Hegel to refer to the historical period from 500 onward as ""the Germanic Era"", as the creation of Western Europe's great powers England, France, the Holy Roman Empire (Germany), the Slavs' Kievan Rus, and the nexus of future Spain were all built under this post-Roman Germanic barbarian sword. This heritage was later, unfortunately, applied to the politics of the bloodthirsty Third Reich during World War II.  The ""barbarians"" had actually triumphed over Western Europe's superpower, uniting Europe with the offer of stability in the face of total collapse of the Roman economic state, the coming Islamic Jihad, the invasion of the Slavs, virtual anarchy, assaults by Turkic peoples, the threat of global revolutions to alleviate the political and economic instability. A dramatic twist of fate. First-hand look at the Roman and Gothic capital of Ravenna: Though his wealthy and thriving reign was short-lived in the Roman, Gothic German, and Byzantine regional capital of Ravenna, Theodoric built a number of fantastic and ancient treasures that make this tiny Italian city a historical gem, and one of the only remnants of anti-Trinity Christian (Arian) churches in Europe that survived Catholic and Orthodox persecution. Due to the constant international wars and regional conflicts that wrought Italy just after the Roman collapse, the exchange of authority over the region by dozens of nations, and brutal purges of Gothic and heretical Christian monuments, nowhere but in Ravenna can a historian or tourist experience the achievements of Gothic states with such preservation. The city of Ravenna today remains distinctly Italian -- as ethnic Germans have not held political authority here for nearly 800 years -- but offers a wide array of Roman, German, and to a lesser extent Byzantine monuments in all their glory, allowing a visitor to directly study this fascinating shift from Roman authority to Gothic, then to Byzantine, then again to German Lombard, and then finally back to the native Italians. This quiet, comfortable, and clean city (unusually so for an Italian big city) offers the chance to walk from a tomb built 1,000 years ago to a restaurant built yesterday, and to a church built 1,500 years ago, and to experience Greek, Italian, and German architecture in the same city. Its ancient loins and structures remain upright today with fantastic preservation, though many deemed 'heretical' were of course burnt or looted. Ravenna today is relatively clean with little graffiti, few cars, little crime, and a generally politically and socially conservative population in comparison with some of the local Communist-plagued cities in northern Italy like Bologna whose Communist youth have virtually crippled that once-great city's society and economy with graffiti on literally every wall of the city. The center of the city of Ravenna is notably old and ancient, whilst the outer expanded portions of the city are upright and modern. Cars are not allowed in some parts. The city of Ravenna, having been the former capital of so many regional conquering empires, takes great pride its treasures and history with signs to monuments all over the city. Tourist groups can be seen in Ravenna daily, usually ethnic Germans investigating their early ethnic heritage of the growing Germanic world empires. The city today is primarily Italian, but interestingly has quite a huge black immigrant population along with a smaller Arab minority. There are few black youths and few women; most are older and noticeably well-composed and well-dressed immigrants from Senegal, Nigeria, Niger, and Muslim black West Africa. The local Italians were keen to point out their distaste for the booming immigration to their city, and blame the immigrants for a sudden spike in drug abuse, unemployment, crime, and illiteracy which only increased after the immigrant influx. Some locals blame Arab Muslim immigrants for more of the problems in Ravenna because of their near-militant opposition to Italian politicians and authority, or so it is said by many locals. The blacks here appear to attempt integration (though the acceptance is not mutual with the Italians) in the sense that their clothing and dress is far from their Islamic roots of Muslim-dominated Wolof Senegal. The growth in social problems are, as in the rest of Europe, also blamed on the white Slavic Albanians and Romanians whom more and more are exploiting the open job market of the wealthier west. Each group is considered an economic and social drain, whether or not any of this clash is warranted or necessary. Many come from big cities here to work. Though there is far from general cultural tolerance between the two groups, this social clash is noticed by most of the immigrants who try hard to gain acceptance typically to no avail, a feature unheard of in Europe's big cities. There are few restaurants, but many bars, and gas stations offer a full selection of whisky and wine to one's surprise. A single fee paid at a historical center offers entry over the course of several days to all of the city's major historical sites on one pass. A five-minute walk down a few blocks of the city center reveal a horde of unique other churches, monasteries, and tombs. As Italians are a Catholic ethnic group, all of the city's churches have been firmly Catholic or converted from Arian Christendom (anti-Trinity or ""Messianic fallibility"" faiths) to Catholicism. There are a number of ""modern"" churches built around 1000 or 1400 for public entry, with Catholic chants playing from loudspeakers. This was very unusual for Christendom, and generally only experienced in Hindu or Islamic societies. A major monument in the city center commemorates the sacrifices of Italian soldiers in their many wars: the wars for unification of Italy under Giuseppe between Piedmonte-Sardinia and their rivals to the north, World War I, colonial wars in Africa (Ethiopia, Libya, Somalia, etc.), and World War II. The backdrop of this monument is shamed by a large red graffiti sentence that locals say is the work of immigrants or Communist youths. A walk down the street reveals a very unique and large cathedral with an ancient brick structure next to a large minaret-like spire tower whose appearance is uncommon in Christian faith churches. This original church, built in the 6th century CE, was actually the central main Church of Theodoric the Great himself! Thus, it is one of Europe's sole standing non-Trinitarian churches to remain today as it adhered to the doctrine of Arius, whose heretical beliefs stipulated that Jesus and God were unequal and completely incomparable. After the temporary destruction of German rule of Italy by the Byzantines under the magnificent emperor Justinian I (an Orthodox Greek Christian), the church was forcibly converted into an Orthodox church in Justinian's honor. Original mosaics of Justinian (""JVSTINIANVS"") can still be seen in the church. After the Byzantines were expelled by the succeeding Lombardic Arian Germans shortly thereafter, and after the Germans of the Holy Roman Empire (under Karl the Great/Charlemagne) annexed the capital of Ravenna in the 9th century, the city and its churches were forcibly converted to Catholicism as seen ever since. This church, whose spire on the side has tilted much like the Tower of Pisa in Tuscany, has an interior that for its time is nearly incomparable in the world. A large white and wooded ceiling is supported by large pillars with intricate etchings. Massive mosaics made of pure gold leaf can be seen wrapping around the entire church. More than 1,500 years old, these fantastic works of art (both made by the Germans under Theodoric's authority, the later Byzantine Greeks, and future Italian city-states) are literally in mint condition it seems. Almost no chipping, smudge, or imperfection can be seen on these works of art or mosaics that long outlived the Roman and Greek empires multifold. New murals added by the Italian Catholics much later can also be seen next to original 1,500-year-old marble statues, paintings, and frescoes from the German, Greek, and Italian (non-Roman) periods. No photography or filming is allowed therein to prevent the entropy and decay of this bizarrely-unnoticed world monument. Leaving the church around the corner, one may find one of the world's sole Arian-faith baptisteries, the official Arian-faith Baptistery of Theodoric the Great sunken into ground next to another large Catholic church that was originally commissioned by Theodoric also before its conversion. This is one of the few baptistery buildings that can be entered in the world, as baptism has since generally been performed in churches outside of the Mandaean faith in the Arab world whose faith is believed to have sprung from John the Baptist himself. John is in this baptistery of Ravenna praised as its central theme: a massive ceiling mosaic of gold more than 1,500 years old covers this small building in original mint condition. The ceiling decoration shows a number of white-robed holy saints or disciples with halos atop their heads watching John's baptism of Jesus of Nazareth with a white dove atop to, allegedly, signify the Holy Ghost's presence in the man upon this ""true birth"" (baptism). In this image, baptism of Jesus was done in the nude at an adult age with the entire body. This may indicate that this was the method of baptism in German Arian-faith tradition. The surrounding room is at this point empty with several recesses in the corners perhaps to hold separate baptisms at the same time, often to adult converts instead of infants borne thereof. After the brief Byzantine conquest under Justinian and the later Catholic authority of the native Italians as seen today, this blasphemous baptistery was closed and converted into a Catholic shrine. A drive to the outskirts of the city center reveals easily one of the most magnificent buildings extant on earth. It was not built by Germans nor Greeks, but rather the R. native Italians. This allows a visitor to see not only the importance of Ravenna in history, but also to see first hand the shift from Roman rule to German, from German to Greek, from Greek back to German (Lombardic) and later to the Germans in Germany under Charlemagne, and finally to the native Italians once again. This church, called the Basilica di San Vitale, was built by Bishop Ecclesio (522-532) with the approval of Pope John I for honoring a Roman soldier who was martyred during the Roman persecution of the Christian minority centuries prior. Having seen the world over, other than the Pyramids of Giza and Stonehenge perhaps, this single cathedral easily surpasses all of the cathedrals of Europe, the Orthodox Hagia Sophia in Istanbul (converted to a mosque after the Turkish Jihad succeeded), and approaches or even surpasses the glory of the Vatican's cathedrals. This massive sunken cathedral, more than 1,400 years old, is breathtaking. Nearly a hundred feet tall, nearly every inch of this domed cathedral is covered in original mosaic, gold, gem, jewel, marble, fresco, or statue easily in mint condition. There are endless depictions of saints, apostles, biblical scenes, sacrificial animals (including a strange lamb to symbolize Jesus of Nazareth), stories of the Crucifixion, Revelations, the Great Flood, the revelation of the Ten Commandments to Moses (with a Burning Bush shown), the Assumption of Mary into heaven, the Nativity scene, the incomplete sacrifice of Isaac (or as Muslims claim, Ishmail) by Abraham, etc. Staring at the church's interior for hours would not reveal every depiction or intricate artistic creation this church has to offer. It is sad that a building whose majesty rivals any world wonder is virtually unknown, along with the importance of the city of Ravenna in history from the Roman period to the German and onward. A walk outside to a local small church, designed in the traditional shape of a cross, offers a small mausoleum to two figures important to the region. It too was not built by Germans not Greeks. Built too in the 5th century, the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia was intended to honor the assumption of the daughter of Theodosius the Great into heaven (the Roman emperor who required Christendom of all Romans for the first time, with punishment of death to all pagans and especially Jews who rejected the command). Her mortal remains are not housed here though. The building is 12.75 metres long and 10.25 metres wide as a cross. The interior is small but radiant; there are attractive non-Christian and Christian mosaics all over the interior, though the artwork is more faded than in the glorious church. Entrants may not use cameras and must leave after a few minutes oddly. The artistic design is interesting in that there is little Greek influence here (that one would expect for a Byzantine emperor's daughter's honorary tomb), but rather a pre-Christian Roman style. There are depictions of the Evangelists (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) inside as well as a number of angels and artistic symbols. The multiple tombs in the room apparently house no corpses, but once did. They are in the non-Christian style of the Roman past interestingly, but the original ""blasphemous inscriptions"" were forbidden and etched away after the Byzantine conquest of the city from the Goths of Theodoric. It is unclear what type of inscription this was: German Runic, Greek, Aramaic, or simply a blasphemous or non-Christian passage in Latin? No photos are allowed here. Though the city offers several more monuments dating to the same period more than 1,400 years ago with equally fantastic glory, the most famous monument of the city in its hinterlands is the Tomb of Theodoric the Great, where his physical body was interned after his death. It shows the classical Gothic style in its preserved original style. It was erected here because of its location in a local German cemetery before Christendom was established as the state faith of the Italians. Unfortunately, this location was in a swamp, which caused the tomb to be covered in water for more than 500 years. As a consequence, the exterior is wondrously in great condition but the interior is literally vacant and empty. Ethnic hatred for the Germans and religious hatred for the Arian Christians by the Greeks and Italians also discouraged any preservation effort, and many of the glorious gold valuables in the tomb were stolen or collected by locals later. A massive dome atop the structure, originally probably entirely covered in gold leaf, was added miraculously as a 500-ton single piece atop the structure; an architectural oddity. There is also a cross at the peak. A long path to the tomb allows one to enter the lower level and the top level; the lower level is literally empty entirely. None knows what was housed in the lower level originally: perhaps a holy Bible, perhaps hordes of sacrificial treasures for the afterlife, perhaps the bodies of his many slaves who died with him, perhaps simply massive mosaics on the walls that are now vacant. A walk up the original stairs to the top level reveals a similar upsetting fact: the top floor is also nearly empty. Instead of endless hordes of treasure one would expect from a wealthy and powerful dictator-king, there is nearly nothing but stone walls and pigeons. There is, however, blatant evidence that elaborate frescoes and mosaics of solid gold, gems, jewels, and marble once adorned this important mausoleum. Faded text can also be seen wrapping around the room in German in the Latin and also perhaps originally German Runic scripts (the script of the Gothic kingdoms and most Germans at the time). There is a large original cross made of stone in the corner of the room in a strange recess in the wall perhaps for treasures or his corpse originally. The ceiling reveals a washed-away (by the waters of the swamp) ""X"" shape that was probably actually a cross or a halo to imply his ascent to heaven or divine protection. The center of the room (probably relocated there later) reveals Theodoric's original sarcophagus. It is a bizarre and unique massive red marble coffin with a very large and wide interior. The sides are smashed and cracked; there is no top at this point. The interior is also empty. His body was removed and desecrated by the Byzantines after they destroyed his pagan and heretical empire, some say, though it may have been relocated to protect from erosion later or was washed away by the swamp waters. The tomb survived American and British bombing during World War II, an odd target due to its lack of importance to the war effort, and the fact that no Italian would care if his tomb were destroyed; perhaps it was either an accident or an effort to anger the race-based German state to the north, where Heinrich Himmler and other SS leaders considered the tomb a type of pilgrimage site for ethnic Germans (Volkdeutsche). The European continent that the Romans built from virtually nothing into various degrees of civilization had declined into virtual anarchy after less than 600 years of world conquest, and the ""barbarian"" Germanic, Slavic, and Turkic (Hunnic) peoples had annexed nearly all of their former domains, bringing a new brand of self-interested continental civilization to replace the failed Roman one before it. This transition, easily the most important historical shift in world history, can only be studied to such a degree first hand in this quiet and timeless city of Ravenna, a capital to German and Italian empires alike for nearly a thousand years."
10,"An inside look at Bulgaria, Land of Gold & the Thracians",politics," This is an inside look at the current cultural, ethnic, historical, religious, social, and linguistic dimensions of Bulgaria, complete with photos from my 2007 vacation. It also analyses the issue of Islam in Europe, the Gypsy race, and the mysterious masters of gold, the Thracians. English name: Bulgaria Local name: Balgariya Population: 7,322,858 Religion: Bulgarian Orthodox 82.6%, Muslim 12.2%, other Christian 1.2%, other 4% Language: Bulgarian (Bulgarski/Balgarski), with Turkish minority Ethnic groups: Bulgarian 83.9%, Turk 9.4%, Roma 4.7%, other 2% (including Macedonian, Armenian, Tatar, Circassian) Average fertility/woman: 1.39 per woman Migration rate: -3.71 migrant(s)/1,000 population [Bulgarians are leaving] Per capita average income: $10,700 Unemployment: officially 9.6% Population below poverty line: officially 14.1% Extant populations elsewhere of Albanians: USA, Germany, Greece, Russia Source: CIA World Factbook Bulgaria is one of the more interesting former Soviet puppets in Eastern Europe, with a complicated and ancient history of its own as one of the oldest nations on earth. It prides itself as being the first Slavic nation, as the Slavic race in Central Russia had split and traveled south into modern Bulgaria, displacing the previous Greek and Thracian inhabitants to establish the First Bulgarian Empire in the 7th century CE. They quickly established themselves as one of the most powerful empires in southern Europe, annexing much of the Balkans and adopting the Orthodox faith of their Byzantine neighbors after rejecting the Catholic Papacy. By the 11th century, the Byzantine Greeks had conquered the Bulgarian state, but within a century the Bulgarian Slavs had expelled the Greeks and re-established themselves as the powerful Second Bulgarian Empire. After a series of conflicts with the increasingly powerful European empires of the northwest and other Slavic states like Serbia, the Bulgarian Christians were conquered in the wake of the Islamic Jihad of the Ottomans by the 14th century, one of its first victims. The Bulgarians endured centuries of persecution, economic exploitation, forced conversion, a required blood tax that forced at least one Bulgarian child per family into forced conversion and conscription into Istanbul's awesome janissary armies. Thousands converted in order to avoid persecution and unlivable Jizyah taxes (which in theory allowed the Christians to practice the religion that was at the same time persecuted), and thousands of Turks settled in the Christian land, a legacy that is visible today with Bulgaria having one of Europe's largest Muslim populations. Bulgaria became a source of military and economic strength for what was the world's greatest empire at the time, under the banner of Islam. By the late 20th century, however, other Christian Balkan peoples' independence movements inspired the Bulgarians -- with the help of German, British, and French military aid -- to wrest themselves free of Islamic rule, establishing the Kingdom of Bulgaria by 1908 (though independence was declared much earlier). It engaged in a military assault on its own Christian Slavic neighbors in the Second Balkan War only to fail, forfeiting Kosovo and Macedonia to Serbia for the time. It aided the Germans during World War I and World War II, where it joined the Fascist Axis against the Soviet Union. But by 1941, when its Tzar Boris III had died and the tides of the incredible Soviet might had turned against the Axis, Bulgaria broke the alliance and forfeited itself as a vassal to the USSR, later to join the Warsaw Pact as a Communist puppet. By the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Bulgaria had re-established itself once again as a very centralized yet democratic state of today. Bulgaria's long and tumultuous history, ultraconservative Orthodox Christian heritage, ancient and unchanged Cyrillic (and Glagolitic) Slavic alphabet, and hordes of the oldest and most elaborate gold treasures in the world (both from the separate Thracian race and from Bulgarians alike) define Bulgarians with great pride to this day. Bulgaria's recent troubles -- including corruption, a presence of Russian and KGB mafia even today, and ethnic conflict between Russians, Slavs, and Gypsies -- make Bulgaria quite new to tourism, making us some of the few to have visited. Our ship landed at the lovely coastal port city of Varna. Expecting to see yet another broken down ""Soviet country"", Bulgaria was quite impressive and upright despite all its hardships over the last century. Though its waters seemed relatively dirty and unregulated, the cities were relatively clean and well-maintained, with few dilapidated and broken down buildings (unlike in Romania or Albania, separate EHA articles). There is seldom trash on the street as one would expect from a larger city like in the United States or Europe. The economy is doing well with a massive growth and recovery factor from its Soviet period of decline. There seems to be more graffiti than in Ukraine, which many of the locals attribute to a higher immigration and minority population (Turks, Gypsies, etc.) than in extremely-homogeneous Ukraine. Bulgaria's Varna is one of the few cities experimenting with the occasional ""city art"" move, that being when the city pays local ""artists"" to spray graffiti-like images and text on a specific regulated wall. There are few tourist shops, as little tourism is expected. There are a seemingly infinite number of restaurants and eateries, many of them open-air in the center of ancient cobblestone paths impassable to cars, offering a variety of Slavic, Greek, and occasionally Turkish foods for a good price. Bulgarian red wine is renowned across Europe, and is offered in the American White House, famous for its thick and dry red pallet. Pita-like bread filled with cheese is a local favorite. English is relatively common, as taught with compulsion in most schools, as is German, though very little English text is visible anywhere on the streets. Most of the Bulgarians in the street appear to be relatively young by comparison to the remainder of Europe, roughly 15-40. Not too many infants or very young are commonplace oddly. Bulgarian women generally dress conservatively and well, a trait that distinguishes them from most of the Ukrainian, American, and Russian youths today. In rural Bulgaria, attractive hills and mountains are adorned with broad fields of thick grass, bush, and golden wheat. Bulgaria's urban cities are a growing light in a dark part of Europe, but its rural quarters are an explosive source of a thriving agricultural economy. Crops, horticulture, hydroponic gardens, sheep, fowl, and horses decorate wide and well-maintained roads for miles and miles until the next growing city. This is no dilapidated ""Eastern Bloc"" country like Georgia so rife with suffering and internal schism in Abkhazia and Ajaria. As in Romania, Bulgaria's social and economic problems root in its large Gypsy (""Roma"" or ""Sinti"") population. Descendant from northern India centuries ago, the nomadic ""Gypsies"" traveled throughout Iran and Mesopotamia before settling along the Caspian and the Balkans, where they were routinely persecuted or massacred by nearly every culture they entered (much like the Jews, as later occurred in the Holocaust for both ethnic groups). For centuries the Gypsies have lived as an impoverished and starving people with a bizarre syncretic religion whose sole source of occupation other than subsistence farming appears to be theft and offering collections. As in Romania, it was amazing to learn that these seemingly racist and denegratory descriptions of this race were entirely true. In Bulgaria it seems that few are wealthy, but if there are poor, it is because of the Gypsy population in the outskirts of the city. They live in unthinkable conditions with entirely demolished buildings, collapsed walls, infested foods taken from waste baskets, unclean drinking water, they defecate in public outside their homes, and they do not bathe nor shave. All of them either seem fatally ill or deformed. Five or so kilometers from town, Gypsy ""villages"" that are akin to an Zimbabwean slum are regulated, segregated, and offered economic recovery (akin to a type of welfare or subsidy). Horses, carriages, plows, and frail cows are to the Gypsies what Audis and Saabs are to the Slavic natives. Some of them attempt to enter public life or employment but generally fail miserably and return to economic assistance. Whereas in Romania they are considered to be leeches and thieves in public Slavic Romanian life, in Bulgaria they appear to be a marginalized and segregated race of the morbidly poor. In both countries, their sympathetic asking for handouts, with decrepit hands extended holding basins for coin donations, are deemed entirely a false act of theft and swindling. They account for the largest rate of theft and crime by proportion in the nation. Several of the locals and passengers of the cruise ship were robbed by the Gypsies when they had their wallets open to make a purchase at a local shop. It is far worse in Romania. They even stand outside churches to inspire Christian compassion to offer them money (or even let their guards down to be open to theft), which is entirely a false ploy because of the fact that the Gypsies embrace a unique religion descendant from India blended with the nations they infiltrate. In some cases, local businesses actually hire Gypsies to panhandle in order to gain extra income for the firm, or even to stand outside another business to steer away clientelle from thieves. The slang word ""Jip"" (to cheat or steal) derives from the word Gypsy. Few of the locals donate to them, in fact many push them away or spit at them, pleading for tourists not to fund their perceived heist. This ethnic group faced genocide during World War II by Axis Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Germany, and later by the Soviets as well. The ethnosocial conflict remains strong to this day. Bulgaria is rife with some of archeology's greatest mysteries and treasures dating back to the time of the Iranian pre-Zoroastrian states of Sumer and the Hittites. Varna is full of massive state-owned archeological museums with the most impressive coffers of gold, burial remains, gems, and rare metals in the world. Aside from a plethora of Roman baths, ducts, temples, and burial chambers all over Bulgaria (all made in stone and brick), there are other simple findings that eclipse it tenfold. Buried skeletons -- with women buried in the fetal position and men laying on their backs -- are collected here from Bulgaria, Romania, and Thrace (between today's Turkey and Bulgaria) covered in refined and smithed gold, gold leaf jewels, rings, earrings, and intricate artwork including a hand-carved angel with near-microscopic detail. They are attributed in majority not to Greek tribes of Homer's time nor to the Romans or Etruscans, but to a bizarre culture or race called the Thracians. Their origins are entirely shrouded in mystery and theory. A venture to Bulgaria was a fascinating opportunity for me to study the mysterious ancient race that perplexes European historians over the ethnic history of the current Romanians, Bulgarians, and Greeks to this day, all dating from 800BCE and even as early as 3500BCE. The fact that this race and its technology disappeared suddenly is more perplexing. Many historians like myself debate over their racial origin as an advanced Greek tribe (akin to the Minoans of Crete, one of the oldest civilizations in the world), even ancient Atlantis, to an abstract and theorized ""Indo-European"" group, to the Phoenecian Arabs of Lebanon, and to Iranian or Anatolian civilizations. The few burial, cultural, and religious characteristics that we can absorb from skeletons instead of buildings and temples does not link them to any of these groups. It seems appropriate that they are at least loosely connected -- ethnically, historically, and technologically -- to the only major magnificent race at that time in the area: the culturally Iranian/Mesopotamian states of the Hittites, the Lydians, and especially the Scythians whose immigration westward led to their settlement in the eastern Balkans, where the Romans later annihilated their statehood and presence in the Dacian Wars. Later, the Slavs entered the region, establishing today's Bulgaria as one of the world's longest-lasting nation. No conclusion has been made to universal submission in Bulgaria or otherwise. There is no greater outlet to study this European historical gate to the east than in the Slavic Bulgaria which replaced its predecessors. The role of religion is central to Bulgarian history, heritage, and culture 1500 years ago and today, enduring past nearly five decades of atheistic Communist rule. 82.6% of the citizens profess conservative Orthodoxy, with some 12.2% professing Islam (mostly due to Turkish settlers and those forced to convert during centuries of Ottoman rule). Bulgaria has some of the Slavic world's most glorious Orthodox cathedrals, which tower atop the cities with a bright cross with the traditional Orthodox diagonal planks to discern from the excommunicated Catholic faith. The conservative churches of Orthodoxy require men to cover their legs and shoulders, and women to wear veils or headscarves upon entrance like in Islam. Beautiful gold leaf-finished onion domes link Bulgaria with its ethnic Russian roots in its ancient homeland. Inside, the traditional roots of the Slavs are epitomized with pride: the Glagolitic alphabet which preceded Slavic Cyrillic of today's Bulgaria, Ukraine, and Russia wrap around the church resounding Biblical verses much like in mosques with Arabic. Fantastic mosaics and frescos of the holy saints wrap around the room glowing with gold for several centuries. Few chairs are present generally. Unlike in Catholicism, Orthodox faith is far more independent, and Bulgarians can be seen flocking to church throughout the week at all hours of the day to pray. Prayer faces the saints, with candle in hand or hand against an icon of a saint, just as Muslims pray to Makkah. There is seldom a charge for lighting candles to pray, unlike in Catholic churches. Confession is done in public for all to see and hear; an Orthodox Christian bows before a metropolitan or pope, who promptly places a holy tie-like cloth over their heads, after which the two pray together aloud. Weddings are held several times a week, as Bulgaria's long and ultraconservative religious history are directly connected to its elaborate marriage rituals. Bulgarian traditional religious Slavic chant singers are celebrated throughout the nation. Bulgaria places a critical deal of pride as well in its unique and elaborate sewing, weaving, and traditional dress costumes that are rich in blacks and reds to distinguish them from their other Slavic brother cultures of Ukraine, Serbia, and Poland. Most Bulgarians still pay a type of marriage or dowry to one another upon marriage, including monetary moneys, jewelry, and traditional dress to be worn at the church wedding. Their Slavic race, long history, somewhat unique culture, traditions, and conservative faith define Bulgarian heritage then and now. Even today, when skepticism of Biblical claims are commonplace, religion acts as a tool to justify Bulgaria's right to independent statehood. So too, it is reported that some 50% of recent births in the last few years are out of wedlock (a tenet rejected by the church), with many claiming that elaborate weddings, parties, dowry, and planning are too difficult, though most eventually become wed via the Orthodox church. This is less a problem than appears, as Bulgaria has such a low birthrate (one of the very lowest on earth) that few are born at all this way in totality. The role of Islam in Bulgarian history and today is complicated and in many ways unique. Universally Orthodox before the victory of the Turkish Jihad in the 14th century, the combination of mass forced conversion, persecution, unlivable taxes, and second-class conditions cause Bulgaria to be one of the few white nations under Turkish rule where large-scale conversion of the natives to Islam occurred -- primarily by force, otherwise by best socioeconomic interest during foreign rule. Only Kosovo (today in Serbia), Albania, Bosnia, and what was later Macedonia surpass Bulgaria with populations of white European Muslim converts during Turkish Islamic rule. Today, some 12.2% of citizens in Bulgaria profess Islam (primarily Sunni). Unlike in nearly all of Europe, where the Muslims are immigrants who exploited post-war liberalism imported largely by the victors and the new governments, in Bulgaria roughly half of these are native Bulgarians. The remainder are ethnic Turkish Muslims (Sunni, Sufi, or Darvish) who settled either during Ottoman rule or during post-war guest labor immigration. The Bulgarian government throughout the 29st century and after World War II expelled the Turks and Muslims on several occasion back to Turkey. Today, as in all of Europe, there is a firm ethnosocial conflict between the Europeans and the settling Turks and Muslims. Bulgaria is no different due to its close geographic proximity to the very capital of the Islamic world for some 500 years in Anatolia. There are, however, few mosques due to a strong reprisal against the occupying powers by the native Christians. There are, predictably, few synagogues as well. Bulgaria is a lovely experience and an exclusive opportunity to study the Thracians, the earliest of the Slavic states, the proud Orthodox faith, and the influence resultant of centuries of Islamic Jihad in a Christian European nation."
11,A 10th-century Arab's depiction of Ancient Russia,politics," This article regards the cultural, ethnic, and political primary sources of 10th-century Abbasid Arab Muslim traveler and ambassador Ahmad ibn Fadlan in his journey along the Volga river basin, including his depictions of the pre-Christian European Finns, Slavs, and the Turkic Muslim Bulgar tribes. Historical and Cultural Background: Today part of the massive dominion of the Russian Federation, in the 10th and 11th centuries, the wilderness along the large Volga River in central-southern Russia was still free of Slavic rule. The dominant and thriving Slavic Kievan empire originally built by the invading Vikings (""Varangians"") did not convert nearly all Slavic cultures to Orthodox Christendom until 988 upon the conversion of Vladimir the Great. Other extant Slavic nations during the timeframe included Bohemia (today including the Czechs and Slovaks) before its annexation by the Germans, Bulgaria, Poland, Croatia, and more. From the 5th century onward, Turkic peoples marched westward from Central Asia, settling along the Volga river, the Caucasus, and today's Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan where the Slavs of the later Russia had not exerted full dominion yet. The racially-Mongol tribes today seen in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and eastern Russia had not entered the region as extensively as seen today until the 13th-century Mongol conquest of Asia. The foremost powerful Turkic tribes were the Tatars, Bulgars, and Khazars. In the 9th century, the Turkic peoples almost in entirety submitted to Islam, but retained their non-Arabic Turkic languages. From the late 8th century onward (until being obliterated by the Kievan Slavs), the most powerful of these peoples was the Khazar kingdom. Apparently acting as a vassal, the Bulgars became the most powerful Islamic Turkic tribe in the region. The Khazars leaders later converted to Judaism, an event that is academically quite debated and mysterious in terms of its reason. It is generally accepted that the Bulgar Islamic hordes remained independent from Khazar rule but functioned as a tributary vassal. The growing role of Islam in Turkic culture, and the resultant Jihad against the non-Muslim Turkic minority and the Russian Christians naturally caught the eye of their southerly Islamic neighbor, the Sunni Abbasid Islamist state centering around Baghdad. The fundamentalist Abbasid caliphate was the central force of the Islamic world, and arguably the world's greatest superpower, as most of Europe outside of the increasingly-dominant German and Byzantine empires were suffering from internal conflict and only growing statehood for the brief time being. The Iraqi state's reigns stretched from Libya to Iran, and from Armenia to Oman and Yemen. Its wealth, trade, and mathematical advancements dwarfed even the most advanced local kingdoms outside of their rule. To expand their realm, to ensure the triumph of the Jihad of Islam throughout the world, and to hinder the expansion of the growing Christian kingdoms in the east (Byzantium, Kievan Russia, Bulgaria, etc.), the Abbasid Caliph al-Muktadir sent a missionary embassy to meet the Islamic Turkic tribes along the Volga to open trade agreements, to built mosques, and to hold diplomatic audience for pan-Islamic partnership (as the Abbasids, in effect, ruled the near entirety of the Islamic world). Along with the embassy came famous 9th-10th century Arab writer, traveler, historian, and diplomat Ahmad ibn Fadlan, ibn al-Abbas, ibn Rashid, ibn Hamad [#GE'/ %(F #DA/DF] (one name). Along his journey, he made famous and rare primary source documents depicting the early local tribes of the Turkic, Finnic, Slavic, possibly Hungarian, and possibly also the Germanic (the Vikings) races. Though the Iraqi embassy failed due to the inability to meet with the Turkic kings sufficiently, his experience gives us one of the few pictures of the separate ethnic European and Turkic tribes before and during Christianization. His venture is depicted, albeit absurdly loosely, in the Michael Crichton novel Eaters of the Dead and the film The 13th Warrior, starring Omar Sharif and Antonio Banderas as Ahmad ibn Fadlan. Ahmad ibn Fadlan's travels and ethnocultural observations: On his embassy's adventure he traveled through the trails, trade networks, deserted wildernesses, and sandstorm-torn regions of Central and Southwest Asia. He traveled by horse and camelback from Baghdad to Tehran, Bahktaran, near Ashgabat, to the majestic city of Buqara and possibly near Samarqand, along the Caspian of today's Kazakhstan, along the Volga, into the steppe lands of the Khazars, and into the Bulgar Turkic capital of Bular (pronounced ""Bool-ahr""), where he organized an audience with local Turkic Muslim rulers, scholars, and Islamic jurists of al-Qur'an. There, he bolstered political and economic relations between the Islamic powers, but failed to assert the Iraqi declaration upon them that all Muslims are to pray to Allah fivefold per day (the local Turkic tradition was apparently 3-4), and did not convince them to enforce the law that men and women are to both bathe (purifying pre-prayer ablutions) and pray in segregation, following the tradition of all other Islamic peoples. The mission was less successful than expected. After the majority of his missionarial efforts with the Turkic Bulgars were complete, we learn of a series of depiction of the nearby ethnic Finnic, Slavic, and possibly Germanic (the few Vikings who remained following state creation of the Kievans) populations to the far north (who traded goods regularly with the Bulgar Muslims to the south, where Ahmad ibn Fadlan was residing for the time). Most of his descriptions are considered second-hand, and are extremely biased and racist against the non-Muslim Europeans. Though probably exagerated grossly, we nonetheless gain a rare picture of the generally illiterate, pre-Christian peoples in the region. The eastern and northern Volga had long been populated before the Russian and Mongol conquest by allegedly Finnic- and Ugric-speaking (today's designated as Hungarian) peoples, Slavic Russians, and occasionally Germanic seafarers traveling along the Volga to conquer and explore. Neither the Slavs, Finns, Germans (specifically Swedes), nor Hungarians were yet Christian by majority. As infidels and white-skinned Europeans each, Ahmad's rantings on their behalf is predictably dubious. So too, it is difficult to identify which race he is observing in his sources, as the distinct cultures and languages of the Finns, Hungarians, Russians, and Germans in relation to the region were shrouded and elusive both then and now, especially to a palace-bred Arab Muslim from so far away. Today, his depictions are considered to focus on ""the Rus"", whose meaning originally referred to the minority Germanic seafarers who created the first unified Russian powerhouse, after which the name passed to the local non-German Slavic Russians. Therefore, it can be assumed that his descriptions refer to the pre-Christian Slavs and the Finnic-speakers west and east of the Volga, respectively. Ahmad referred to his writing subjects as the Rus (""Russiyya"" [1'H3PJG]) as well. The term ""Rus"" during this period is often used today in academia to refer to the Varangian Germanic ruling class, though this article will show that population's lack of involvement in the tales of Ahmad ibn Fadlan. The main criticism of the Europeans, as laughably exploited in The 13th Warrior, focuses on the Europeans' lack of hygiene. A famous scene from the film that is directly based upon his descriptions shows a series of Vikings (as the film ridiculously inaccurately portrays) passing around a communal washing bowl into which the residents spit, sneeze, and collectively wash their faces and hair. Upon passing the bowl to Ahmad ibn Fadlan and Omar Sharif's character, the two disgustingly grin and pass it onward whilst the nomad Europeans (in reality, the Slavic Rus or the Finnic peoples) continue to bath in mucous and saliva waste. From Ahmad ibn Fadlan's actual work regarding cleanliness and washing ritual of the pre-Christian Slavic Rus: Every day they must wash their faces and heads and this they do in the dirtiest and filthiest fashion possible....every morning a girl servant brings a great basin of water; she offers this to her master and he washes his hands and face and his hair - he washes it and combs it out with a comb in the water; then he blows his nose and spits into the basin. When he has finished, the servant carries the basin to the next person, who does likewise. She carries the basin thus to all the household in turn, and each blows his nose, spits, and washes his face and hair in it. This harsh criticism can be partly disregarded as hyperbole not only because of Ahmad's lifestyle as an upper-class Arab scholar in the world's wealthiest city, but also because of the fact that any local European tribes were effectively nomadically engaging in trading, settling, traveling, and encampment after weeks of travel. Any city-bred person of today would appear the same way to an elite like Ahmad after such distant camping and trading routes. The minority Germanic culture present in the region were actually famed for their hygiene, medicine, and tradition of cleanliness back home in the Teutonic Odinist and Tyrist world in comparison with the backwards local societies in the Baltic and Slavia. Previous and later Iranian scholars depicted the Germanic peoples of the further north as prestine, clean, faithful, well-ordered, gentlemanly, and proud, as they were collectively admired even by the Romans (especially visible in Tactitus ""Germania""). Thus, it is again more plausible aside from simple geography that these subjects are Slavic, Finnic, Magyar (Hungarian), or another European ethnic group instead of the Germanic minority. The Arab Muslim also described the Slavs' or Finns' local sexual behavior in the villages he saw. Again, there is no evidence of his actual presence amongst the Europeans; it may entirely be second-hand in addition to its anti-non-Muslim intensity. Nonetheless, Ahmad did experience shocking lengths of days, but this does not signify his presence in the far north. He was surprised by how very short the nights are, a characteristic seen both in the far north, in Siberia, and the southern Russian steppe depending upon the time of year -- Ahmad may have ventured to the region in the summer. They are the filthiest of God's creatures. They have no modesty in defecation and urination, nor do they wash after pollution from orgasm, nor do they wash their hands after eating. Thus they are like wild asses. When they have come from their land....they build big houses of wood on the shore, each holding ten to twenty persons more or less....With them are pretty slave girls destined for sale to merchants: a man will have sexual intercourse with his slave girl while his companion looks on. Sometimes whole groups will come together in this fashion, each in the presence of others. A merchant who arrives to buy a slave girl from them may have to wait and look on while a Rus completes the act of intercourse with a slave girl. The 13th Warrior briefly shows hints of promiscuity amongst the locals, including slavery, though Ahmad makes no attempt to deride the Europeans for their slaveholding, as the Muslims had the largest collections of slaves in the world. The Arab's depiction of promiscuous sexuality may also not be his own personal comparison between the Iranian and Arabic world of his fundamentalist home empire, but rather it may root in the fact that Ahmad (himself a fundamentalist Muslim and Islamic scholar) considered them pathetic infidels apostate from the Islamic law of purity he was seeking to bring to the southerly Turkic tribes. The tasting of pork, the drinking of alcohol, etc. stimulate this hatred and disgust for the infidel by the Muslim Arab writer. Ahmad, however, did praise them as upright, beautiful, and unique. He described their features as clearly European. The descriptions are true of both the Slavic, Germanic, and Finnic races alike. He describes their culture and tradition as unique and simple. I have seen the Rus....I have never seen more perfect physical specimens, tall as date palms, blonde and ruddy; they wear neither tunics nor caftans, but the men wear a garment which covers one side of the body and leaves a hand free. Each man has an axe, a sword, and a knife and keeps each by him at all times. The swords are broad and grooved, of Frankish (German) sort. Every man is tattooed from finger nails to neck with dark green (or green or blue-black) trees and figures. Each woman wears on either breast a box of iron, silver, copper or gold; the value of the box indicates the wealth of the husband. Each box has a ring from which depends a knife. The women wear neck rings of gold and silver....Their most prized ornaments are beads of green glass of the same make as ceramic objects one finds on their ships. They trade beads among themselves and they pay an exaggerated price for them....They string them as necklaces for their women. No standard measure [economic unit] is known in the land.... They are very fond of pork (Haram/forbidden in Islam)....The Rus are a great host, all of them red haired; they are big men with white bodies. The women of this land have boxes made, according to their circumstances and means, out of gold, silver, and wood. From childhood they bind these to their breasts so that their breasts will not grow larger. Ahmad also describes the religion of these Finnic and Slavic Russian peoples. It appears to be monotheistic or henotheism (many gods, one triumphal godhead), with a great use of idols and figurines. There is no evidence of the pan-Germanic religious tradition of Odin, Tyr, and Thor more popular amongst eastern Germans. This may give us a rare image of pre-Christian Slavic or Finnic religion, as very little evidence survives. When the ships come to this mooring place, everybody goes ashore with bread, meat, onions, milk and intoxicating drink and betakes himself to a long upright piece of wood that has a face like a man's and is surrounded by little figures, behind which are long stakes in the ground. The Rus prostrates himself before the big carving and says, ""O my Lord, I have come from a far land and have with me such and such a number of girls and such and such a number of sables"", and he proceeds to enumerate all his other wares. Then he says, ""I have brought you these gifts,"" and lays down what he has brought with him, and continues....If he has difficulty selling his wares and his stay is prolonged, he will return with a gift a second or third time. If he has still further difficulty, he will bring a gift to all the little idols and ask their intercession....And he addresses each idol in turn, asking intercession and praying humbly....and he takes a certain number of sheep or cattle and slaughters them, gives part of the meat as alms, brings the rest and deposits it before the great idol and the little idols around it, and suspends the heads of the cattle or sheep on the stakes. In the night, dogs come and eat all, but the one who has made the offering says, ""Truly, my Lord is content with me and has consumed the present I brought him."" Ahmad also depicts the unique and interesting burial tradition of these local Europeans that are unfamiliar to the Arab Muslim scholar. An ill person is put in a tent apart with some bread and water and people do not come to speak to him; they do not come even to see him every day, especially if he is a poor man or a slave. If he recovers, he returns to them, and if he dies, they cremate him. If he is a slave, he is left to be eaten by dogs and birds of prey. If the Rus catch a thief or robber, they hang him on a tall tree and leave him hanging until his body falls in pieces. At last I was told of the death of one of their outstanding men. They placed him in a grave and put a roof over it for ten days, while they cut and sewed garments for him. If the deceased is a poor man they make a little boat, which they lay him in and burn. If he is rich, they collect his goods and divide them into three parts, one for his family, another to pay for his clothing, and a third for making intoxicating drink, which they drink until the day when his female slave will kill herself and be burned with her master. They stupefy themselves by drinking this beer night and day; sometimes one of them dies cup in hand. When the day arrived on which the man was to be cremated and the girl with him, I went to the river on which was his ship. I saw that they had drawn the ship onto the shore, and that they had erected four posts of birch wood and other wood, and that around the ship was made a structure like great ship's tents out of wood....Then they began to come and go and to speak words which I did not understand....The tenth day, having drawn the ship up onto the river bank, they guarded it. In the middle of the ship they prepared a dome or pavilion of wood and covered this with various sorts of fabrics. Then they brought a couch and put it on the ship and covered it with a mattress of Greek brocade. Then came an old woman whom they call the Angel of Death, and she spread upon the couch the furnishings mentioned. It is she who has charge of the clothes-making and arranging all things, and it is she who kills the girl slave. I saw that she was a strapping old woman, fat and louring. When they came to the grave they removed the earth from above the wood, then the wood, and took out the dead man clad in the garments in which he had died. I saw that he had grown black from the cold of the country. They put intoxicating drink, fruit, and a stringed instrument in the grave with him. They removed all that. The dead man did not smell bad, and only his color had changed. They dressed him in trousers, stockings, boots, a tunic, and caftan of brocade with gold buttons. They put a hat of brocade and fur on him. Then they carried him into the pavilion on the ship. They seated him on the mattress and propped him up with cushions. They brought intoxicating drink, fruits, and fragrant plants, which they put with him, then bread, meat, and onions, which they placed before him. Then they brought a dog, which they cut in two and put in the ship. Then they brought his weapons and placed them by his side. Then they took two horses, ran them until they sweated, then cut them to pieces with a sword and put them in the ship. Next they killed a rooster and a hen and threw them in. The girl slave who wished to be killed went here and there and into each of their tents, and the master of each tent had sexual intercourse with her and said, ""Tell your lord I have done this out of love for him."" Friday afternoon they led the slave girl to a thing that they had made which resembled a door frame. She placed her feet on the palms of the men and they raised her up to overlook this frame. She spoke some words and they lowered her again. A second time they raised her up and she did again what she had done; then they lowered her. They raised her a third time and she did as she had done the two times before. Then they brought her a hen; she cut off the head, which she threw away, and then they took the hen and put it in the ship. I asked the interpreter what she had done. He answered, ""The first time they raised her she said, 'Behold, I see my father and mother.’ The second time she said, 'I see all my dead relatives seated.’ The third time she said, 'I see my master seated in Paradise and Paradise is beautiful and green; with him are men and boy servants. He calls me. Take me to him.' ""Now they took her to the ship. She took off the two bracelets she was wearing and gave them both to the old woman called the Angel of Death, who was to kill her; then she took off the two finger rings which she was wearing and gave them to the two girls who had served her and were the daughters of the woman called the Angel of Death. Then they raised her onto the ship but they did not make her enter the pavilion. Then the closest relative of the dead man, after they had placed the girl whom they have killed beside her master, came, took a piece of wood which he lit at a fire, and walked backwards with the back of his head toward the boat and his face turned toward the people, with one hand holding the kindled stick and the other covering his anus, being completely naked, for the purpose of setting fire to the wood that had been made ready beneath the ship. Then the people came up with tinder and other fire wood, each holding a piece of wood of which he had set fire to an end and which he put into the pile of wood beneath the ship. Thereupon the flames engulfed the wood, then the ship, the pavilion, the man, the girl, and everything in the ship. A powerful, fearful wind began to blow so that the flames became fiercer and more intense. The elaborate burial routine for their kings and noblemen is common amongst any culture, but the ship-burning method is unique amongst the north Germanic tradition as a vessal of passage to Valhalla. The presence of this tradition amongst the Slavic and Finnic north Volga is easily due to cultural influence, unless the non-Germans already engaged in this burial ritual independently (as so little evidence of them exists). One of the Rus was at my side and I heard him speak to the interpreter, who was present. I asked the interpreter what he said. He answered, ""you Arabs are fools."" ""Why?"" I asked him. He said, ""you take the people who are most dear to you and whom you honour most and put them into the ground where insects and worms devour them. We burn him in a moment, so that he enters Paradise at once."" Then he began to laugh uproariously. When I asked why he laughed, he said, ""His Lord, for love of him, has sent the wind to bring him away in an hour."" ...Then they constructed in the place where had been the ship which they had drawn up out of the river something like a small round hill, in the middle of which they erected a great post of birch wood, on which they wrote the name of the man and the name of the Rus king and they departed. Ahmad ibn Fadlan goes on in conclusion to offer observations and second-hand visualization of the capital of this people's kingdom he observes. Ahmad never ventured nearby, and it is possible that the Slavs or Finns with whom he cohabitated were speaking of a mythical homeland, as no evidence of a true local center exists. As the Slavs of today's Russia were originally ruled by an invading Germanic minority (which many Russians reject as the so-called ""Normanist Bias""), it could be that Ahmad was describing Slavs and possibly Finns under the ultimate rule of the Germanic minority back at the capital at Kiev and Novgorod, and thus his depictions of the wealthy palaces of the capital are relatively positive (and still unknown to him directly plus additional bias) compared to the backward and heathen lifestyles of the rural nomadic Slavic majority of the empire in its furthest trade and expedition reaches. It is the custom of the king of the Rus to have with him in his palace four hundred men, the bravest of his companions and those on whom he can rely. These are the men who die with him and let themselves be killed for him....These four hundred men sit about the king's throne, which is immense and encrusted with fine precious stones. With him on the throne sit forty female slaves destined for his bed. Occasionally he has intercourse with one of them in the presence of his companions of whom we have spoken, without coming down from the throne. When he needs to answer a call of nature, he uses a basin....The cloth of these lands and localities is famous, especially that of their capital, which is called Kyawh. Famous and noted cities of the Rus are Crsk and Hrqh. Despite its mystery and lack of certainty in terms of the ethnic cultures subjected to his observations, as well as his religious and ethnic bias and probable second-hand credibility, the journals of Ahmad ibn Fadlan and other Arab and Iranian Muslim scholars give us among the first depictions of the pre-Christian Finns, Slavs, and possibly Hungarians over a millennium before our time."
12,Causes of the Holocaust,politics," The following article is a historical analysis calling for an unbiased, objective study into the causes of one of the most famous incidents in world history. It is NOT a Holocaust denial, nor a justification of Hitler's regime nor its actions, nor does it blame the Jews for the Holocaust. The Holocaust is easily one of the foremost malevolent and tragic events in world history. Everyone has been witness to the horrific imagery of incinerated and decrepit corpses being heaved into mass pits. But what were the actual catalysts of the mass genocide of over 6,000,000 individuals, most of whom Jews? Antisemitism and even outright attempts at extermination had been nothing new to the Germanic world, or the remainder of Europe. As early as 1096, German crusaders had begun pogrom-like attacks all throughout the Holy Roman (German) Empire against Jews, rather than Muslim Tatars or Saracens. Recently-united Spain in the 15th and 16th centuries ordered the expulsion of all Jews and non-Catholics from Iberia, even sanctioning their murder. Muslim nations included them as infidels in their global duty of Jihad to defend the true faith. In the 16th century, German Protestant founder Martin Luther called for their complete expulsion from Germany in his novel On the Jews and their Lies: ""If we wish to wash our hands of the Jews' blasphemy...we have to part company with them. They must be driven from our country...Then they need no longer wail and lie before God against us that we are holding them captive...This is the most natural and the best course of action, which will safe guard the interest of both parties."" But what were the underlying causes of such a sudden, unparalleled, and draconian explosion in national extermination programs of the Jewish populations in Axis-dominated Europe as initiated by Germany, Hungary, Romania, and their allies? The individual is well-versed in the standard curricular and ideological explanations for such an abhorrent tragedy: that the German people were brainwashed by a fanatical, evil despot, and that radical figures in the new National Socialist movement needed a scapegoat to explain the rampant post-war hyperinflation, shameful loss of a worldwide war, the seizure of Germany's eastern and western marches by the victors, and the Versailles punishments the German empire faced. Without restraint or bias, and especially being careful not in any way to imply that the mass slaughter of the Jews was justified or acceptable, historians must engage in active analysis of the contributions of both parties to the Holocaust, and why the historical anti-Semitism reached such a sudden peak after World War I. Historians must first work to question the concept that the Holocaust can solely be attributed to the fanaticism of Chancellor Adolf Hitler, as is often implied. Coming to power in 1933 after an election victory and the selection by President Hindenburg, Hitler made clear public notice of his outlined suppression of the Jewish population. On multiple occasions, he openly exclaimed that the Jewish ethnoreligious community would be removed from Germany by force, especially in a famous 1942 national speech before the Sportspalast in Berlin. ""...the war will not end as the Jews imagine it will, namely with the uprooting of the Aryans, but the result of this war will be the complete annihilation of the Jews."" Such harsh and violent rhetoric occurred at the same time as historians imply that the German population was completely unaware of the coming horrors the Jews and other minorities would and were already facing in Axis lands. Therefore, the ""canonical"" standard that Hitler committed such ruthless crimes as the Holocaust behind the eyes of the German people or had hidden his true intentions is inaccurate. The extent to which the ""Jewish question"" was ""answered"" could obviously not have been imagined by German citizens, but the intentions of the elected regime were clear and rife with popular support. As the German nation was clearly informed of such ruthless extents of anti-Semitism as annihilation, we can deduce that there was a blatant opposition to ""Jewry"" pervasively common throughout society. Further, no historic piece of evidence exists linking Adolf Hitler to the ""Final Solution"", that is, the national plan of [majority] Jewish extermination stipulated at the Wannsee Conference on January 20, 1942. The program was initiated by Luftwaffe commander Hermann Göring and Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler. It is obvious that such an all-seeing and powerful dictator, having encouraged the program openly to the public, was highly aware of the coming genocide. The policy was widely accepted among the ruling regime, the public, and Germany's allies in Romania and Hungary. The slaughter also occurred in the Soviet Union that Germany considered a ""Jewish empire"". This should encourage historians to question the idea that the genocide was merely the work of the madman Adolf Hitler sentenced millions to their deaths in cold blood as nothing more than scapegoats. Even before the Wannsee Conference the Wehrmacht (army) as a whole in the Third Reich was enthused with the apparently inevitable removal of Jews from the Axis territories, as seen by this speech to the Wehrmacht in Poland by Governor General Hans Frank on 16 December, 1941: ""One way or another, I will tell you quite openly, we must finish off the Jews. The Führer put it into words: should united Jewry again succeed in setting off a world war, then the blood sacrifice shall not be made only by the peoples driven into war, but the Jew of Europe will have met his end...We must destroy the Jews wherever we find them, and wherever it is at all possible, in order to maintain the whole structure of the Reich..."" In delineation of the ""canonical"" idea of a universal Jewish scapegoat, that is that the Jews were slain en masse solely as a justification for Hitler's election and consolidation at the same time as supposedly no one knew it would occur, historians must analyze the accepted Jewish characteristics in the Third Reich. Was there more criticism of Jews in Europe than simpleton stereotypes like frugality, big noses, curly hair, and theft? Or did they play some role in the reactive mass Antisemitism experienced all over Europe and the Middle East? National Socialists, right-wing radicals, Freikorps, monarchies, and nationalists throughout Europe characterized the Jews as an ultra-liberal, often anarchistic, subversive, ""parasitic"" people and, most important perhaps, the founders of the growing threats of socialism and Communism, the archnemeses of international Fascism and European heritage. They were often blamed for ending World War I early in the tumult of 1917-18, and also for forcing the liberalism, democracy, freedoms, and all-accepting tolerant governments that the Allies and United States demanded of the losers of the war. Without any attempt to justify the extermination of the Jews following World War I, historians must analyze the validity and source of such claims so prevalent in Europe, even among non-Axis nations. A great deal of critical leaders in the international, liberal Communist movement were of Jewish heritage or were recent converts or apostates therefrom, including Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, and Leon Trotsky. So too, Joseph Stalin, the key bulwark of Communist power, was of Judeo-Georgian origin, having attended a yeshiva (Jewish studies) school in his youth. The Great War had ended early for Germany due to widespread reformist and liberal revolts, eventually overthrowing the anti-Semitic dictator Kaiser Wilhelm II, resulting in an armistice with France at Compiegne, and the installation of a revolutionary government under the unstable banner of Weimar liberalism inspired by France and especially the United States. Long rooted in German heritage and conservative culture, Bavaria and now-French Alsace (Elsaß) had been ripped from the German empire in criminal coups by Communists seeking change from the anti-Semitic monarchical system of the Wittelsbachs to a liberal republic, creating the Alsatian and Bavarian Soviet Republics. The key leaders in the destruction of the 700-year-old Wittelsbach leadership in Bavaria were also Jewish, including Karl Kautsky, Eduard Bernstein, Rudolf Hilferding, and the leader Kurt Eisner. Later sweeping liberal revolts calling for democratic equality by the Spartakist League were also almost exclusively Jewish-run, including Rosa Luksemburg, Paul Levi, and Karl Liebknecht. This growing Spartakist movement actively handed out pamphlets calling for a complete overthrow of the German government, as seen in this November 1918 article from their official newspaper, Die rote Fahne: ""The revolution in Germany has come! The masses of the soldiers who for years were driven to slaughter for the sake of capitalistic profits; the masses of workers, who for four years were exploited, crushed, and starved, have revolted...From the first day of this war we endeavored to do our international duty by fighting that criminal government with all our power and branding it as the one really guilty of the war...The masses agree with us enthusiastically, constantly widening circles of the proletariat share the conviction that the hour has struck for a settlement with capitalistic class rule...But this great task cannot be accomplished by the German proletariat alone; it can only fight and triumph by appealing to the solidarity of the proletarians of the whole world. Proletarians of all countries! This must be the last war! We owe that to the twelve million murdered victims, we owe that to our children, we owe that to humanity."" The nation-wide sectarian ""Jewish"" revolt threats were real and problematic enough to catch even the attention of Lenin himself, calling for an intensification of the overthrow efforts against the conservative German establishment to be converted into a liberal government by the Marxist and American models: ""What measures have you taken to fight the bourgeois executioners?...have councils of workers and servants been formed in the different sections of the city; have the workers been armed; have the bourgeoisie been disarmed...have the capitalist factories and wealth in Munich and the capitalist farms in its environs been confiscated; have mortgage and rent payments by small peasants been cancelled...have all paper stocks and all printing-presses been confiscated so as to enable popular leaflets and newspapers to be printed for the masses...have you taken over all the banks; have you taken hostages from the ranks of the bourgeoisie..."" Such widespread blows against the already-collapsed German empire (now the Weimar Republic) obviously played a great role in the popular image of Jews as having a role in Communism, the greatest rival of the Axis state doctrine. Communism was deemed polar to German values in its efforts to promote ""the weak"" (i.e. the poor and especially minorities) as opposed to the ""strong"" (Germans, Hungarians, Romanians, or to some thinkers ""Aryans""). The post-war liberal government installed by revolutionaries and the United States via the League of Nations and Versailles were deemed illegitimate of foreign, partisan, and especially Jewish invention. Hitler reflected upon such events in the statement in his Mein Kampf, ""I must remove the Jews. They are an element of revolt."" Later, other Jews likely contributed to this blanket labeling of the entire Jewish population as an enemy of the Germans. Herschel Grynszpan assassinated German diplomat Ernst vom Rath. David Frankfurter killed the famous Swiss National Socialist Wilhelm Gustloff, attempting to, as the Reich believed, prevent the Germans from reaching German-majority  Switzerland. Dutch-national Communist Marinus Lubbe had burned the Reichstag building, contributing to the socially-accepted Enabling Act (Gleichschaltung) of Adolf Hitler. His Jewish ancestry is sometimes disputed as an act of scapegoating. Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, American communists executed for espionage, were also Jewish, as were, some say, the famous communists Sacco and Vanzetti. From such presented evidence, we can see that a much greater inspection of historical cause and effect relations is required to study the Holocaust and the causes of one of history's most horrific events. Of course, six million Jews were not all trying to overthrow the government or rob German civilians, but the popular Antisemitism in Europe that occurred long before Hitler had even been elected has a blatant causality that goes beyond ignorance and scapegoating. Some historians have openly questioned the standard outline of the Holocaust tragedy, but are often reviled as anti-Semites themselves. The ignorant say the Holocaust never occurred, despite being arguably history's most documented event. A great deal of the Arab, Iranian, and Indian world deny the Holocaust either as not having occurred at all or having been exaggerated or falsified, including Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Others say the Holocaust was used for political purposes that led to the creation of Israel at the behest of American influence from the former British colony of Palestine. Those who question the Holocaust are often thrown in jail in Europe for the crime of Antisemitism or promoting hate speech. Controversial and now-jailed British historian David Irving made great studies into the causes of the genocide of these Jews. Many critics claim that his motive was to debunk the Holocaust in entirety, but his evidence of the causes and blame of the Holocaust must be analyzed if we wish to gain a true picture of history. He recognized that the event occurred, but that it was (he believed) minimal in comparison to its modern perception, or over-exaggerated. Much of his theories are rejected due to his former membership in radical right-wing or neo-Nazi groups, which obviously reveals an ulterior motive behind his scholastic studies. In his controversial novel Hitler's War, Irving questioned the role of Hitler as the catalyst of such mass murder: ""Hitler grasped quite early on that antisemitism would be a powerful vote catching force in Germany; [he] had no compunction against riding that evil steed right up to the portals of the chancellery in 1933; but that once inside and in power, he dismounted and paid only lip service to that part of his Party creed...Himmler is known to have visited Auschwitz in 1941 and 1942. Hitler never did...Many people, particularly in Germany and Austria, had an interest in propagating the version that the order of one madman originated the entire tragedy. Precisely when this order was given was, admittedly, left vague...In the newly discovered Goebbels diaries we learned that Hitler lectured the Gauleiter [governors] in September 1935 that ‘above all’ there were to be no excesses against the Jews and no persecution of non-Aryans...Every other historian has shut his eyes and hoped that this horrid, inconvenient document would somehow go away."" Such controversial evidence is challenged with great heat. Historian Gordon McFee agreed that no link has been found between Hitler and the Holocaust order, but assumes by probability that such an extensive order could not have been engaged without his active hand: ""Most experts have agreed that an action on the magnitude of a mass genocide, with the resultant possible ramifications, could not have proceeded without Hitler's personal approval. Until now, no written decision from Hitler has been found...The recent discoveries cannot be called a written decision (which, if it ever existed, was almost certainly destroyed by the end of the war), but they are certainly unequivocal confirmation that a clear decision was taken by Hitler."" From such evidence one can observe that a completely unavailable link in the Holocaust timeline has been ignored and the source has been determined solely by probability. For this reason, greater investigations must be engaged to determine the true causes and source of such broad crimes. McFee continues to criticize Irving and Holocaust ""revisionists"" by the degree of motive: ""In my opinion there is force in the opinion expressed by Evans that all Irving's historiographical ""errors"" converge, in the sense that they all tend to exonerate Hitler and to reflect Irving's partisanship for the Nazi leader. If indeed they were genuine errors or mistakes, one would not expect to find this consistency. I accept the defendants' contention that this convergence is a cogent reason for supposing that the evidence has been deliberately slanted by Irving."" Liberal and far-right motives play a great role in our portrayal of history, rendering a great deal of our knowledge of the causes inconclusive and potentially inaccurate, reinforcing historians' need to study into these causes greatly without bias. Without an unbiased investigation of the contributions of both parties (Jews and Germans) to the Holocaust without ""presentism"" (current ideas that influence our scope of the past), our knowledge and depictions of the Holocaust will instead continue to be largely inaccurate and short-sighted, polluted with bias and ulterior just as equally so as the blind and ignorant at the far-right."
13,2008: Election Of Your Life,politics," We're a year away from the next US presidential election and already there is universal desperation for change in this country, and through this country, the impetus for a better world.  Judging from the broad spectrum of candidates who've thrown their hat into the ring, no doubt change is what we'll get.  The question for all Americans is, how drastically do you want things to change, and in which direction?  And the only question all Americans must answer is, will you participate in the process of creating change, or will you sit this one out? If you're an American, the 2008 race may well be the election of your life.  Don't sit it out.  Here is why: If you are between age eighteen and twenty-five, your head is spinning wondering what happened to the America you hear people older than you reminisce about or of which you read in books.  That America has not been your America.  Since you were a child you've lived in a country increasingly party-divided, a country now coming off the closest two presidential elections in its recent history, which sequentially turned-out the highest voting populations ever.  Not to mention, you were introduced to the political system via the 2000 Presidential election fiasco, likely making you wonder whether your country is not just as corrupt as some archetypal Latin American dictatorship south of the border, one we've historically been eager to overthrow.  Furthermore, the bombardment of messages, technology, media hype and digital devices that you have never known life to be without makes it nearly impossible to pay attention to anything, or believe what you do absorb.   Yet you have unique ways of tuning in via the Internet, social media, and virtual group collaboration.  You have the cynicism of youth on your side to improve your power of discernment.  Now in your twenties, you have an opportunity to make your adult voice heard for, perhaps, the first time.  Please use it. If you're 30-ish or 40-ish, born in but too late to partake in the free love partying and political-rallying of the 60's and 70's, you're still old enough to remember a bucolic, likely suburban upbringing when only one of your parents worked to provide a comfortable family life.  A time before microwaves, cell-phones, the Internet and digital-everything, your childhood was filled with freedom; freedom from online pedophiles, freedom from overdeveloped land, freedom from terrorist attacks, and even the simple freedom of your mother not knowing where you rode your bike and hung out after school.  You've witnessed, lived through, and somehow adapted to drastically-accelerating change in your country and the world at large in a relatively short period of time.  This has given many of you a global mindset and desire to move away from the post-World War II capitalist, survivalist American Dream race of achievement toward something truer, better, but not necessarily bigger.  You see how we politically came to be where we are in America, and may have seen enough of the world to realize it doesn't have to be this way.  You are in your prime, you carry economic clout, and you hold leadership positions.  Now is your time to step up and be involved.  Please do so. If you are a baby-boomer, in your 50's or early 60's, the present state of our union should feel not only painfully familiar, but frightening.  You are no stranger to revolution, to change, and to standing up to the establishment.  Even if you weren't politically active during the Kennedy, Eisenhower, and Nixon years, you are definitely old enough to remember the lessons of those times and you have no excuse for not doing so.  Many of you, the progeny of early twentieth-century immigrants to the US, through your courage managed to mold equal opportunity for and abolish injustice against minorities.  Through your heritage and your diversity you've contributed to the multi-cultural, multi-racial mix that is America now.  You are the most numerous and wealthy generation this nation has ever seen.  Your ballast can sink or stabilize this ship.  Please, if you have not done so already, get on board and help us steer it in the right direction. And last but not least, if you are a veritable senior citizen, age 75 or older, well you've just about seen it all, haven’t you?  You've seen how governments, a world, a universe, can give and take life.  You have the long-term view of where we've been as a country, and you possess the wisdom of experience that can guide us toward where we're going.  You've been around enough to have lived the adage that those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.  You may be angry, you may be frightened, you may be resigned, you may be ill and infirm, or you may simply be old and tired.  But YOU ARE STILL HERE.  And we need you, all of you, to stay involved in preserving the America - not the government, not the politics - but the ideal, that so many of your generation fought and lost its lives for.  Please don't leave the ring yet, stay in and keep fighting the good fight.  The rest of us promise to cheer you on. It's not just that the presidential choices for 2008 are more diverse than ever before, it's that the stakes are higher than they've ever been in most Americans’ lifetimes.  With global warming, an energy crisis and bio-terrorism looming over our heads, we're talking about our very survival as a species.  The nuclear Armageddon fears of the past – whether the Russians or North Koreans will get jacked up enough to start World War III – pale in comparison to whether humans can survive a planetary climate or pole shift.  We're talking about things that may be beyond our control to change or reverse.  Now is the time for unity, not division.  The whole system needs to change if we're going to make it, as a country AND as citizens of the world.  We want someone to show us the way, not the old way, not the same way, but a new way. Is there such a person?  Of course there is, and likely more than one.  But you won't be able to discern who if you don't even know the line-up.  And you won't be able to chose your future if you don't get in the game.  The time is long overdue to break from a re-run of the past.  In evaluating who can lead America to a new future, don't just vote for the new faces you haven't seen in the race before.  Don't let gender, color, religions, looks or age distract you from the substance or lack thereof underneath.  Search for courage, search for independence, search for the candidates willing to cross party lines to do what's right.  Search for rules being broken because they need to be.  Know the issues and judge your candidates on where they stand.  And vote your conscience; vote your heart, not simply your party line. But most of all, vote!  Vote this time around especially in the primaries as well as the general election.  After all, 2008 may well be the election of your life."

15,USA in 2008 and after,politics," THERE WAS A time when the governing elite of the USA would look down at other countries during their periods of elections and say: ""We are the Beacon of Democracy. At least We Respect Each Other’s Opinions."" The debates at that time were peaceful, but with one defect - the Libertarians, Greens, and other alternative political movements were excluded. Since the 2000 Elections and with the 9/11 incident, the Republicans and Democrats (while being friendly to each other in private) started to fight and insult each other. The supporters of both parties have also taken inspiration from the United States governing elite and have insulted, committed acts of repudiation such as spitting, tearing down signs, and throwing tomatoes with eggs. In the middle of all of this, there is trouble every time a Libertarian, Green, or Alternative Party tries to participate in a debate. The Republicans and Democrats then unite and start with the ridicule: ""Who votes for an Alternative Party? That’s a wasted vote"". The Republicans and Democrats then continue with the use of terrorist tactics such as threats of job loss, physical, and psychological torture, in order to remain in power. The Republicans and Democrats have even used insults and arrests against Greens and Libertarian presidential candidates, all the while insulting each other. What has been the response of those who are of the educated class in America, watching the incidents of negativity in the United States Elections? Those who have not voted for an alternative political party are staying at home, or voting with their feet, to leave a country that is teetering on the border of anarchy or dissolution. The ones that are voting with their feet have voted to convert their US Dollars into Euros or to renounce their US Citizenship. Only time will tell what may happen, but it is hoped that this situation resolves itself. The alternatives are the following, without a resolution: A civil war based on region, race, or ethnicity The USA dividing into different republics or countries based on regions, or ethnicity For those who think this is too extreme, there is a Convention between States and Groups that want to secede from the USA or dissolve it. While Press TV hails the dawning of a new era in Latin America and hopes that it would repeat itself in the USA, the possibility is that a new dawn could mean homosexuality and amorality in New England and extreme racism in the South and Midwest against Latinos, Asians, African Americans, and Native Americans. The resolution is simple: A Multiracial Multiethnic Libertarian Green Government, which would take the USA out of the UN, hold accountable the governing elite of the USA (and their puppets in Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua) for their destructive policies of the Cold War, and return the US Dollar to the Gold Standard."
16,Barack Obama vs. Hillary Clinton,politics," The most talked-about personalities in the political as well as common circles of the United States are New York Senator, former first lady, Hillary Clinton and the Senator of Illinois, Barack Obama.  The interesting political significance about these two is that both are potential rival Presidential candidates for the 2008 elections in the United States, who hardly seem to possess any political difference of opinions against each other. They have already induced in opinion poll organizers, politicians as well as commoners, a great deal of curious guessing mentalities.  Internet statistics have also revealed that this issue has raked-in the most amounts of search interests among Internet users.  Another interesting statistics regarding the popularity levels of these personalities reveals significant results. Popularity levels among public for these two personalities analysed through the Internet-usage is pertains to the geographic area of the population generating interests in either of these two. The data shows Barack Obama’s popularity more among people living in Illinois, California, Florida, Ohio and Michigan predominantly.  However, Hillary Clinton’s popularity was concentrated more in the areas of Kansas, New York, Hawaii, New Jersey, and Missouri.  The data is quite clear to the extent that it definitely shows their popularity in and around their respective hometowns. Considering the facts from their latest consensus on voting against the confirmation of Chief Justice John Roberts to issues like the war declared on Iraq, there seems to be not much of a difference in their opinions in the political front.  Both of them voted against withdrawal of most of the U.S forces from Iraq as per the enactment of Sen. Russ Feingold’s measure.  The same was the case when they both had voted similarly against the immigration bill in the Senate. There have been a few isolated cases of their political disagreements.  It was during the time when the mandate for automakers was passed in the Senate.  The mandate was proposed in the senate forcing automobile manufacturers to achieve a fuel economy of 40 mile per gallon by 2017.  Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton had voted for and against it respectively.  However, predominantly there seems to have been little political differences and have always voted in tandem in most of the issues. Hence, most politicians and journalists opine t that the dividing line could be predominantly determined only by the intangible characteristics.  Senator Obama’s preference towards futuristic, youthful and charismatic thinking is quite popular among the public in the United States.  Senator Hillary Clinton’s accomplishments as a mature, shrewd Senator and an ace politician, has gained her much popularity among the public. However, be it considering Internet popularity rates, or even the intangible characteristics, it would be too early to predict their vote banks within the population.  It would surely take a few more months, after their election campaigns start heating up one could again start using special tools to predict their popularities."
17,A Message To All Peace Activist And Peace Seekers,politics," The missing element in the peace movements has always been the lack of a practical plan for peace that provides a logical alternative to all war that will be universally accepted by everyone. This is why peace organizations rarely last the test of time.  Just protesting with ""stop this"" or ""stop that"" and not providing a long lasting permanent solution to the problem will lose steam after a while. Our studies have lead us to concluded that there can be no real peace on this earth until that peace is a total peace that includes every person on earth without exception; therefore, all efforts for pursuing a true and lasting peace must be geared towards establishing World Peace.  In our studies to understand what was needed to achieve peace on earth, we looked at the three areas that are essential to establishing peace on earth, the governmental structures, religions structures, and The People. It became obvious to us that the governmental and religious structures lacked the means to establish World Peace because of their many differing goals, policies, and ideologies, which create many divisions among the people. We are not saying that the governments and religions do not want peace on earth; just the opposite is true and they would overwhelmingly embrace real peace on earth if it were possible.  That lead us to The People and an understanding of what their role is in establishing World Peace. It is common knowledge that humans are the most intelligent and dominant form of life on this earth and have a natural desire to be free and live in peace.  The truth is; The People are the one true power on this earth because nothing man-made can function or survive without the support and efforts of The People, including the functions of the governments, religions, and other essential systems created by man. The People working as a collective body have the power and the right to determine how they want to live on this earth and they have the right and power to determine how their governments, religions, and corporate structures function in this world. When The United People of this world decided that they want to live in a peaceful and civilized world, nothing could stop them because they could naturally justify pulling their support form anyone or anything that stands in The Peoples way. All humans, since the beginning of human existence, have inherited and carried an instinctive belief that they have a right to survive, be free, and live in peace along with other beliefs described as our unwritten Evolutionary Human Rights.  Scientific studies have proven that this belief structure is exactly the same in all humans and is the one natural common bond that all humans share. This is why when you ask anyone, from any part of this world, if they want to survive, be free, and live in peace, or if they believe they are entitled to Human Rights they will automatically say yes.  Understanding this led us to discover that the path to World Peace is through establishing an internationally legalized Bill of Human Rights that All People on earth would be legally entitled too without exception. This International Bill of Human Rights would, establish a standard legal value for all human live, be overwhelmingly accepted by all People, and would become the Natural Laws of Humanity that all governments, and others, would be legally bound to honor and abide by. What this world lacks at the present time is a legal, just, and moral system to function under on an international level.  Any functioning international system must provide guidelines for how governments and others will function within that system.  The plan for World Peace provides a peaceful and civilized international system for the governments and others to function under that will never allow for a one-world type government or any type of totalitarian global rule of The People."
18,5 Questions that Reveal Who Should be Our Next President,politics," Do you think George Bush knows how much a bus pass costs? When was the last time you think Dick Cheney pulled out an envelope full of coupons to save a few bucks at the grocery store? Does he even know what a grocery store is? I do not want to bash the President. But what I want to do is explain why so many of our national politicians aren't ready to tackle the everyday problems the average American faces – simply because they have no idea what they are. During my Illinois mayoral campaign this year, I held seven town hall meetings with topics ranging from improving education to accessing the healthcare system.  Two trends stood out to me as I listened to the American people. First, I talked to people who had not voted in twenty years because they felt like they did not have anyone for whom to vote.  These Americans felt voiceless in this local democratic system. This sense of hopelessness and voicelessness caused me to reflect on what would cause a person not to exercise the right to vote for twenty years given the fact that Americans gave their lives for the right to vote.  I quickly concluded that it must be more than apathy as described by many people. As I continued talking to people during my seven town hall meetings and on the campaign trail, I concluded that the reason for what we call apathy is actually disconnection.  American citizens are disconnected from the democratic process because our leaders are disconnected from the American people. The second trend I observed during my campaigns was the citizens' inability to see the connections between local, regional and national elections.  The local leaders of today become the national leaders of tomorrow.  If they are disconnected from the people today, what can we expect tomorrow?  The American people have a responsibilityto ensure that this does not continue.  We have been too passive.  It should not take an electoral crisis to bring people out to the polls.  A crisis usually means something of value has already been lost.  We can and must be more proactive with the future of our nation. Disconnection does not eliminate men and women with sincere desires to serve in a servant leader capacity but it means two things. First, it means that we have to challenge each of them to reconnect. Second, disconnection requires what I call an ""intentional leadership style ""An ""intentional leadership style"" requires three things: 1.Continuous self assessments asking, ""Am I connected to the American people?  If not, what can I do to reconnect with the American people?You cannot be honest with yourself until you are honest with the American people. Are you personally aware of my struggle or just aware of my struggle through statisticians? 2.Create diverse ideological cabinet/team. You want someone who will disagree with you respectfully.  Healthy dialogue is the birthplace of creativity.  The phenomenon of group think creates unhealthy and disconnected policy. 3.In addition to ideological diversity, maintain fluid teams to ensure you have the best possible people during the life cycles of your public leadership. This means change is necessary. Stagnation breeds nothing but death. We have a responsibility to our children and to the future of America to move pass name recognition generated by family legacy and wealth as the determining factors in our choices if we even decide to make a choice see and as a result of disconnection and frustration. Many have walked away from the democratic process and continue to walk away from the process in frustration or even worst did not feel invited into the process by the hypocrisy we now see. A last name does not make you a president and wealth does not prove to me of your ability to lead the country. It means you are a fundraiser. Yes, the presidential candidates are disconnected from the American people? However, there are degrees of disconnection.  The candidates do not have the same degree of disconnection from the American People.  In response to what I heard from the America people as a two time mayoral candidate, I have developed a tool to begin to evaluate how connected our leadership is to the American people.  I call this evaluation tool, the ""Ten Degrees of Disconnection.""  The ""Ten Degrees of Disconnection"" is a ten question litmus test.  The ten questions are available at the virtual town hall meeting website. In response to this disconnection, I have also launched a virtual town hall meeting to share with you what I see and to hear from you about your experience so we can support each other in making stand in our individual neighborhoods and communities and to make a national stand in our nation.  Log onto the virtual website to reserve your virtual seat for the next national discussion."
19,Alternatives to catching criminals,politics," Working in the community can be hard work. Doing good isn't all that easy, especially when there's very little money and hardly any support to go round. Inevitably, a lot of time is spent trying to raise funds to make things happen. In Britain that means applying to charitable trusts and all the quasi-governmental organisations like the National Lottery, and that means getting a bank account opened. Ehhh, that's when life gets difficult. This week I turned up at my local bank with an application to open a bank account on behalf of the newest charitable venture in our area that I was supporting. I thought I had things ready. I had filled in the form and got my neighbour to sign it too. No chance, I was told. For a start, the Manager of the bank was on her lunch-break and couldn't see me until later. I offered to come back the next day. That would be fine, I was told, as long as the two of us showed up. My colleague would have to be there too, in person. It was because they didn't know us, I was told. I sympathised. After all, I could have been an international drug dealer seeking to launder my many millions of pounds of ill-gotten gains. I made an appointment for the following afternoon. The next morning, waiting for the appointed hour, I had a brain wave. Sure, the local bank didn't know me, but both of us who signed the form also had an account at the same bank at the main building in the city. They knew me there, I reasoned. I'd go there and get the account opened. After all, I had the form all filled in and signed. What else would I need? Another form, I was told later. Yes, they knew me at the main branch of the bank, the woman assured me, but it was a 'new account' and they'd have to see both of us, in person, (just like the first person said). No, I couldn't open the account then and there. I'd have to go away. Frustrated, I complied and moved on to my former appointment that afternoon, fearing that I'd only be met with another hurdle. Sure enough. I hadn't filled in the 'application form', the right one. I had filled in the 'mandate form' okay, but that wasn't enough. There was a second form. I was sent away. Well yes, the answer to all the form filling and 'showing identification' and personal appearances, is that they want to avoid money launderers. So, I want to ask you this question – all these precautions, do you honestly think that they would they really deter a real-life drug-dealing money launderer? From what I've seen of such people on the television, it wouldn't slow them up for one minute. For a start, they probably have enough fake passports to convince a lowly bank teller that they are who they say they are. Failing that, they could offer a bribe (or send their lawyer in their place). If all else fails, they might kidnap the bank manager's wife and hold her hostage until the terrified man complies with their every wish. Wouldn't they? Yes, the problem with the real world is that the real criminals don't stick to the rules, (that's where they get the name 'criminal' from). It's only the dazed and baffled ordinary citizen who gets stuck by these procedures. I've got another example. Ever been driving down the road, keeping to the speed limit, when you get overtaken by a real flash car, driving dangerously and speeding outrageously? What makes them think they can get away with exceeding the limit and breaking the rules? Because they do. A friend who's a policeman told me that the real criminals simply ignore all parking fines, resist all summonses and never turn up in court. They guess – probably rightly – that the police department won't have the time or personnel to come and arrest them. The only people who break the law and pay the fines, he told me, are the law-abiding citizens. And another. In Britain, it's a fact that there are a number of people who claim to be out of work, draw unemployment benefits from the state, then go off and do work in secret and get paid for that too. The newspapers get all steamed up about these 'benefit cheats' and demand action. It adds up, they storm, to a total of over fifty million pounds a year. Consequently, the government employs hundreds of investigators and sends them out to track down these 'criminals'. So far, so logical. What undercuts it is that the Internal Revenue department has calculated that the amount of tax they lose each year to people who cheat on their tax returns is over five hundred million pounds. That's ten times as much as the amount lost to people pretending not to be working when they are. Ten times. What's the government's response? They employ investigators too. It's estimated that there are about a tenth of the number of investigators in the tax department as there are in the Benefits department. Ten times the money stolen, a tenth of the effort to catch those 'criminals'. What does that prove? That today, in our modern world, there are alternatives to catching criminals. One is to look as though you're doing something about it, as in the bank account example, when, in fact, you don't even inconvenience the real bad guys. The other is to allocate resources to the cases that are aggressively unpopular with the public, such as the 'unemployed' cheats, and do little about the cases that might elicit public sympathy, such as tax dodgers. That way, you stay popular. You haven't done what you said you'd do, of course, which is to address the problem. But when did anyone have the time to notice that?"
20,Hillary Clinton: First Viable Female President,politics," A former First Lady and a six-year New York senator who’s the first viable female candidate for President of the United States, Hillary Clinton stands out among the dozens of presidential candidates for the 2008 election. She’s definitely a frontrunner for the Democrats, and despite women presidential candidates being on the ballot for third parties before, as the nation is effectively bipartisan, Hillary Clinton shows the first real promise for breaking the tradition of electing only white males to the office of the president. The United States, the so-called ""melting pot"" of cultures and land of endless possibilities, is one of the last first-world nations to have never elected a female president or prime minister. What would it take for the United States to elect a female president? Will Hillary Clinton be the one to break America’s presidential tradition? If there was ever a time for a majority of Americans to deviate from tradition, it’s now, in one of the most long-running and competitive pre-election seasons ever seen in American history. Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, John Edwards, and the other Democratic presidential candidates might have the power to overtake the Republican candidate because of the low approval rating for the currently Republican executive branch of government. Although not the 2/3 majority that Congress needs to enact any real change, the fact that the 2006 midterm elections led the Democratic Party to sweep aside the long-standing Republican majority in the House and Senate shows that America is ready for change. Hillary Clinton could be that change. Who else among the presidential candidates has worked so intimately with the executive branch before, as wife of former President Bill Clinton? Who else was part of a support network for a presidency that aimed to and began to balance the national debt while cutting taxes for millions of low-income families and enacting change to make a steady, better economy? Although Hillary Clinton was part of an administration mired with controversies, those controversies were for the most part personal and did not directly affect American citizens’ lives, unlike a long-term military quagmire or one day having to be responsible for paying back a national debt of over $8 trillion through higher taxes. So far, Hillary Clinton promises in her campaign an end to the American presence in Iraq and a form of national health care. Many people happy with the current administration claim that these promises would lead to disaster. The problem is the United States is already in a disaster: in Iraq, for example, and when millions of Americans can’t afford to see the doctor. The cry for change among American people is louder than ever. Electing Hillary Clinton as President of the United States is one way to see real change in the country—not only by electing the nation’s first woman president, but by radically pointing the country in new and promising directions."

1,Dark Secret About Education Part II,politics," In my previous article called the Dark Secret About Education, I used four of my five steps (from a coaching process I call successful living )to focus on the need to reform our educational system. This article will complete my discussion. Believe in Positive Power. We can revitalize the whole educational system by more study of an emphasis on ethics, logic, philosophy, religions, the arts, sciences, and a greater awareness of the power of positive thinking. Our educators could start by teaching young people, The Five Steps To Successful Living. Above all else, young people should be given more opportunity to creatively discuss, and become involved in solving current social problems. We need more programs like the Olympics of the Mind, for example. Our country can benefit from inspired adults who sponsor projects that provide rewards to our youth for trying to resolve our great social challenges:  the environment, crime, racism, violence, substance abuse, obesity, poverty, incarceration, rehabilitation, and even terrorism. We also need to believe that our educational system can and will involve parents once again in a collaborative effort to educate our young people, and model acceptable social behaviors. Parents may have to be held responsible for keeping their kids in school, and for teaching appropriate social values, preventative healthcare and positive mental attitudes. Parents who leave their children alone all day to watch television, or let them wander the streets unsupervised, or abuse, or neglect them, could be held accountable by our society. They might be encouraged to pay for the social treatment programs necessary to make up for the deficiency in their parenting skills. To this end, our juvenile court system with high recidivism rates and antiquated laws, (encouraging the reunification of abused and neglected children with parents who are damaged mentally, emotionally, and socially), all need more reassessment and renovation. The courts must hold families accountable for child abuse, neglect, and criminal behavior. We should hold the educational and juvenile court system accountable for providing the necessary treatment and support services necessary to salvage children, who are damaged by the bad decisions and self-destructive behaviors of their parents. I believe parenting is not a right, it is a privilege. I think our culture should protect the rights of children to be safe from harmful parents as much as the legal systems protects the rights of all adults. If necessary, pass a new constitutional amendment to guarantee our children legal protection from damaged parents who sexually, physically, or emotional abuse them. We can't afford to wait any longer for improvements in the educational system. Our dark secret says,"" Leave it alone; somebody else can fix it."" We need to face the social problems of today, not deny them, or believe we are too busy to resolve them. We can act now to do something positive about these problems. Let us begin by expressing our feelings, both negative and positive about our educational crisis. We can start using positive thinking to develop a meaningful plan of action. The only thing that can try to hold us back or our country back is the dark secret of fear. The negative side whispers in our ears: ""Nothing better can be done at this time."" But the only power fear has is the influence we give it by avoidance, denial, despair, anger, depression, guilt, and shame. The Five Steps also shouts in our other ear a more positive message: Begin by facing the dark secret, release the negative feelings, and replace them with positive emotions and good thoughts. Actually, we can solve any problem if we devout our total creative energy to finding the right solutions. Which voice will influence you today?"
2,Green Card Lottery Visa,politics," A Green Card Lottery Visa. Boy, what a mouthful! Yet, when you pick it apart and get down to the details, it is really a very simple program. Every year, the United States allows a certain number of people to (legally) enter the country. Each is issued a visa to do so, the so called “Green Card.” Well, each year, the U.S. Government sets aside between 50,000 to 55,000 of those visas to give out via a lottery held in October. The system is officially known as the Diversity Visa Lottery Program. Now, considering the huge numbers of people who want a visa, the chances of winning are quite slim. Yet, there is always that chance! And, after all, someone has to win, so why not take a chance and see if it happens? Every year, thousands of people sign up to take a chance at the lottery. The program is available in many countries, and many people all over the world apply. First, each year, you can to apply to the lottery for green cards. And, in keeping with current technology, the application process can be carried out online. All it requires is that you log into the U.S. State Department website. Yet, that is but the first step. If you win, that is no guarantee that you will get into the country. That is just the first step in the process. Next, there is a fee of $750 U.S. Dollars, which is paid to the U.S. Embassy in the country where you applied. But, here is a bit of good news: you only pay that fee if you win. There is no cost associated with the initial application. After that comes several medical exams, all of which must be passed. In addition, the U.S. Government generally wants professional people to win. So, you must have an advanced level of higher education. Or, at the very least, you must have worked in some sort of professional position for a minimum of two years, and done so within the past five years! If, after all that, you still meet their requirements, the ordeal is not over yet. No, there is still more to come. The United States, like any other nation, has enough of a crime problem to deal with on its own, thank you very much. So, they insist on a very thorough background check. And, not just any simple police investigation. No, the checking is done by the United States. So, not only do you have to be a professional to win, you must also have a clean police record before. So, it is easy to see that the Green Card Lottery Visa is not the simplest of programs. But, it is a means of getting into the United States legally. So, when you consider the prize, it is an excellent program to enroll in. As they say, if you don’t try, you can never win."
3,Is This the Age of Hillary Clinton?,politics," As she has become a prominent political figure, many people wonder whether this is the age of Hillary Clinton. Many people feel that she has the potential to be the first female President of the United States. However, she has been a controversial figure for many people, which could work against her political ambitions. Hillary Rodham Clinton was born on October 26, 1947 in Chicago, Illinois. She eventually attended Wellesley College and majored in political science. Although she was a member of the Republican Party, she would switch over to the Democratic Party because of her views on the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights Movement. After graduating, Clinton entered the Yale Law School. During her time there, she provided free legal advice to low income individuals and worked on child abuse cases. She graduated with her law degree in 1973 and began a post graduate study at the Yale Child Study Center. In 1974, she began teaching at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville School of Law. Here, she met Bill Clinton and the two were married in October 1975. In November 1976, Bill Clinton was elected Attorney General for Arkansas and the couple began their political careers. When the couple moved to Little Rock, she joined the Rose Law Firm. She also served as the chair for the Legal Services Corporation. She was the first lady of Arkansas for 12 years while her husband was governor. In 1993, Bill Clinton took office as the President of the United States, making Hillary Clinton the nation’s First Lady, a title that she would hold for eight years. She became the first First Lady to have an office in the White House and the first to hold a post-graduate degree. During her time as First Lady, Hillary Clinton worked health care initiatives. Many people felt that the First Lady should not be actively involved in political matters. The years Bill Clinton served as President were marred by a number of political scandals, including his affair with Monica Lewinsky. After he left office, Hillary Clinton was urged to run for the United States Senate from the state of New York. The Clintons bought a house in the state and she won the 2000 election. She was sworn in on January 3, 2001. As a member of the Senate, Clinton has served on a number of committees and continued to support the idea of universal health care in the United States. She was reelected in 2006 and her approval rate as a Senator has remained high at over 60 percent in August of 2007. In January 2007, Hillary Clinton announced her intention to run for President of the United States in the 2008 election. Some people remain concerned that Clinton is too polarizing of a figure, even though she has led all Democratic nominees in popularity through the first part of 2007. Whether this is the age of Hillary Clinton or not remains to be seen. She may become the first female President of the United States or she may be too much of a controversial person to gain the votes and support needed."
4,Why was the fall of USSR without blood shed?,politics," carry out a large war? During the consideration of the first question you would automatically get the answer to the second question, therefore, I begin from it. Let’s consider all orderly: for a beginning – what is such a large war? What sense we would put into this understanding? Large war – its such war as result of which the boundaries of warring government changes and (or) the warring factions incur large number of people and material causalities. Beginning from such understanding of large war and applied it to not long a go in the past on Russian empire and USSR, large war – it’s Patriotic war in the year 1812, Crimean (Eastern) war in 1853 – 1856, Russian – Turkey war in 1877 – 1878, Civil war in Russia in 1917 – 1922 and of course both World Wars. And also little wars, all possible conflicts and other armed collision you could count several numbers, but here we would not make mention of all, just only limit our self after the period of Civil war: before the Great Patriotic war – it’s Spain, Hasan lake, Halhin Gol and after it – Korea, Vietnam, Egypt and Afghanistan. Apart from this in USSR in the end of XX century broke out several internal conflicts: Armenia, and Azerbaijan ( Nagorni Karabakh), Tadjikistan (civil war) Moldova (Pridnestrovie), Georgia (civil war: Abkhazia and Southern Osetija) and Russia (Chechnya). As it could be seen, little wars within the USSR were many and some of such wars continuous till now, in 2005. That these wars are large wars for those small countries that were created after the fall of USSR – it’s another question, question of scale: considering for an example, Georgia alone out of the whole USSR, her war with Abkhazia would be taken as a large war. In conformity also with the three Slavic republics of USSR large war would mean, loses of about million (or more) killed and wounded. On the territories of Russia, Ukraine, and Byelorussia were been carried out fighting actions – everybody aware of Chechnya: Byelorussia, Ukraine never took part in the war, at the same time Russia and Ukraine are taking part in conflicts occurring far away (across the sea) under the aegis of UNO. Such are the situations of things, at a first glance it looks strange – why for an example no fighting going on not in the European part of Russia, not in Siberia, not in Ukraine, not in Byelorussia? In Siberia it’s clear – the last large war took place under Ermak in the end of the 16 century, that is the indigene of Siberia never fought about 400 years back (truly, in the southern Siberia there was captured war in 1917 – 1922), - in 4 centuries they never fought war, why would they fight now? But why no fighting in the European part of USSR?! Why?! Because have got tired to be at war!!! Let me explain my conception. The Great patriotic war ended in the year 1945 – ended in brutal blood shedding war in which the nations of the former USSR incurred several millions loses of people and uncountable material loses. Remember the map of the German – fascist troop movement: towards November 1942 enemy captured Pribaltic republics, Byelorussia, Moldavia, Ukraine and part of Russia, advanced to the north up to Leningrad, in the center – to Moscow, in the south – to Stalingrad and predgori Caucasus – to the line of Taman – Maikop – Nalchik – Mozdok. And now no war here (apart from Pridnestrovie) because the great Patriotic war stormed this area! Prednestrovie – it’s and exceptional case which only confirms the principle: Nations have got tired of war in the territory of the USSR occupied with Germans by the end of 1942 and this people do not want to fight even in 60 years after the war ended. You could object to the fact, that wars in the Caucasus and Middle Asia occurred among people with different religions and because it’s a natural fact that people with on religion doesn’t fight against each other.. Against this assumption 2 regions could be mentioned; Tadjikistan (population mainly Moslems) and Georgia (population mainly Orthodox). In Tadjikistan the Tadjik fought against the Tadjik during the civil war in 1992: also similar case in georgic in that same year 1992! Which means that, national and religious belongs are not the main reasons of the war in Caucasus and in Middle Asia in the 90s. Further, during the Great Patriotic war representative of all nations participated, began fighting in the 90s many representatives as well gave their life for Victory: due to this it shows that not all the nations in USSR are yet fed up in fighting, at the same time as observed in the present development of situation, it’s not like that: fed up of fighting (i.e. tired of war) only a particular part of such nations, and the people as a whole not fed up. But it follows that the people in Caucasus and Middle Asia gave all what demanded from them g\for victory, - and this is their happiness, that for an example Tbilisi never know such battle which thundered in  Novorossiysk  far away from it! So, on the territory occupied by German – fascist troops towards November 1942 not the nations were belligerent, but there is a question here, when would they fight? Assumption that everlasting peace fell on this land – its naive: it’s better more to study the history! It means that, the major question is when? German began Second World War after the year 1939 -1918 = 21 years after the end of the former world war; the people of Yugoslavia began fighting in the year 1991 – 1945 = 46 years after the end of the second world war; Sweden didn’t fight from 1743 till the current time (2005), that’s 2005 – 1743 = 262 years – in such case it could be seen from these examples in relation to the duration of peaceful period that spread on countries therefore we could not cover all but concentrate on the most important to us -  territory of European part of USSR. As a starting point we select the civil war in the year 1917 – 1922 in Russia. In this war all great nations in Russian empire participated: the civil war covered almost all the territory of  Russian empire, apart from Siberia region which is the most strenuous region for life. In such a case, could be accepted that from the year 1920 the people in USSR lived in peace. Large war came in the yare 1941 – when the Great patriotic war began, dividing the territory of USSR into two parts: the first part – is the territory occupied by the Germans towards November 1942 (the date when the enemy troops made the most advanced movement) and the second part – Caucasus, Middle Asia, Siberia and far east. The nations in the Middle Asia and Caucasus started fighting in the interval from the year 1988 (Nagorni Karabach) to 1994 (Chechnya). Approximately, all the conflicts in Middle Asia and Caucasus began in 1990, and then it means that these nations lived in peace from 1990 – 1920 = 70 years, that is each of these nations didn’t experienced large war for a period of 70 years. At the same time Pribaltic nations, as well as Byelorussia, Ukraine and almost all the European part of Russia lived in peace only 2005 – 1945 = 60 years: and towards 1990 they lived in peace only 1990 – 1945 = 45 years! It follows to be noted again such fact – in the year 1941 the nations in the European part of the USSR were compelled to go into war, that is apart from their private desire they were induced to participate in the war unleashed by German Hitler – at the same time in 1988 – 1994 the nations in Middle Asia and Caucasus started fighting without been compelled, that is apart from internal reasons nobody attacked them. In most of the cases war busted out in order to became independent (Abkhazia, Southern Osetija and Chechnya), that means war caused by internal reasons, - the people of these 4 republics were not forced into war: they decided themselves, that they could not be anymore under “unnecessary” government to them, and took the choice to separate, and when the situation became highly tense, they went to the extreme and couldn’t come into an agreement on certain conditions, and  the war began on becoming  Independence. Among ethnics conflicts (Armenia and Azerbaijan) and civil (Tadjikistan, Georgia) also could not be called external compelled reasons – these are all internal conflicts. Now we could answer both questions. Question N 1.  When would the people of European part of USSR be prepared to carry out a large war? Answer. In 2015 (1945 +70 = 2015). Explanation. Over 70 years life without a large war majority of the nations in Caucasus and Middle Asia have accumulated strength for wars, without been compelled, therefore logically we would assume that Slavonic states: Russia, Ukraine and Byelorussia would accumulate similar strength after 70 years, that is towards 1945 + 70 = 2015. Question  N2. Why was the fall of USSR without blood shed? Answer: because the people of |Russia, Ukraine and Byelorussia haven’t rested enough towards the year 1991 after they ended the Second World War. Explanation N 1. The fall of USSR took place on the 8th of December 1991 under the initiative of the leaders of Russia Ukraine and Byelorussia, that is the republics that 46 years back ended the great Patriotic war – over little period after it ended (46 years peace in the European part of USSR, lesser than 70 years peace in Caucasus and Middle Asia), therefore these three Slavonic republics were able to separate in peace. Explanation N 2. But why the Soviet Union collapsed “without blood shed’’”? But during the process of its disintegration on the territory were several local blood shed conflicts! Answer. These were little conflicts on the scale of the whole USSR. A real ‘”Blood shed” of the Soviet union _ it’s civil war and military intervention in Russia in 1917 – 1922: during that time people died of hunger, sickness, terror and in battle (different figures given) from 8 to 13 million people, up to 2 million people immigrated, industrial production fell to 4 – 20% at the level of the year 1913, and agricultural production reduced about twice. If in case that USSR in the year 1991 collapsed ‘”with blood shed, then minimal number of those that would have been killed and died from hunger and sickness would have not been lesser than 1 million people (most probably figure – 3 – 4 million). As observed, this never took place; therefore, the fall of the Soviet Union was without blood shed. So, towards the year 2015 the people of Russia, Ukraine and Byelorussia would prepare for a large war, but would they actively fight? May be the people of these countries would enter into a large war after a century – in the year 2050 or after one and half century – in the year 2100? Or they would limit themselves in little conflicts ( in this case I don’t mean “fighting or conflict among themselves” – in case the wish is there, and war could be caused not only by misunderstanding neighbors, and as well across the sea!). But perhaps they would consider peace to war, like an example Switzerland? May be would be so…. The future is covered with cloud … who knows.. but that towards the year 2015 these nations would have great power – it’s no doubt! And to which direction the power would be directed? To better their welfare, or their cultural life or external aggression, and perhaps all together … I don’t know: now we could discourse about this only on certain level of probability. But one aspect is clear to me – discord creates conflict and conflict creates war. Representatives of hundreds of nationalities fought in the Great patriotic war as a whole, regardless of little differences separately among their representatives, - and conquered! People of different nations, we should live in peace with each other! Either, if we would not live like this, then our enemies, then our enemies would feel our weakness and have more hope on own strength; at first powerful external enemy become more aggressive, and weak external enemy becomes more insolent, - and then they would instigate in us ethnics fire and attack - and then together with external war we would have internecine warfare! People, remember: the land on which our fathers and grand fathers shed their blood during the Great Patriotic war, gradually dry up under the affectionate rays of the sun and becomes more and more receptive to fire, towards another fire of the large war! And if (what shouldn’t be!) it occurs on our land, then the probability that it would be even more and civil, Great and in all the 3 Slavonic republics have no precise  accepted by all global national idea as if that which was in Imperial Russia: Orthodoxy, Autocracy, Nationality. Therefore now it’s proper to cherish and foster the unifying tendencies with all, those who sincerely wishes; apart from this, it’s necessary to put out all possible differences on any level – and to put them out its necessary to be tolerance, inter compromise and benevolence. People, let’s live together and live in peace."
5,Famous Filibusters in U.S. Political History,politics," The filibuster as a political delaying tactic has been a part of the American political process since the adoption of the U.S. Constitution. Though it was not used in the early years of the nation, the filibuster has been used hundreds of times since the 1840's. Here are a few of the famous filibusters from our political history. The U.S. Constitution does not limit the length or nature of debate on the floors of the Senate or the House of Representatives. The House has since adopted rules which limit the length of debate since the House has a very large number of Representatives. But the smaller Senate has always upheld the right of a recognized Senator to debate an issue for as long as he or she wishes to hold the floor. Senate Rule 19 and Rule 22, the cloture rule adopted in 1917, create some guidelines for conducting a debate and for closing the debate when it becomes lengthy. Senator Henry Clay In 1841 Senator Henry Clay proposed a bank bill that was opposed by Senator John C. Calhoun who began a lengthy, seemingly unending, rebuttal. Calhoun basically created the modern filibuster. Clay threatened to change the Senate rules in order to close debate on the issue. Clay's colleague, Thomas Hart Benton, rebuked Clay and accused him of trying to stifle the Senate's right to unlimited debate. Through the next few turbulent decades and into the 1960's the filibuster was used often by Southern Democrats to block civil rights legislation. The filibuster had been seen by the minority party as a tool to combat the potential ""tyranny of the majority,"" but the frequent usage of the filibuster by the Southern Democrats became characterized as the ""tyranny of the minority."" Senate Rule 22 President Woodrow Wilson suggested that some limits be placed on the unlimited debate concept. In 1917 the Senate adopted Senate Rule 22, now known as the ""cloture"" rule. The new Rule 22 provided the mechanism to close out debate on a legislative bill and bring the bill up for a vote if cloture was approved by 67% of the Senate. The 67% requirement remained in effect until 1975 when Rule 22 was amended to allow a 60% agreement to invoke cloture. Cloture Rule 22 was tested in 1919 when the Senate was asked to ratify the Treaty of Versailles, which ended World War I. The treaty was debated and filibustered, but a 67% majority voted to end the filibuster and to bring the treaty to a vote. Senator Huey Long Senator Huey Long, the fiery and colorful senator from Louisiana, made the filibuster famous between 1932 and 1935 when he utilized it several times to stall legislation that he considered unfair to the poor. Long frustrated his opponents and entertained the Senate gallery by reading Shakespeare, reciting shrimp and oyster recipes and talking about ""pot-likkers."" An amendment to Senate Rule 19 later required that debate on legislation be germane to the issue being debated. On June 12, 1935, Senator Long engaged in his most famous filibuster. A bill was before the Senate to eliminate the provision for the Senate to confirm senior National Recovery Act employees. Senator Long opposed the bill because he didn't want his political adversaries in Louisiana to obtain lucrative N.R.A. jobs. Senator Long spoke for 15 hours and 30 minutes running well into the evening and early morning hours with senators dozing at their desks. Long read and analyzed each section of the Constitution, a document which he claimed had become ""ancient and forgotten lore"" under President Roosevelt's New Deal. After the reading of the Constitution Senator Long offered to give advice to the remaining senators on any subject of their choosing. No senator took Long up on his offer but the gallery patrons began sending notes to the floor for Senator Long to extemporize on. That kept Long going into the early hours of the morning. At 4 a.m. Long yielded the floor in order to use the restroom and his proposal was defeated. James Stewart brought more fame to the filibuster when he played the role of Senator Jefferson Smith in the 1939 film, ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."" Stewart's character launched into a filibuster in response to an attempt to ridicule him. Senator Wayne Morse Senator Wayne Morse from Oregon was called ""The Tiger of the Senate"" and served in the Senate under 5 Presidents. In 1952 Senator Morse left the Republican Party, claiming independent status, when he objected to sections of the party platform and Dwight Eisenhower's choice of Richard Nixon as his vice presidential running mate. Senator Morse claimed that the Republican Party had left him. On April 24, 1953, Senator Morse began to filibuster against Tidelands Oil legislation. He kept the floor for 22 hours and 26 minutes, breaking the filibuster record of 18 hours held by his mentor, Wisconsin Senator Robert La Follette. Senator Morse is remembered through numerous colorful stories. For example, Clare Booth Luce, former U.S. Senator and Ambassador to Italy had to resign her appointment when she made the insulting but funny remark that her problems with Senator Morse began when he was kicked in the head by a horse. Senator Strom Thurmond About 9 p.m. on August 28, 1957, Senator Strom Thurmond rose before the Senate and announced, ""Mr. President, I rise to speak against the so-called voting rights bill, H.R. 6127."" His own staff had not been informed about Senator Thurmond's intentions to filibuster the bill, but they knew something was up when they saw Thurmond gathering considerable reading material. Senator Thurmond had prepared himself for a long filibuster on the Senate floor. Earlier in the day he had spent time in the Senate steam room, dehydrating himself so that he would absorb all the water he drank without having to visit the restroom. His wife packed a steak sandwich lunch for him and she stayed in the family gallery throughout the night. Thurmond brought a quantity of malted milk tablets and throat lozenges from his office. Senator Thurmond began his filibuster by reading each state's election statutes. He later read and discussed an opinion by Chief Justice Taft. He also read and discussed the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, and Washington's Farewell Address. His staff, concerned for Senator Thurmond's health, was finally successful in getting him to leave the floor. After 24 hours and 18 minutes, a record that still stands, Senator Thurmond concluded his remarks with, ""I expect to vote against the bill."" The bill was defeated. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 On June 10, 1964, Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia finished his address begun on the previous day, slightly more than 14 hours earlier. He filibustered against the Civil Rights Act of 1964, an act which was debated by Byrd and others for 57 working days, including 6 Saturdays. Senate President Hubert Humphrey from Minnesota needed 67 votes to be able to carry the motion for cloture. Minority Leader Senator Everett Dirksen, the always eloquent senator from Illinois procured the Republican votes necessary to pass the cloture motion. ""Stronger than all the armies is an idea whose time has come,"" he said. ""The time has come for equality of opportunity in sharing in government, in education, and in employment. It will not be stayed or denied. It is here!"" The final roll call vote on cloture resulted in 71 votes in favor and 29 votes opposed. It was the first time in history that cloture had been invoked on civil rights legislation. The 1964 Civil Rights Act was the most sweeping of its kind in our history. Justice Abe Fortas In June of 1968 Chief Justice Earl Warren notified President Lyndon Johnson that he would be retiring from the Supreme Court. This move gave President Johnson time to nominate a successor since he was not planning to seek re-election as President. Johnson nominated Associate Justice Abe Fortas to replace Warren. At the same time Johnson nominated Texas Appeals Court Justice Homer Thornberry to replace Fortas, a move that was designed to satisfy southern senators. President Johnson counted on Senators Everett Dirksen and Richard Russell for their support of the nomination. When Abe Fortas testified at his own confirmation hearing, an unprecedented occurrence, it was revealed that Fortas worked uncomfortably closely with the White House staff and the President. Later it was learned that Fortas was being paid a large sum, privately, to teach an American University summer course. At this point Dirksen, Russell, and other senators withdrew their support. Though the committee recommended confirmation of Justice Abe Fortas, a filibuster ensued on the Senate floor to block his confirmation, the first filibuster in Senate history on a Supreme Court nomination. On October 1, 1968, the Senate was unable to tally the 67 votes needed to invoke cloture and President Johnson withdrew the nomination. The use of the filibuster has increased from 16 filibusters in the 19th century to 66 in the first half of the 20th century to 195 in the period from 1970 to 1995. It is likely that the filibuster will continue to play an important role in the American political process."
6,What is the Filibuster All About?,politics," The filibuster has been a tool available to U.S. Senators during Senate floor discussions on legislation and appointments since the U.S. Constitution was ratified. Both the Democratic and Republican parties have valued the filibuster as a means to bring compromise and bipartisanship to bitter and divisive debates. The word, filibuster, as it applies to the American political process refers to a political delaying tactic such as a long speech used by politicians to delay or prevent the passage of legislation. The older meaning of filibuster refers to the illegal act of plundering or piracy; of capturing a ship and its cargo and holding it for ransom. The etymology of the word, filibuster, seems to date back to about 1560-1570 when the English anglicized the Dutch word, vrijbutier, into freebooter. A freebooter is understood to be a person who goes in search of plunder; a pirate, a buccaneer. Shortly thereafter, the French adopted filibustier and the Spanish adopted filibustero to mean the same thing. In the 17th century the English transformed the Spanish word into filibuster to describe the actions of the pirates who attacked the Spanish explorers of the New World. In the 1800’s the Americans popularized the word filibuster, referring to the activities of famous pirates operating in Latin America and the Caribbean. Filibuster as Piracy From 1830 to 1860 the countries of Cuba, Mexico, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua were all victims of various filibuster campaigns. The filibusters were led by groups of adventurers who, without the consent of the American Government, but with the aid of private American finance, tried to seize political power in these Latin American and Caribbean countries. Part of the aim of the filibuster campaigns was to empower the population of these countries and bring forth a revolution that would be beneficial to American interests, mainly the slave trade. Financial support for the filibusters came largely from the southern states where parades of celebration were held in their honor and songs were written about their adventures. Officially, the U.S. did not support the filibuster campaigns because the military was spread too thin to be able to provide adequate enforcement of the laws against the involvement. Many citizens saw the campaigns as an aspect of “manifest destiny,” the idea that America had a right to unlimited expansion. A couple of famous filibusterers include Narciso Lopez and William Walker. Lopez liberated Venezuela from Spanish rule and attempted three times to liberate Cuba. Walker, from Tennessee, annexed parts of Mexico, including Lower California, and declared himself to be president. The U.S. government did not support Walker and eventually brought him to trial. The era of the Filibuster Movement ended when the U.S. Civil War started. Attention and resources were given to the defense of the North and the South, ending the efforts of the filibuster campaigns. Filibuster as a Political Tool During the period from 1840 to 1860, numerous Southern politicians made long speeches during Senate floor debates on legislation bills for the purpose of delaying the bill or preventing a vote on the bill. The word filibuster was borrowed to describe these speeches, which were thought of as piracy of time and opportunity. Henry Clay, in 1841, gave what is considered to be the first filibuster speech. As the debate over the slavery issue became more important in Congress, southern politicians used the tactic of long dilatory speeches to block all civil rights legislation. The word filibuster became popularized during this pre-Civil War period. Legislative Rules The U.S. Constitution did not give direction to the House of Representatives or to the Senate regarding how to conduct everyday business and how to conduct debates on the floor. Each body was expected to create and adopt their own rules. On day 2 of the first Senate meeting a special committee was created to ""prepare a system of rules for conducting business."" A few days later, on April 7, 1789, the special committee filed their first rules report and on April 16, 1789, the Senate adopted their first set of rules. The first set contained 19 rules and on April 18 number 20 was adopted. At this point the special committee was disbanded. The rules committee was recreated on several occasions during succeeding years for the purpose of creating new rules or revising existing rules. Since 1789 there have been 7 adoptions of new or revised rules; in 1806, 1820, 1828, 1877, 1884, and 1979. Some rules have been amended and passed by the Senate without going to a committee. The change to Rule XXII in 1917 to provide for a cloture procedure is a good example. There currently are a total of 43 Standing Rules of the Senate. The House Rules and Manual of the U.S. House of Representatives does not allow for filibuster speeches. Each Representative is allowed to hold the floor to debate a question for one hour and may only speak once on each question. The House is a large body and the members thought it wise to limit the amount of time that a Representative may speak. The Senate is an entirely different situation, however. Senate Rule XIX Rule XIX is the key rule that provides a structure for debate on the Senate floor. A key provision of the rule states that when a Senator rises to seek recognition during floor debate, he or she is guaranteed a chance to speak on the question for as long as he or she wishes. The presiding officer is not given discretion in this matter and must recognize each Senator in order. During the period of time that a recognized Senator is speaking the question before the Senate cannot come to a vote. The Senator cannot be interrupted or be forced to stop their speech without their consent. Debate Rule XIX does not limit the number of Senators who may speak on an issue. The rule does, however, limit each Senator to two speeches per legislative day on each issue. During a filibuster period the presiding officer will typically call a recess rather than an adjournment at the end of the calendar day, keeping the legislative day alive when the Senate reconvenes. This tactic effectively limits each Senator to a maximum of two speeches on each issue. It is possible, however, for a Senator to offer an amendment in order to create a new debatable question, on which the Senators may make two more speeches. A relatively recent provision in Rule XIX, called the “Pastore Rule” in honor of Senator John Pastore of Rhode Island, requires that debate on a question must be germane to the question. During filibuster periods this rule is enforced to prevent Senators from making meaningless, off-topic speeches. During the 1930’s through the 1950’s several Senators, such as Huey Long and Strom Thurmond made long filibusters which included readings of recipes, the Congressional Record, the Declaration of Independence, and other non-germane topics. While a Senator is speaking on an issue he or she must remain standing and must speak more or less continuously. During a filibuster-length speech this requirement creates fatigue in the speaker. However, the speaker may yield to a question from another Senator without losing the floor. The other Senator can provide relief by asking a very long question followed by a short answer, followed by more long questions. In this manner a group of Senators can work together to extend the length of a Senator’s speaking period. Senate Rule XXII The procedures for invoking cloture for purposes of wrapping up the floor debate and bringing the question to a vote are contained in Rule XXII. The process requires a motion that is signed by at least 16 Senators and presented to the presiding officer while the question is being debated. The rule requires that the cloture motion must be seasoned, meaning that it cannot be acted upon until the second day after it is presented. One hour after the cloture motion has matured on the third day the presiding officer interrupts the Senate proceedings and presents the cloture motion to the Senate for a vote. At this point an automatic roll call vote is required. In 1975 the Senate voted to change the number of votes needed to invoke cloture to 60% from the previous 67%. A compromise was struck, however, because some Senators feared that if changing the Rule was too easy that the majority needed to invoke cloture might be reduced further in the future. Therefore, the Senate agreed that to make future rule changes, including changing the cloture rule itself, would require the traditional 67% majority vote. If the motion to invoke cloture is defeated the Senators can reconsider the vote or file a new motion to invoke cloture. For example, in 1988 there were eight cloture motions on a campaign finance reform bill and all eight motions were defeated. If a motion to invoke cloture is successful, then the effect of invoking cloture only guarantees that a vote on the question will take place eventually, but not immediately. After the successful cloture motion has passed the Senate is said to be working under cloture. Rule XXII imposes a maximum cap of 30 additional hours for debate, quorum calls, parliamentary inquiries, and other proceedings prior to an actual vote on the question. During this cloture period each Senator is entitled to speak for a total of not more than one hour. Once cloture has been invoked under Rule XXII, the point of a filibuster is largely lost. Without exception, proceedings are wrapped up in less than 30 hours and the question is brought to a vote. Conclusion The filibuster speech in the Senate has enjoyed a long tradition and has been used for several purposes. On one hand the filibuster has been used to persuade others of the validity of the minority position on a question. Open and unlimited debate can change minds and sway opinion. The filibuster speech process may help to defeat an issue once a vote is taken. On the other hand, the filibuster has been used to stall or prevent a vote on an issue. The filibuster speech or the threat of a filibuster may cause the issue to be tabled or withdrawn and not brought to a vote on the floor. The minority party in the Senate counts on the use of the filibuster as a means to prevent the majority party from wielding too much influence. Such a tool encourages the two major parties in the Senate to work in nonpartisan ways to resolve differences. The filibuster creates a need for compromise. It has been suggested that without the filibuster tool the Senate would be much less productive in producing legislation."
7,The Political Wit and Humor of Will Rogers,politics," Will Rogers was an amazing person and one of the wisest men of any generation. His accomplishments include being a champion lasso thrower, a performer on the Broadway stage, the star of 71 movies, a radio broadcaster, an author of six books, and a syndicated newspaper columnist. Will Rogers traveled around the world three times and befriended presidents, senators, prime ministers, and kings. Will Rogers was famous for his simple, insightful humor and his ability to connect honestly with everyone he met. His comments about politics in general and the politics of his generation are among his most memorable. The following are some of the best Will Rogers political quotes. There’s no trick to being a humorist when you have the whole government working for you. Ancient Rome declined because it had a Senate; now what’s going to happen to us with both a Senate and a House? I am not a member of any organized political party. I am a Democrat. I don’t make jokes. I just watch the government and report the facts. The more you read and observe about this Politics thing, you got to admit that each party is worse than the other. The one that's out always looks the best. The income tax has made more liars out of the American people than golf has. On account of being a democracy and run by the people, we are the only nation in the world that has to keep a government four years, no matter what it does. The man with the best job in the country is the Vice President. All he has to do is get up every morning and say, ""How's the President?"" An economist’s guess is liable to be as good as anybody else’s. Alexander Hamilton started the U.S. Treasury with nothing -- and that was the closest our country has ever been to being even. If stupidity got us into this mess, then why can’t it get us out? Be thankful we’re not getting all the government we’re paying for. Politics has become so expensive that it takes a lot of money even to be defeated. Diplomacy is the art of saying “Nice doggie” until you can find a rock. A fool and his money are soon elected. About all I can say for the United States Senate is that it opens with a prayer and closes with an investigation. Our Constitution protects aliens, drunks, and U.S. Senators. Anything important is never left to the vote of the people. We only get to vote on some man; we never get to vote on what he is to do. Politics is applesauce. Diplomats are just as essential to starting a war as soldiers are for finishing it… You take diplomacy out of war, and the thing would fall flat in a week. I bet after seeing us, George Washington would sue us for calling him “father.” There ought to be one day—just one—when there is open season on senators. The country has come to feel the same when Congress is in session as when the baby gets hold of a hammer. If I studied all my life, I couldn’t think up half the number of funny things passed in one session of Congress. If you ever injected truth into politics you’d have no politics. Things in our country run in spite of government, not by aid of it. We don’t seem to be able to check crime, so why not legalize it and then tax it out of business? Everything is changing. People are taking their comedians seriously and the politicians as a joke. Liberty doesn’t work as well in practice as it does in speeches. Ohio claims they are due a president as they haven’t had one since Taft. Look at the United States; they have not had one since Lincoln. The 1928 Republican Convention opened with a prayer. If the Lord can see His way clear to bless the Republican Party the way it’s been carrying on, then the rest of us ought to get it without even asking. There is no more independence in politics than there is in jail. All I know is just what I read in the papers, and that’s an alibi for my ignorance. Will Rogers was asked about the nature of his humorous remarks about politicians. ""I have often said in answer to inquiries as to how I got away with kidding some of our public men, that it was because I liked all of them personally, and that if there was no malice in your heart there could be none in your gags, and I have always said I never met a man I didn’t like."""
8,How to Become a Legal Immigrant in America: The Green Card,politics," The process for a foreign citizen to legally acquire a green card and eventually become a legal naturalized citizen of the U.S. is difficult, time consuming, and expensive. Many critics of the system maintain that if the process was simpler there would be far fewer foreign citizens entering and remaining in the U.S. illegally. When a foreign citizen visits the U.S. as a tourist, a medical patient, a student, or for business purposes, they generally need to present only a valid national passport, a photo ID card or birth certificate, and sometimes an entry visa. A visa is simply an endorsement on a document that shows authenticity and conveys permission to travel to and to enter a foreign country. This type of visa is also known as a nonimmigrant visa. Fees for a passport, a nonimmigrant visa, and a border crossing card total about $300. However, when a foreign citizen wishes to reside and work in the U.S., they need to present an immigrant visa, also known as a green card. The green card was originally called the Alien Registration Receipt Card, but it has recently been renamed the Permanent Resident Card. Originally the card was green in color but now the card is white with some green printing on the back. It is still known generally as the green card. Recipients of the green card must carry it with them at all times. The green card is valid for a period of 10 years. The green card is issued to a foreign citizen as a response to a petition by an employer or a relative who is a U.S. citizen. The petition by the employer or relative allows the foreign citizen to enter the U.S. for the purposes of being employed and residing permanently in the country. The process for acquiring the green card generally follows three steps. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) issues the green card. This service used to be known as the INS or Immigration and Naturalization Service. USCIS is often referred to as simply the Immigration Service and is now part of the Department of Homeland Security. The first step is for the USCIS to review all of the paperwork and approve the petition from the qualifying relative or employer. The second step is to send the approved paperwork to the National Visa Center (NVC) where the petition waits for a visa number to become available. Only a limited number of visa numbers are available each year. Once a visa number becomes available, then the third step is for the petition to be forwarded to the appropriate U.S. embassy or consulate in the foreign citizen’s home city or country. The three step process appears to be simple and straightforward, but the expenses and the amount of paperwork and time involved make the process difficult and frustrating. The first step to obtain a green card is for the sponsoring relative or employer to submit the proper forms to USCIS. The process of filling out, collecting, and forwarding the paperwork on to NVC can take two months or more. Typically, not all of the necessary forms are submitted the first time and communication by mail between the USCIS and the petitioner and between the USCIS and NVC is slow. Fees for the paperwork, photos, and supporting documents can total $190 to $400. Next, NVC collects the paperwork and determines if additional items are needed to complete the application process. There generally are additional necessary forms, passports, and documents needed before everything can be forwarded to a U.S. embassy or consulate in the foreign citizen’s home city or country. This process can take two to seven months and requires the payment of processing fees and fingerprinting which cost about $500 or more. If the petition is for an immediate relative, such as parents, spouses, and minor children, then the application does not need to wait for a visa number, and the petition can be sent on to the U.S. embassy or consulate. Some consulates are busier with green card applications than others and the waiting period for an appointment at the consulate ranges from a couple of weeks to 9 months. In addition to identity documents the applicant must present blood tests and medical exam results which may cost an additional $200 or more. After the appointment at the consulate and the approval of the petition, the foreign citizen is issued the Permanent Resident Card or green card. The citizen is then free to enter the United States for purposes of establishing a residence or beginning employment. If the petition is for a family member other than an immediate relative, such as adult children, married children, and brothers and sisters, then the application must wait for an Immigrant Visa number to become available. The waiting period may take a few months to as long as 10 years. Only a limited number of Immigrant Visa numbers are available for each country each year. An application may wait for a long period of time if the applicant is from a country which sponsors a large number of applicants. After the petition receives a visa number the application is sent to the U.S. embassy or consulate and the citizen can then complete the appointment and receive their Permanent Resident Card or green card. The green card is valid for 10 years. After five years of residency in the U.S. the citizen is eligible to become a naturalized U.S. citizen. In addition to the five years of residency, the citizen must show an ability to read, write, and speak English, understand U.S. history and government, have good moral character, and be willing to abide by the principles of the U.S. Constitution. Fees for the application and electronic fingerprinting total about $400. Once the citizen has taken the Oath of Allegiance they become a full U.S. citizen. Obtaining permanent residency or citizenship in the United States requires a large commitment of time, determination, and resources. Simplification of the process would allow foreign citizens to more easily immigrate to the U.S. legally and would likely reduce the number of illegal immigrants. The United States has a proud history of successful legal immigration."
9,"A Heck of a Job: A Compassionate President, With a Bird's-Eye View",politics," The New York Times, Aug. 4, 2007: President Bush got a bird's-eye view Saturday of what remained of a highway bridge that collapsed last Wednesday over the Mississippi River, and planned to later tour the site on foot . . . ""[T]he people there are decent and resilient, and they will get through these painful hours."" The New York Times, Aug. 5, 2007: Mr. Bush took a 10-minute helicopter tour of the wreckage, where he could see the remains of a school bus, a truck and other vehicles . . . '' Our message to the Twin Cities is we want to get this bridge rebuilt as quick as possible,'' the president said. [Now, imagine if Bush handled the disaster in Minneapolis in the same way he handled Hurricane Katrina and the aftermath of that tragedy . . . ] Six Months Later: President Bush flew over the Twin Cities in Air Force One and, looking down from 20,000 feet, said the bridge reconstruction looked ""pretty good,"" but was probably ""doubly good on the ground."" His flyover came half a year after Bush praised federal officials for doing a ""heck of a job"" in responding to the collapse, and he pledged ""one of the largest bridge reconstruction efforts the world has ever seen."" However, the billions in federal aid that Bush promised to rebuild the bridge have not materialized, many millions of it squandered by fraud, mismanagement, and waste. Minnesotans are feeling increasingly frustrated that cleanup of the I-35W bridge collapse continues at a snail's pace. Rescue workers recently found yet another victim. Highways around Minneapolis and St. Paul have remained congested, and some angry residents have begun to move away. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has provided loaner cars, dubbed ""FEMA cars,"" to those who lost their vehicles in the collapse and were unable to settle insurance claims or obtain federal loans for new cars. Six Months Later: On the one-year anniversary of the Minneapolis bridge collapse, President Bush hovered for four-and-a-half minutes above rush-hour traffic in his presidential helicopter, Marine One, and blamed the Democrat-controlled Congress for it's failure to repair the I-35W bridge. Later in the day, he defended his decision to veto a 5-cent gas tax that would have paid for replacing the bridge and repairing other aging bridges across the nation, claiming that the escalating, five-year-old, $500-billion war in Iraq was a higher priority. He said a gas tax would ""affect economic growth."" Minnesota's Republican governor, Tim Pawlenty, after twice vetoing a state gas tax that would have paid for needed highway infrastructure upgrades, said he was now open to the idea. President Bush immediately fired the governor. When Bush learned that Navy divers were still working on the bridge, he ordered them sent to Iraq. He vowed to soon send ""armies of compassion"" to Minneapolis -- as long as the state paid the tab. Meanwhile, many Minneapolis residents are still driving around in their ""FEMA cars""; school enrollment is at it's lowest point in half a century; crime has reached record levels; hospitals have closed and businesses have relocated. Minneapolis' population is now half what it was before the bridge collapse. A Month Later: Bound for Crawford, for his monthlong summer vacation, President Bush ordered Air Force One to make a detour and fly over New Orleans, the city where many displaced Minneapolis residents have relocated, after their city collapsed into chaos. Looking down on the Big Easy, finally rejuvenated three years after Katrina, thanks to the influx of Midwesterners, Bush declared that Minnesota was too cold anyway and that the relocation to New Orleans was ""working very well for them."" Five Months Later, Jan 20, 2009: On his last day as President, having survived the threat of impeachment that has hovered over his final year in office, George Bush strode stoically across the White House lawn, climbed the steps to Marine One, turned around a flashed two peace signs to the staff gathered on the lawn, then disappeared inside the helicopter. Inside awaited three of his former colleagues -- Dick Cheney, Karl Rove and Donald Rumsfeld. As the helicopter door closed, Rove approached and gave Bush a going-away present, a T-shirt that read, ""It's not my fault."" The president busted out laughing as they ascended above Washington. A Week Later: A poll has found that Americans believe George W. Bush was the least compassionate of the nation's forty-three presidents, a designation largely blamed on Bush's ineffective response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Among the questions pollsters asked were, ""Was Hurricane Katrina President Bush's fault?"" and ""Was the Minneapolis bridge collapse of 2007 President Bush's fault?"" The nearly unanimous responses to those questions was ""no."" However, when asked whether Bush did enough to react to those disasters, eight of ten Americans said ""no."" The poll found that, among expectations of the executive office, Americans ranked as ""very high"" that presidents at least make an attempt to care about the victims of disasters. Lyndon Johnson received high marks for visiting the Lower Ninth Ward and victims in shelters a day after Hurricane Betsy ravaged New Orleans. (""I put aside all the problems on my desk to come to Louisiana as soon as I could,"" Johnson said.) But pollsters found that, despite gaining the White House with the promise of ""compassionate conservatism,"" Bush irreparably damaged his presidency by doing far too little at the federal level to keep the nation's attention focused on repairing and rebuilding New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. [He left office with the lowest approval rating in the history of the presidency, roughly 5 percent.] Three days after Katrina, Bush flew over New Orleans on his return from a monthlong vacation. Peering out the small Air Force One window, he said “it’s got to be doubly devastating on the ground.” Bush's flyover struck many as a wildly insufficient gesture, as if he didn't want to get his feet wet, or his hands dirty with the reality of the suffering, by actually visiting New Orleans, the way he visited New York so soon after the 9-11 attacks, a visit that briefly served as the defining moment of his presidency. The more lasting defining moment of his administration came when Bush finally did visit New Orleans and praised FEMA director Michael Brown for doing ""a heck of a job"" in his response to Katrina. Two weeks later, Bush returned for a prime-time event on Jackson Square to pledge ""one of the largest reconstruction efforts the world has ever seen."" Beneath the floodlights, Bush said, ""[T]onight I also offer this pledge of the American people: Throughout the area hit by the hurricane, we will do what it takes, we will stay as long as it takes to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives.'' But a year later, many millions in federal aid were found to have been wasted, and by the storm's second anniversary nearly 50,000 families were still living in FEMA trailers. The poll found that it didn't help Bush's ""compassion index"" when his mother, during a visit with Katrina victims at Houston's Astrodome, said ""many of the people in the arena here, you know, were underprivileged anyway, so this -- this is working very well for them.'' [Nor did it help when Bush told wounded soldiers at an Army hospital in San Antonio about his own boo-boo: “I have an injury myself -- not here at the hospital, but in combat with a cedar. I eventually won. The cedar gave me a little scratch. As a matter of fact, the colonel asked if I needed first aid when she first saw me. I was able to avoid any major surgical operations here, but thanks for your compassion, colonel.''] Of course, Bush wasn't alone among compassion-less conservatives in stoking America's change-the-channel attitude toward New Orleans. In a similar poll titled ""Compassion in the Congress,"" former House Speaker Dennis Hastert scored low marks for his post-Katrina suggestion that damaged neighborhoods could simply be bulldozed, and Louisiana Congressman Richard Baker scored poorly for his claim that Katrina had ""finally cleaned up public housing in New Orleans. We couldn't do it, but God did it."" Some Americans, the poll found, now believe that the administration's plan was not to rebuild New Orleans, a sentiment that echoes what Douglas Brinkley, the Tulane University historian and author of ''The Great Deluge,'' told the New York Times in 2006: that the Bush strategy was ""deliberate inaction,"" with the goal being a smaller, less ethnic, more Republican-friendly city -- a whiter New Orleans. Nearly 70 percent African-American before Katrina, New Orleans is less than half African-American today. ''The last blue state in the Old South is turning into a red state,'' Brinkley said. Former president Bush, who recently announced plans to return to the corporate world -- as head of his former vice president's old firm, Halliburton -- could not be reached for comment. A spokesman for the ex-president said Mr. Bush doesn't believe in polls and that he ""cares about Americans who care about him.""

10,2008 Presidential Election Betting Hits The Online Sportsbook Campaign Trail,politics," Not that members of the sports betting industry needed it but when Chris Matthews, the loquacious and assertive host of MSNBC’s Hardball, quoted odds on the 2008 race for President of the United States, the practice of betting on elections gained a measure of acceptability. Election betting is not new. In fact, Las Vegas oddsmaker Jimmy “The Greek” Snyder gained fame and credibility (which later led to a spot on CBS’ NFL preview show) when, after noting that women did not trust men who wore mustaches, boldly predicted that underdog incumbent President Harry S. Truman would defeat New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey in the race for the Oval Office in 1948. Or so the story goes. The irony is that Nevada sportsbooks do not accept wagers on elections. The often cited reason is not that, like entertainment award voting such as the Oscars, that someone knows the results of the balloting in advance, but that there is something queasy about mixing gambling and politics. Yeah, right. Certainly, most online sportsbooks outside the jurisdiction of the Silver State have little difficulty in posting futures on who will win the next four-year lease at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The process, which should come to a conclusion when delegate-rich states such as California, New York and Florida vote next February, already is underway with 10 Republicans and eight Democrats vying for the prize. Each party field could grow and there also is the possibility for a fusion ticket or an independent candidacy. Generally, online sportsbooks attack the 2008 election in one of three ways. The simplest way is to post a generic proposition on which party will win the White House. Led by a President with record low approval ratings and saddled with an increasingly unpopular war in Iraq, the Republicans are clear underdogs to maintain control in 2008, usually listed as +140 underdogs (bet $100 to win $140). On the other hand, Democrats, with their base more energetic and independent voters tracking in their direction, are quoted as -160 favorites (bet $160 to win $100) to regain control of the Oval Office. Could someone unaligned with either of the major parties, such as an independent or a third party candidate, win? You can get +5250 on that remote possibility. Many online sportsbooks also boast separate future books for Democrats and Republicans. Although she voted to authorize the Iraq war, a very unpopular position among party activists, New York Senator and former First Lady Hillary Clinton heads the list of Democrats, usually at odds around 4/5. Representing a younger generation, Illinois Senator Barack Obama is the clear second choice at 5/2 with former North Carolina Senator John Edwards, 5/1, and as yet unannounced candidate, former Vice President Al Gore, offered from a low of 4/1 to a high of 10/1. New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, who widely is viewed as an ideal vice presidential choice, Senators Chris Dodd (CT) and Joe Biden (DE), former Senator Mike Gravel (Alaska) and Congressman Dennis Kucinich, are longshots. Despite holding liberal to moderate views on many social issues, such as abortion, gay rights and gun control, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani is a 7/5 favorite to get the nod of the largely conservative GOP to run for President. Arizona Senator John McCain, who holds an unpopular position on immigration, is the 5/2 second choice with former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, whose positions have evolved (his detractors would say “flip-flopped”) is quoted at 4/1 with former Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson likely to enter the race in July at about the same odds as Romney. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, would enter the race at about 15/1 should he diced to run, ahead of previously announced candidates such as former Governors Mike Huckabee (AK) and Tommy Thompson WI), Senator Sam Brownback (KS), and Representatives Duncan Hunter, Ron Paul and Tom Tancredo. Senator Chuck Hagel (NE), 30/1, could enter the race as either a Republican or as an independent. The third way online sportsbooks offer Presidential election futures is to lump all the candidates together in one massive book. The difference between this type of book and the separate party books is the same as the difference between World Series and pennant futures; more risk but more reward in going for the whole enchilada. Clinton is the favorite in the big book, usually at about 2/1. Giuliani checks in next at odds of 7/2 with Obama at 4/1, McCain at 6/1, Romney and Gore at 8/1. As the 2008 election draws nearer, many online sportsbooks will add key Senate, House and Governor races to their wagering menu, providing even more options to election betting."
11,What happened to Our Democracy,politics," Dwight Eisenhower warned against the United States becoming predominately dependent on military power as a means for its security.  The biggest change in American democratic history came about as a result of World War II and the introduction of the nuclear bomb.  From the mid 40's to the early 50's two different directions became available for our government to choose from. One direction was for our government to embrace the principles of the newly formed United Nations, which was originally handed all the tools necessary to civilize this world through a system of International Law and Order based on the establishment of an International Bill of Human Rights. After the devastation of World War II the world came to realize future wars using nuclear weapons could destroy this world and a new system for providing a more peaceful and civilized existence in this world was needed, thus the United Nations was formed. The other direction governments could take was to pursue military expansionism with nuclear weapons to ensure their defense. Once one single country pursued this path others were forced to follow and the overall purpose of the United Nations was nullified. Today the American people have become oppressed slaves to their military power and have been forced to give up their democratic rights and freedoms for their security. Ben Franklin stated, once you give up your liberty and democratic rights for your security, you deserve neither. The cost the American people have had to pay for their military power is being a constant target always having to defend itself from those who wish not to be militarily dominated by the U.S. government. The American people and their democracy has been oppressed and dominated by fear as a result of their military power and expansionism. The United States government is now the most barbaric, brutal, and uncivilized country in the world and has been responsible for more deaths (approximately seven million people killed) then any other country since the mid 1950's. The strange thing is the American people act shocked when someone attacks their country (911, the USS Cole, etc) and can't understand why. We have been conditioned to believe a strong military is the best way to defend our country, but when that military power jeopardizes our security and safety because our leaders are abusing it for purposes other then to defend our country, we should not be surprised. Being civilized and living in Peace is the sacrifice we have made for military power. They say when you live by the sword you die by the sword and we now live totally by the sword. There was a time when it was patriotic to defend our country and democratic way of life, which was back when our democracy was one that was by the people, for the people, and of the people. Today, our government is corporate controlled, which means we have sacrificed our democratic rights, freedoms, security, and safety to defend a government, which is by the corporations, for the corporations, and of the corporations. This was not part of the original deal when our democracy was formed.  Nowhere in our Constitution, Declaration of Independence, or Bill of Rights does it mention the American people must yield their democracy to the corporate powers. The reason our democracy was formed was to be self-governing and get away from totalitarian rule. The first paragraph of the Declaration of Independence states clearly the obligation to preserve our democracy rest squarely with the American people, yet the American people are so oblivious to their democratic responsibilities they have allowed their democracy to fail.  A democracy is only as strong as the people who participate in it. Thomas Jefferson stated; this democracy would only last about two hundred and fifty years before the people must decide to rebuild it or let it revert back to totalitarian rule.  We have been at it for two hundred and thirty four years now, with sixteen years left to decide. If the American people are satisfied with being oppressed by fear as a result of our their military power, which is controlled by a corporate run government then they should do nothing, but they should understand it was they who failed their democracy and they have no one to blame but themselves."
12,Global Warming: Reality or Leftist Propaganda?,politics," Information is now being discovered and disseminated throughout the planet at an unprecedented rate. So is misinformation. Global warming has all the makings of a catastrophe, but the powers that be would rather that you did not realize that. Here are some basic facts about the reality of global climate change. Myth #1: Within the scientific community, debate persists as to whether or not anthropogenic (human-caused) gases are the primary cause of global warming. Fact: Worldwide, climate scientists are united in agreement that the current rise in greenhouse gases and global temperatures are directly correlated to human-related causes. There is virtually no disagreement about the fact that global temperatures are rising. Since the Industrial Revolution, the world's consumption of fossil fuels has increased at an alarming rate and climate scientists consent that the combustion of these fuels are the primary culprits of global warming. Whatever debate exists does so in the popular media and political arenas. Skeptics are often spokespeople or ""scientists"" hired by industries that have a stake in new emission-cutting regulations or changes in consumer buying patterns that would curb global warming. Myth #2: The current warming trend is just part of the natural cycle of rising and falling climate variation. A small shift in degrees is not a big deal. Fact: It is indeed normal for the global climate to experience undulations in temperature over given periods, but the world is currently experiencing an increase in temperature that is nearly unprecedented. While some animals and plants were able to adapt to slow changes over time, many will become extinct as a result of faster climate changes. Evolution requires time to change any given species-successful changes are made over thousands (or millions) of years. In contrast, scientists predict that the average global temperature will increase anywhere from 2.5 to 10.4 degrees F in the 21st century alone. Although this may seem insignificant, such a shift across the entire globe will dramatically effect the more delicate ecosystems which are, in turn, connected to the function of each other system. The last Ice Age was only 5-9 degrees colder than today's temperatures. Myth #3: Global warming is a good thing; an extended warm season would be more comfortable and extend the growing season, thus increasing global food supplies. Fact: While a small amount of warming might benefit some select regions, the negative effects of global warming will far outweigh any positives. Among the many expected results of global warming are: drought, flooding rainstorms, forest fire, and species extinctions. Many of the extreme weather events will occur in areas that are already experiencing trouble producing their own food because of resource depletion, specifically in the developing world where hunger is already prevalent. Additionally, rising sea levels are predicted to displace 13 to 88 million people each year, placing a greater strain on agricultural lands. Finally, warmer winters and an increased growing season will extend the range of many invasive plant and animal species, which may crowd out natives. Harmful insects that eat crops or harbor disease will have expanded geographical and seasonal ranges. Myth #4: Like examples of the past, humans can easily adapt to the effects of global climate change, especially with current and future technologies. Fact: Although humans can adapt to new climatic situations quite rapidly, there are several notable historical examples of major population decreases as a result of climate change. If the global warming trend continues without action, the rate of increase and the degree of warming will exceed anything experienced since the beginning of human civilization. The fallout from global warming will drastically impact all aspects of modern human life, as well as the global economy with which we are so intertwined. Furthermore, even if developed countries were able to come up with technology to ease the effects of global warming, poorer countries will likely not have the resources to adapt. Environmental refugees will affect both developed and developing countries. Additionally, conflict over food and water will likely have a ripple effect across the globe. It is clear that the need to act on global, industrial, political, and individual levels is imperative to address one of the biggest environmental challenge humans as a species has ever seen. Education is the first step; action is the next. The future is in our hands. Sources: Wang, James, PhD. and Michael Oppenheimer, PhD. ""The Latest Myths and Facts on Global Warming.""

13,Managing Mississauga for Almost 30 Years,politics," Canadian politics are truly unpredictable, and it is rare to find a leader that has served continuously in any capacity for a lengthy period of time. This can be particularly true in municipal politics, where hands-on campaigns mean that the grassroots truly has a say in the outcome of any election. It is truly remarkable, then to find a mayor that has been in office as long as Mississauga’s Hazel McCallion. First elected in 1978, Hazel McCallion has held the title of Mayor of Mississauga for a continuous period stretching almost 30 years. Her most recent mandate was handed to her by Mississaugans in November of 2006, when she was easily re-elected to an eleventh term with 91% of the votes, at the age of 86. As you might expect, Hazel McCallion has seen a lot change in the Mississauga area over the past thirty years, both in terms of technology and population. When she was first elected, the city was large for the time, with a population of over 200,000 people. Today, the city is among the very largest in Canada and even North America, with more than 704,000 people calling the area home. Factor in the challenges that arise from a population growth that extreme and the resulting pressures caused by transportation, pollution, and crime, and it becomes obvious that it takes an adaptable leader to keep things running smoothly. Hazel McCallion proved herself equal to the task of running such a diverse city back when she was first elected, before the city’s boom. In November of 1978 a Canadian Pacific train derailed in the city. The train was loaded with toxic materials, and the entire city was placed under evacuation orders for health reasons. Predictably, the press, city officials, and others looked to the mayor’s office for guidance, and McCallion proved up to the task. The city amazed Canada and the international community by evacuating its entire population of 200,000 residents for a full week, with the accident resulting in no serious injuries or loss of life. McCallion’s illustrious political career is the result of a combination of several factors. Unafraid to speak her mind and become involved in any situation, she raised more than a few eyebrows during her tenth term in office when in April, she talked a man out of committing suicide after a five hour stand off. In addition to her outspokenness and her forthrightness, McCallion has stalwartly refused to endorse any one of the several Canadian political parties which run on the provincial and federal levels, in order to better work with whatever person is elected to office. She is also credited with ideas of government that were well before her time, running the city as one would a business."
14,Core Democratic Values,politics," Here are few core democratic values which can be added to the constitution of any country in the world, and greatly improve the democracy in these states: All civilians have the right for freedom, integrity, peace, security, privacy and honor – equally and fully. All civilians have rights and duties – equally. The inhabitants (temporary and permanence) don't have all the rights of the civilians, but they do have all humanitarian rights and all elementary rights (all rights needed for proper regular course of life). The inhabitants (temporary and permanence) don't have all the duties of the civilians. This is because it isn't at their responsibility to take care of every thing in the state, because it isn't their own state but the state of the civilians. Every civilian of the state has the right and freedom to be informed about everything from every one from everywhere in the entire world, to inform every one from everywhere in the entire world about everything, and to exchange information with every one from everywhere in the entire world about everything. Every civilian of the state has the right and freedom to advertise everything to every one from everywhere in the entire world, individually and publicly, including by all kinds of mass communication means. Every civilian of the state has the right and freedom to teach, to preach, to convince and to influence every one from everywhere in the entire world about everything. Every civilian of the state has the right and freedom to be taught, to be preached, to be convinced and to be influenced by every one from everywhere in the entire world, about everything. Some restrictions may be implemented for certain information by certain laws legislation, and the type and nature of the illegal information must to be defined by these laws. These laws must not to border with dictatorship, and must to completely comply with the democracy. These laws must not to restrict too much the freedom of information and advertisement, as well. Every civilian of the state has the right and freedom to advertise every religious information to every one from everywhere in the entire world, individually and publicly, including by all kinds of mass communication means. Every civilian of the state has the right and freedom to teach, to preach, to convince and to influence every one from everywhere in the entire world about every religious information, and every civilian of the state has the right and freedom to change the religion of every acceptant and willing one from everywhere in the entire world. Every civilian of the state has the right and freedom to be taught, to be preached, to be convinced and to be influenced by every one from everywhere in the entire world about every religious information, and every civilian of the state has the right and freedom to change his own religion."
15,A Late Dedication to Rosie O’Donnell,politics," “I’ve learned so much from these women. They’ve made me clarify my thoughts. Being challenged by them is an unbelievable gift.” – Elisabeth Hasselbeck (Today’s Christianity July/August 2006). Elisabeth, amongst a list of other negative traits, is a liar. For nearly a year, Rosie O’Donnell and Joy Behar, her co-hosts on The View, have given her thousands of facts on what the Bush administration did wrong and illegally, not that she needed them to present her with proof. The majority of the country is aware of the administration’s undemocratic behavior, of their continuous harmful actions that have led to disastrous consequences at home and around the world. Yet despite the stack of “lists” circulating the globe on this subject, Elisabeth learned absolutely nothing. Her thoughts were not clarified one bit, and embracing the challenges as unbelievable gifts? Yeah, right. Elisabeth is a fundamentalist. And like all those who have a strict adherence to a set of basic ideas or principles, she is unable to learn. To maintain her extremist ways, she must do everything in her power to not alter, not even slightly, her ideal beliefs that were bestowed upon her by a higher power, like President Bush and Jesus Christ. Elisabeth is a hypocrite who remarked on May 23rd, during perhaps her last feud with Rosie, “I am all about facts,” and accused Rosie of trying to steer her towards emotions. But Elisabeth has never taken one fact into account, brushing it off as if it’s a fuzz ball irritating her nose rather than evidence that the government, directly and indirectly, is hurting millions of people. She wept over the morning pill and got reprimanded for it by Barbara Walters when everyday, with a straight and determined face, she encourages that countries be blown up so she could feel safe. Elisabeth is a coward, and Rosie was right in calling her that. “Cowardice, as distinguished from panic, is almost always simply a lack of ability to suspend the functioning of the imagination.” [Earnest Hemingway “Men at War” 1942] Elisabeth is ignorant. Once, while once again defending the war, she had added that at least the Iraqi women were not raped as often today as they were during Saddam’s days. My family and I were infuriated. I was born in Baghdad, Iraq as a minority Christian and came to America at age ten. I visited Iraq seven years ago, when the Iraqis were suffering under different types of conditions caused by the U.S. imposed sanctions, and the country was safe. People could walk the streets without the fear of being killed, kidnapped or raped. Today my female relatives in Iraq are housebound as a result of the war. Had Mrs. Hasselbeck ever read or viewed material outside of Fox News, had she educated herself during her spare time rather than watched The Bachelor – crying over who was kicked off the segment – she would have discovered that Operation Iraqi Freedom enslaved Iraqi women whereas under Saddam’s regime women had more freedom and were better educated than women in their neighboring countries. Iraqi women today can’t work, go to school, take a walk or wear western clothing or makeup. Their men have closed their business for fear of the insurgents, U.S. soldiers and suicide bombings. The war has created 2 million refugees and another 1.7 million people displaced in Iraq. As for the illegal elections that everyone boasts about, the Iraqis came up with a new riddle after the winner was announced: If 60% of Iraqis are Shia, 35% Sunni, and 15% Kurds, who voted for the Kurd? Elisabeth is prejudiced. She was outraged when Rosie brought up the innocent deaths of 650,000 Iraqi civilians because she does not want to acknowledge those lives, wishes everyone would just forget about them. Again her main concern is that she is safe, and that Bush continuously gets cheered on and receives blind support, despite the senseless deaths of women and children and our US soldiers who could have put their energies protecting our country right here at home without sacrificing their lives and destroying the hearts of loved ones. Many have called Rosie a bully and oftentimes more disrespectful names, and they have even included Joy in their name calling. But if it wasn’t for their wisdom, their humanitarian and educated outlook on life, we would have Elisabethians (little children in an adult body who are given power through the media or by the government; Bush, for example) running around, editing children’s books during bedtime story, voting to bomb a country here a country there, telling women what to do with their bodies, accusing adulterers of not loving their children as much as those who never cheat, and worshiping and defending President Bush as a brainwashed wife would her controlling husband."
16,Cocaine For President Bush OK,politics," This post will review the case of Guiles v. Marineau, 461 F.3d 320 (2nd Cir 2006) cert denied June 29, 2007, another student freedom of speech case.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that a school could not censor a student's t-shirt where the shirt, at the top, has large print that reads ""George W. Bush,"" below it is the text, ""Chicken-Hawk-In-Chief."" Directly below these words is a large picture of the President's face, wearing a helmet, superimposed on the body of a chicken. Surrounding the President are images of oilrigs and dollar symbols. To one side of the President, three lines of cocaine and a razor blade appear. In the ""chicken wing"" of the President nearest the cocaine, there is a straw. In the other ""wing"" the President is holding a martini glass with an olive in it. Directly below all these depictions is printed, ""1st Chicken Hawk Wing,"" and below that is text reading ""World Domination Tour."" The back of the T-shirt has similar pictures and language, including the lines of cocaine and the martini glass. The representations on the back of the shirt are surrounded by smaller print accusing the President of being a ""Crook,"" ""Cocaine Addict,"" ""AWOL, Draft Dodger,"" and ""Lying[**] Drunk Driver."" The sleeves of the shirt each depict a military patch, one with a man drinking from a bottle, and the other with a chicken flanked by a bottle and three lines of cocaine with a razor. Without question Guiles's T-shirt uses harsh rhetoric and imagery to express disagreement with the President's policies and to impugn his character. On June 29, 2007, The United States Supreme Court refused to review this case, although Justice Samuel Alito cautioned that schools could not censor political speech.  This is significant in and of itself because it means that the Supreme Court does not want to shape the current status of the law in this area at the moment or they believe that it is significantly and sufficiently developed and this case offers no new opportunity to clarify the law.  It could also mean that they just don't feel like dealing with this issue at the moment because others are more deserving of their attention. Why can a student where a t-shirt of this nature at school, but a student cannot hold up a banner that read ""Bong Hits 4 Jesus?"" See, Morse, et al. v. Frederick, or my last post ""No Bong Hits 4 Jesus.""  The difference between the two is simple and it all comes down to content; what was being said.  When we look at the content ""Bong Hits 4 Jesus"" it appears to be empty of any political speech.  Political Speech is among the most highly protected types of speech.  The t-shirt in question is a profound statement of political speech.  Where the ""Bong Hits 4 Jesus"" banner could have been construed as promoting drug use, the t-shirt in question is designed to highlight some of the Presidents alleged dabbling in drugs and alcohol and highlights the student's disgust with the current President and his character.  This is a political statement and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned the lower court in line with centuries old case precedent protecting political speech. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied the Defendant's argument that all illustrations of drugs promote drug use and are disruptive.  The court reasoned that the Defendant could not overcome the argument that anti drug campaigns containing such images promote the use of drugs or were otherwise disruptive.  The court ultimately directed the lower court to issue an injunction prohibiting the school from censoring the t-shirt or not allowing the student to where it.  The court also held that the student's suspension should remain removed from the student's record.  The disparity in the two cases comes down to the content of what was being said.  It is further evidence that political speech in school will remain intact, while otherwise senseless and random images or promotion of illegal drug use will remained banned from the schoolhouse."
17,The United States Failing War On Drugs,politics," The United States, as well as other participating countries, declared war on the illegal drug industry by passing an initiative to combat the illegal drug trade that threatened modern day society.  This never ending war was initiated by President Nixon in 1969.  Soon later in 1973 the Drug Enforcement Administration was created as a government branch dedicated to fighting this illegal industry.  It is commonly known as the DEA. Prior to this time there were many large attacks at the black market portion of the drug industry, but only laws were created.  Research and trends revealed that this industry was still growing at an unacceptable level.  Most of the punishments were rather lenient and were still not seen as being as beneficial as the government believed necessary.  The 1973 creation of the DEA was the first major investment of the US government to crackdown on illegal drugs. In 2005 alone, the United States spent more than $45 billion of tax payer's money on this war by fighting, incarcerating, and rehabilitating our drug issue.  Not only is the spending completely out of control, but illegal drug use has continued to substantially increase every year since prohibition.  More than one fifth of our youth population actively uses what the United States government considers to be illegal drugs. Like any other war, the best possible resolution is to find diplomacy. What needs to happen is the finding of a middle ground to the failing battle that satisfies both opinions.  Drugs such as marijuana are currently illegal that offer no severe health risks, are not dangerous, and are not addictive.  Instead, the government continues to lie to our youth through schools and TV about such harmless issues.  If legalized, regulated, and taxed, marijuana alone would be enough to fund a large portion of a war on dangerous drugs such as heroin and methamphetamines.  This would also no longer pull law enforcement into unnecessary situations and keep them on track to fight harder drugs.  Several countries around the world have realized this to an extent.  Many parts of the world consider use of marijuana to be either legal or completely decriminalized. Fortunately, some harmless herbs such as salvia divinorum have avoided the government's spree.  It is not a very commonly known herb even through it is perfectly legal to sell and own in most of the United States.  Salvia divinorum offers it's user a psychedelic experience that only lasts a short period of time and has not been known to cause harm to anyone. Salvia is a great example of how a nonaddictive herb can be legal and not get out of control. We will continue to see the failure of our war on drugs until swift actions against harmful drugs are taken and the shackles released from harmless ones.  Growing up in this world kids are exposed to these drugs. When they realize that the government has misled them, they lose faith in the government's decisions on other drugs.  This may cause more harm than good."
18,Health Care and Michael Moore:  Who’s the real “SICKO?”,politics," Michael Moore's movie, ""Sicko,"" is his attempt at placing blame for the American health care crisis on the shoulders of the pharmaceutical companies and the government.  Clearly, governmental agencies that are supposedly looking out for the welfare of the citizens are far from innocent, and pharmaceutical companies are anything but good Samaritans, but Michael couldn't be more wrong on this one and need not look too much further than his own mirror to see the real problem.  His denial is problem #2. The fact is, Michael Moore is just another cog in the big, dysfunctional machine that Americans currently call ""health care.""  It is actually ""disease care,"" and therein lies problem #3.  Are you beginning to see a pattern here? Michael Moore, even just at a cursory glance, is flamboyantly committing at least two of the ""seven deadly sins"" – gluttony and sloth.  And he wants health?  Michael Moore wants to engage in a problematic way of life and then make those problems that he's created someone else's problem.  That's problem # 4.  Where does personal responsibility fit in to Michael Moore's paradigm?  Perhaps, it's just one of those annoying little details he's overlooked.  Where does self-control fit in to his lifestyle?  Another annoying, trivial detail, I suppose. For those who care to deal in reality, until people take responsibility for their own lives and their own health, there will not be health.  Nor can the government fix the problem.  It is patently impossible to live a disease-producing lifestyle and then expect someone, or something, else to be able to fix it.  The health care system is not about health at all, rather it is all about financing disease.  And people such as Michael Moore create disease.  What we have in this country is disease care, and I suggest Michael Moore be its poster child. The truth is, our diet is directly responsible for well over 80 percent of the diseases from which we suffer.  Heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, gout, cancer, high cholesterol, acid reflux, constipation, obesity, to name a few, are directly attributable to what we put in our mouths, and it is quite obvious that Michael Moore puts a whole lot into his mouth. The governmental issue of health care exists simply and totally because of people like Michael Moore, and the ""war"" being waged against disease is folly.  If people began eating the right foods, we wouldn't need to wage a war, we would quite literally eradicate the need for the war.  So, what's the real solution? People who follow the healthiest diet in the world, a vegan diet, don't suffer from many cancers, heart disease, hypertension, obesity, etc., etc., etc.  So why don't doctors tell their patients about the enormous benefits of a vegan diet?  Not only would diseases vanish, but so, too, would the doctors' incomes.  Also, perhaps, many patients simply wouldn't follow the advice, so the doctors simply don't bother.  And disease marches on. And so do most environmental problems, which also stem from a meat and dairy-based diet.  To be clear, a meat and dairy-based diet is problematic to our health, our environment, our society and even our spirituality, where as a vegan diet cures all problems.  I suppose Michael Moore would scoff at such a suggestion, and then blame the United States government for the cost of the heart bypass operation (for starters) he's going to need. Any man who truly wishes to improve his life must stop blaming everyone else for the problems he creates.  Otherwise, and by any real definition, he is a Sicko.  Michael, put down the burger and listen up."
19,Blair's Blast!,politics," Retiring British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, has blasted the media on the eve of his retirement. Pulling no punches he said the fierce competition for stories meant the modern media now hunted in a pack. ""In these modes, it is like a feral beast, just tearing people and reputation to bits, but no one dares miss out"", he said. And I agree with him.
I've been media training for 20 years now and have seen the terror on the faces of so many executives, and that's just in a training environment. I've also heard their horrifying stories of either them being bitten by the media personally or the fear they felt when a colleague came off second best with the fourth estate.
In that time I've worked out what causes this terror. Firstly, it's fear of saying the wrong thing and that having an impact on their career (what I call, in media training, a career altering moment!) Secondly, it's fear of derision by their peer group and a loss of standing in that group. Thirdly, it's fear of being laughed at by family members. Notice that the word fear pops up a lot in this paragraph.
If we go back for a minute to Tony Blair's speech to Reuters in London on June 13th 2007, he too spoke of fear. ""I am going to say something few people in public life will say but most know is absolutely true. A vast aspect of our jobs today is coping with the media - its sheer scale, weight and constant hyperactivity. At points, it literally overwhelms. People don't speak about it because, in the main, they are afraid to.""
Now, this fear is palpable but it can be controlled. As Mr Blair said, it is rare today to find balance in the media but it's up to you to try and ensure such balance. When Henry Kissinger was U.S. Secretary of State long before Tony Blair became British P.M. he used to stride into media conferences and announce:""Has anyone here got any questions to go with my answers?""  That's the mindset you need when dealing with the media.
Facing a journalist's tough questioning can be very daunting but if you prepare your material, have two or three main points to fall back on and remember your audience at all times, you will give a better interview and, dare I say it, one that has more balance than if you let the reporter concentrate purely on their negative line.
Tony Blair said the media is ""increasingly and to a dangerous degree driven by impact. It is this devotion to impact that is unravelling standards, driving them down, making the diversity of the media not the strength it should be but an impulsion towards sensation above all else.""
It's up to the interviewee to make sure the journalist doesn't get away with just impact but has a story with some balance in it. Like everything in life, this will become easier with practice.
Media training is an obvious help."
20,The State of Canada Before The Next Federal Elections,politics," Ask yourself this question – are you happy with Canada as it stands right now?  If you answered no, don’t worry you are in the majority.  The reasons vary, but the underlying feeling is pretty much the same. To get positive result changes, we must identify and expose the weaknesses and segments that have gone rotten. To begin, let us look at where we came from. Starting with the Second World War, Canada saw its position in the world propelled forward through the horrors and tribulations of total war.  Little Canada grew up in that period and those that lived through that time took the initiative and kept o­n going. Canada in the immediate post-war period saw tremendous social change.  Soldiers returning from the war, and those that fueled the war machine at home, wanted to ensure that they really did put their lives and effort o­n the line for more than the freedom of others. They all wanted to see their blood, toil and sweat pay off here at home as well. Our national industrial base and capacity was greatly expanded due to the war effort.  Our farms were maximized and other resource-based industries were brought to full speed.  Our ability to play with the big boys had come. But it was not o­nly what we were capable of doing with our hands that had changed, our attitudes about government and our society had also changed.  Canadians came to realize that forging ahead with social change was something that was not o­nly attainable, but also desirable.  It was with that prevailing thought that the new Canada was born. Social ideals and movements were no longer dirty words or bad ideas.  The CCF more than proved this and the foundations of our social systems were born.  Scare mongering o­n behalf of the elite did not succeed. The Canadian people came to realize that the Canada they sought to obtain for themselves, their families and the future generations of Canadians should be based o­n a social system.  It was a system that was compassionate and inclusive.  Government had a new role to play, and Canadians were more than willing to be a part of that new expanded role.  Governments now had a central role to play in Canadian lives. Social systems were expanded and employee unions grew in strength and numbers.  The Canadian economy grew rapidly to match those strides.  The Canadian dream in many ways had become the envy of the world.  Many post-war immigrants put Canada at the top of their wish lists.  Canada by the mid 1970’s was the premier middle power. It seemed Canada could do no wrong. But… the wheels eventually fell off. With the post-war period of growth came new ideas and new ways of looking at the present scope of economic events.  At the heart of these new ideas was the notion of ‘free markets’.  Increasingly, the wealthy and powerful in Canada and elsewhere were coming to believe that governments had grown too big and had become too wasteful. Combined with that general feeling was a sense that corporations and the ultra wealthy were overtaxed and overly burdened by the burgeoning social system, which Canadians had come to enjoy and actually depend upon. At the core of this new mantra was the adoption of the ideas of Milton Friedman. Instead of using our own bank – the Bank of Canada – to finance our needs, we acquiesced our economic sovereignty to a handful of private banks.  Instantly we saw our manageable national debt explode into what we see today – over $500 billion owing with no end in sight of the interest payments due. Couple the abandoning of our own bank with a constant march of tax cuts for the rich and corporations at the expense of the entire system, we saw the inevitable curtailing of what Canadians had worked so hard to build.  Our national social system was now enemy number o­ne, and still is today to those that preach ‘free market’ fundamentalism. Groups like the Fraser Institute, the C.C.C.E., and the C.D. Howe Institute have all but declared war o­n what Canadians have worked so hard to create.  To many traveling in those circles, social institutions and pubic entities are just added waste to be trimmed so others may reap the benefit.  With that is the idea that governments are not to be central to social planning, but instead private institutions are to take over and take place of democratically elected officials. Corporations now benefit from yearly record profits while our social system collapses around it.  In its place are public entities turned private for profit.  This panacea was the solution put forward by the few for the many.  Thing is, it has not worked as advertised. Although, increasingly, those that have pushed these ideas o­nto Canadians have refused to see the obvious, so they continue to push for more of the same in the insane hope that in the end it will all work out.  Like an addicted gambler they are always betting that the next spin of the reel will be the winning spin. To return Canada to its former glory we must turn back the clock.  Rarely is this ever an answer for anything in life, but this is o­ne of those times when exceptions count in the final formula.  By o­nce again utilizing the Bank of Canada and moving away from the all out ‘free market’ craze we can return Canada to its rightful place as the premier middle power that was respected and looked at as a world leader. Sadly, if this does not happen we can lump ourselves in with the other failed experiments throughout history."

1,On Politics - Propaganda Is Now Disguised as News - Part 4,politics," I continue to like Charles Krauthammer, Ann Coulter and Dick Morris as smart, savvy people who have something to say worth knowing. Krauthammer is serious, Coulter can be outrageous and cutting, and Morris remains the opportunist. It is likely that Krauthammer and Morris really need some attention and audience to be happy: I doubt Coulter cares what anyone thinks about her views, she is unwavering. I will read and listen to Morris and Coulter because they also bring humor to the conversation. I love Morris' classic line about the reason Bill and Hillary's marriage has worked is because Hillary loves Bill and Bill loves himself. Coulter cuts up politicians like a stir-fry chef at Benihana's and is enormously entertaining, hysterically funny and right on more often than her targets would be comfortable admitting. Despite being entertained by writers I like to read, there is probably nothing that disappoints me more than the current sad, sorry state of newspapers in America. There is more personal journalism in newspapers than news, and newspapers today try to pass off government and political propaganda as actual news. Big time and small time wannabe journalists start off stories today with leads like this: ""Beleaguered President Bush refused to answer questions again in his press conference today about the debacle that is the Iraqi War, still refusing to admit that there were no weapons of mass destruction today any more than there were when he decided to unilaterally invade Iraq four years ago."" This sort of personal journalism never would have passed muster when I was graduating from Michigan State University's College of Communication Arts with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Journalism in 1966. I feel plenty qualified to speak on the topic of personal journalism since I was an investigative reporter, sports editor and managing editor for a daily newspaper, and the owner/publisher of a community publishing company. I believe that the trend toward personal journalism was jump-started in the 1960s by Time magazine which became a bastion of liberal ideas trying to influence opinion and culture in America. Time managed to sully the landscape of truth and integrity in the process, and continues to spew out its own brand of liberal personal journalism today. Newspapers today are faced with declining readership as younger generations flock to the Internet which is no better at reporting news and is even more vitriolic. They simply pare down and reprint the same crap that is in newspapers. Name brand newspapers that once had proud heritages with outstanding reporters have become nothing more than pandering sluts who cannot get enough of their personal journalism and politics into the news side of the paper. Their chief contribution is to try and trick enough readers into paying for the newspaper, thereby elevating themselves to word prostitutes for hire to the political party nearest to their misguided beliefs. I know this sounds harsh but do not think you are being misled by me. The figurative definition of a prostitute is a person who misuses their talents or who sacrifices their self-respect for the sake of personal or financial gain. That is the vast majority of newspaper reporters today. I have no idea what our universities are teaching in journalism schools today, but it sure has nothing to do with the objective reporting of news. Instead of being presented with the facts and letting the reader decide what is meant, we have become inundated with liberal pundits who think we are too stupid to think for ourselves. In this process we have become surrounded by mediocre minds and mental midgets masquerading as important purveyors of the news. What we are getting is propaganda disguised as news. Propaganda is thinking of the most outrageous lie, repeating it ad nauseam and then people will accept it as unquestioned truth and build it into an even bigger lie. Two examples of propaganda: 1) There were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq so we were wrong to invade Iraq. 2) President Bush and the United States government planned, financed and orchestrated the 9-11 attacks on America by the terrorists. The only advantage for the reader is that we are still honoring the First Amendment to our United States Constitution, so freedom of the press does allow us to see what a degenerate press looks like when in full bloom of political hysteria.

2,On Politics - One of the Most Lucrative Jobs in America - Part 3,politics," The truth of the matter is that being a politician in America today is one of the best paying jobs a person could have despite their supposedly low wages compared to corporate executives. I bet there are corporate executives in America who wish they were making $16 million a year like Giuliani. The tragedy of all of this is not that a Republican is being discovered, tried and convicted in a news report, but that the same can and will be done to a Democrat by some other news reporter hell-bent on trying to pass off their brilliance as actual news rather than accusatory garbage. If you do not know that the vast majority of politicians lie, cheat and steal as necessary to get elected and stay elected, you do not understand much about politics in America today. It is real difficult to practice integrity when your pants are down. The best job most national politicians do is helping themselves get rich legally at the expense of the electorate they are supposed to be representing. It is never too soon to vote themselves another raise, perk or benefit, or cut an out-of-sight deal to line their pockets, and it is never too late to bail out on legislation that might offend a big campaign contributor. This is politics in America today: you buy and sell votes like a common prostitute in the red light district of your city; you try to do it legally, and if you cannot, you hope to hell that you do not get caught. Who exactly do you suppose politicians are protecting when they will not pass legislation to protect innocent children against child predators? This is the world we live in today. No payoff is too great to not be swept under the carpet. It is difficult to sidestep the cow pies when your are mired in a crap field. When something good is done for the people at large it is more likely to be done today by accident than by design. Politics and the business of politics are simply that bad. Some politicians ignore children who are innocent victims as not even being worthy of the same rights they enjoy, and then make it a badge of liberal honor to try and rehabilitate predators who are no better than yesterday's garbage. Usually it is these same politicians who do everything in a fit of righteousness (their rightness at your expense). Man is the only animal on the face of the earth who preys on his own species. Man is also the smartest animal on the face of the earth and the stupidest at the same time. We would rather kill each other than live in peace. I believe Ambrose Bierce had it right when he defined politics in his Devil's Dictionary as: ""Politics, n. A strife of interests masquerading as a contest of principles. The conduct of public affairs for private advantage."" Bierce first published his Devil's Dictionary in 1911, a time some would consider more genteel. Today's political parties and politicians have raised lying, cheating and stealing to an art form. When I say cheating I mean both of money and extramarital sex. Some of our married politicians at the national level are so horny they need to be romancing their secretary or an intern young enough to be their daughter or granddaughter. A few even fancy themselves as incredibly attractive Lotharios masquerading as chick magnets. They might be able to pull this off as long as their photo-opts are straight on; the side views may be problematic in print. Bierce was an interesting guy. He was an American editorialist, journalist, short-story writer and satirist who wrote for a number of newspapers, including the San Francisco News Letter, a financial magazine founded by Frederick Marriott in the late 1850s. Bierce was the 10th of 13 children, all of whom had names starting with the letter ""A"", as in Abigail, Amelia, Ann, Addison, Aurelius, Augustus, Alameda, Andrew, Albert, Ambrose, Arthur, Adelia and Aurelia. His dad's name was Marcus Aurelius Bierce. Ambrose Bierce fought at the Battle of Shiloh on the Union side in the Civil War. He would later write about the experience. He is most remembered for his lucid, unsentimental style that created the Devil's Dictionary which offers up reinterpretations of the English language which lampoon cant and political double-talk. Bierce was born in Ohio in 1842, grew up in Indiana, moved West to San Francisco, worked as a writer, and died in Mexico. His actual date of death is unknown, listed only as possibly 1914 (June 24, 1842-1914?). There was no question mark about his work; his writing lives on. If you ever find a better definition of politics than the one offered up by Ambrose Bierce, you let me know, and I will buy you lunch. (Editor's Note: This ends Part 3 of a 5-Part Series)"
3,On Politics: News Writers Are Really Political Hacks - Part 2,politics," When reading Charles Krauthammer, I am reminded that Henry Ford said ""the hardest thing to do in the world is to think, and that is why people do so little of it."" This is especially true during Presidential elections which start about a year too early and end about a year too late. It is often hard for me to decide which is wearier, the droppings of a contentious person or a Presidential election. We have 18 more excruciating months to go in this one and will probably be no better informed on the day we vote. This is because we are going to be inundated with lies, misrepresentations, hateful remarks, character assassination, snide remarks and insults, and there is not a nickel's worth of difference between the bickering parties and candidates. Ann Coulter, in her book How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must), points out that ""When Democrats make an accusation against Republicans, newspaper headlines repeat the accusation as a fact,"" like ""U. S. Law Chief Failed to Heed Terror Warnings,"" or ""Bush White House Said to Have Failed to Make al-Qaida an Early Priority."" ""But when Republicans make accusations against Democrats"" says Coulter, ""the headlines note only that Republicans are making accusations,"" to wit: ""Ashcroft Faults Clinton in 9/11 Failures."" The second story I read on Giuliani was an Associated Press piece on May 15, 2007 with this headline: ""A President Giuliani Could Face Ethical Web."" Was this another example of Coulter's observation? You decide. The boldface subhead and introduction to the story said this: ""An Associated Press review of Rudy Giuliani's law and lobbying firm finds it would spell ethical trouble for him if he won the presidency."" This is exactly what Coulter was pointing out. This is the kind of crap we get for news in newspapers today: the writers weave an elaborate trail of ""facts"" arriving at a conclusion of wrongdoing without the reader even having to think. The writers of this piece of tripe-Sharon Theimer and Devlin Barrett-are trying to convince me that they have uncovered some brilliant piece of investigative reporting when what they have really done is present their own prejudiced views and convicted Guiliani of some wrongdoing. These writers are masquerading as news reporters but are actually political hacks that do not even recognize how misguided they have become. They probably think Giuliani is as stupid as they think they are smart. It is probably true that Giuliani made more than $16 million in earned income during the past 16 months, so what is the big deal? Do they think he is a trained attorney and a former prosecuting attorney who is now pig-slopping his way though deals to make income? Heck, virtually every candidate running for the presidency who could possibly win is at least a millionaire. John Edwards reported $1.25 million in earned income last year and has listed assets of at least $5 million. Heck, even newcomer Barack Obama knocked down more than a half-million in royalties for one of his books and an advance on another. I believe he earned at least $900,000+ in income last year. They could investigate Giuliani until they are blue in the face and fine nothing illegal has been happening. You can bet that any of the presidential candidates, regardless of party affiliation, are not going to be doing illegal moneymaking deals that could ruin their shot at being elected. They would likely wait for a more opportune, less media exposure time to cut a back room deal that would line their pockets. They may have some moral indiscretions along the way, but will likely cover their heinie in their financial dealings while running for the presidency. The AP story cites example after example of how Giuliani could be implicated in his lobbying and other money-making activities, and covers all of the supposed conflicts of interests arising from lobbying efforts, like every other candidate has not had any dealings with any government agency since becoming a politician. Good grief, all politicians make money hand over fist in all kinds of dealings, hundreds of which never become a matter of public record. So what? If any politician really screws up today, he or she is likely to be found out, right down to the money in the cooler. Virtually every politician at the national level has had their hand greased at one time or another, directly or indirectly. Almost any political candidate who takes campaign contributions of any kind could be shown, upon examination, to have rewarded the contributor with a timely vote that could be justified as legal, moral or honest. Lyndon Johnson did not make squat when he went into the Texas legislature as a schoolteacher and was a multi-millionaire before he was a President, all on a politician's wages.

4,The Abysmal State of Mental Health in the United States,politics," The devastating killings at Virginia Tech have highlighted the abysmal state of the mental health delivery system in the United States. We need public education to encourage individuals to go for help when they recognize feeling out–of-control or in a situation where they need counseling, support and advice. Some problems are chemical imbalances and often medications can reduce symptoms or stabilize the individual, if the person takes the medication. They don't always take them because the medications have such uncomfortable side effects that the  patient believes that the disease is easier to cope with than the drugs. Other problems are situational and don't need to be medicated but brought to the surface, worked out and resolved. The best way to do this is through ""talk therapy."" There are many modalities that effectively work to educate and empower people to stop repeated patterns of destructive and self-deprecating behaviors. Childhood trauma caused from molestation is one example. There is no drug to resolve the damage done and continuing negative effects on adult relationships like trust issues, guilt, shame and sexual confusion and dysfunction. These issues need to be resolved by other means. Medicating such a wound just exacerbates the dilemma and doesn't resolve or heal the wound. Neither does behavior modification. Grief is similar issue. Typically it isn't pathological, yet it hurts like hell for a long time. Medication isn't recommended. Talking about the pain and expressing the hurt is a healthier way to deal with grief. Knowing what to expect, the hot spots and the time frame is empowering. Just knowing that the immediate pain will heal  itself  is part of the healing process. Historically, we as a nation have attached a stigma of shame on the individual suffering from a mental problem and on the family. I know because in 1956 my father was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and rather than go to a hospital and inflict shame on his family and himself he killed himself at 45 years old. In the 1960's we began systematically to empty out all our mental hospital. Often they were less than ideal, but rather than reform them we dumped the patients onto the street. Many homeless people have serious mental problems as do most inmates crowding our jails. The mentally ill have no  safe place to go to get shelter and treatment they need. There are few long-term beds available. Half way houses substitute as a safe place to be housed, but they are rarely safe. Most of the population in prison need counseling and therapy to turn their lives around to reduce to high recidivism rate. Then in the 1990's the Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO's) appeared on the reimbursement stage and embraced short-term therapy with an emphasis on behavioral modification and limited psychotherapy to six or on occasion twelve sessions. Sessions necessary to complete effective therapy must be approved by the HMO responsible for service delivery. This was the death knoll to effective therapy for the severely mentally ill. Behavior modification is basically  a band-aid type of therapy believing if you change your thoughts you heal any pain or problems from old wounds. Just sweep it under the carpet and it will fade away. This works for some minor problems and patients who can adjust in a very structured modality but is not realistic for more severely wounded people, some need months and even years of therapy. The most seriously disturbed patients may take months just to establish trust in their therapist before they even reveal what happened to them. States don't have enough money to adequately fund Community Mental Health Programs. Many people fall between the cracks even when identified and mandated to get out patient therapy. Mental health practitioners are overloaded, overwhelmed and underpaid. It is a job with high burn out and high turn over. In community mental health agencies patients may be shuffeled from one therapist to another and must start all over with someone new adding to their problems. Private insurance limits  the  number of visits they will pay for through reimbursement and co-payments.  They closely monitor  the number of visits, that are regulated  by HMO staff. A mental health professional literally has to beg for additional visits when deemed necessary. Additionally the HMO tells the practitioner what they will pay and it is rarely his or her regular fees, always less. Mental health must become a higher priority in this country to prevent innocent people from becoming victims. All of society is responsible for this tragedy. We must demand more education, better treatment and prevention strategies to avoid similar incidents in the future. This is a  broken system and needs to be fixed. Now!"
5,Alternatives to Education Meltdown,politics," Why is it that education is never geared towards the majority? Does that sound harsh? Well, that's certainly the impression you would get if you listened to the latest debate about education in England. Check your daily newspaper right now, and you'll see it concerns our Conservative Party's reluctance to endorse the idea of building new Grammar Schools. I know all about them, all right. At the tender age of 11 I was thrown into the '11-Plus' Exam that we had in Britain at the time. For some reason, maybe more good luck than judgement, I did well. That allowed me into one of the top Grammar Schools in my city, where I stayed for the next 7 years. Later, my mother proudly told me, 'Son, you managed to get into the top 2 per cent in the test'. Hey, that's great, but how can you build an education system around the needs of the top 2 per cent? That leaves – how many? – out in the cold. Yes, 98 per cent. Damn, that's a lot of people, most of them directed towards a pretty second-rate schooling in what were then called 'Secondary Modern Schools'. They were 'Secondary', because that's schools for the 11 to 16 year olds, and they were 'Modern' because they got re-designed in the 1950s to meet the new needs of industry and commerce. They didn't last long. In the 1960s a new government came along, the Labour Party, and they promptly invented 'Comprehensive' schools, that is, schools that cater for everyone, at all levels. Confused? You should be. While all this was going on, the real top dogs, the people who grew, went to school and ended up running the country, ignored the topsy-turvy policies and carried on doing what they always have done - going to what we Brits call 'Public Schools', (what the rest of the world might think of as private schools). Don't know what they are? Think about the film 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' and just take it for granted that all those posh speaking men in the movie would have been educated in English Public Schools. That will give you some idea. So, British education comes out in levels. At the top level is the Public Schools, where rich people send their children to make sure they turn out like them. Next level down is the Grammar Schools, which we've still got! Yes folks, the Labour government said 'Let there be Comprehensives' in the 1960s, then forgot to abolish the Grammar Schools, so they carried on. They had to rely a bit on charity and a few floundered, but quite a lot milked the government for grants and survived. The Comprehensive Schools spread out into every parish and town, and Secondary Moderns disappeared, mainly by turning from the latter into the former. A change of name, some new buildings and 'Comprehensive' became the norm. For 'most people'. That's the point. For most young people in Merry Old England, the vast majority, in the last forty years, would have attended a Comprehensive School as a child. For some that worked out well, a few hated it, and most got by. Why aren't we arguing about that? For two reasons. One, the rich and famous avoided the debate altogether and kept right on using Public Schools. Second, the local Comprehensive schools – who took in everyone from their locality, right? - soon found that their catchment areas varied, the type of parent and pupil they received varied also, which meant that some schools did well, some didn't. If you start with good grapes you can get champagne, if you have trashy grapes, you can end up with vinegar. No surprise. Pushy parents saw what was happening and moved house, usually into an area that had a well-performing school. Their enthusiasm made the 'local' school even more successful, and it attracted the brightest kids and got the best results. Oh yes, those schools were 'Comprehensive' all right, it's just that some performed better than others. They weren't all the same, as the original planners somehow imagined they would be. So we debate that, don't we? No, we don't. The current row that's raging is about Grammar Schools. Remember them? We almost forgot about them back when things changed in the 1960s. The Conservative Party, just to prove that they have their finger on the pulse and is bang up to date with people's needs, is saying now that the country 'doesn't need any new ones'. So what? We'll just 'make do' with the ones we've got? Well, maybe, but that could be bad news for the layer of people slightly below 'rich and famous', the 'fairly well off and well connected', perhaps. They aren't happy. They can't afford to send their kids to Public Schools, and they know – since many of them went to Grammar Schools – that the Grammar School is just about the next best thing. It's a terrible shouting match, and means problems for the real debate that should be going on about education in Britain. And that is, what's the best way to educate the 98%? Because, if we can't solve that conundrum, we aren't just letting down the vast majority of our children, we're also laying up trouble for the future, since we aren't tackling the real issues that are leading – right now - to teacher burnout, administrative lack of confidence, and a vision that looks increasingly like educational meltdown."
6,On Politics - Giuliani Is a Pro Choice Republican - Part 1,politics," It is possible that Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani has infuriated his Democratic rivals to the point of distraction.  As a good Republican Giuliani should be pro life but he is pro choice. Being in favor of abortion on demand makes Giuliani more dangerous politically to Democrats than actually wiping out another life so women can retain their right of choice at the expense of their potential progeny.  Only Democrats are supposed to be pro choice. You can imagine the Democrats' extreme agitation and emotional response to Giuliani horning in on their ""sacred"" territory.  I can assure you that the exterminated unborn do not consider abortion sacred at all. Giuliani is now under searing attack from every Democrat and flaming left-wing Democratic news organization worthy of the name. I recently read three news stories about Giuliani's candidacy and thought I would tackle some thoughts on Giuliani, politics, politicians, pundits and predators. My initial interest took flight when reading Charles Krauthammer's recent piece (5-13-07) titled ""Giuliani's Abortion Stance Makes Sense"". If you have never read Charlie's stuff, you might want to try him on for size.  Krauthammer is a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for the Washington Post (not too shabby as former Opera Man Adam Sandler used to say on Saturday Night Live). The Financial Times named Krauthammer as America's most influential commentator in 2006.  I would not go that far because I think Ann Coulter and Dick Morris are in his league in terms of discernment and thought power.  Coulter is the best at identifying political posturing, and Morris is the best at identifying political strategy. I did not purposely go looking for information on Giuliani or any other politician seeking to become the next President of the United States.  I generally cannot stand politics or politicians, but more on that later. I see Krauthammer on television occasionally and marvel at the conversation.  Usually he appears with some other famous pundits on a political show and I watch intently as his fellow companions say little as they drone on about a subject.  Then Krauthammer starts speaking, and I immediately realize that this is one smart intellect actually saying something that makes eminent sense. The difference between Krauthammer and the others is the difference between night and day.  I generally always agree with Krauthammer and I always respect and admire his ability to defend his point of view.  Krauthammer puts together compound and complex sentences flawlessly and is totally on task. He does not waste time spinning out political fodder like almost every other commentator does.  Most commentators are so busy spewing out the typical Republican or Democratic line of crap that they have nothing to offer that would increase a person's knowledge and understanding. Krauthammer's piece on Giuliani was interesting to me because he inadvertently reminded me that any politician's position on abortion is irrelevant ""because neither presidents nor legislatures nor referendums decide this issue.  Judges do."" Amen, Charlie, you are so right.  I have decided to ignore what any presidential candidate's position is on abortion; it does not matter. Sure, some unrealistic souls think a clever Republican President that nominates a new U. S. Supreme Court justice can carry the day on Roe v. Wade by appointing a real conservative judge. Those days are long gone.  The nominee will never be approved by the United States Senate.  Too many conservative judges who are politically appointed do not vote as conservatively as presidents would like.  Some judges flip positions, like Chief Justice William Rehnquist did after originally opposing the 1966 Miranda ruling as ""legislating from the bench"" but upholding it in 2000. Giuliani's position apparently is that it would be OK to repeal Roe v. Wade and also OK if a strict constructionist judge viewed it as precedent, what legal folks like to call stare decisis (Latin), the legal principle of determining points in litigation according to precedent. Krauthammer said ""I hope for the day when Roe is overturned"" and added that ""Abortion is already so contaminated with legalisms, why not turn the issue into one of simple democracy?  Let the people decide.  Let them work it out the way everything else in this country is worked out-by political argument and legislative accommodation."" I will read anything Krauthammer writes because he is a rarity in our country, a person who actually thinks and can present a case cogently. (Editor's Note: This ends Part 1 of a 5-Part Series)"
7,The Government In Ancient Rome: Who Ruled in Early Rome,politics," The city of Rome has an historical legacy of 3000 years and was founded in 753 BC by Romulus considered the first King of Rome. Romulus was fed by the she Wolf with his brother Remus when their mother was obliged to leave them in a basket on the docks of the Tiber River. Romulus accomplished many important reformations in ancient Rome like the creation of the army and the institution of the roman senators, which represented the richest members of the roman families. After Romulus other kings like Numa Pompilius took care more of the religious habits of the Romans and instead created more priests in order to get deeper into the respect of the rules belonging to the roman religion. In fact, observing respectfully the roman religion could guarantee a better peace between the romans and their gods. The last period of the monarchic period in early Rome was characterized by the Etruscan Kings which made important constructions in Rome like the Cloaca Maxima and the Circus maximus but they were considered tyrants by the population and they were overthrowned in 509 BC. The latin writers said that , at this point of the roman history, the romans would never stand to be governed by one person. In this way they decided to split the religious power and the civil and political powers giving them to two men elected every year: the consuls. The consuls marked the roman annual calendar as we know from many inscriptions and were also the chief commanders of the roman army. At the end of their ruling period, they became life senators as a way to be rewarded for having been working for the state. senators were helped also by other minor magistrates, like the praetors, encharged to celebrate the trials every day in the Roman forum. There were also prefects in Rome, whose job it was to run the city – some heard court cases, some ran the vegetable markets or the meat markets or the port. The forum, originally a marshy valley between the Quirinal and Esquiline Hills, became the focus of public and political life.  It was divided down the middle by the cloaca maxima, probably originially meant to be a storm sewer or drainage ditch.  By the 6th century BC it was covered, and by the 2nd century BC it was Rome's chief sewer.  Shops and houses lined the forum on the northeast and southwest sides.   People assembled in the Comitium, a rectangular enclosure oriented to the four points of the compass.  The Senate House (curia) was built into the north end of the Comitium, as was a speaker's platform, the rostra.  On the southeast end of the forum stood the regia, the former kings' palace.  It was now occupied by the Pontifex Maximus and Vestal Virgins. There were tribunes, who were supposed to speak for the poorer people in the Senate. Tribunes were elected by the assembly, and they could veto (stop) anything the Senate voted for that affected the poor (which ended up being pretty much anything the Senate voted on)."
8,Haiti vs Brain Drain,politics," The state of the State of Haiti is so complex that it requires profound knowledge of its history to understand its current image. As early as the late 1940’s, intellectual Haitians have turned to other countries, either voluntarily or forcibly, in search of a better life or higher salaries; and in so doing, Haiti has become the greatest victim of what Social Scientists referred to as “Brain Drain”, losing skilled people to other countries. Considering the number of intellectual Haitians who are living outside the world of Haiti, one must wonder, what if they have stayed home and what difference it would have made? A great assess for success of a country is certainly a strong intellectual class, however, Haiti is lacking such a class. For our purpose here, the intellectual class is composed of Educators, Doctors, Lawyers, Social Scientists, Journalists, Businessmen, Scientists, and Economists and so on. It is believed that, because of the gap between the haves and haves not, the knowledgeable and the not so knowledgeable, and on top of that, the irrepressible problem poses by Brain Drain, Haiti has become a country of profiteering and leaderless. There are those who believe that there is actually an intellectual class in Haiti but it has been silenced and secluded itself from the affairs of the country. I believe that it would be selfish if such a class existed and allowed itself to witness the dying of a country right before its eyes. It is an alleged reason to believe that such a class existed for I believe that the intellectual class of Haiti is actually living outside the world of Haiti and this class must be approached in order for any dramatic changes to take place in Haiti. The Brain Drain phenomenon creates a vacuum in Haitian society and thereby allows Haitian “leaders” to lead the country without a real challenge of opposition to their mediocre political agendas. These “leaders” have too often focused on their own interest rather than that of Haiti. It is just about time to get rid of the politics of self-interest and launch a campaign behind the politics of national interest. We must get out of the clouds that embedded our views for the well being of this beautiful Island. It is not daring to claim that we too, Haitians, have big dreams for our country and we should not therefore be afraid to talk about ending poverty in Haiti. We too can talk about health care for our Haitian counterparts; we too can talk about job training for our people who are desperately in need and to say the least, we too can talk about improving our public safety, education and justice for all. And on the contrary, one would argue how could we do it all when we cannot even provide our people its most inalienable rights, which are the rights to life, to be fed, sheltered, and educated and to live in a safety environment? To make it probable, we ought to welcome our fellow professional Haitians back to the mother land. These professionals, or as they are called, the victims of the Brain Drain phenomenon, are part of the reasons why Haiti is trailing behind the developing world. Professional Haitians who are living outside the world of Haiti are potential resources in the quest for change in Haiti. In other words, they are essential tools in order for any dramatic changes to take place in Haiti. If given a chance, we will witness a mammoth of progress inside Haiti. One should not be reluctant to claim that the Brain Drain phenomenon is indeed a cause of the growing problems inside Haiti. Without a doubt, Brain Drain is a terrible factor and a menace to Haiti’s development. Has it not been for Brain Drain, I strongly believe that Haiti would have been in a much better position instead of what the world shamefully refers to as the poorest country in the western hemisphere. In the absence of a strong intellectual class, no nations can acclaimed the reputation of being a developed country. The intellectual class of a society is its watchdog, making sure that everything works out according to the norms, regulations and laws of the land; and such is not the case in Haiti. The Brain Drain phenomenon has and continues to be a threat to Haiti’s well being. Currently, the youths of Haiti, who are indeed the future of the country, have one thing in common. No, it’s not their love for Haiti. It is the wish of getting a visa for any destination away from Haiti and to never step foot back. After graduating from High School, most Haitians would stop attending school because they don’t see why bother studying when there is absolutely no hope to do so, though they are willing to continue their studies. Have you ever wondered why foreign embassies require that visa seekers be educated? This is their way of saying, if you’re coming to my country; you should be able to contribute one way or the other to the well being of my society. So when we fail to give hope to the youths of Haiti, we can only expect to see them leaving the country and to never step foot back. Thus we must ask ourselves, what would it take for Haitians to stay home? The greatest challenge is already solved. Haitians love Haiti, especially those who have left it have come to appreciate it more after leaving. I have never seen a people so attached to their country as Haitians, even in the face of poverty, humiliation and so many negativities. Give me security, a good education, jobs, and a sense of belonging and I will stay home. This is the cry in Haiti. Haitian authorities would have to create a policy or an environment that would encourage Haitians to stay home. Focus must be placed on educating the people as a whole and revamping the school system by emphasizing on a strong civic education, giving hope to the people and security that would attract foreign investors. For Haitians to stay home, they must not be treated as statistical numbers but as individual of importance. Those who have become victims of Brain Drain are hoping to be able to return home and contribute to the effort of rebuilding Haiti. It is the government’s responsibility to create conditions that would pave the way for a massive return of intellectual Haitians to Haiti. We have sadly come to a point where Haitians are afraid of vacationing in Haiti. This is the last straw and Haitian authorities must take appropriate actions to regain the trust of Haitians in the Diaspora."
9,Eisenhower Doctrine,politics," In the history of international diplomacy the appearance of the Eisenhower Doctrine was an important and life changing document. Before January of 1957 there was no such notion in the entire world; it was introduced by President Eisenhower. Before that date all countries decided for themselves what political direction they were taking and were on their own in the political world arena. By that time the Soviet Union however was a powerful and ever growing country with desires to occupy more and more territories and to control as many countries as it could. Situation in the Middle East was a very favorable one for such actions of the Soviets that only waited for a suitable moment to contribute their political domination to those territories. Most of the Middle East countries were struggling for the independence and were trying to establish self-governing systems as in developed parts of the world. In the course of the history they frequently found themselves in the middle of fighting and misunderstanding between the nations, thus it was a rough process which was still continuing. In the midst of such conditions it was understandable that those countries were a piece of cake for the Soviet Union to make them communist ""believers"". The problem was not only based on the Soviet’s desire, but mainly on the opponent‘s inability to resist the pressure of being involved in a new political system. The immediate reason and pushing power of the famous doctrine was Suez war. This war was aimed at the reservation of the Egypt’s nationalization in the Suez Canal Company. Three participants: France, Britain and Israel failed greatly in helping Egypt and this fact caused creation of a whole new page in the diplomatic world history. Britain at that time was considered the most powerful country in the Western World and also in the Middle East as well. After an Egyptian failure nations were not likely to view the UK as a leader and helper anymore. The United States was one of the first countries which doubted Britain’s ability to play a role in the big political world as it did before. The States feared that now as the place is not occupied by Britain anymore, it would be taken by the Soviets. It was highly unlikely though, as for such a purpose they would have to take military actions and to intrude into neighboring with Egypt countries. Another scenario considered economic dependency and military aid of the Arab countries from the Soviet Union. A few countries were already under such a condition which meant that soon majority of them would follow the example. Eisenhower and his Doctrine sought to provide economic aid, military aid and overall American protection of the Middle Eastern world from the vicious Soviet propaganda. Needless to say that, the United States was looking for their certain benefit in this political game. Clearly the States was primarily pursuing the idea of freedom, independence and democracy while giving a helping hand to the Middle East region. However politicians wanted to fill out the gap that was created during the Suez War, the power to be a ""power"" in the Middle East and lobby their own political interests was a very appealing possibility. Thus the United States started to actively participate in the international politics, mainly by issuing the Doctrine. Looking at the world history it becomes clear that this was one of the few chances for America to seize a moment and become the second greatest power in the world together with the Soviet Union, at that time period. After World War II, America was a rich country as it suffered the least from the destruction, human loses and material loses. It was economically better off than many European countries that were still recovering after horrible devastations of the war. It had better organized military, more funds to sponsor the needy and what’s more important-it had a stable government that at least visually from a distant Middle East looked comforting. Thus the United States was in a perfect position to lead a dominant role in the game of a long Cold War. It not only was seeking to protect the nations from the Communist invasion, Eisenhower Doctrine also was aimed at containing the radical Arab nationalism of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser and moreover discrediting his policy of ""positive neutrality"" in the Cold War. Officially it meant that Arab nations were allowed to enjoy profitable relations with both Cold War blocs. In reality however it turned out to be a hostile treatment of the American interference into their business and Nasser grew to hate the West and become more close to the Communist world. America as a response to such behavior was aiming its politics on the strengthening its power in the traditional and conservative Arab regimes in countries such as Libya, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon. By making such diplomatic move, the States sought to insure their presence in the Eastern world after all. It was a very smart decision as those countries with the financial and military aid from America were more willing to look at the West and follow their political directions, rather than join in with the Nasser’s regime and look up to the Communists. These actions were not completely successful in the end and American government had to discontinue fighting with the regime as their strategy for its elimination was wrong chosen in the first place. Looking back at the time when Eisenhower Doctrine was written and pronounced, one can note that it was success and a failure at the same time. The primary reason of preventing Soviet Union’s expansion and intrusion into the Middle East territories was successfully fulfilled as the intrusion never happened. On the other hand, America was seeking to dominate in that area, taking Britain’s place in the game but was far from being affective in the implementation of the strategic plans. From the very beginning it looked like States have overestimated their power and political advantage in the East. Cultural differences, traditions and a long history of British domination were in the way of productive cooperation with all parties in the Middle East. All those factors put together resulted in the completion of the Doctrine’s existence and realization of it on the Eastern lands. It did however make an impact on the course of history of the US-Middle East relations; it prevented them from communism and strengthened their national unique spirit."
10,A Look Back At History,politics," Haiti, the world’s first Black Republic, the second in the Americas, has been referred to many names such as, “La Perle des Antilles, Quisqueya, Bohio, Hispaniola ect. It would be inconclusive to talk about Haiti without mentioning the Republic of France. After being a Spanish colony, beginning in 1492 with the arrival of Christopher Columbus and, as a result of the War of the Grand Alliance (1688-1697), the eastern part of Hispaniola was traded to France under the treaty of Ryswick in 1697 and renamed Saint-Domingue. After the annihilation of the native Indians of Ayiti by the Spaniards, it became clear that a new class of laborers be introduced in the Island. As Hispaniola was in a desperate need of alternate means to improve the local economy, Bishop Bartolome de las Casas, a Dominican priest, who later became a champion in defending the rights of the Indians to exist, has suggested the importation of African laborers to work on the plantation and mine fields. It is important to note that Bishop Bartolome, early in his career, have benefited greatly from the encomienda system (a royal granting of land and serfs, Indians), especially after the conquer of Cuba by the Spaniards for his contribution to the war. This suggestion of importing slaves from Africa was a low point in his career; in fact, it was very impolitic for he was so much focused on finding ways to free the enslaved Indians that he failed to notice that righteous cannot come from two wrongs. Nicolás de Ovando, who became the first Governor of Haiti, took the suggestion and first ordered four thousand African slaves, from Europe, to be sent to Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and Jamaica at a thousand per Island. By the year 1518, the very first shipload of enslaved Africans directly from Africa arrived in the West Indies. It should be noticed that prior to 1518, the enslaved Africans were being sent to Europe. By the late 1690’s, the French had total control of Saint-Domingue. For Saint-Domingue to become the richest colony in the world, it was instrumental that the slave trade be at its peak. Dragging from Africa to Saint-Domingue, the slaves were packed like sardines in a can. This inhuman behavior became an uncompromising and profitable trade, a way of earning cash; that was the worst trade of humanity; it was a slave trade, the selling of human beings. This was the horrendous path by which Haitians, formerly Africans, arrived in Haiti. The male slaves were planter, laborers and the females were mostly used as sex objects. Wasn’t that cruel? Most of the slaves were beaten to death, raped and forced to work the land from dust till dawn. Gender did not really make a difference. The rebelling slaves suffered the most; they were killed a number of ways. One of them is what I called the “Balding Head Syrup”. This practice was done as follow: the master would force the rebelling slave to dig up a hole of his size so that the body can fit into it. The master would then order another slave to shave the head of the rebelling slave. The rebelling slave would then be forced into the hole; with a hairless head, the master would pour hot boiled syrup on it. The entire body would be immerged under ground, leaving the “Balding Head Syrup” for flies, roaches and all kinds of insects to enjoy it. When death occurred, usually one to two days later, the head would then be covered with soil. This was an atrocious way to be killed. Was this type of killings justified? Has slavery ever been justified? These are tough and important questions that we must ask ourselves. After years of oppression, turmoil and abuses, the slaves have revolted against their French masters. They sought not only the Independence of Saint-Domingue, but complete freedom of the entire Black population. The Revolution of Saint-Domingue started by a gathering led by Voudou priest named Boukman, a slave from Jamaica. This gathering has come to be known as the “Ceremonie du Bois Caiman”, named after the village in which the gathering took place. At this ceremony, the slaves prayed their gods for their liberation from the savages. It was not until August 26, 1789, which marked the date of the Declaration of the Rights of Man in France that the slaves have totally revolted against their masters. If the French could have equal rights to life, liberty and freedom, so could the slaves. That was the focus point behind the revolution. For some people, the revolution of French Saint-Domingue was like a volcano waiting to be erupted. The Declaration of the Rights of Man by the French National Assembly in August 26, 1789 was the green light to the volcano. The slaves fought vigorously and triumphantly for their freedom. Some of the slaves’ leaders were Toussaint Louverture, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Henry Christophe et.al. Led by Toussaint Louverture in 1791, the Revolution of Saint-Domingue briefly reduced the importation of African slaves; however, it was not until Independence Day that the slaves were totally emancipated. Sending troops to Haiti to capture Toussaint was Napoleon’s biggest and the most unforgettable mistake. Enslaving Toussaint did not bring success to the French’s cause; it rather brought an economic burden, such as the necessary selling of Louisiana to the Americans. On his way to exile, leaving behind his beloved land, Toussaint said the following: “In overthrowing me, you have only cut down in Saint-Domingue the trunk of the tree of liberty of the Blacks; it will spring up again from the roots for the roots are profound and numerous. What did he mean by that? Did the French have any clues as to what he was talking about? By cutting down the head of the palm tree, which is a symbol of freedom for Haitians, the French had no idea as to what the roots would have become. Toussaint knew exactly what he was saying. Amongst the roots was the marvelous and courageous Jean-Jacques Dessalines. Dessalines, the bravest of them all, the executioner, was the one that even the Frenchmen’s dog would bark out his name. The other slaves called him the brave. While fighting the enemy, he stood firmly inside a fort and said to his troops “I want to keep with me only the braves. Those of you who want to remain slaves of the Whites (Frenchmen) can exit the fort and those, in the contrary, who want to live as free men come around me. Koupé tèt boulé kay (cut down theirs heads and burn down their houses). Liberty or Death”. That was Dessalines at his best. Under the leadership of Toussaint L'ouverture, Dessalines led many successful battles, such as the Battle of Crête-à-Pierrot. After the capture of Toussaint in 1802, Dessalines became the leader of the revolution. The revolutionary war of Saint-Domingue was, perhaps, the bloodiest of all wars. In fact, people were butchered down, hung and poisoned. After a number of wars, guerillas and conspiracies, Dessalines and his troops have eventually destroyed the French troops, sent by Napoleon under the leadership of General Rochambeau, at the Battle of Vertières in 1803. After the battle of Vertières, Dessalines has declared Haiti’s independence on January 1, 1804. After winning the Independence war, Dessalines met with the heroic leaders and called upon Boirond-Tonnerre to write the Declaration of Independence of the newly Republic, which was then changed from French Saint-Domingue to Haiti. A few lines of Haiti’s Declaration of Independence by Boiron Tonnerre follow: “In order to write the Declaration of our Independence, we ought to have the skin of a White man (Frenchman) for parchment, his skull for inkstand, his blood for ink and a bayonet for pen”. Dessalines was then chosen by a council of generals (blacks and mulattos) to assume the office of Governor-General. Nine months later, he proclaimed himself Emperor Jacques 1er in September 1804 and ruled Haiti until his assassination on October 17, 1806. Even after being devastated by wars, yet Haiti was the biggest and richest crop growing country in the world. This country was not always the poorest and the most ignored of the Western Hemisphere. Historian who studied Haiti would proudly argue that it was the fastest economy growing Caribbean Country of the 19th century and a nation full of pride. Today, Haiti is sadly begging to retain its sovereignty."
11,"Leaders of Haiti, Is There Any?",politics," Leaders of Haiti, is there any? This question would have been irrelevant have I asked it during the thirty years before February 7, 1986. The notion of Haitian leaders was very much a delusion during the era of the Duvaliers. Under the leadership of the Duvaliers, anyone who attempted to raise concerns or talk against the regime would most likely be disappeared in the middle of the night, killed or tortured; and if they were lucky enough, they would have been forced into exile. Today, February 7, 2007, 21 years after the deposed of President Jean Claude Duvalier, what have we accomplished? With President Duvalier out of the country, a wave of “leaders” emerged in Haiti; they are what I refer to as “Passive Leaders”. Many critics argue that the deposed of President Duvalier was not, in any ways, a result of leadership among Haitians. Others even argue that it wasn’t the Haitians who deposed the president but the United States government. In the midst of all that, where does the truth lay? Let it be reminded that the movement against President Duvalier, which has come to be known as Dechoukay, began in early 1985. The movement was not a result of any leader or leaders but the will of a tired, over abused people against a do nothing president. It was an ad hoc movement. The Haitians became their own leaders for they led the movement through their music, arts, paintings, churches and even pirated radio shows. As a clever people, the heirs of Vertieres knew how powerful the regime was but, they equally knew that the will of a well determined nation for freedom cannot wait. The strategy was to have all cities, suburbs, villages and communities throughout the country to rise against the regime. Proven historically, Haitians have one powerful weapon which they rarely use; and when they do, they become unstoppable. This weapon is their togetherness. It took three deaths to witness this powerful weapon in action. It was not until November 28, 1985, following the deaths of Jean Robert Sius, Daniel Isaac and Marc-Enson Michelle, all students killed by the tonton macoutes in Gonaives that the Haitian people totally united against the president and his associates. Together, the Haitians did put an end to the Duvaliers’ empire in Haiti. Shortly after the deposed of the president emerged the so-called “Passive Leaders”. They came from all over the world; some of them were the ones forced into exile  and others were simply ordinary Haitians living abroad. These were groups of individuals with their own ideologies aiming at the National Palace. The whole purpose of their returning to Haiti was to succeed President Duvalier. Such people cannot be called “Leaders”. Notice that for anyone to become a leader, the following statement must be justified: Someone becomes a leader, if (and only if) he/she becomes the will of the people to be led. Is there such a character in the Haitian political arena? Some would aptly argue that President Jean Bertrand Aristide could be described as such. Is he still the hero of the 1990’s? Furthermore, the “Passive Leaders” were put to a test; a test where they had a chance to prove themselves and they frankly flunk the test. This test was the deposed of President Jean Bertrand Aristide by the Haitian Army in 1991. Which one of these “leaders” condemned the military coup? Has anyone of them stood up to defend the will of the people? They were instead quiet, hoping that Mr. Cedras, the then Army Chief, would call upon one of them to succeed President Aristide. This proves the lack of leadership that existed and continues to exist in Haiti. The silence of the Haitian “Leaders” during the 1991 coup d’état against President Aristide was the biggest disappointment in Haitian politics of the 1990’s. After all, a leader has all the rights to oppose Aristide, however, how in the world could one call himself a leader when he opposes to the will of the people to be led? The main goal of the “Passive Leaders” is to become president. They are not interested in being a senator, deputy, mayor, ambassador or even a judge. They want to hold the highest office of the land. As my late grand mother used to joke, “en chaque Haitien, il y a un president” (there is a president in each Haitian). We need to change this mentality and start working together for a better Haiti. It is an ego and a presidential sickness. Now that we are four years away to our next presidential election, none of the so-called “Leaders” is working toward helping the ordinary people or involving in programs that would benefit the Haitian people; they are rather busy preparing their speeches for the upcoming presidential election of 2010. As a result of this lack of leadership and because the movement against President Duvalier was so spontaneous, I frankly believe that Haitians were not readily prepared for the eventual post Duvalier era. Because the uprooting of the president was not planned, Haitians failed to foresee the aftermath of Duvalier; and unfortunately, chaos was nicknamed democracy after the deposed of the president. Nowadays, a great number of Haitians argue that Haiti would have been better off had President Duvalier stayed. Such an argument is understandable because Haitians are truly becoming more and more desperate and helpless than ever. However, this is not an argument that I am ready to support. As we say in Haiti, “qui n’avance pas récule” (who does not advance moves back). This is my position when it comes to describing the post Duvalier era in Haiti. A vivid example is the State of Iraq. A recent survey reveals that more than 70% of Iraqis argue that Iraq was better off under Saddam Hussein. Due to the situation in Iraq, it is easy to understand why some people would argue as such. Does that turn Saddam Hussein into a hero? It is far from that, nonetheless, the day to day nightmare forces the people of Iraq to look back at the relative calm under Saddam Hussein; and that can also be said about Haiti. Twenty one years after the deposed of President Duvalier, Haitian should now be focused on moving forward not looking backward. Instead, we have to rethink our way of behaving toward elected governments in Haiti. Rather than taking to streets and advocate the overthrowing of an elected government, we need to emphasize on taking to the polls and unseat a do nothing government. In a democracy, if taking to the streets and advocate the overthrowing of an elected, sometimes selected, president was allowed, a certain George W Bush would have joined the ex-presidents’ club. This is to say, hypothetically, if it occurs that President Preval is unable to fullfil his promises, we should voice our concerns but taking to the streets and advocate his overthrowing should not be an option. The people’s choice is very narrow when it comes to choosing a leader. The faces are the same since 1986. We need to broaden the choices of the people by bringing in new faces and new ideas that would eventually bring relief to the people and positive results to the political crisis that we are all fed up with. We are evidently neither ready to claim that we have leaders in Haiti nor can we rightly argue that there isn’t any; however, we can definitely argue that there is a lack of leadership in Haiti. The question to ask follows: where do we go from here? Let me be the first to say that there isn’t anything that the Haitian people cannot accomplish. We simply have to find a common cause and pursue it. That’s what we did in November 1803 in Vertieres and most recently, February 7, 1986, April 20, 1990 (the crossing of the Brooklyn bridge, NYC, march against the stereotype of Haitians as the originators of the HIV virus) and frankly December 16, 1990 (the first democratic presidential elections held in Haiti)."
12,The Upcoming 2008 Presidential Race,politics," A few days ago, I realized that the US presidential election is fast approaching. You see, I was watching the news a few nights ago and I saw a political ad endorsing Sen. Hillary Clinton. I also saw the results of the results of the recent election 2008 polls on the news. It dawned upon me that the election will be held next year. This event is clearly very important because it will determine the direction of our country. It will also affect the whole world as the newly elected president will make decisions regarding foreign policies. Of course, the next thing that entered my mind was the possible candidates who will be competing for the presidency. I also realized that I know very little about the election so I need to do some reading about the election and the candidates so that I can make a wise decision. I decided to hop on my PC and some online research about the 2008 presidential race and the candidates. Thanks to modern technology and the World-Wide-Web, gathering information about a certain subject has become easy and convenient. You don’t have to go to a library to delve into a topic nowadays. All you need is a computer and an Internet connection and you can get your hands on all the information you need. The best thing is that you can do it all at the comforts of your own home. Anyway, I found a lot of information about the 2008 presidential race on the Internet. For instance, I found out that the upcoming election will be the first election without incumbents in 80 years. The vice president is normally the leading candidate and nominee to succeed an American President that is about to leave his office. However, there is no incumbent president seeking re-election and no incumbent vice-president attempting to win office on the upcoming election. This is significant because the incumbent Vice President has immediately thereafter run for President in the three most recent presidential administrations featuring an outgoing, two-term president. As you probably know, Dick Cheney, the current Vice President of the United States, announced that he would never run for president in 2001. This means that the 2008 presidential race, will apparently be a non-incumbent or ""open seat"" election in which neither the sitting President nor the sitting Vice President will be a candidate. The last non-incumbent or ""open seat"" election happened in 1928. I also found out in the course of my research that, six candidates has achieved ""front runner"" status. These are John McCain of Arizona, Mitt Romney of Massachusetts and Rudy Giuliani of New York on the Republican side; and John Edwards of North Carolina, Barack Obama of Illinois and Hillary Clinton of New York on the Democratic party. These candidates are currently leading on the recent 2008 election polls but the figures may change as we move closer to the election. Are you also interested in the upcoming election? If you are, then all you have to do is hop on your PC or Mac. You can easily check out the latest news, polls, and information on the candidates and the progress of the election on the web.

Thomas Jefferson was born on April 13th of 1743 and no one could have known how important the words would be that this child would speak. This month we celebrate his birth with these 17 famous Thomas Jefferson quotes: ""It is incumbent on every generation to pay its own debts as it goes. A principle which if acted on would save one-half the wars of the world."" ""An injured friend is the bitterest of foes."" ""Be polite to all, but intimate with few."" ""No occupation is so delightful to me as the culture of the earth, and no culture comparable to that of the garden."" ""It is error alone which needs the support of government. Truth can stand by itself."" ""A democracy is nothing more than mob rule, where fifty-one percent of the people may take away the rights of the other forty-nine."" ""The Creator has not thought proper to mark those in the forehead who are of stuff to make good generals. We are first, therefore, to seek them blindfold, and then let them learn the trade at the expense of great losses."" ""There is a natural aristocracy among men. The grounds of this are virtue and talents."" ""We may consider each generation as a distinct nation, with a right, by the will of its majority, to bind themselves, but none to bind the succeeding generation, more than the inhabitants of another country."" ""Where the press is free and every man able to read, all is safe."" ""Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter."" ""War is an instrument entirely inefficient toward redressing wrong; and multiplies, instead of indemnifying losses."" ""Sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted with the government of himself. Can he, then be trusted with the government of others? Or have we found angels in the form of kings to govern him? Let history answer this question."" ""Only aim to do your duty, and mankind will give you credit where you fail."" ""I'm a great believer in luck and I find the harder I work, the more I have of it."" ""I am mortified to be told that, in the United States of America, the sale of a book can become a subject of inquiry, and of criminal inquiry too."" ""I was bold in the pursuit of knowledge, never fearing to follow truth and reason to whatever results they led, and bearding every authority which stood in their way."" Let these wise Thomas Jefferson quotes not only remind us of what this wonderful nation was built upon, but that trials of today are not so very different from the trials of our past."
14,The ‘Porkmeisters’…Cloaked In Secrecy…Ply Their Trade Of Separating Tax Payers,politics," There won’t be a pair of pants big enough to remove the evidence of this pork outrage from the Depositary For The National Archives. Participants will be left with explaining to their future heirs and families their roles as a fully operation “Porkmeister”. Under the faint shield of just getting their ‘due’ for their district deals are struck and America’s future is mortgaged up to its eyeballs. If there ever was a case for term limitations this is it. Familiarity of this modus operandi breeds contempt. The chart in the “club” ranks the biggest porker of them all. “Gosh if I could just get to the top” muses a sharp elbowed elected official pushing toward the money trough for the daily hit of slop from the tax payer money flow of tax revenues all in the pitch of darkness. Waistlines increase as the ‘Let’s Make A Deal’ is played out daily. Long term seniority can magnify and command even more pork. Is there any ‘Mr. (Ms.) Smiths in Washington now? Maybe, Barak Obama and Tom Colburn with their plan to put the budget online could at least shine the light on the players so they could at least “Man Up” to “Yeah, I sponsored that pork attachment”. Senator Barak Obama from the State of Illinois and Abraham Lincoln with Senator Tom Colburn from the State of Oklahoma and Will Rogers with being Junior Senators from their respective states perhaps could bring with them the spirit of Lincoln and Rogers to Washington. Wow! Would that be refreshing for a change? Both of the parties are stinking up the country right now. As a nation, we deserve better and we must DEMAND more. China recognizing the power of the Internet has restricted its use and has even developed its own system. With a host of Internet monitors trying to get their arms around any communication that will show their government in a bad light is censored. The Chinese are now mastering the online power of satire where if you can’t read between the lines, then your not understanding the writers drift. The cat is out of the bag in China. The Internet is America’s only hope that the Bloggers in China can marshal enough support to prevent their country from taking a wrong turn. The same hope remains for America. The Blogashere and other online activity in the Internet will bring all the governing bodies under close scrutiny for all to see. An informed electorate is America’s hope. Truth eventually will come out. Having all congressional bills and budgetary items online with ALL the sponsors named will point the brightest and most focused stage spotlight to the proponents of pork.  Operating in darkness shields the “Porkmeisters” from scrutiny. If a project is so weak and without merit and the only way for its passage is to stick it on the trailing tail of a bigger bill than that is just so lame and impotent.  Yes earmarks and “secret endorsements” lead to runaway spending. Since the line item veto was struck down the executive branch has little option but to rattle the sword and veto the entire bill and hope that it there are not enough additional votes to over ride the veto. Otherwise, Presidents would need to hold their nose and sign it any way. Perhaps it is time to make another effort to take another run at putting the line item veto in place with hopes of getting a better play with the Supreme Court. Until then, we are left to try and shine a light on the budgetary and legislation enactment by putting everything online and let the public see exactly who is doing what. Parading ones voting record and actions can only help to mute the abuses that are currently under way. There are huge challenges ahead for America in the Social Security and Medicare sectors that need adjustments NOW. Additional taxation will further burden the middle Americans who have enough on their plate as it is. The Fair Tax or other tax alternative may give the financial income to not only fund these needed programs but eat away the swelling national debt and make America competitive on the world stage. One major benefit would be to remove the need for any lobbyist looking to buttonhole an elected official to get their client a tax loophole. No corporate or individual taxes would do away with pork-laden bills and stealth riders, as there would not be any IRS code to modify. The safety net for low income families will offset any increase to the family budget for a national sales tax and have built in protections against additional burdens to the lower income segments. This program can make a lot of sense but will be fought tooth and nail by all the special interests protecting their little corners of the world. Term limitations could put a dent into the “Career Politicians” where pay backs and back scratching are the rule. Having fresh faces each term would be a learning curve for each with no long-term memory to resource of who is owed what favor. Fresh ideas, fresh approaches with new points of view. That is the base of attraction for Barak Obama. Thus far, appears untethered to special interests and is outside of the old party machine. Obama has shown the ability to reach across the aisle to Senator Tom Colburn, the biggest thorn in the “Porkmeister’s” side to put the budget and bills on the Internet for ALL to see. It will take fresh thinking and fresh ideas with a flow of fresh blood. America was founded based on a “can do” attitude. Lately, the country is reeking with negativism and frankly its becoming tiresome. When lawmakers are below attorneys in the polls the electorate are on to them. Changes must come. Special interests must be put aside and some new “Mr. (Ms.) Smiths Must Come To Washington”. If the tough issues are not addressed soon, families will be increasingly under financial pressure with their very credit and financial foundations at stake. Things have to change. Unfortunately, the situation many times needs to get really bad before it gets better. With enemies trying to destroy our way of life, we must become strong again from within. A return to looking at making the tax system fair and removing much of the special interest lobbying efforts to grab a loop hole at the tax payers expense would be a good start. The Fair Tax could do just that. Will this be an easy sell? No way! It will be tough to do. It will impact the “Porkmeisters” and many of the lobbyists trying to buy influence. Term limits with real limited campaign budgets will broaden the citizen pool with people who want to compete on the basis of ideas not how much cash they can raise. When some campaign budgets approach the governmental budgets of some countries, it’s time for a change. It now is a campaign of exclusion for lack of a large cash stash to run for office. After the term is up, the elected “new blood” needs to go back to work where they were making a living before. No where was this valued citizenry participation meant to be a “life time calling”. Serve the term, do great work and go back to work. No full retirement for part time effort that has not measured up, representatives need to pay Social Security just like other Americans, no special parking spaces, nothing. To serve in an elected capacity is a privilege not another entitlement. Serve one term and go home and get back to work and encourage others to run and serve. Pass it on and keep it going. Definitely, becoming a “Porkmeister” and all that it brings with it is not the goal. Making America a better country needs to be the only goal through positive and innovative thinking and bringing in fresh blood to the fray. Limiting campaign spending, reducing term limits, passing the Fair Tax, bringing back the line item veto, putting the budget and bills on internet with ALL sponsors being identified will be a good start.  Will the real America please stand up."
15,Point and Click Democracy:  Why It Doesn't Work,politics," It seems like you can't click the mouse these days without finding a website seeking to connect citizens with their government.  But are these sites really helping citizens connect with their elected officials in a meaningful way?  Has the Internet really led us to the brink of direct democracy?  Or are the communications that are coming through these sites merely adding to the white noise that permeates Capitol Hill? Does ""Point-and-Click"" Make a Difference? As someone who spends a great deal of time teaching people how to effectively communicate with Congress, I am concerned that some of these sites leave people with the impression that being an effective citizen advocate is as easy as clicking a mouse.  Pointing and clicking on the ""yes"" or ""no"" button on vote.com's site is not equivalent to participating in a meaningful way – even if your vote is forwarded to your Congressional representative.  Frankly, your vote, if you are lucky, will simply be tallied with other opinions, and that tally (again, if you're lucky) may be 1/10th or 1/20th of a factor in your representative's decision-making process.  In most cases, your ""yes"" or ""no"" vote is simply deleted from the system. If Not, What Does? So what really influences members of Congress?  I'll give you a hint: it's not money.  In fact, it's good old-fashioned policy analysis, research, and personal beliefs.  To be an effective advocate, you must become part of that process – and you don't get there by pointing and clicking. The most important thing to remember in seeking to influence the policy making process is that you have something of value to contribute.  You probably have a particular reason why you feel the way you do about a specific policy proposal, or a reason why you're seeking a change in law.  A thoughtful approach to policy issues combined with a careful explanation of why it's important to you personally is very compelling to congressional staff and members.  In writing a personal, thoughtful, well-argued letter or e-mail, your chances of influencing your Representative's decision-making process increase dramatically. People ask me all the time whether e-mail is an effective means to communicate with Congress.  I tell them that the tools citizens use to communicate with their elected representatives are far less important than what they say.  As I talk about (some would say ad nasueum) in my book, ""Government by the People:  How to Communicate with Congress"", the key to being effective in your written communications is ensuring that someone on staff actually thinks about what you have to say.  So how do you do that?  By being personal, relevant, asking for a response, and reaching the right person. The Personal Approach:  By far, the most compelling and effective letters combine a thoughtful approach to policy issues with a careful explanation of why it's important to the author personally.  In most offices, it is these letters that the member of Congress actually sees, not the letters generated by mass postcard or form letter campaigns.  For example, one of the members I worked for routinely asked to see the five to ten most thoughtful, rational letters we received in a week.  These letters received much more attention then other less personalized correspondences. Why Are You Relevant?  You are relevant to the Congressional office because you are a constituent or because you represent a constituent, and you can demonstrate that connection by including your postal address on every correspondence, whether it's e-mail, fax, or traditional letter. Ask for a Response: Given the limited time and budgets in congressional offices, priority will always be given to letters that require an answer.  Asking for a response means someone on the staff has to think about what you've said and, in some way, address your concerns or comments. Reaching the Right Person:  Correspondence requesting a meeting or site visit should be sent to the Executive Assistant or Scheduler.  Educational and informational correspondence about your program should be sent to both the member and legislative assistant assigned to your issue.  You can find out who these people are at www.congress.org By following these guidelines, you can dramatically increase the chances that your correspondence will be noticed, whether you send it via e-mail, snail mail, or carrier pigeon! Will the Internet Make Representational Democracy Obsolete? But will all this personal, thoughtful letter writing really be necessary in ten years?  Some people argue that the Internet heralds a new day for democracy, where people will vote for their representatives and eventually vote on policy issues directly and online.  Essentially, Congressional representatives would become obsolete.  However, this ""ballot-initiative"" model of government ignores the most important role that your elected official plays in the process, paying attention to every issue under the sun 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Think about it.  Under the direct democracy model, you would be pointing and clicking to cast your vote approximately 900 times a year.  That's over twice a day, every day including weekends.  You'd be voting on Permanent Normal Trading Relations for China, the Patient's Bill of Rights, legislation to promote Digital Signatures, and whether to name the Post Office in Garden City, Kansas after Clifford R. Hope. Don't get me wrong.  I love the fact that all of these sites are emerging and that some are flowering.  The Internet is an important and powerful tool for connecting citizens to their government.  But so was the printing press, the telephone, and CSPAN.  It's what we do with these tools that matter.  Content, thoughtful analysis, and personal perspectives still matter.  So go ahead and point and click – but follow that up with a thoughtful e-mail, letter or phone call.  You'll be a better citizen and we'll all have a better Democracy."
16,Seven Ways International Organizations Can Get the U.S. Government to Listen – and Act!,politics," Mystified by the U.S. Government?: you're not alone.  International organizations often find it difficult to get the U.S. Congress or federal agencies to even listen to their priorities, much less act on them. In truth, officials in the U.S. government will listen to what you have to say, but only if you deliver your message in a way that makes sense to them.  Here are seven techniques you can use to get them to sit up and take notice! Technique Number 1:  Be Specific About the Constituency Connection U.S. elected officials and their staff represent the interests of the constituents they represent.  Period.  Every member of the U.S. House represents about 750,000 people, while every member of the U.S. Senate represents everyone in the state.  In order to make an impression, you MUST be able to demonstrate how your issues connect to their constituents ""back home."" What does this mean?  For International NGOs, it means that if you have a great policy idea or program, you should work to build support among U.S. citizens and get them to reach out to their elected officials.  This might include partnering with U.S. groups already working on related issues, or creating grassroots networks in key communities.  For businesses, it is essential to understand how policies might impact jobs, development or trade issues in U.S. congressional districts and states -- that's what U.S. elected officials want to know. Technique Number 2:  Be Specific About What You Want ""Educating"" U.S. elected officials on international issues rarely succeeds.  The best way to ensure that the office pays attention to your issue is to ask for something specific.  Sometimes, that might be funding for a specific program or support for (or opposition to) a policy idea.  In other situations, that might mean asking them to submit a statement to the Congressional Record (find it at www.congress.gov) or meet with concerned constituents in their district.  Rather then sending reams of paper and statistics on the challenges or opportunities overseas, ask them to make a decision of any sort, and you'll have much more success. Technique Number 3:  Offer To Be a Resource Elected officials and their staffs usually are not experts in the issue areas they cover and often turn to trusted outside experts for advice.  This is especially true for international issues, where the politics are complicated and the consequences of an inappropriate action can be dramatic. If you are an expert in your field, let your congressional office know that you can answer any questions they may have. Number 4:  Tell a Compelling Story Compelling stories make for powerful messages, perhaps even more so than ""shock and awe"" statistics.  While you don't want to ignore the data, be sure to pay equal attention to the anecdotal stories that make your point.  Your job is to MAKE IT REAL for the elected official or staff person.  You can achieve that goal by telling a personal story. Think about it:  there's some reason why you've decided to be an advocate on your issues.  You've seen the challenges first hand -- you've met the people affected -- you've seen the impacts of certain U.S. policies.  You bring a sense of reality and urgency to your requests by demonstrating their concrete effect on real human beings who you interact with every day. Number 5:  Understand Your Audience Committees rule in Washington, DC, especially when it comes to foreign policy decisions.  In order to be successful, you must have an understanding of how the committee structure works.  International organizations should, at a minimum, have contacts in the House and Senate Foreign Relations, Appropriations and Tax-related Committees (House Ways and Means and Senate Finance).  Check the House and Senate websites at www.house.gov and www.senate.gov to gain an understanding of these structures.  Then think about how you can gain a foothold in the districts of Committee members or, at a minimum Committee chairs and ranking members. This approach can be particularly useful when dealing with U.S. federal agencies.  Think for a minute about where federal agencies get their funding from – that's right, it comes from the U.S. Congress.  Do you think agencies are more or less likely to pay attention to the concerns of those officials that approve their budget?  If you guessed more, you'd be right.  That's why it's essential to have connections on the Appropriations subcommittees related to your programs – those officials can get the attention of related federal agencies very quickly. Number 6:  Get Others Involved in the Asking There's a reason why groups seek celebrity involvement in their issues – it works!  Leonardo DiCaprio does not, to my knowledge, have a degree in environmental engineering.  Yet he is seen frequently on Capitol Hill testifying on global warming.  U.S. elected officials are star struck just like everyone else.  For some reason they are more likely to hear a message when it comes from someone who exudes glamour. Fortunately, the ""others"" that you ask to get involved don't always have to be celebrities.  They might include business leaders, foreign dignitaries or the international media.  Gaining an understanding of the interests and passions of the elected officials you are trying to influence can help you pinpoint the right people to approach.  For example, if the chair of the Committee has introduced legislation on saving polar bears, you might want to see if you can get the planet's foremost expert on Polar Bear preservation involved in your cause – even if totally unrelated to your policy concern! That's right.  Sometimes you have to help an elected official on an issue they care about before they will help you on your issue.  So be creative in your outreach.  Over time, the response will surprise you. Number 7:  Don't Give Up! You should not expect an immediate response to your comments or concerns.  In many cases, the issue may be one about which the member has not yet formed an opinion.  Do, however, ask when you should call back to see if the member has taken a position.  Perhaps the most important thing to remember in dealing with U.S. elected officials is that persistence pays.  In many cases, you may have to ask two, three, or even a dozen times before the elected official is able to respond to your request.  So keep plugging away – and happy advocating!"
17,Kant's Deontology and Categorical Imperative,politics," For those of you who have been keeping up in my series on ethical theories, this one is very different.  It is known as Deontology and the great champion of Deontology was a Prussian named Immanuel Kant.  Kant has gone down in history as one of the greatest thinkers of all time but it was his work in ethics that was his greatest contribution. Deontological theories are theories of morality that state that one should act out of duty.  This differs from Utilitarianism in that the ends do not need to justify the means.  According to those that subscribe to Deontology the motivation behind any particular action is what determines its morality, not the consequences of the action as in Utilitarianism. This has one major advantage over Utilitarianism.  It is possible now to be confident that the act is a morally right one before it is committed.  You will recall that under Act Utilitarianism one had to wait to see the consequences of an action before the action could be judged to be right or wrong. It also just seems to make sense.  If you meant well by an action and had no reason to suspect it would cause pain why should you be blamed when it does?  The phrase “it’s the thought that counts” is supposing to a Deontological ethic.  The down side of this is that we might have to admit that some of histories worst crimes were in a sense right because the perpetrators were true believers in what they were doing, however perverse their thinking might have been.  The Holocaust comes to mind.  The writings left by Himmler seem to indicate that he truly believed it was his duty to eliminate the Jews. Kant recognized this problem and made an attempt to solve it by what came to be known as the Categorical Imperative.  Though Kant proposed several different forms for the Categorical Imperative it is his first one that seems to sum it up best to me.  “Act only According to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.”  What does that mean?  To understand the Categorical Imperative you must understand the word “maxim.” Webster’s 1828 gives us this definition, “Maxim, n. An established principle or proposition; a principle generally received or admitted as true.” So maxim is simply another word for principle.  With that in mind reread the Categorical Imperative one more time and it should make more sense.  Based on the Categorical Imperative when judging the morality of an action one has to decide what principle the action is based on.  Then you must decide if that maxim could be applied on a universal scale.  If it could then the action is deemed to be good, if it cannot the action is deemed to be morally bad.  I’ll give you an example to better illustrate this point.  Suppose you want to lie to someone to keep from offending him or her.  Your motives are good, so you pass the first test in Deontology.  Now you apply the Categorical Imperative, could the lying (the maxim) be applied universally?  If all people were habitual liars then would lying work?  No, of course not, because lies depend on deception.  People would not be deceived if they were expecting to be lied to.  So according to Kant and his Categorical Imperative lying is morally wrong. Some of you may have picked up on the shortcoming of the Categorical Imperative in the above illustration.  The person who is likely to be committing the action in question picks the maxim.  If you get very specific with the maxim then you can almost always arrive at a positive answer.  If you change the maxim from “all people should lie all the time” to “all people in my exact circumstance should lie” the entire equation is changed.  It is for this reason that the Categorical Imperative is meant to be applied as broadly as possible, but the ultimate judgement on how broad to go is still left to the individual."
18,Al Gore's Defeat or His Finest Hour?,politics," In December of 2000, Al Gore conceded the election for President of the United States to George W. Bush. I won't go into all that led up to that event or all that followed.  That's not what I want to talk about.  However, as bad as the results must have seemed to Al Gore at the time, if ever one man's loss might have become a world's gain, that might have been the moment. Al Gore, of course, went on from that defeat to produce (and star in, I guess you could say) a telling, and Oscar winning, movie documentary about the perils of global warming, or climate change, depending on what camp you're in.  It was a subject that he has fervently followed, studied, and whose importance he has believed in for years. I guess with all that time on his hands, he needed something to do. It's interesting to note that until he ""lost"" that election, Al Gore was on a track to success but was it his chosen track?  After all, he followed his father into the family business of politics, eventually becoming Bill Clinton's Vice President, and from there it seemed natural that he would occupy the Oval Office.  I wonder, had he really chosen these pathways, or simply followed the signs that had been blazed for him by his father and events of circumstance, history, and birth?  Would he, like many of us, have chosen another path if given the opportunity to go back to earlier interests and enthusiasms? Yes, it seemed that the life of Al Gore was pretty neatly laid out. That was B.C. - Before Chad. After the debacle in Florida (my home state, sadly), he was then forced to endure what must have been one of the greatest disappointments imaginable. What was of interest to me was his refusal to carry the fight further lest it divide the nation more.  This willingness to step aside for what seemed the good of the rest of us, despite a possibly good claim to the presidency gave me my first insight into the reality of the man. Perhaps this was the opportunity for the emergence of the real Al Gore. In college, a professor, I believe, had introduced him to information about events that could be damaging the environment, perhaps permanently.  His interest in this, while it never wavered, had to take a back seat to the requirements of the career pathway he was on...politics.  However, he did attempt to use his position to focus attention on the problem and to combat what he considered environmentally destructive actions and legislation. So, after the events of November and December of 2000, he must have looked around for something to occupy his time, efforts, and talents.  I don't think he started out to be a movie star, he simply decided that the planet was still in danger and his next project would be to save it. I think that's great! However, I feel good about something else as well. Remember the Al Gore who was kidded, mocked, teased, and mimicked by comedians, reporters, and the public?  He was accused of being wooden...of being stiff...of being impersonal, cold, and standoffish. If you had seen him in the movie (definitely NOT leading man material there) or at the Academy Awards, where his little movie, ""An Inconvenient Truth"" won an Oscar, and a song from the movie also won an Oscar, you would have seen an animated, engaged, interesting man who seemed full of life and vitality and passionate about his subject.  Well, as passionate as Al Gore gets....but still! Not bad for an out-of-work ex-""next President of the United States"" as he introduced himself in the movie. I am happy to see this sort of transformation in anyone.  I am glad for the planet that Al Gore had the opportunity to turn from the path of politics .  While he is not a Messiah, I think the world will be a better place and Al Gore a better, or at least happier man for having found a new path to walk...one chosen by himself. Many experts in psychology, motivation, and self improvement have proposed that the way to be truly happy is to find something you love doing and make that your life's work.  Seems that something like that may have happened here. I don't know what kind of president Al Gore would make, or would have made, but I think that he could possibly accomplish more good for mankind and create more happiness for himself by doing that little hobby he's picked up...saving the world just because he wants to and believes it's the right thing to do."
19,The US Tax Code: An Open Letter to Madam Chairperson Pelosi,politics," The Honorable Nancy Pelosi United States House of Representatives 235 Cannon House Office Building Washington, D.C. 20515-4322 February 24, 2007 Dear Congresswoman Pelosi, As you work to develop our next National Budget, I would like to present a suggestion for a novel way of looking at tax reform.  I am writing to you, as well as other members of Congress, because to date I have not heard mention of any other idea that would be as useful, practical, and informative for United States taxpayers. In the past, efforts to reform the tax system have failed to recognize or deal with the System's two primary functions.  The first function, of course, is raising revenue.  That part is straightforward-you have to pay the bills.  That is the function people usually thing of when they hear the word ‘taxes'.  But the second part is bigger.  The second function is the ‘fairness function'.  This is the mechanism where the tax system takes the money from those who earned it, and give it to those who did not earn it.  The tax code currently accomplishes this redistribution of income in many ways, including progressiveness, phase-outs, and the granting of the child tax credits to non-taxed ‘taxpayers'.  I don't know if you will get this, but isn't the ‘Earned Income Tax Credit' a funny oxymoron?  Anyway, efforts by Steven Forbes et al. in the past have fallen ‘flat' in part because of their failure to adequately address this second function. I realize that you will initially be against my idea, as the tax system as it stands stymies conservative Republicans in at least two ways.  First, attempts to reduce the size of government cannot win public support if the majority of the voting public pay nothing when government is expanded.  There is no public stake in such a reduction beyond Keynesian economic principles, which will never be appreciated by the majority of the voting public (or by Democrats, for that matter).  Second, under the current system the issue of tax cuts is effectively destroyed by the sound-bite of ‘tax cuts for the rich.' This claim ironically becomes more believable as the progressiveness of the system increases, because as you know, any tax cut can be criticized as ‘for the rich' if only the rich pay the taxes!  Brilliantly, progressiveness then increases with each round of tax cuts.  And so yes, the ultimate effect of the current system is great for NPR et al., and you would take some flack from them if things changes.  And yes, you would be tossing a bone to all those idiots who believe in the principle of public stake in government.  But hear me out.  I think that many of the complainers will be satisfied in the end. The basic essence of my idea is to replace the current tax system with two systems, each designated to address one function of the tax code.  The first system would be radical, but quite straightforward: every adult (and child?) would pay an equal amount to support the spending of the federal government.  I can imagine you rolling your eyes, and this will shock you even more:  I am not suggesting a flat tax based on income, but rather a flat amount per person.  Yes, I know, why should people who don't work have to chip in?  But believe it or not there are people out there who have this ‘pay your own way' philosophy, and it might actually end up being a popular idea.  If nothing else, it would make sense to anyone who has ever tried to explain the present progressive system to their 12-year-old daughter using the analogy of a group of friends going out for pizza. This system would allow every taxpayer to have a stake in the functions of government.  Each individual would easily be able to determine what a particular program would DIRECTLY cost them. People would know, for example, that in the year 2006 the government cost approximately $10,000 per person over 16 years old.  Breakdowns could be provided for each major area of spending.  For example, people would know that the Department of Defense cost approximately $1400 per person, or that interest on the public debt cost about $1800 per person.  This would benefit the left as well as the right, because the cost of military operations, for example, would be evident in each taxpayer's annual assessment. On first blush the benefits for conservatives would be greater, because for the first time there would be a real connection between government spending and taxes, which would result in far more public scrutiny of government spending.  But on the other hand, there are people who ‘get off' on giving their money to you guys-just over half of the population, judging by the last election.  They seem more interested in giving the money than they do in seeing where it goes.  A letter from the government demanding money would presumably give them a bit of a thrill. The second half of the new system would provide income redistribution to address what you and your friends perceive as ‘social inequalities'.  A proper median income could be determined, and income of any type over that level would be ‘mitigated' on a percentage basis, and provided in a similar manner to those below the median.  Of course we would have to make some people exempt-the Hollywood folks work darn hard, and so they shouldn't count.  And people like Kennedy and Soros who have spent so much time proving that you can hide money overseas-especially Kennedy, because it wasn't his fault that he was born rich. But the great thing about this system is that the business of income redistribution would be out in the open.  ‘The rich' (you can decide who that should be-cool!) would feel appropriately generous or resentful, and the poor could choose to feel grateful for the distribution, or resentful that it is not larger.  In any case, the social engineering hidden in the present tax code would be out in the open, for all to see.  The public could vote at regular intervals as to the slope of the redistribution curve (or you could just set it if you would rather do it yourself). You could use the median income as the dividing line for who gives and who gets-that would even the score in the debate over ‘tax cuts for the rich', and then just before election you could move the line a tiny bit up or down to get just the result that is needed to get the right people to Washington. I worry a little bit that if income redistribution is presented in such an open manner, it would be rejected as unfair even by some of the same people who argue for tax rebates for non-taxpayers.  But a touch of ‘shame, shame' will likely keep that under control.  This second system could be known as the IRS, or Income Redistribution System.  Over time, perhaps another acronym would be more appropriate, such as the Funding for Under Compensated Money Earners, or FUCME. While the concept of two Internal Revenue Services does little to excite the average person, the separation of the business of funding the Federal Government from the business of income redistribution would dramatically change the way people view government programs.  The result would be a system that any 12-year-old daughter would understand.  We wouldn't even need those stupid laws that make education accountable. Anyway, just a thought-- Sincerely, One of the Good Guys."
20,"""Performers Should Shut Up!""",politics," The Dixie Chicks, featured on the Grammy's 2007, are still getting the cold shoulder from conservative Southern Radio for mouthing a political opinion. Actually it was a personal attack on President Bush. They still haven't learned. Martin Sheen (remember his duct taped mouth?) has been relegated into the shadows. He appears in the new movie - The Departed - but you only see him for 2 seconds in the commercials for the flick and he is not mentioned in a starring role. Director Martin Scorsese has hidden Sheen in the shadows. Does he hope that conservatives will be tricked into spending their money on the movie, or buy or rent the DVD? I could go on about the financial backlash each of these people is feeling and how they should not be penalized for exercising free speech but that is not the issue here. Actor Richard Widmark said it best. When asked about politics he said - ""Performers should perform and then shut up"". I believe that he understood his obligation to not use his position and popularity as a pulpit to express his political views. I believe that he understood that he could easily sway the opinions of gullible star-struck fans towards a political position that he favored or decried. Richard Widmark performed and then kept his mouth shut about politics. As a former working journalist, paid by my station and network, I delivered the news and ""shut up"" about my personal political views. No one knew whether I was Republican, Democrat, Independent. I voted in nearly every election and I had friends in the political parties because I reported the news and ""shut up"". All politicians got equal time on every issue. My job was to give them a pulpit because each was recognized as a political expert. Those of you of my generation will remember Walter Cronkite. He was called - ""The Most Trusted Man in America"". Why? He earned that designation because no one knew his politics. He never tilted a story, hiding his political opinion, as is the practice among many TV anchors today. He stepped out of his neutral role only once. He went to Viet Nam and saw the carnage for himself and spoke out against the war. It was done in a way that was thoughtful and fact-based. It was not a shoot-from-the-lip opinion. Actors and musicians are hardly recognized as having the credibility of a Walter Cronkite. They perform and entertain for a living. Yes, they have a political opinion. Most of us do. But, expert opinion? I think not. Just because Mainstream Media gives them a bully pulpit does not validate their opinion in the slightest. In fact, it should make you question the motives of Media. Why would they put these people on-air and in print? Why not give my plumber or garbage man the same visibility? Their opinion is just as valid isn't it? Where do I personally stand on this? I will make this admission - I do not pay to view, own, rent, or listen to any performer who publicly states a political opinion, regardless of that opinion. I really don't care about their opinion. I only care about their misuse of their position and my wife and I have decided we will not support them with our money. If their name is mentioned in the credits of a film or on a CD cover - sorry. Now, I am not proposing a blacklist. Far from it. I don't like blacklisting in any form. I don't like boycotts or protest marches either. I believe in changing things through the political system through the power of the ballot box and the power of money. If you agree with the performers, you have every right to spend your money to support them. If you do not agree with them, you have every right to reject them. For me - performers should perform and then shut up. Jim DeSantis"

1,Obedience to Authority,politics," Obedience is an essential part of everyday life of members of modern society. This word has become a synonym of good work and quality performance in the work place. People who are obedient are more likely to be accepted by the society and comforted by it, because disobedience usually means severe consequences especially when an order or a request comes from someone in direct authority to the object. In today’s world people are becoming more and more distanced from their own understanding of things happening around them and thus are easily involved in matters that might be highly unpleasant for them. This happens because the major responsibility is taken by someone, a usually unseen and remote person who is in charge. The comprehension of the whole matter does not occur to the obedient object and thus for both parties, those who order and those who perform, it is much easier now to do things that would not be done if complete responsibility was taken by a single person. Stanley Milgram’s experiment is well known as an experiment of human willingness to obey the orders of authority, even if there is no real authority and no necessity to follow the orders. The whole experiment was based on the ‘teachers’ and ‘learners’ functions, one of them being asked questions and the other answered. The ‘learner’ was an actor who pretended to experience pain from shocks that were given to him by the ‘teacher’ in case of a wrong or no answer. The experiment has revealed numerous interesting observations which were not evident about human nature prior to its start. It became clear that people no matter what profession they held, or if they were employed at all were eager to please an authority figure, who in this situation was the experimenter, professor in a white coat. The evidence of a serious experiment proved by the appropriate environment, as in a real scientific laboratory, made ‘teachers’ behave in a determined way and imposed a meaning of high significance of what they were doing. Moreover the presence of the professor made them ‘punish’ a wrong answer severer than when he was talking to them over the phone. It shows that people are more likely to follow orders when the authority figure is in their obvious proximity. Another side of the experiment carried a social meaning to the ‘teachers’ and even when the person in the electric chair started screaming as if from pain, 65% of them continued increasing the voltage as they were told so by the professor. They were eager to please the authority and also did not want to look impolite or unreliable. This feeling of higher power over them ordering what to do and realization of the importance of the experiment strengthened by white walls of the lab unified into desire to continue obeying. A few people in the course of the experiment requested to stop it and refused to continue when the screaming from the nest room began. Those people explained their behavior by not willing to be responsible for the lives or health of those under shock. It is clear that those people understood and took consequences of this experiment as their own personal responsibility and were not ready to take it. From that one can make a conclusion that when people feel the weight of the consequences in the future for what they do now, they are not likely to follow orders that can lead to bed results, personally for them. They are thinking from the perspective of their individual life not from the perspective of doing harm and causing pain for others, although that also could be one of the factors. An interesting notion of people’s self imagine is also an important factor that has to be taken into consideration when investigation obedience to authority. When a person is used to see a certain image of himself/herself it is difficult to make them believe different. Thus when something is ordered that contradicts with their usual self image, people tend to disregard the experience or interpret it in a way that would suit their life. In the Milgram’s experiment ‘teachers’ viewed themselves and what they were doing as an important discovery in the scientific world rather than a pain causing trial. It follows that humans are most likely to obey when they believe in the good and important side of the matter and when they are assured in their goodness. Basically the combination of the authoritative command, respect for the authority, willingness to be a good member of the team, and a feeling of self importance typically contributes to obedience."
2,15 Leadership Quotes for Presidents Day,politics," President's Day is celebrated on the third Monday in February, and this year it falls on February 19, 2006.  To celebrate President's Day, I've collected some of my favorite leadership quotes from US Presidents. The leaders of this country have had some extraordinary obstacles to overcome and they've had to rise to meet many challenges.  They have left little bits of wisdom along the way I hope you'll find interesting. So here are some of my favorite leadership quotes from US Presidents: ""Patience and perseverance have a magical affect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish."" - John Quincy Adams ""Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort."" - Franklin D. Roosevelt ""I not only use all the brains that I have, but all that I can borrow."" - Woodrow Wilson ""Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom."" - Thomas Jefferson ""As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them."" - John F. Kennedy ""No man is above the law and no man is below it; nor do we ask any man's permission when we require him to obey it.  Obedience to the law is demanded as a right; not asked as a favor."" - Theodore Roosevelt ""Our defense is in the preservation of the spirit which prizes liberty as a heritage of all men, in all lands, everywhere. Destroy this spirit and you have planted the seeds of despotism around your own doors."" - Abraham Lincoln ""I hope I shall possess firmness and virtue enough to maintain what I consider the most enviable of all titles, the character of an honest man."" - George Washington ""The truth is that all men having power ought to be mistrusted."" - James Madison "" ‘Tis better to be silent and be thought a fool, than to speak and remove all doubt."" - Abraham Lincoln ""Do you want to know who you are? Don't ask. Act! Action will delineate and define you."" - Thomas Jefferson ""My observation is that whenever one person is found adequate to the discharge of a duty... it is worse executed by two persons, and scarcely done at all if three or more are employed therein."" - George Washington ""There are two educations. One should teach us how to make a living and the other how to live."" - John Adams ""Change is the law of life. And those who look only to the past or present are certain to miss the future."" - John F. Kennedy ""You are not here merely to make a living. You are here in order to enable the world to live more amply, with greater vision, with a finer spirit of hope and achievement. You are here to enrich the world, and you impoverish yourself if you forget the errand."" - Woodrow Wilson Happy President's Day!"
3,FDA Public View Deteriorating,politics," As of late, the FDA’s public perception has deteriorated to the point that the majority of adults have a negative view of the job that the FDA is doing.  A recent Harris interactive poll stated “that most adults say they are concerned about the FDA’s ability to make independent decisions that will ensure that patients have access to safe and effective medicines (80%), and their ability to effectively communicate safety concerns about prescription drugs to doctors and the public (76%).” The survey consisted of 2,371 participants from May 12th to the 16th.  The poll results found: •	Ensuring that truly innovative prescription drugs come to market more quickly (70%), with 21 percent of adults saying it is the most important function for the FDA to focus on. In 2004, the numbers were reversed: then, 56% felt the FDA did a good or excellent job, while 37% felt the agency did a fair or poor job in this regard. •	Decisions concerning which brand name prescription drugs can be marketed as generics (63%), with seven percent of adults saying it is the most important function for the FDA to focus on. •	Decisions about which drugs can be marketed over-the-counter without a prescription (62%), with five percent of adults saying it is the most important function for the FDA to focus on. •	Ensuring the safety as well as the efficacy of new prescription drugs (58%), with 58 percent of adults saying it is the most important function for the FDA to focus on. The recent downturn in popularity could be attributed to the FDA’s failure to allow Vioxx onto the market.  With other bad PR events such as Taco Bell already slipping through the cracks at the FDA, I wouldn’t be surprised if their popularity drops even further next year."
4,Who Is The FDA Trying To Protect?,politics," I'll be the first to say the folks at the FDA have a hard job. It is their responsibility to protect the public safety and certainly not subject those of us who are ill to drugs that offer false hope or tremendous risk. And when it comes to considering new drugs for approval, I know how much they want to get it right the first time. The last thing they need is to have to pull a drug off the market after people have been hurt causing damage to the FDA's credibility to Congress. I get all that, and what follows is not written disrespectfully. But my glimpse the other day in Washington, D.C. into the process of considering new cancer drugs left me feeling the FDA was operating too conservatively when it comes to potentially lifesaving or life-extending drugs. It was also clear to me their advisors (or at least a majority of them) were not as knowledgeable as we patients would expect. They seemed unfamiliar with the new science being considered as well as the needs of the community that would benefit. That was the case when the new drug application on Genasense for CLL seemed doomed by the Oncologic Drug Advisory Committee and the cancer leadership of the FDA. My immediate reaction was that an injustice had been done. And the faces of several of the nation's leukemia super specialists confirmed that, as the hearing ended. So what to do? Was this just a loss for people like me with CLL, or is there a bigger concern that could make it hard for anything but breakthrough cancer drugs to be approved? Are congressional concerns on drug safety putting so much pressure on the FDA that the bar is being set too high? Am I all wet? I called the VP of legislative affairs with the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) to find out. The answer was no, not at all. According to George Dahlman, while they don't endorse any particular drug application, they generally feel the FDA drug advisory committees and the FDA itself do not have enough expertise when it comes to reviewing proposed cancer treatments that could offer incremental treatment benefit. And they worry drug companies will not push ahead with new drugs with the government taking such a conservative, and maybe uninformed, approach. Drug development experts I've talked to (scientists who care about saving lives) are now increasingly discouraged. I am, as a patient and a patient advocate, discouraged too. I've asked the LLS to tell me and to tell us as patients how our voices can help. Are there congressional representatives and senators we should talk to? Would the leadership of the FDA listen to us? Because of my business endeavors, there are a few things you should know. HealthTalk has, in the past, produced programs on CLL treatment that were sponsored by unrestricted grants from Genta, the developer of Genasense. While there are no current or planned programs, you should know that the possibility of future programs exists. In addition, I now run a company called Patient Power that received an unrestricted grant from Genta to facilitate the travel of three people (myself, a CLL patient's family member, and another CLL patient) to the public hearing last week. Both at HealthTalk and at Patient Power, Genta has neither prompted nor had any control or influence over what we say or write. Speaking personally, as a CLL patient, I have nothing to gain with Genasense being approved. Right now, I need no medicine. Certainly, there are other patients who do need it. But putting that aside for a minute, what about the next cancer drug hearing? Will the panel clearly understand the issues and have expertise in the relevant cancer area, and will the FDA cancer drug leadership understand? If they don't, will the treatment you need someday (or perhaps a senator or congressional rep may need) not be available because of the cold water being thrown on drug development now? I am worried. One other thing: I very much appreciated having the opportunity to testify at the recent FDA committee hearing. They listened respectfully, and it was a very open hearing. But there was a part of the process that seemed improperly behind closed doors. As the hearing ended, I questioned an FDA official about who they drew on for CLL expertise. She said they had phone conversations with CLL consultants but that they were under confidentiality agreements and prohibited from revealing who they were or how the FDA was advised. She said I'd need approval from the drug applicant company to get more information. I checked with the company, and they said I have their permission. So now I'll go back to the FDA to learn more about the process and share it with you. I am just trying to learn if the process is broken and our hope for new medicines is at-risk. Stay tuned and let me know what you think."
5,Troop Surge in Iraq will deepen Quagmire,politics," It looks like President Bush is going to announce a ""temporary increase"" in the number of American troops serving in Iraq. The President is adding complexity to a series of wrong decisions he has made since the beginning of the invasion. It is difficult to imagine how a surge in American troops can fix a self-created problem? We have made the same mistake that five star General Douglas MacArthur warned about with regard to Asia, ""Never get involved in a land war in Asia."" Presidents Kennedy and Johnson didn't heed the advice, and the rest is history. Now once again, we have a President who has involved us voluntarily (the US was never attacked directly or indirectly by the evil Saddam Hussein) in a land war in an Arab country where suicide bombers are as common as a cup of coffee. The basis of General MacArthur's advice was that life is cheap in Asia. Our country will tire, and the public will to continue the effort will wane before the opposition will tire of losing lives. The same advice applies to the Middle East as it did to Asia. Saddam Hussein's Iraq, and the Mullah's Iran lost several hundred thousand men in the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980's, and neither felt the loss. The United States openly backed Saddam Hussein during the war, and prevented an Iranian victory by stepping in with arms and intelligence information. Our President on the other hand continues to get very bad advice from the same people that initiated this effort. Let's look at history to understand what's going on. Saddam Hussein was a tyrant just like all the other tyrants in that section of the world. Goggle ""Hama Massacre"", and you will see how the Syrian leadership killed tens of thousands of their own people in 1982. When the Mullahs took over Iran and deposed the Shah, perhaps several hundred thousand people died as a result. The history of the entire region is one of violence, instability, anarchy, and uncertainty. In that simple sentence you will understand why our President's desire to install a democracy in Iraq cannot work. Every country in the Middle East has an unstable regime ruling a society whose members have low tolerance for one another, and are inherently volatile. Even if our President were successful in forcing our democratic principles on the people of Iraq, the whole system would of necessity fall apart in a matter of months to a year or two, as a new equilibrium would be formed among the warring factions. This is not George Bush's fault. He has simply allowed himself to be misguided as to the reality of the day to day situation in Iraq. His advisors have failed him miserably, and he has failed America in not changing his advisers quickly enough to understand what he is dealing with. The primary goal of all American Presidents and not the Congress is to determine for our country what our interests should be. The President then must create policy to advance our interests. It is not a coincidence that the first invasion of Iraq in 1990 took place shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union. Our Middle East policy up until that point was to prevent Soviet penetration, and domination of the OIL RICH Middle East. With the fall of the Soviet Union, our policy became to PREVENT any one country in the region from creating hegemony over the region (the reason being OIL). This was Saddam's SIN. He attempted to control the oil wealth of the region by invading Kuwait, and therefore neutralizing Saudi Arabia. This had to be prevented at all costs. In 1990, the cost was a US led coalition to remove Saddam as a threat to the oil stability of the region, and that is why the first President Bush never marched to Baghdad. Saddam's removal from Kuwait was enough to insure that hegemony would not be created. Somehow the current President Bush got it into his mind Saddam still represented a threat to the stability of the region, and therefore invaded again. In doing so, he has opened Pandora's Box. Once that box was opened, no one can predict with any accuracy how this is going to play out. We have certainly done a number of things, none of which play to our favor: We have strengthened and emboldened Iran. We are no longer in a position to threaten Iran with invasion for continuing its nuclear program. We do not have the force structure to back up our threats. We have strengthened Syria in the same way as Iran. We have aggravated the Arab-Israeli situation by weakening our own image as an honest third party to the conflict. We have destabilized Iraq as a country, and as a functioning state, with no endgame in mind. We have placed our prestige on the line, and are at the lowest level of respect in our allies' eyes since World War II. Our position as the moral guiding force of this planet is in jeopardy. We have started a war that we do not know how to finish. What the President must do RIGHT NOW is recognize where we are at. This is why he lost the Congress in the last election. Americans are never sitting stay, or watch idly. We are an active nation. If the President isn't moving fast enough, the people will elect others who will? Our current troops should be used only to train Iraqi forces, both police and military, and not act as combatants in a country whose government we already defeated. If the President finds it mandatory to deploy additional troops, again these additional forces should only be used to train Iraqi forces, not to intervene. This is no CIVIL WAR, with Moslem pitted against Moslem, and sect against sect. This is not about Catholic versus Protestant, or Jew versus Arab. This is all taking place within the context of the same religion. It is even taking place within the same sects. Sunni is also killing Sunni, and Shia is killing Shia. We could never hope to be able to intervene against such wanton killing. We are after all a democracy, the beacon of light in world where there is much darkness. Our continued efforts in Iraq may weaken this country so much more that it could result in potentially nuclear Iran creating the regional hegemony that we tried to prevent Iraq from creating. Wouldn't that be a sad state of affairs? We replace one monster with another. Goodbye and Good Luck"
6,Six Years later – A Failed Presidency,politics," President Bush came into office with great promise, and the reality has been one failure after another, and this is coming from a writer who was a conservative Republican before the President knew what the term meant. Let's use former President Ronald Reagan's requirements for a successful Presidency. Do you remember the last debate between then President Jimmy Carter and candidate Reagan? The former Republican Governor of California asked the American people in closing if they thought they were better off today in 1980, than they were when President Carter took office four years earlier in January of 1977. The following Tuesday, the American people threw the failed President from Georgia out of office in a landslide. Here we are now six years into another Presidency, and the only thing that I believe has been successful about this Presidency is the fact that the Dow Jones Industrial Average is somewhat above the same level it was in 2000 when this President was elected. Let's look at a few of the big issues this President has faced and to which he has reacted poorly in resolving. The tragedy of 9/11 – Six years later, Osama Bin Laden the direct murderer of almost 3000 Americans remains FREE, and unencumbered by the United States military. Do we still have military units assigned to hunting him down? There is not a word in the press about it if we do. Making America SAFER in response to terrorism – Do you really believe we are safer? I for one believe that no American passenger airplane will ever be taken hostage again by terrorists. I believe this only because of the American passengers on board who will react immediately to a hostage situation, not because of the marshal program but because Americans still remember how to defend themselves, and they will. As for planes crashing into buildings, do you really think all those FED EX, UPS, and US Postal Service planes are secure? Do you think private corporate aircraft are secure? What about the tens of thousands of private airplanes in America? Recently a private airplane in NY flew up the East River, made a U-Turn and crashed into an apartment building on the East Side of Manhattan. Nobody realized what was going on until the crash occurred. As a result the government has not banned flights up the East River. It's kind of late, don't you think? The Docks are not safe – How difficult would it be for a terrorist group to sneak a low yield nuclear weapon into this country aboard one of the tens of thousands of merchant transport ships that bring cargo into this country each year? Only a small percentage of the cargo is inspected. Subway and Bus System still completely exposed – The terrorist acts in Madrid and London in the last several years exposed flaws in our own public transportation systems that have not been addressed.  Do you really think that terrorists carrying backpacks with explosives in them would have any problem getting on a NYC bus or subway car, and committing their insane acts? Hurricane Katrina – This terrible tragedy exposed government ineptness, and lack of responsiveness. There were bodies of American citizens floating down the Mississippi River in the streets of New Orleans, and this is the 21st century. FEMA which is the Federal Emergency Management Association proved to be completely incapable of handling, or even helping in this crisis. Do you really believe that these inadequacies have been addressed? If chemical or biological warfare were used against the United States by terrorists, do you think that we would have anything approaching an adequate response to such an attack? I don't believe it. Initial Iraq decision making process – You have got to be kidding us, Mr. President. We know in retrospect that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and Saddam Hussein posed no direct threat to America. In other words, he was not going to attack us. The basis for the war was in error, and I personally supported it. We have wasted 3000 American lives during the invasion, and 3000 subsequent to the invasion in ERROR, plus 30,000 men who have been injured including terrible losses of their limbs. Post Invasion decision making - Wow, could it really have been worse? Could the people reporting to the President have done a poorer job in post war Iraq, if they had wanted to? We had the unnecessary disbanding of the Iraqi army, to the throwing out of the Sunni civil servants that knew how to run the day to day government operations. We then installed the Shia civil servants who had not run the government in several hundred years. The whole thing was a series of colossal, could have been ANTICIPATED mistakes. Our window of opportunity to do the right thing has now passed. The American electorate has lost its patience with this President, and this war. Our options are running out, and there is no good ending in site for us. Largest deficits in American history – You have got to be kidding when this man calls himself a conservative President. There is nothing conservative whatsoever about his spending policies. He has systematically outspent every one of his predecessors in history to the tune of trillions of dollars. He has not vetoed one Congressional spending act – first time in history. His prescription drug bill for seniors is costing almost $50 billion dollars per year more than it should because he included overpayments to drug companies, and created unnecessary giveaways to insurance companies to act as intermediaries in the program. Who would have believed that a Republican President would do such a thing? Tax policies that don't make sense – I believe in the lowest rate of taxation possible. I do not believe that you cut taxes for the rich in a time of deficit, borrow the money from Japan, China, and Europe to fund the deficits, and then send tax refund checks to the richest 2 percent of the population with the borrowed funds. Furthermore, I do not believe that the very rich in our society believe you should do this either. Yet, that's what the President has done, an act of fiscal irresponsibility at best, and insanity at worst. You figure it out for yourself. Look at the above and it equals a failed Presidency. All of this from a man who has never once consulted his father as to what he should do about Iraq. Both men have stated that they have not talked about it. This is a President that still can't talk about issues, or give even a minor speech without READING the entire prewritten document. He is that uncomfortable in his own skin. How will we survive another two years of this kind of leadership?"
7,President Bush and the GREAT MYTHS of Iraq,politics," What a world we live in. Let's look at Iraq. We know the President said ostensibly that the reason for invading was to find weapons of mass destruction, and prevent Saddam Hussein from using them. His removal from office could create a new democratic Iraq. America invaded and found no weapons of mass destruction – not even a hint of them. Now the media is basically reporting that we are involved in a Civil War in Iraq, and we are losing it. Somewhere in between the two ends of the story is the truth and you need to know it, so that you don't have to be inundated with bias from all sides of the media, both liberal and conservative. Let's go through the great myths of Iraq. Myth 1 – Invading Iraq has helped us with the War on Terrorism Nonsense, there is no war on terrorism in Iraq. Osama Bin Laden attacked the two World Trade Center buildings in NYC more than five years ago. Hello, has anybody heard recently whether anybody is looking for Bin Laden anymore. If so who, what resources are being devoted to taking down this awful, hateful man? I suggest very little is being done. Everyone's attention is on Iraq. Saddam Hussein was not an exporter of terror. He used terror as an internal weapon inside Iraq to control the very people that we obviously can't control. These people do not want a democracy, if they did, they would fight for it. Instead, they fight each other, even in the same neighborhoods. It's a Civil War folks, pure and simple. Myth 2 – The military's post war planning was okay, not great, but okay? Really, Donald Rumsfeld's Defense Department could not have done a worse job if they had set out to do one as an objective. There was literally ZERO post war planning, compared to the actual invasion that took place. The looting of the civil infrastructure after our invasion, including the pilfering of museums was a tip-off as to how undermanned, and under planned we really were. Myth 3 – If only we ""Stayed the Course"" as the President is fond of saying, it will work out in the end. There's a line that goes, ""If you always do, what you always did, you'll always get, what you always got."" In life, if something isn't working, YOU CHANGE IT. You do something else. You do not just keep doing what you were doing. This President is stubborn without being wise. Perhaps more than anyone else in the history of the modern Presidency, he shows a reluctance to learn from his mistakes, and total lack of desire to inquire as to alternative options. He's LOCKED into a thinking that just doesn't work. He has never allowed the decision making process to be VETTED by opposing thinkers. In this behavior, he is unique, and foolish. Myth 4 – Iraq will become Democratic in time. Sure, and I believe in the tooth fairy. This is not the American Revolution, a unique era with a unique group of the best read, self-educated men in history. Unrivaled in courage, our founders had the desire to stand against England, and form a Republic for which it stands. President Bush is right, when he says; I haven't seen Thomas Jefferson in Iraq yet. Jefferson doesn't exist in Iraq, and perhaps never will. Myth 5 – Our situation in Iraq has made our position stronger in the world? Really, do you really want to argue this one?  Iraq had the 4th or 5th largest standing army in the world. We demonstrated that we could take it apart, and destroy it in 29 days. This was a valuable lesson for the world to learn. In the aftermath, we demonstrated that we could not govern. We could not influence events. Our influence frankly just broke down, and we did it in the face of the world, while everybody was watching. Our enemies and our friends recognize that we do not have the capacity to back up our rhetoric with military action anywhere else in the world, while we are bogged down in Iraq. Placing 140,000 troops currently in Iraq has made us incapable of operating anywhere else. If North Korea were to create a provocative act TODAY, what would we do? If Iran were to send troops into the Iraqi desert, or better yet to Saudi Arabia, or Kuwait, what would we do? We no longer have a draft. The military is having major problems fulfilling their current manpower requirements. Has anybody noticed the disproportionate number of officers at the lieutenant level and above that are dying in Iraq. Last week, 3 lieutenant colonels were killed in action. This is unheard of in previous wars. It is because they are dying from roadside bombs that can strike anyone within a specified distance. Myth 6 – Those roadside bombs are made locally in terrorist hideouts in Iraq. Those bombs are being manufactured in Iran, and transported across the border with Syria's help, and we are doing NOTHING ABOUT IT. These are not simple devices. They are technologically sophisticated. They required advanced machinery, and skill to produce. This expertise is not available in Iraq. These are shaped charges, and they are adjusting to the changes that the United States is making on the battlefield. Only Iran can produce such technology in that area. The United States has never held Iran accountable for its actions, or even mentioned it on the world stage. What is going on here? Myth 7 – The military was in agreement with Rumsfeld's policies or they would have protested?    Do you think so, do you really honestly think so? Very few generals have what it takes to blow away a career by protesting about decisions being made by superiors. What we are seeing is what many of us thought we'd never see again – the Viet Nam syndrome coming back to haunt us. During Viet Nam hundreds of officers knew our conduct of the war wasn't working. They kept their mouths shut, and said that some day when they had the power they would never allow this to happen again. Here we are 30 years later, and you guessed it. The young officers who made those statements are now leading the armed forces of the United States, and they are just as quiet as their superiors were during the Viet Nam war. Every one of these officers knows that we went into Iraq on the cheap, in terms of our manpower. Oh yes, we had enough to destroy the Iraqi army, but certainly not enough to secure the peace. Colin Powell who knows a thing or two about waging war felt 300,000 plus troops were needed. Powell was smart enough to get out of government before it hit the fan. So what do we do now? We declare victory in the field, and also declare an inability to build a democracy for a people where democracy is everybody's second choice. We then must concentrate on terminating Bin Laden, and being a responsible superpower."
8,FDA Advisors Found to Have Financial Ties to Product Under Review,politics," In a recent report by Bloomberg, it was found that six doctors set to be on an FDA advisory panel, had financial ties to companies that produce stent heart devices which are currently up for FDA review.  Drug coated stents that are used to prop open arteries, have been associated with an increased risk of blood clots that can cause both heart attacks and strokes. The recent decision allows these doctors to serve on the advisory panel that could ultimately lead to the approval of rules and guidelines that would directly affect the drug coated stents, has lead to a backlash of public scrutiny. According to Healthday, “ To clear the way for the six doctors to take part in the review, the FDA has waived rules that prohibit experts from involvement in matters that affect companies with which the experts have consulting contracts or in which they own stock. The fact that the six doctors hold shares in, or receive fees from, companies that make stents is outweighed by their expertise on heart disease, Randall Lutter, the agency's associate commissioner for policy and planning, noted in a posting on the FDA's Web site.” An extra 2,160 deaths a year could be avoided by not using drug coated stents according to an editorial by U.S. cardiology experts posted online Oct. 11 by the American College of Cardiology. This would not be the first time the FDA has allowed financial ties with outside corporations to affect their decision process. A good example was Vioxx.  When Vioxx along with several other COX-2 inhibitors were found to increase the risk of both heart attacks and strokes, the FDA created two advisory panels to look into the matter.  The two panels concluded by a narrow margin that even though there was no doubt that the COX-2 inhibitors increased both heart attacks and strokes, the benefits outweighed the risks and all the inhibitors would be allowed to return to the market just with stronger warning labels. After the fact, research into the FDA cases revealed that many members of the FDA advisory panels for both the original approval as well as the committees that voted to re-release the drugs back on the market, were paid consultants for the drug companies.  When a member has financial ties to a company that is up for approval or review, that member is supposed to excuse themselves from the decision.  In the meeting for the approval of Vioxx for of the six members including the chairman, had financial ties to Merck, the maker of Vioxx.  Even more conspicuous, according to the New York Times the panel that reviewed the COX-2 inhibitors to determine if they would be placed back on the market, ten members that voted had financial ties to one manufacturer.  Oddly enough, the vote was nine to one in favor of Vioxx. It seems like to me the FDA may be protecting interests instead of our wellbeing.

9,"Mayor Bloomberg says, “Shooting Unacceptable”",politics," Several days ago, an unfortunate shooting took place in New York City. A team of five undercover police officers were sitting in a van outside a strip club doing surveillance. There was an additional officer outside on foot in radio contact with the van. A gentleman of African American descent was celebrating his wedding which was supposed to be the next day with two of his friends. The three individuals left the club, got into their car and came under suspicion of the officer who was on foot and in plain clothes. The officer approached the car, wearing his badge. The driver of the car bolted. The officer thereupon radioed the five officers in the van that I think he has a gun. At that point, the car with the three individuals in it crashes into the van with the five cops, not once but twice. A hale of bullets, some fifty in all follow. One officer fired 31 times by himself. The driver of the vehicle, who was supposed to be married the next day, dies in the shooting, and his two companions were wounded. In the crime scene that followed no one finds a gun that could have been used by the gentlemen in the car. What follows next is EVERYBODY IS JOCKEYING FOR POSITION. The Mayor announces that firing that many bullets (over 50) is ""UNACCEPTABLE"", while the police commissioner keeping his cool, talks about the evidence not being completely in yet to form a judgment. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton get in on the act, and stir up old angers in the African American community. The first thing I say is, ""Thank God, two of the officers in question were black, and one Hispanic. The remaining two officers were white. The second thing is that the Mayor has never been in a shoot-out. The closest he comes to a gun is the police unit that protects him, and his $10 billion dollar Forbes 400 fortune. So what is Bloomberg trying to do? We can only conjecture. It does seem possible that he is positioning himself for a run for the Presidency in 2008, and he does not want to seem overly bias to the police department. It seems to me he is patronizing the Black community, which is just as bad. The Police Commissioner, Raymond Kelly is also positioning himself for a run for Mayor of New York in the next two years. This means he has to watch what he says also. I can't begin to imagine what a police officer has to go through to make a decision in an instant to use his gun. Human beings have five million years of evolution built into them. The most primitive emotional basis of our history is the ""Fight or Flight"" response. In a moment of intense fear, or panic as in when lions were chasing us 50,000 years ago, our sympathetic nervous system kicked in. Our brains are not thinking, instead instantly, extremely powerful chemicals start to flush through the body. These include noradrenalin, adrenaline, and cortisol which are released by the adrenal glands. These chemicals are so powerful that they overwhelm the body. Your emotional brain is preparing your body for FIGHT. The moment that first bullet went off; each officer involved assumed they were being shot at. All of them immediately emptied their automatic weapons at the car in question. NYPD officers are no longer permitted to carry revolvers as their primary weapons. They are instead required to carry semi automatic weapons such as the Glock 17, with a five pound trigger pull and a magazine that can fire 17 rounds. It is called a Glock 17 because it was the 17th patent taken out by its inventor. Most police officers carry 15 rounds in the magazine until the spring is broken in. You can however fire all 17 rounds in seconds, and that's just what happened. The Mayor is playing to the grandstand, and knows less than nothing about a gun fight. Once you fire, you don't say to yourself is two or three shots enough? You don't even know if you have hit anything. The adrenaline keeps pouring through your body, you can barely stand up. Unfortunately we have these preconceived attitudes generated by watching too many police shows on television. An example would be the various CSI television shows which show the crime scene detectives solving the case, and arresting the perpetrator.  That's nonsense; crime scene detectives NEVER EVER arrest anyone. They simply investigate the crime scene, and turn over the evidence to homicide detectives who do the searching and the arrests. Only in the movies and television do we see cool cops acting calm under pressure.  In real life, the fear that takes over the body is completely overwhelming. At some point in each of our lives, you have probably been stopped by a police officer for a traffic violation. You might remember the adrenaline rush you feel in your own body when this happens. What you don't know is the adrenaline rush the police officer is feeling in his body when this happens. There is nothing more frightening than a police officer pulling somebody over at night on a quiet road. The officer has no idea what is going to happen, or who he is encountering. There is a feeling of panic that is pervasive. I am sure in the incident at the night club that the officers regret the unfortunate ending to a terrible situation. I believe that although they may be charged and tried for this incident, I do not believe that any REASONABLE jury would ever convict. If convicted by a biased jury, the case would be overturned on APPEAL. Nevertheless, some people including the Mayor may try to make political hay out of this tragedy. If so, he will not benefit long-term, people tend to see through these situations to what is really going on. I will leave you with these thoughts. Seventy years ago, my father, than a 17 year old teenager was walking by an armored truck parked on the avenue. The rear doors were opened and my father decided to peer in, somewhat upsetting a guard who was sitting in the truck. The guard looked at my father, and said, ""You know young man; you hardly ever get into trouble minding your own business."" When the car drove into the van containing the five police officers TWICE, the driver was certainly not minding his own business. We should all pause for thought. Good luck"
10,New Medicare Advantage Plan Costing You Money,politics," In a new study by the Common Wealth Fund, it was found that moving seniors to private Medicare HMO’s are costing taxpayers 5.2 billion dollars per year.  The study found that coverage through a Medicare HMO usually costs 12.4 percent more than normal fee-for-service Medicare plan. Advocate of the program say that it increases the role of the private sector in Medicare and gives beneficiaries more choices and greater efficiency, while those against it argue that the free-to-market ideology has forced Congress to endorse a program that costs much more and gives seniors more restricted care. The research showed that the average beneficiary only uses 800 dollars of services and the new plan costs much more.  The report compared the cost of the two approaches in 3000 US counties. It found that managed care costs around 922 dollars more per year than the traditional system used by the federal government. Multiply the cost of the managed healthcare system by the 5.6 million Medicare beneficiaries, and it equals out to 30 billion dollars wasted on Medicare over the next five years.  Money that could be used fill in many other holes in our healthcare system, such as the doughnut hole in Medicare Part D. Besides costing more, the plan also limits the type of care seniors can receive and where they can receive it at.  The old Medicare plan would allow seniors to switch between plans, or change back to the original Medicare plan if seniors experienced any difficulties, such as their local hospital switching to another plan. Robert Hayes, president of the Medicare Rights Center, a non-profit group that provides assistance to Medicare beneficiaries said, “It’s very unfortunate few of these plans offer any value,” Hayes said. “There should be a level playing field between traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage. The new Congress should immediately pull money back for providing real care for people with Medicare.”"
11,The Rosia Montana Dilemma,politics," The Road to Democracy Romania was beggared during the autocratic rule of the communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in the 70s and 80s and after his violent overthrow in 1989 struggled to become a truly democratic nation throughout the nineties. During this period economic stability and growth declined due to an out of date and non-competitive industrial base and infrastructure. From 2000 onward the economy picked up rapidly to a GDP of over 8% in 2004, one of the highest in Europe and despite a set back due to bad weather affecting agriculture in 2005 is expected to continue to remain healthy and unemployment to remain low. Government in Romania is shared between a popularly elected President and by a Prime Minister nominated by the President after consultation with the majority party in parliament. If no party holds an overall majority the President will consult with all the parliamentary parties. The Prime Minister appoints other members of the government. Parliament has two chambers whose members are elected under the proportional representation system. Romania joined the NATO alliance in 2004 and is due to join the EU in January 2007. There are unconfirmed reports that graft and corruption remains prevalent at all levels although it is also believed that tentative steps are being taken to tackle the problem. The Rosia Montana Mining Project Rosia Montana is an attractive valley located in the Apuseni Mountains of West Central Romania in the County of Alba. The Rosia River flows through the Valley.  It is the site of the oldest documented settlement in Romania and mining in the locality dates back to Roman times. The area is rich in archaeological findings. It is reported that the area is estimated to hold the largest deposits of gold and silver in Europe. Over 10 million ounces of gold and 47 million ounces of silver in proven and probable reserves with indications of many more millions of ounces of both metals possibly recoverable. The Rosia Montana Gold Corporation is a joint venture between a Romanian state owned company, Minvest and Gabriel Resources (TSX:GBU), a Canadian company, with no mining experience, that holds 80% of the issued shares. Newmont Mining (NTSE:NEM) a major US miner owns 10.8% of Gabriel Resources. The extraction procedure will use the gold cyanidation process and is expected to consist of carving four open pit mines in the valley and damning a neighboring valley with a 180 metre high wall to form a six square kilometre cyanide storage lake. Before the mining project starts 2100 people will have to be moved from an area of 42 sq. kilometres, ten churches and nine hundred houses will be destroyed. The pollution of the area caused by the use of cyanide will be devastating and will last for many years. There is also a precedent when a cyanide pond used in another mining project in Romania sprang a leak in 2000 and caused disastrous pollution to the rivers Danube and Tisza resulting in the water supply of two million people becoming contaminated and the death of over a thousand tons of fish. To further cloud the issue there are unconfirmed reports that Gabriel Resources founder and chairman, Frank Timis, does not enjoy the cleanest of records with the authorities. There is a large, vociferous and influential environmental lobby actively opposing the Rosia Montana project as well as some Romanian government departments and officials in the anti camp. Have a look at the many websites giving the pros and cons. A further influence on the outcome is the attitude of the EU who may well block the project as a condition of Romania joining the common market in January 2007. Those in favor of the project have also produced strong arguments to support their view amongst which is the poverty and decline of the area and the improvement in standards the displaced population can expect. The venture is due to receive a decision from the Romanian Government, which has a vested interest, albeit likely to be relatively small, by the end of 2006. This is a speculative play that is wide open. If the project goes ahead there is likely to be a substantial short-term gain to take advantage of, if it is rejected then being short could pay off. Either way this is an exciting and interesting scenario that is coming to a head and in our opinion well worth the trouble and time to fully research. Good hunting!"
12,Lost in Translation: California Community Dispute Resolution Programs Denied Funding,politics," In 1986, the California legislature enacted a statute to fund a Dispute Resolution Program.  In enacting this statute the Legislature recognized that the resolution of many disputes is unnecessarily costly, time consuming and complex when achieved through formal court proceedings.  As a result, the legislature intended for the funds to be directed to the community to develop an informal resolution of disputes in a non-coercive dispute resolution forum, outside of the court system.   The intent of the legislature has been lost and the funds are being directed toward court programs that favor the economically well off, specifically claims over $25,000, who have the financial resources to maintain costly and protracted litigation.  The Dispute Resolution Program Act must be amended to restore the legislature's intent that the funds be used for Community programs for persons of all ethnic, racial and socioeconomic backgrounds.     The Legislature states in Business and Professions Code section 465 that the purpose of the program is to seek alternatives to costly legal process, by funding community-based dispute resolution programs reflective of the diversity of the communities to be served, funded partly by public funding and partly by users of these services on a sliding scale basis, but without cost to indigents. However, some of the counties have lost sight of the Legislature's intent and have misdirected the funds away from under funded community programs to the detriment of the diverse communities and the socio-economically challenged.  Some counties have chosen instead to fund court-connected programs, particularly claims over $25,000 that can generally only be accessed by economically sufficient persons. For example, Los Angeles County ignores the legislative intent by giving priority to unlimited jurisdiction civil claims (over $25,000) by providing free services indiscriminately to all comers provided they are already in the litigation system.  The Los Angeles court connected program specifically discriminates against Small Claims and low value ‘limited jurisdiction' cases (under $25,000 cases), by giving them the least priority and fails altogether to provide services ‘on a sliding scale basis'.  The violation of legislative intent could hardly be clearer. Los Angeles County specifically limits funding for Small Claims and ignores the statutory purpose of racial, ethnic or socioeconomic diversity.   By diverting funds to already well-funded unlimited jurisdiction cases, the County circumvents the statutory purpose by failing adequately to provide funding to programs for Small Claims and limited jurisdiction cases that involve disputes ""between neighbors, domestic disputes and consumer-merchant disputes,' as specified by legislative intent. Thus, the programs intended by the legislature to benefit from the funds, namely community programs involving disputes that have not already entered the court system and similar court-connected programs involving socio-economically challenged persons involved in low value limited jurisdiction and Small Claims disputes, and Youth Peer  Programs, are suffering because funds are being diverted to programs serving economically prosperous, who receive dispute resolution services free of charge while paying handsomely for all other aspects of their litigation. An enumeration of specific matters that may be referred to government-funded programs will prevent misuse of funds and uphold the statutory purpose.   Business and Professions Code section 467.2 outlining the county's eligibility requirements for funding should be revised as follows:  (b) Provision of neutral person, reflective of the diversity of the community in which they serve, adequately trained in conflict resolution techniques as required by the rules……. (c)  Provision of dispute resolution programs on a sliding scale fee-paying basis, and without cost to indigents, with respect to any disputes that have not yet entered the court system, and limited jurisdiction and small claims cases. By incorporating the Legislative intent of diversity of community volunteers and enumerating the specific disputes that can be eligible for Dispute Resolution Funds, the Legislature will finally create what it originally envisioned:  a funded community-based dispute resolution forum for all persons of all ethnic, racial and socioeconomic backgrounds."
13,Iraq and the Misery Index,politics," The other day it occurred to me that during Ronald Reagan's run for the Presidency he created a ""Misery Index"". This index represented a total of the rate of inflation, plus the prime rate, as an indicator of how the American people felt about how they were doing. No one has suggested resurrecting this index in recent years. My thought was to create a ""Happiness Index"". How happy are you with the leadership of the country. The problem is that other than taking an outright poll, how do you determine happiness? Could you merely ask people if they are happy, or not with the way things are going? Think about it for a moment, and try to objectively look at what's been going on the last couple of years. For the last fifty years, the Republican Party successfully presented itself as the people's choice for as a strong anti-communist party versus the former Soviet threat. Republican President after President was elected on the basis of toughness versus communism. By 1992, communism was no longer an issue as Russia, and the satellites went democratic, and the Berlin Wall had fallen. Suddenly, the Republican Party felt its foreign policy legs come out from under it. The communist bogeyman which was real since 1917 was no longer an issue. A sitting Republican President, George HW Bush was defeated handily by Democratic Candidate, Bill Clinton who had NO foreign policy experience, or even an understanding of things foreign. During the campaign that followed, foreign policy was a NON-ISSUE. There was no communist bogeyman for the Republicans to pin their hopes on. The tragedy of 9/11 changed everything. When the tragedy struck, the current President of the United States was handed terrorism on a silver platter as an issue.  Terrorism could then be used as a replacement for communism as the next boogeyman.  Anti-terrorism would serve as the underpinning of the Republican Party the same way anti-communism served for over 70 years. The President attacked the Taliban in Afghanistan who had harbored Osama Bin Laden, and his allies for years. When it came to finishing the job, and surrounding Osama in the mountains of Tora Bora, Afghanistan, we let this mass murderer get away by leaving the job to foreign hired mercenaries, the anti Taliban Afkan nationals. I assume we simply did not want to take the American manpower losses that might have been demanded. The President then committed the American army and wealth to destroying the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq. Our entry to this war was based on false premises. There were no weapons of mass destruction. We are now left with chaos and civil war in that country, and no EXIT STRATEGY. As Americans, not one of us, including the President has any idea how this war will finish. He, the President has now placed our country in the same position as we were in during Viet Nam - Quagmire. When Americans enter a war, they need to know the objective. During WW II, it was the taking of Berlin in Europe, or the fall of Tokyo in Japan. In Viet Nam, there was no mission, except the ephemeral objective of keeping South Viet Nam from going communist. What does that mean? Depending on how you calculate it, the Viet Nam war went on for about 15 years. How long will Iraq take? I believe the President has been notified by the American people in the recent Congressional election that he is on a ""short leash"" when it comes to Iraq. What is the objective in Iraq? It can't be democracy any longer. These people do not understand democracy as we understand it. The concept of democracy in that part of the world has not existed in thousands of years. Democracy is everybody's SECOND choice in Iraq. The Shia and Sunni's are killing each other on a daily basis in large numbers, some of which are unreported. Good, decent American troops, none of which are sons of any member of Congress, are dying in a war without an objective, except for ""Stay the Course"". These policies should be unacceptable to all of us as Americans. The Republican Party in Congress was a surrogate for President Bush in this election. The voters could not vent their ANGER at President Bush direct. The electorate chose instead, to vent their pent-up anger towards Republican incumbents, who took a ""thumping"" as the President said. Yes there were other issues like corruption, but Iraq was the emotional issue. Had President Bush been up for re-election, he would have been soundly defeated by even a paraplegic blind mute this time around. Let's get back to that ""happiness index"" I spoke about in the beginning of this article. Are any of us happier with the progress of our country over the last six years than we were before that period? Are we more optimistic about the future of our country now than we were a few years ago? Do any of us believe we are headed in the right direction, or even where we are headed at all? I believe we are now facing MASSIVE UNRESOLVED PROBLEMS that if not addressed will get worse, and our present leadership is not even aware that they exist. America has moved from a farming economy pre 1900, to a manufacturing economy in the 20th century. It must now complete the move from a manufacturing economy, to a services / post industrial society in this the 21st century. This is going to be a tough move with big unanticipated downdrafts that can knock us for an economic loop. China and the Asian rim want to manufacture everything, leaving us with nothing. Some of our brand name companies are more than willing to accommodate them. Nike manufactures nothing – everything comes from Asia. The massive oil companies in this country including Exxon, and others manufacture nothing – they are strictly distribution and marketing entities. GM and Ford can not compete against Asian manufacturing, and then there's Wal-Mart, which really functions as a distribution arm for China. Eighty percent of everything Wal-Mart sells comes from China. This President does not have his eye on the ball, and we are in danger of losing our economic fire power in the next decade. He is asleep at the switch, and must realize that we can no longer afford the loss of precious lives, and national wealth on wars without objectives in countries that none of us have ever been to. We do not have a ""Happiness Index"" in this country, but if we did, I believe we are near a low in our emotional happiness in this country. Things have to change, and they have to change in a hurry. Time is NOT on our side. Other countries want to eat our economy for lunch, and displace us as the world's only remaining superpower. This President would do well to act his act together, and start thinking about how to maintain national economic wellbeing in the face of the coming foreign economic threats that are looming."
14,New Defense Secretary Changes Everything – Perhaps,politics," On Election Day, the American people spoke very strongly that the direction the President and the Republican Party was taking America towards, is not the direction the country wanted to go in. Presidents are not oblivious to polls. They may not honor them, but they are not oblivious to them. The most important issue in the campaign turned out to be two issues according to the exit polls. They were CORRUPTION, and IRAQ in that order. The President was quick with a lightening type response to the election. I personally felt Donald Rumsfeld was going to be fired 3 or 4 weeks after the election to allow him to leave with his dignity intact. The President dispatched the now lamb duck Secretary within hours after the voters made their decisions. In doing so, the President is insuring that this Congress will ratify the nomination of Robert Gates, not a Democratic Congress convening in January of 07. What type of man is Robert Gates, the D Sec as they call the Secretary of Defense? There are parallels to this selection. During the height of the View Nam war, after six plus years in office, Robert McNamara was a worn, beaten man troubled by his own running of that war. His children had even turned against him. His friends advised how can you continue to be a part of this mess? McNamara left, and Lyndon Johnson installed Clark Clifford, one of my heroes who was a legal advisor to every Democratic President since Harry Truman. Clifford was even Joe Kennedy's lawyer, the father of the future slain President. Johnson thought that Clifford would turn into an absolute HAWK on Viet Nam, and turn up the pressure on the war. Instead, he advised Johnson, you are in an un-winnable situation, and I advise a negotiated settlement. Johnson swallowed hard, and announced he would not be his party's candidate for nomination, or re-election in the upcoming months. Robert Gates the new incoming Secretary of Defense is this President's second attempt to reach out to his father's advisors to HELP HIM. In the last 3 years, not once has this President spoken to the most important advisor he could have spoken with, regarding what to do in Iraq - namely his father, George Herbert Walker Bush. Now when the Iraq war has turned into a quagmire with no end in sight, this President has chosen his father's CIA director Robert Gates, to step in and turn this thing around. Gates was a student of Brent Scowcroft (former National Security Advisor), as was Condolezza Rice, our Secretary of State. Scowcroft is considered the ultimate low key professional who ran White House foreign policy when George HW Bush was President. Most people think Secretary of State James Baker called the shots, that's only partially correct. Scowcroft was the professional with the experience. Baker learned of course as the years went by, and became a very effective, diplomatic Secretary of State. Gates was there all the time, a totally professional intelligence analyst who is the only CIA career employee to rise from the bottom to become Director. The President's current status This President is in trouble, and the people who surrounded him called the Neo-Cons got him into the mess he's in. What you need to understand is that George Bush unlike many other politicians believes what he says, and says what he believes. Most politicians play to the crowd. This man's hero is probably Harry Truman, who walked out of the White House with an approval rating approaching 25% in 1953, and went on to be venerated by succeeding generations of Americans. President Bush does not play to the crowd. This is evident in his news conferences when he can not help but show his feelings when reporters ask the stupidest ""SHOWBOAT"" questions. Bush will not have any part of it. He is an authentic guy that lives his life that way. If the Iraq Study Group chaired by former Secretary of State Baker, gives the President some very tough advice on Iraq, he just might take it. Bush is not a fool. He knows this war is not going well. He also knows the American people like to keep their Presidents on a short leash when it comes to wars, and the free ride is now over. For the moment, the pressure on President Bush can only get worse. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld was taking the heat that rightfully belonged to the President. Rumsfeld as a foil for this country's anger is now gone. Bush will instead take the heat himself. He has no problem with that if he the President continues to believe in the righteousness of his actions, and for the moment he does. The President has been constantly underestimated by his opponents. You don't win two national elections, and one Congressional election in between by being a fool. Bob Gates is going to change things at the Defense Department, and change them quick. Do not for one moment believe that Rumsfeld was wrong on everything he did, that's nonsense. He did get four big things terribly wrong. One, he underestimated the post Iraq war need for US troop levels. It takes more troops to govern a country and quell discontent, than to invade and take over. Two, He did acquiesce or instigate the destruction of the Iraqi army. That army could have been utilized to re-build and govern post-war Iraq. We simply had to PAY THEM a sum of money equal to a fraction of what we are paying Halliburton for a failed US policy. Thirdly, he participated in, or instigated the firing of the Sunni's who ran the Iraqi government before finding COMPETENT REPLACEMENTS to replace those fired. They knew how to turn the electricity on, and keep the machinery of government functioning. Even General Patton at the tail end of WW II used Nazi bureaucrats until he could train his own bureaucrats.  Fourthly, the Iraqi police were fired, and then new people had to be found, vetted, and trained – 3 years have elapsed. What does it mean? We will never know if democracy would have had a chance to flourish in Iraq. It is too late, too much time has been wasted to wait for that to happen. The President's team, and therefore the President FAILED in the EXECUTION of a policy that could have worked had it been implemented properly, perhaps, we will never know. The American people have now lost patience in waiting for this President to correct his own mistakes – and forced change upon him via an election. Robert Gates is his first response. James Baker and the Iraq Study Group in the next couple of weeks will be his second response. Watch for changes in the Defense Department as soon as Gates is approved by the Senate. Does he fire the neo-cons one after another? If he does, you know we are on our way to a new policy."
15,Internet and Cable TV Shake Up Democracy,politics," Very rarely are we given the opportunity as citizens to participate in a revolution. The citizens that founded our republic participated in a revolution that has affected every corner of the earth for more than 200 years now. Our grandfathers and fathers participated in a revolution during World War II when we successfully ridded the world of Adolph Hitler and his technology of death that was sweeping civilization. Finally we all participated in a quiet revolution when Communism fell to its knees a little more than a decade ago, and went out with a WHIMPER. It didn't have to be that way. Millions could have died in Eastern Europe and in the USSR itself. Very quietly, this brutal totalitarian dictatorship that sought to enslave the planet quietly disappeared, and more remarkably, they all became capitalists. What a wild world we live in. I submit to you that we are on the eve of a new American Revolution, perhaps as powerful as the birth of our democracy in the 1700's. What has happened is that the power in this country is in the process of being re-distributed to the people themselves who are the voters. We were born as a Republic, remember the words, ""And to the Republic, for which it stands,"" in the Pledge of Allegiance. We are fast becoming a Democracy based on the information dispersion created by the Internet and cable television as a tool in everybody's home. Granted there is tremendous noise on the Internet, meaning that there is an abundance of useless information, but in the universe there are many gems, and they are on the Internet as well. Think about what has happened in just a few short years? It wasn't so long ago, that mainstream media had a 100% liberal bias. Clearly, an objective look at ABC, NBC, and CBS would reveal their liberal orientation. From their origins to their story topics, the media always played it to the left of center. Richard Nixon would NEVER have had to resign from office if the either the Senate or the House was Republican and the media was neutral. Today, with the Internet and Cable television, the tide has certainly evened up, and maybe swung to the other side. Dan Rather of CBS broadcast a disparaging story on George Bush and the National Guard which may have been correct, but Rather knew he couldn't prove it. In an attempt to influence the election two weeks before the election, he broadcasted it anyway. The Internet blows up his 40 year career and forced his resignation. The bloggers were relentless in attacking Rather and it resulted in the disgraceful behind the scenes, to date never revealed story of the firing of Dan Rather. Without the Internet and Cable television, Dan Rather would still be representing his liberal bias on prime time television every night. Traditional media and print journalism can't stand what has happened with the Internet and cable revolution we are participating in. When Republican Congressman Foley committed political suicide by writing inappropriate sexual e-mails to young pages, you and I were able to get on the Internet and read the e-mails for ourselves to determine the guilt of innocence of this man. We didn't need anybody with a POLITICAL AGENGA filtering it for us, and therein lies the REVOLUTION. We are able to filter stories for ourselves. No longer do I have to listen to Dan Rather tell me what's right or wrong. I can listen to Rather, read the NY Times, and go to the Internet and Cable TV to get additional information that the liberals refuse to divulge to me. The following will amaze you. A month before we invaded Iraq there was a former weapons inspector on television giving an interview in which he spoke in an explosive voice. He was ranting and raving that ""There are no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and we aren't going to find any."" I thought he was crazy, but I also said to myself, this is former weapons inspector who was THERE. He's not a recently released patient from an insane asylum. Now the reality is that he was right, and the President was wrong, the CIA was wrong, the military was wrong. How was this guy right, and knew he was right, and a 300 billion dollar a year war machine couldn't get it right? I have never seen or heard from this individual again. Has he been hushed up, why no interview, articles, or books? After all, he got it right, and we all got it wrong. The Internet is leveling the playing field. If you want to know why John Kerry lost the national election, look to the Internet. The guy was being defined by the Internet before he could define himself. I know Governor Pataki was making a joke when he said that ""John Kerry has to Google himself every morning to see where he stands on the issues,"" but he wasn't so far off the truth in retrospect. If I could have one prayer answered in politics, and I believe it's going to be answerd, this would be it. I would like to see every candidate, liberal or conservative raise 100% of their financial backing from the Internet and be free from these Special Interests and Lobbyists that are DESTROYING the democratic basis of our country. I don't want the drug companies to dictate pricing to Medicare for drugs for senior citizens. I also don't want teacher's lobbies dictating education in this country. Did you know from kindergarten through senior year of high school, our education system ranks 16th in the world? On a college level, we rank number one and there is no one even close. Why you ask? It's because the college system is private, and the public system is not. Even on a college level when you have public colleges like the University of California system or State University of New York system, they are world class only because they have to compete against a private system. Our public school system doesn't compete, and therefore it is allowed to remain mediocre in the face of 15 superior systems throughout the world. It is time for the Revolution to continue. By 2012, we will not recognize the political system in the United States as the dispersion of information shifts unfiltered to the people through the Internet's power. We should all welcome it, and thank God for it. What a wonderful thing that we will be alive to see it. Goodbye and Good Luck"
16,"""Blame It On Gay Marriage… $1,000 Reward.""",politics," The US environmental policy is being dismantled by a government in denial, while more and more evidence pours in about global warming (small things like hurricane Katina). Politicians cry about our dependency on foreign oil while our cars are getting bigger and bigger and government doesn’t do anything to really improve gas mileage.  Their only suggested solution is going into our reserves in pristine Alaska and using that up too. It’s sort of like the family who can’t budget… then… blames the banks and the credit card companies for having to spend their retirement account on a Hummer so they can look more macho than they feel. And then what about the domestic problems?  We are worried about the Mexicans coming up here and taking our jobs… at the same time… tons of higher paying jobs… the ones Americans really want, are being shipped abroad without a word – when was the last time you called Microsoft or HP or AOL and didn’t get India? And I keep hearing about more freedom, less government and less spending while what I see is less freedom, more government and the biggest debt our nation has ever faced. How about those tax cuts… but this is confusing because to have a “True Tax Cut”, you have to reduce spending… anything else is a tax re-distribution. If the government keeps spending more and the rich keep paying less, someone else ends up with the bill. That’s redistribution … it’s the middle class and the poor footing the bill. I am also told our government is at war on terror and yet that seems to be the only thing they are promoting… terror. I am much more afraid to travel abroad now than ever. We are making enemies around the world at an alarming rate. And what are we doing to solve all of these problems?  We’re attacking the gay people of America.  The one thing almost all of our current government officials can agree on is… it’s the gays fault. We can’t even have them in the military or the most powerful fighting machine in the world will fall apart (that’s a scary thought). We can’t have them getting married or the institution of marriage will fall apart? These are incredibly powerful people, if all this is true.  I say send a small group to Iraq and the terrorist will run in TERROR. I have spent years as a communication coach, teaching in government, schools, prisons and to the public. And, not once, have I met anyone who has said their marriage was great until those gay guys down the street got married (or for that matter – started living together). No one has told me they had a good job with great pay but when the gay women next door got married, they just stopped going to work, started drinking the next day and before they knew it… they were beating the wife and molesting the kids. Believe me, from my work in prison, I heard almost every story you can image and many you can’t, but I have never heard of a good relationship falling apart because of the gays getting married.… So now it time to ask yourself and your government what’s really important… Dear government officials – Kevin Lundberg, Marylyn Musgrave, President Bush: It’s time to stop wasting tax payer dollars and your time and go to work solving real issues… but first let me put my money where my mouth is. I will personally pay a $1,000 donation to the charity of your choice if you can prove to a panel of experts (counselors and therapists) that any couple had a normal, healthy relationship with good communication, and that relationship was destroyed because some gay people got married. Clean water and air for the future, jobs in America worth having, energy prices we can afford, a foreign policy that doesn’t antagonize the rest of the world so it’s safe to travel, an education system that has funding and oh yeah what about health care and social security? Are those things more important or do we want our government to focus all of its power, resources and your tax dollars on preventing gays from enjoying the frustration, upsets, heart-break and challenges of marriage the rest us suffer? This isn’t about me being gay and needing y rights to be protected.  This is about leaders actually leading.  Please, please, please... stop the stupid witch hunt and start leading us. Cause our thinking to expand, not contract.  Create hope, possibility and inclusion, not fear and separation. Use your power to create a tomorrow our kids can be proud of."
17,"Are too many political candidates campaigning in ""the Cave""?",politics," Is negative political advertising harmful or helpful in getting political candidates elected today?. This article examines some of the moral highground politicans give up if they sink too low in attacking their opponents. It uses Plato's Analogy of the Cave and suggests how voters can take an active roll in demanding more intelligent and civil messages from those seeking public office. Socrates to Glaucon Let me show you in an analogy how far our nature is enlightened or unenlightened. Behold politicians living in a cave, which has a mouth open toward the light. They have lived here from birth with their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move, and can only see the cave wall before them, being prevented by the chains from turning their heads. Most politicians are decent people who care about their country. But they are prisoners of that wall. To win elections they see shadows of their opponents on that wall and think they are seeing reality. The only opinions they hear are echoes of their own voices bouncing around the cave. Glaucon: Truly that explains why they say such ugly, distorted things about each other. I see by today's news scroll that the two Virginia Senatorial candidates are saying some good things but then, suddenly, they begin to mud wrestle with words.  How can you throw mud without getting your own hands dirty? Socrates: And how else to explain how two honorable men with thoughtful ideas can waste time accusing each other of everything with meaningless ""he said/he said"" arguments  - HE is delaying armaments for soldiers and not paying taxes on stock options, or counter charges - HE is demeaning women and a reflection of the lusty words he wrote in his novels.    But Virginia candidates are not alone in spreading thinly-researched insults.  Too many political candidates all over America mix campaigns with calumny - rumor and innuendoes. Let me speak plainly. Many people country are facing real problems -  an unending war, lack of access to affordable health care, and dangers to their Social Security and pension plans. Political candidates have an obligation to address these problems with their own solutions. Of course, they have a right to speak forcefully to defend themselves when they are attacked with false words.  But there is a narrow ethical line they must not cross. Instead of offering thoughtful ideas, too many debase their responses with their own overblown accusations - everything from charges that opponents choked their mistresses to making pornographic phone calls and accepting bribes and all other manner of civil and legal crimes. Glaucon: That is true. And so shameful for democracy. But many say these cruel words win elections.  Socrates: My good citizen, remember last week I told you the cautionary ""Tale of ENRON""? Sadly we have seen that lies and exaggerations can sometimes build great fortunes. But should we elect the most successful liars and exaggerators as our leaders? Glaucon: No! No! Certainly not!  But how can concerned voters choose the right candidates? Socrates: Voters must break their own chains, turn their heads and look for the light at the opening of the cave. Who among these candidates for public trust are honestly trying to see both sides of complex issues? Who actually listens to what his or her opponent is saying and responds in a thoughtful honest debate. But whenever citizens see or hear remarks from candidates that distort truth or spread hatred, they should send them a clear message: (Sir) or (Madam) I am a voter who loves this state and my country. I find your campaign full of ""sound and fury, signifying nothing!"" Glaucon: Good! And average people like me could post that message to candidates in our own emails and blogs. It could spread like a truth serum! Socrates: Glaucon, I am known as a Great Teacher, but sometimes I feel you are years ahead of me!"
18,Navy Seal dies the hero’s death in Iraq,politics," It may surprise you to learn that during the entire Iraq war and post war engagement period, only two of the elite Navy Seals have paid the ultimate price of service. I remember when the Navy created these magnificent combat units during the Viet Nam war, which succeeded the navy's underwater demolition teams (UDT's) that became famous during World War II. When the Green Berets use to train in Viet Nam, they would run up and down the beaches. The Seals would run with them, but would run around them, to demonstrate their competitive spirit and their training. A Navy Seal unit in Iraq was assigned to a sniper hideout in Ramadi, outside Iraq on September 29th, of this year. The door to the hideout was part of a roof top structure. Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael A. Monsoor was the only one near the door. A grenade was thrown into the hideout. It bounced off Monsoor's chest and hit the ground. His fellow Seals stated that Monsoor's eyes never left the grenade. As the grenade moved to the ground, Monsoor eyes followed it. It is a moment like this that can never be trained for, thought about, or reasoned. Everything you are as a human being determines what you do next. What would any of us do? These are questions to which we can never know the answers. We do however know what Michael Monsoor did. He voluntarily smothered the grenade with his body, and absorbed the full brunt of the explosion. In doing so, he saved the lives of the men in his team. Other members were hurt but not killed. A 28-year old Lieutenant was hit with shrapnel in his legs. There were two Seals next to Monsoor who were hurt but not seriously. Another team member 10 feet away was unhurt. Seals who knew Monsoor when he was stationed at Coronado Island, in San Diego said that he was a loyal friend, and dedicated professional. Both his brother and his father were former Marines. Monsoor was no ordinary man. On May 9th of this year, five months before his death, a team member had been shot in the leg, again in Ramadi. Without hesitation, Monsoor and a fellow Seal pulled the insured Seal to safety. There were bullets flying all around them while they performed the rescue operation. Monsoor was given a Silver Star for that action. How lucky, how fortunate we are as a nation to have such fine human beings walking among us. People that are committing the most selfless acts, they show such remarkable character. They are demonstrating a uniqueness that we could only wish existed in even a handful of our elected leaders. America is a far safer country because such extraordinary people exist and have opted to serve in our armed forces. It has now come to our attention that the explosive devices being used in Iraq to kill and main our servicemen are not the product of Iraqi insurgents. These devices are being produced in neighboring Iran, and brought across the border to kill our troops. The President has chosen not to share this information with the American people. It would seem to me that these Iranian actions are an Act of War against the United States. Perhaps Mr. Bush feels that have the WMD debacle, he is unwilling to be accusatory against another Arab (Persian really) country. It is putting our brave soldiers at a great disadvantage. Prior to the war, the manufacturers of the Abrams tank use to boast that no American soldier has ever lost his life in an Abrams. Several have now lost their lives in this, the ultimate tank. What's worse is that the new, improved explosive devices coming from Iran have the capacity to pierce the Abrams tank, due to the shaped charge now incorporated into the device. There's much that the President and his Administration have to be accountable for. We as a nation have to deal with what is. We can look back and question the war because of an absence of Weapons of Mass Destruction. I don't know how profitable such an examination is at this point. The President and his advisors through their actions have committed three massive operational decisions that have led to the quagmire, and insurgency that we are now facing. The first mistake was first was the extent of de-Batthification. Our leaders chose after World War II to employ thousands of Nazi's to keep whatever was left of the German infrastructure going. We also knew that these people would help restore the economy quicker than trying to replace them. The second major error was getting rid of the army. The Administration would tell you that the army just got up, disbanded, and left. Armies are loyal to whoever pays them. Here were hundreds of thousands of soldiers that could have been employed to help stabilize a new government in Iraq. Instead, we chose to shame them, not pay them, and send them home where there were no jobs, and nothing for them to do. The response is that they are wreaking havoc on our troops, who are paying with their lives and limbs for this tragic error in judgment. The third error was dumping the leadership group. Saddam's associates were never Islamic extremists. Yes, we needed to chop off the first layer of leadership that surrounded Saddam, maybe put them on trial for their crimes. At the same time recognize there were thousands of people that were members of the Saddam's party because they had to be just to hold jobs, like the thousands of teachers that taught the children. Our entire space program was the product of German rocket scientists, including Werner Von Braun, the guys who rained missiles down on London during the war. Could we not have turned these Iraqi leaders to our advantage? The culmination of these three strategic errors is that such fine young men like Petty Officer Michael A. Monsoor have to pay with their lives because of the tragic leadership errors of our elected officials. Thank God, America produces such fine young men. We always have, and we always will. Goodbye and good luck"
19,"""America's Goliath, IRS code sec 501(c)(3)?""",politics," Has anyone noticed all the hoopla recently about the non profit status of the church? Many have become concerned.  It seems that ministers have not read this code.  The censorship in this code, is in regard to election campaigns.  During election campaigns a minister is not allowed to say anything for or against any candidate from the pulpit. Ministers and the media have not even mentioned this point in the news.  The rest of the year ministers could be educating their members about issues and candidates.  It is a loop hole that ministers are not even aware of.  It seems most ministers keep their mouth shut all the time, because of their fear. The truth may be, according the First Amendment; it would be illegal for the government to censor the church anytime. The church was sound asleep in 1954.  The church compromised their integrity and gave up their First Amendment right of free speech by not speaking out against this code.  They did not use their First Amendment right of redress of grievances. Many ministers call their non profit status a blessing because they are not taxed on offerings and property.  Members can deduct their giving on their annual income taxes.  This  no tax on the church was the historical norm before this code was foisted upon the church.  Is this IRS code really a curse on the church and America? The truth is the church does not have to give up their right of free speech.  They have believed the lie that their faith has nothing to do with their vote. Many ministers cite that Jesus told His followers to be subject to the government.  The Roman empire was a dictatorship.  America is a government by, of, and for the people. Separation of Church and State has been twisted into a lie.  It has caused Christians to cast their vote with no thought of their faith.  Many Christians have sold their vote for economic reasons.  Ministers have perpetuated this lack of knowledge by keeping their mouth shut.  Ministers covet their non profit status.  They are afraid to speak up for fear of losing their profitable business ministry. For the most part, ministers are not aware, because they inherited this Gold Ring from their forefathers of 1954.  Aspiring ministers are elated when they achieve non profit status.  What they don't perceive is; non profit status is just a rusty Iron Ring.  It is a compromise of their integrity and has been part of the reason for the moral decline of America. Most ministers say the moral decline started in 1961, when the government took prayer out of the public school system.  It really started in 1954.  It started when one Senator secretly convinced all of congress to censor the church with IRS code sec 501(c)(3).  It was a tyrannous act performed without notice to the American people.  This code is ""smoke and mirrors"" to hide the fact; they wanted to censor the largest group in America and prevent themselves from being fired.  This censorship enabled elite politicians and elite capitalist to further their greedy agenda against the American people. Christians might do well in reading carefully the First Amendment and IRS code sec 501(c)(3).  Eighty two percent of Americans call themselves Christian.  This fact horrifies the minority non believers and they are doing everything they can, to keep the majority ignorant. Can this American Goliath be defeated? Are Christians waiting for some young man with a sling and a rock to defeat him? A revolution of the church in America is emerging.  If politicians don't pay attention they might lose their job.  The Democrats and the Republicans might become the political parties of the past, if they don't get this right. It might be too late.  Businesses use feed back and criticism to refine products and services.  They know this will make them more successful.  When the church is criticized;  they scream touch not the anointed.  This is partly why, only approximately  twenty to twenty five percent of Christians are in church on a regular basis. Is this the opinion of just one raving idiot? Stay tuned America, only time will tell.  We are in the Information Age."
20,"North Korea – Yes, you have our attention",politics," North Korea has tested a low yield nuclear device with 4% of the destructive power of the bomb that the United States dropped on Hiroshima, Japan at the end of World War II. Some believe that the device was much larger but may have failed for technical reasons. We don't know the truth, because the United States has not devoted the resources to know what is really going on. If you are surprised, don't be. Intelligence collection is a tricky business. When Richard Nixon was President, you may remember that one of our ships, the USS Pueblo was brazenly attacked and hijacked in international waters in 1968, off the coast of North Korea. The 82 member crew was taken prisoner and tortured over an 11 month period before their release was negotiated. There is such a thing as institutional memory. The senior members of the military remember the Pueblo incident well, and it still influences our behavior towards North Korea. As an aside, President Nixon gave the order to attack North Korea in retribution for the Pueblo incident. At the time the President believed a show of force was absolutely necessary to dissuade the Koreans from further provocative acts. Nixon's Secretary of Defense at the time did not carry out the Presidential directive. To the end of his life, Nixon felt the biggest foreign policy error of his administration was the failure to carry out a retaliatory raid against North Korea for the Pueblo capture. The Pueblo incident has emboldened the North Koreans ever since. Both the Clinton and Bush Administrations were aware of the Pueblo incident and its aftermath, when attempting to configure a new US policy towards North Korea's nuclear program. We have 37,000 American soldiers stationed in South Korea protecting our alliance and interests with South Korea. There is a phased troop withdrawal from the South Korea Peninsula taking place. You have to wonder why we are willing to withdraw troops from South Korea during a time when they wish to pursue a nuclear development process. The answer is that this area of the world is loaded with dynamite, and if it blows up, you don't want to have 37,000 American troops sitting in the middle of it. North Korea has one of the largest stockpiles of artillery weapons of any army in the world. They are capable of striking  Seoul, South Korea's capital from across the border. It was recently reported that Prince Bandar, the Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the United States had a private conversation with President Bush. In the conversation the Prince told the President that the United States should withdraw US troops from South Korea. Bandar felt it was too dangerous to leave our soldiers in the middle of a possible confrontation where our OPTIONS would be limited. As Bandar put it, without troops on the border, if there's problem, it's a REGIONAL PROBLEM. With troops, you could have thousands of American lives at risk, and it becomes a major WAR instantly. So what do we do about the North Koreans announcing the ACTUAL testing of a nuclear weapon? We have to realize that words have power. We have to be careful what we say. President Bush announced the ""axis of evil"" speech several years ago. He named North Korea and Iraq as two of the three countries. It would seem that he started his anti-terrorism campaign in the wrong end of the world. Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction (WMD), while North Korea has gone live with them. Now we are in a bind. Our defense policy has been altered whereby we can only fight one war in one country at a time, while fighting a holding action in a second country. Prior to the Bush Administration holding power, we were postured to fight two simultaneous wars on two fronts. The bad guys know our new policy and will take advantage of us being pinned down in Iraq to expand their own power bases. Since we have a fear of losing pilots or better yet, having a pilot shot down, we are not doing the reconnaissance flights that we would normally do over North Korea. The best thing to do right now is to realize that if North Korea is a problem for the United States, it is a much bigger problem for Japan, China, Philippines, and South Korea. This is a regional problem in spite of our alliances, and treaty involvements. Its one thing to build and detonate a nuclear weapon, it's quite another to have a long range missile delivery system. North Korea could fairly easily develop a delivery system capable of hitting the countries in its immediate vicinity. Hitting the United States from a 9,000 mile plus distance is another story, not so easy really. Since the countries bordering North Korea have the most to lose, they should be the ones bearing the brunt of the responsibility for multi-lateral talks among the powers involved. The real deal is that North Korea is a dictatorship that routinely starves its own people for the benefit of the small leadership that has basically enslaved the country. This leadership wants to play the cards that it can. What it now has is nuclear weapons. They will use this card to maximize whatever concessions they can from the United States and the immediate surrounding neighbors. Are we going to cave, and make concessions to the North Koreans? Of course we are, because that's what superpowers do. It's not about appeasement, it's about business, and what makes good business sense. Churchill said that ""People have friends, nations have interests"". It is in our interest to not divert ourselves from the issue of extricating ourselves from a tortuous situation in Iraq. It is costing us treasure, and beginning to eat at the social fabric our country as Viet Nam did a generation ago. We must put a good face on Iraq and get out. The President may not be aware of it, but he is on a short leash in Iraq. The American people are very intolerant of wars without objectives that last too long, and that's precisely where George Bush finds himself. It is highly questionable that his party will survive the mid-term elections intact. The country will embrace CHANGE, even from a Democratic party that is devoid of ideas."

1,Disney / ABC deserve credit-Sept. 11th ABC movie,politics," It is rare, rare indeed when a major media entity bucks the trend, and does what it believes in. Recently ABC under Disney’s guidance aired the $40 million production, “The Path to 9/11”. This was a five hour-two night portrayal of the events that led to 9/11. Having gone through the history of terrorism over the last 25 years, I believe this portrayal was as accurate as you can get. The screenwriters were not politically motivated in any way. They could have come down on the Clinton Administration much harder than what you saw; Bush was not given a free pass either. Bill Clinton was no different than the Presidents before him. Every President from Jimmy Carter forward, whether Republican or Democrat was soft on terrorism. The Presidents chose to use the notion that terrorism is an illegal act, and should be treated as such, in the courtroom. This meant countless indictments by grand juries of overseas terrorists that would never be brought to trial in America. It was a MARVELOUS political choice of not having to deal with a problem. The “Path to 9/11” could have humiliated Clinton on this score. They took it easy on the man. I do not criticize Clinton for his actions. He was simply extending the policies of his predecessors into the present. The problem was that terrorism came home to roost big time under the Clinton Administration. The entire plot to take those planes into those buildings was hatched, and prepared while Clinton was President. The FBI was asleep at the switch, and the CIA wasn’t talking to the FBI. Ask the FBI how they spent a $150 million on a computer system that didn’t work? Ask them if they are computerized as of right now, or are they still using paper index cards in most of their offices? Ask them if more than half their agents have laptop computers today, five years after 9/11? I know the answers to those questions, and you would be surprised at them. The FBI and the CIA have a long history of dislike for one another. If you want proof, go back to World War II when J. Edger Hoover ran the FBI, and Will Bill Donovan ran the Office of Strategic Services, the predecessor to the current CIA. The two men hated one another, and their respective organizations followed through on the anger. Within days after WW II ended, Hoover forced the new President Harry Truman to disband the OSS as unnecessary. At the same time the Russians were consolidating their gains in Eastern Europe. The CIA formed just a few years after the was over, was created in spite of Hoover’s strenuous objections. The notion of judicial process of terrorists was continued right on up through our current President, George Bush. This President turned the tables after 9/11. Would you believe that the FBI was still fighting for judicial processing of terrorists after 9/11 while the CIA was fighting for “let us deal with it”? The President sided with the CIA, and the military, against the protests of the FBI, and Justice Department. Just a few short months earlier, Bush would have probably made the same call as Clinton. Our current President is the first President in my lifetime to deal with terrorism for what it is. It’s an ACT of WAR against this country. For those who want to treat it as something else, let me remind you of the stakes. We lost 2,749 people in the World Trade Centers, and many, many more in the Pentagon and a small field in Pennsylvania. One small nuclear weapon that can fit into a brief case would make New York City uninhabitable for decades at a minimum, probably kill of 250,000 within seconds, with another 300,000 to 500,000 casualties with hospitals that couldn’t help them. If you don’t think that Osama Bin Laden on a daily basis is not trying to acquire that weapon, than you need to change what you are smoking. These people if they could snap their fingers and remove 300 million Americans from the planet would snap those fingers. Usually people that hate us don’t have the capacity to follow through on their hatred. If you live in a village in the middle of a mountain pass, and you hate Americans, what can you really do, while you sleep in a bug infested hut, eating scrapings from the Chieftain’s table? Osama on the other hand, has cash estimated at $500 million. Additionally, he raises BIG MONEY on a yearly basis from Arabs who hate us also, and governments seeking to buy protection from him. Do you think it’s just luck that the Saudi Arabian pipelines have not been touched in a terrorist act? Those pipelines are wide open, and just waiting to be blown up. Such an act would put us all on gas lines in the United States, and probably rationing. Aren’t you surprised that Kuwait has not been attacked, or any other oil producing juggernaut. Oil comes from all the bad neighborhoods of the world, and it is the lifeline of American productivity. We must do whatever we must do to protect that lifeline. If you are concerned about war with extreme Islamic fundamentalists, let me remind you that we once fought a foe just as militant, and just as extreme. There were once 50 million Nazis that hated our souls, and if gave the chance would have killed every one of us. We fought a war for five years against them. How many Nazis do you see around the world today? They are a group so small that they can be counted on the fingers of a mutilated left hand. If we can successfully eliminate the Nazis, we can successfully eliminate Islamic terrorists from our world as well. The answer is not hauling them into court and putting them on trial. The answer is to keep them overseas. We must do whatever has to be done to keep this marvelous, wonderful bastion of democracy free from those who would destroy our entire society. We have been God’s gift to the world for 200 years. Yes, we have made mistakes through the decades, but can any other country in two centuries have acted in as wise, and decent a fashion as us ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I think not."
2,Afghanistan given up to the warlords,politics," Fifteen thousand American soldiers, helped by two thousand back-up troops of the allied troops, try, without much success, to ensure a pretence of order in Afghanistan. The presidential election wanted by Washington is quite unable to bring back peace in a country divided between all-powerful lords of the war. Being based on dissatisfaction vis-a-vis with the foreign presence and the permanent insecurity, the talibans multiply the armed actions and wait their hour. As of the suburbs of Kabul, the Afghan State disappears. One finds nothing any more but lords of the war who control like absolute monarchs, take taxes don't apply the directives of the central government. Even in the capital, one does not know who controls: president Hamid Karzaï and his government? The American ambassador Zalmay Khalizad, this Afghano-American parachuted by Washington? Or the international troops which, with 6 000 men, square all the districts length into broad? The United States confiscated the largest avenue of Kabul, where they build an immense building for the CIA. The villas in the neighbourhoods, which were sold ten thousands of dollars under the talibans, are worth, two years later, thousand times more. The Afghano-Americans returned to recover their houses in Kabul and to rent them at ransom price to the Westerners. The Afghans of Hamburg and besides encased the step to them. In the eyes of people of the interior they are sag chouyan, ""washers of dog"", impure animal for Islam. These Afghano-Westerners, indecently rich compared to the population, came to be added to the diaspora of those returned from Iran or Pakistan, where they could pile up a little money at the price of a hard labour. Enough cosmopolitan, they must adapt to the new conditions: masons, electricians, small contractors or small shopkeepers, some live on the hills which surround Kabul and thus escape from the prices from some avenues. These two diasporas share only their origin. If the second is integrated without too many difficulties, the first, arriving from the Occident, is rejected. In Kabul one considers that it came to box its goods, but then it will leave or monopolize lucrative stations in order to increase its fortune on the back of the population of the interior. In the bazaar of Kabul misery bursts; people in rags live with almost nothing. Admittedly, the nongovernmental organizations - some two thousand Western ONG which are prosperous and highly respected there - give work to a part of the city. But the noble tasks return obviously to Westerners or to Afghans come from Occident, the menus work - drivers, guides, distributors of assistance, etc - with the Afghans of the interior. The urban average-lower classes fight against impoverishment, but they can easily fall into misery because of inflation. Many of their members do not manage to follow the rise in the cost of living, in a city where the surge from abroad breaks old balances and raises the prices out of arrow. These small townsmen live more and more in the frustration and the hatred of the fortunate Afghans considered as nonMoslems because of their individualism and of their refusal to share and give alms. In the conversations, these townsmen often express their objections in religious terms, making it clear that, under the talibans, at least, all were poor and that the capacity was not dominated by parachuted people of another world. In the name of Islam, the extremists groups will be able, in the future, to exploit this feeling ""not to be at home"", to be maintained with the bottom of the social scale, to be scorned and rejected by ""foreigners"" and the ""inaccurate ones"", to reinforce a long-lived islamist movement in the frontier areas of Pakistan. They will thus gain the urban base which they missed and will widen their influence among this recently urbanized population whose life is made of misery, of attempts to build itself a future. Some, however, succeed while fitting in the meshs of the new system. Omar, a child, was gifted for football. Punished by the talibans, it had to give it up. At present, he tries to play in the team which will become national. His dream would be to find a place in one of the formations of the countries of the Gulf... or besides. Akbar, mason, had left, under the taliban period, to work in Iran. He returned to Kabul to exert its trade. He makes the shuttle between the two countries and is rather optimistic about his prospects for promotion, even if, he recognizes, the situation hardly encourages working and investing. Mohammed also returned from Iran. He works thanks to more or less illegal constructions which proliferate in Kabul. He brought back with him his two daughters and his two boys, who complain: the first (of which one went to the university of Teheran), of little freedom which is left to them; seconds because they are treated as ""Iranians"" and that one does not recognize them like authentic Afghans. Like the Afghan/Pakistanais duality, the germs of a Afghan/Iranien duality are sown, and the new company will have to be done there, with girls and boys who do not subject themselves easily to the tradition. The scatter of the capacity and the seizure of the lords of the war on the areas induced notable changes. Omar, small shopkeeper who, under the talibans, bought in Iran and sold in Afghanistan, went bankrupt after their inversion. Firstly, he paid only one tax to insert his goods in the country. From now on, he must pay taxes in each area which he crosses: how to remain profitable? He was transformed into taxi driver, but does not hide his bitterness. In a country more or less unified under the talibans a feudal system succeeded. The underground economy has encouraged all kinds of traffics, from electronic parts to food, but especially opium. The poppy cultivation extended since the fall of the talibans: it touches areas saved before and becomes transnational, by combining the ethnic bonds with the world traffic as well as the political fasteners with the lords of the war, even of the members of the government. It is unaware of the borders and extends in Iran, Pakistan and beyond, in Europe and, much less massively, in California. But it is also at the origin of the redistribution of the economic capacity and policy in Afghanistan: lords of the war take a tax on this culture of opium, even imply themselves there, and sometimes actively, to pay their private army. In Iran, the use of the ethnic, linguistic and religious bonds, allows the passage of drug: Iranian Baloutchistan is populated of sunnites which make pass heroin to the beard of the pasdarans, the Iranian guards of the revolution. The drug money cements the bonds which, in return, in a mondialized underground economy, facilitate the transfer of the white powder in Iran, in spite of the boundless ingenuity deployed by the army of this country to stop the flow of drug. The traffic towards Pakistan passes by the frontier area of Waziristan, where the talibans, the members of Al-Qaida and the islamist ideology have the wind in poop. There too, it is facilitated by the ethnos groups which, on both sides, make the border porous. The opium produced in various parts of the country is sold easily. The Americans are concerned little. On these traffics, the lords of the war present in the government take in the passing of the taxes which enrich them and allow the maintenance with customers and a militia, of which the nargue number the scanty army like the small national police force. The government can assume only 12 % of its budget to him, the remainder coming from the Western contributions. In short, all occurs like if a vast network of ethnic, religious and economic alliances enclosed Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran. Acting of Afghanistan and Pakistan, this play proceeds in countries placed in the formal orbit of the United States, which exerts a limited control and must adapt to the ground, i.e. to negotiate with gangster chiefs. In Pakistan, a great part of the population is antiamerican and favorable to Mr. Usama Bin Laden. In Iran, Baloutches sunnites support Al-Qaida in opposition to theocracy Iranian Shiite. In Afghanistan, a great part of Pachtounes preserve a diffuse sympathy to the talibans. The Afghan government tries to create a ""national"" feeling by being equipped with posthumous heroes, of which the commander Ahmed Chah Massoud, emblematic ""lion of Panchir"". But Massoud is actually liked by only one part of the Inhabitants of Tajik and people of its area (Panchir). The others often hate him, reproaching him for having acted himself as a lord of the war during the catch of Kabul by seven rival factions, in 1992-1994, before the victory of the talibans. In Afghanistan there is a mondialized economy which has as names dopes, ONG, money of the allies, international assistance under the American aegis and finally gifts made to the government by the rich countries. The State does not exist and, probably, will not exist very soon. It is an unstable and heteroclite coalition of lords of the war and politico-monks leaders who surround the president, driven by the lure of gain, by the ambition or because they feel constrained to play the game wanted by the Americans. To last, the capacity tries to put an end to the reign lords of the war by integrating them in a court, as Louis XIV did it with the aristocracy. But, with France of Ancien Régime, there is a difference in size: without the Western will, this government would not exist. And let's not forget the ethnicity, which is combined according to several modes: initially religious (sunnites versus Shiites), then linguistics (Persan versus pachtounes), finally ethnic - Hazaras (Shiites), Inhabitants of Tajik (sunnites), Pachtounes (sunnite)... The president makes an effort to ""pachtounise"" the government, because it is pachtoune and that the ousting of the talibans, them also pachtounes, gave too much weight to the Inhabitants of Tajik. Nothing there, however, which is likely to reinforce the State and its autonomy. The president tests, without much success, to play the mediator in the multiple conflicts which put at the catches the chiefs of the war: in Mazar-e-Charif, between the lord of the war Mohammed Atta and the chief of the police force, the General Akram Khakrezwaï; in Herat, between Mr. Ismaïl Khan and Amanoullah Khan, etc. The president has tiny room to multiply the nominations and the against-nominations to weaken local potentates, leading to the reinforcement of what one calls here the ""warlordism"". Actually, the State, with the assistance of Washington, seeks to enter this power play, especially to weaken the talibans and Al-Qaida, much more than to build institutions worthy of this name. It seeks, in addition, to attract to itself the benevolence of islamist known as ""moderated"", in particular a part of the group of Mr. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, one of the historical leaders of the moudjahidins in the anti-Soviet fight, a step in the integration of fundamentalist in its project. In short, ""pacification"" is less the work of the central State than of a redistribution of the ethnic chart by a government allocating privileges. The chiefs of war collaborated in turn with the Russians, the talibans, the various regional capacities or their opponents; all have blood on the hands. Meanwhile, they are the chaos of universalization, the poppy cultivation and the interethnic bonds revisited which generate money and capacity - the economy of drug would represent more than 2 billion dollars per annum. The new regional disorders in Afghanistan, in Iraq, in Pakistan as well as the consequences of the regional policies in Iran (where the capacity Shiite is not tender with respect to the sunnites of the border) and in Pakistan (where the military capacity must compose with the tribes under penalty of general revolt) make this area explosive. How to wage an effective war against radical islamist groups for which such an amount of injustice and inconsistency creates a fertile ground?"
3,Sept. 11th ABC movie-Historically accurate,politics," Sometimes Hollywood does get it right. The landings at the beaches of Normandy in the Steven Spielberg movie, “Saving Private Ryan” is a vivid, stunning, blood and gore portrayal of the horror that young American troops freeing the world of Adolph Hitler faced. No book could portray this experience as accurately as the movie. The Disney Company through its ABC subsidiary, has put together a $40 million dollar 5 hour experience of the events leading up to the September 11th tragedy at the World Trade Centers.  Being a student of national security I was deeply surprised at how accurate the movie is. Even some of the actors physically looked like some of the actual participants in the events. The senior Democratic leadership in the Congress pleaded with the network not to air the movie. They felt that the Democrats were being shown in a bad light, which they were. If you want to lead a country, you must take the hit politically when you are caught on the wrong side of an issue. Beginning with Jimmy Carter, this country has treated acts of terrorism as a judicial process, a law and order issue, and not an ACT OF WAR. This policy was continued by every President, Republican or Democratic for over a quarter of a century, only President Bush to his credit, decided to call it what it is, WAR. It’s the desire on the part of Islamic extremists to make the world unsafe for democracy. The Democrats have much to lose because Senator Hillary Clinton would like to be President in the next 24 months, and former President Clinton is taking a hit on this movie as well. Bill Clinton personally called Robert Iger, the CEO of Disney, and ABC’s parent company to ask him to cancel the 5 hour drama. Clinton was told that the show was still being edited, and this was just 4 days before it would appear on television. Nobody edits that close to airtime. Who’s kidding who? Nevertheless, it looks like 15 to 20 minutes were cut from the first night’s portrayal. One of the scenes that were altered at the former President’s request showed Sandy Berger, former national security advisor to President Clinton in a telephone conversation with leaders of the CIA. The agency had a real time, live ground operation in progress to capture Osama Bin Laden going on while Berger on the phone simultaneously, couldn’t make up his mind whether to proceed. Men’s lives were at risk, and Berger can’t make a decision. Finally, Berger hangs up the telephone rather than be pinned down. The scene showing Berger hanging up the phone was deleted. Berger certainly doesn’t come up in a good light. Neither does former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright for that matter. When it came to giving the approval to go after Bin Laden, Albright makes it very clear that regional considerations must come first, and then there’s President Clinton himself. The movie does some job portraying the former President as out of touch, and even weak towards terrorism. To a very great extent this was simply the former President following in the same footsteps as every President before him during the preceding 25 years. Former Presidents have all played the same tune. They treated terrorism as a legal issue. These people must be arrested, and brought to justice. Terrorists were waging war against the United States, and we in turn were waving arrest warrants, and grand jury indictments at them. This was just as true of Republican Presidents as well as Democratic Presidents. Nobody in a leadership position in Washington wanted to take on the terrorism issue. It was far easier and face saving, to call it a legal issue. The current President George Bush changed all that. Whatever you think of the current President, he is the first American President in a quarter of a century to deal with terrorism for what it is, terrorism. It is a war pure and simple. Now there are a lot of people in the world that hate us, that’s the bad part. The good part is that 99% of these people don’t have the money, energy, knowledge, or guts to follow through on their hatred. They can’t execute, they can’t get it done. Bin Laden had the wherewithal, and the organization to follow through, and that’s just what he did. Ask anyone in the CIA, and they will tell you that the 9/11 plot was in no way the work of amateurs. If you asked an intelligence agent his objective opinion, he would probably tell you the operation was well thought out, well run, well financed, and well executed. The cell even used our own technology (GPS tracking), and openness of our society against us. It was kept a small operation by the terrorists, and the goal was something that in an open society was unthinkable. The ABC movie showed the continuing power of visual media over books. You can write a thousand books, but one movie can be seen by a hundred times people than those who read books. Bin Laden knew the power of visuals. This is why he wanted the full force of the media to be involved in this tragedy, and that’s just what he got. The man is evil, and he’s a terrorist. We must also realize that with his money and organization he represents a threat that we have not seen before or since. He should have been dealt with by now. The scale of the danger he represents is too great, for this menace to be left alive in the mountains of Pakistan where he lurks."
4,The War on Truth,politics," President George W. Bush has long preferred illusion to reality. ""See, in my line of work you got to keep repeating things over and over and over again for the truth to sink in, to kind of catapult the propaganda,"" Bush explained of his approach at a public forum in 2005. For Bush, there are no real problems, only political problems. The only crises are when poll numbers fall. Bush administration officials are obsessed with controlling the flow of information. Their strategy for maintaining their grip on power is simple: Perpetuate fear. We must remain in a state of total war. The implications for democracy are chilling. President Bush has asserted a right to unlimited wartime powers. Thus the Constitution, Bill of Rights, Geneva Conventions, and the very notion of a balance of power have been shredded. The official rhetoric is that we are now in a Long War, led by the president, über alles. The media, so cowed for so long, has failed to present a coherent picture of this frontal assault on our democracy. Alarming stories emerge, piecemeal, of warrantless wiretaps, of U.S. sanctioned torture, of offshore prisons where thousands are being held at the whim of a president who invokes sweeping life-and-death powers and dispatches propagandists to cover his trail. Information is a crucial weapon in Bush's war. In a February 2006 speech Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld declared that ""information warfare"" will be vital to fighting terrorism. He lashed out at the media for ""an explosion of critical press stories"" that exposed secret U.S. anti-terror programs, including propaganda efforts in Iraq. He declared: ""We are fighting a battle where the survival of our free way of life is at stake and the center of gravity of that struggle is not simply on the battlefield overseas; it's a test of wills, and it will be won or lost with our publics, and with the publics of other nations. We'll need to do all we can to attract supporters to our efforts and to correct the lies that are being told, which so damage our country, and which are repeated and repeated and repeated."" He responded to the images of and charges about American torture of detainees in Guantánamo Bay and Iraq by dismissing them as fabrications. ""The terrorists are trained . . . to lie. They're trained to allege that they've been tortured. They're trained to put out misinformation, and they're very good at it,"" he declared. In a speech a month later, Rumsfeld made clear that he believes the real problem in Iraq is simply the coverage: ""Much of the reporting in the U.S. and abroad has exaggerated the situation . . . Interestingly, all of the exaggerations seem to be on one side . . . The steady stream of errors all seem to be of a nature to inflame the situation and to give heart to the terrorists."" The ""truth"" that Rumsfeld prefers can be found in the articles that the Bush administration is planting in the ""free"" Iraqi media, written by American psychological warfare operatives. IRAQI ARMY DEFEATS TERRORISM blared an October 2005 story in Iraqi newspapers that said, ""The brave warriors of the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) are hard at work stopping al-Qaeda's attacks before they occur."" Another planted article crowed, ""The ISF has quickly developed into a viable fighting force capable of defending the people of Iraq against the cowards who launch their attacks on innocent people."" The latter story was published in the Iraqi press around the time that the United States conceded that no Iraqi battalions were capable of fighting on their own. The audience for this cartoonish propaganda is not just Iraqis: The Bush administration has turned psychological warfare, which by U.S. law can only be targeted at foreign audiences, on Americans. Rumsfeld dismissed the legal prohibitions against using foreign propaganda at home, declaring in February 2006: ""The argument was, of course, that it was taking taxpayers' dollars . . . and propagandizing the American people. Of course, when you speak today, there's no one audience . . . Whatever it is we communicate inevitably is going to be heard by multiple audiences."" Rumsfeld is leaving nothing to chance. A Pentagon briefing for Army Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the top US. commander in Iraq, identifies the ""home audience"" as one of the major targets of American propaganda. The Washington Post reported in April 2006 that U.S. psychological operations soldiers produced a video about atrocities committed by Saddam Hussein that was ""seen on Fox News."" The Bush administration also attempted to hype the role of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian who was killed in Iraq in June 2006. Bush officials used Zarqawi to falsely connect Saddam Hussein with the 9/11 attacks, and to bolster their dubious claim that the Iraqi insurgency was led by al Qaeda-backed foreign fighters. ""Villainize Zarqawi/leverage xenophobia response,"" stated one US. military briefing. As part of this effort, U.S. psy-ops soldiers in 2004 leaked a supposed letter from Zarqawi to the New York Times that boasted of foreigners' role in suicide attacks in Iraq. Other reporters questioned the authenticity of the document that wound up in a widely cited front-page Times story. Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt, the U.S. military's chief spokesman in Iraq in 2004, boasted later, ""The Zarqawi PSYOP program is the most successful information campaign to date."" The ""information war"" Rumsfeld describes is deadly serious. ABC News reported in May 2006 that the government was tracking the phone numbers dialed from major news organizations in an attempt to root out whistle-blowers. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales added that it ""is a possibility"" that journalists will be prosecuted for publishing classified information. The message is clear: The media can either participate in Bush's war, or become a target of it. As Bush administration officials have warned, journalists who do not follow the party line are promoting terrorism. Declaring war on the media is a desperate and risky move. But the corporate media, so compromised and atrophied by its own complicity in promoting the lies of the Bush administration, is woefully unprepared to do battle. If the past is any guide, as the government aims a sword at the heart of our civil liberties and freedoms, the media will provide sporadic resistance at best, and at worst, will help drive the sword home."
5,What Does It Really Mean To Be A Real U.S. Citizen?,politics," It means we have rights.  Rights that many have fought for and given their lives for.  Unfortunately in current America there is, for the most part, two separate classes of citizenship, a bipartisanship if you will.  You have the poor and then you have the wealthy.  Yes, there is a middle class, but the republicans and George Bush are slowly getting rid of this class.  Their reason for this is simple.  The middle class doesn’t like a government that only favors the rich and it has a voice.  The middle class also provides a door for many to become rich.  The rich and wealthy don’t like the poor and don’t like to fraternize outside of their class.  So, needless to say, if the republicans (the rich and wealthy) have their way there will only be two classes left, the poor and the wealthy. Basically, this is how it works.  In America you have a right to great health care if you are rich or have a great employer sponsored plan.  Due to the rising cost of healthcare many employers are limiting or ending these plans for employees.  Of course, at the same time, executives are actually getting more benefits than ever.  So basically, the reality is you have a right to marginal health care.  The great health care George Bush says we have is reserved for the rich. You also have the right to vote.  What you don’t know and the government doesn’t want you to know is that your votes don’t count or matter.  Just look at the close election between George Bush and Al Gore. Al Gore really won, but Jeb Bush, George Bush’s brother and Governor of Florida played around with Florida’s votes and voila George won.  This is even though he had fewer votes.  If you watched Michael Moore’s documentary Farenheit 9/11 you will see that many voters were outraged that their votes were not included.  This was especially so with lower class and primarily black or African Americans.  None were allowed to have a voice or make a formal complaint because they needed a senator to back them and of course none would speak out against Jeb or George Bush.  What happened here is simple, George and Jeb Bush have conspired to great political power.  What they did was dig up dirt and such on every political official that might become a problem and let them know what they have so they would just let this happen.  This is not a true democracy.  It is becoming more like socialist Russia 20 years ago.  How can we liberate Iraq when we are not liberated ourselves? You have the right or responsibility to pay taxes.  Yes, only in America do the rich on average pay only 1% or less of their income in taxes while the middle class and lower class pay on average 35% of their income.  Only the rich can afford powerful tax attorneys and fancy tax havens.  It was recently made known that many of the rich have even set up trusts in childrens names that they don’t have.  Don’t worry, your rich, the government probably won’t catch it and if they do you’ll get off easy.  Its amazing what you can get away with in America if you have money.  Look at O.J. Simpson.  You can literally kill someone and then hide your assets so no one can touch your money.  O.J. claimed he was broke and had no funds.  Right.  Just look at each presidents outgoing list of pardons when they leave office.  All rich and wealthy people looking to escape felonies and similar that would put most Americans behind bars for many years.  If you are rich and are facing something awful, just make a donation or two of $500,000 to a presidents library fund or similar and you’ll be amazed at what you can get away with. As citizens we are not guilty until proven innocent.  Actually, the poor are basically guilty, and the rich will get out of it, regardless.  Actually, the rich don’t even get arrested sometimes.  Just look at Senator Kennedy.  You can drive drunk, hit a concrete barrier, be observed as being drunk by several sworn officers and be driven home.  The rest of us would be given the breathalizer and thrown in the drunk tank to await a court date for either DUI or DWUI (as senator Kennedy claimed it was a medication problem).  He was drunk or under the influence and could have killed someone. There are many more rights that we have or don’t really have and are actually reserved for the rich and wealthy, but I’ll get into those in a later article.  I’m busy now reading an article from the Associated Press on how George Bush’s wife ran a stop sign when she was 17 and killed someone but she was never charged with any crime.  Yes America is a truly great democracy – if you are rich and wealthy"
6,For the Love of Charity! The Economics of Parasitism,politics," Britain’s urban centres have been invaded by ‘Face-to-Face Fundraisers’ over the past few years. Termed ‘chuggers’ (shorthand for ‘charity muggers’) in popular parlance, these brightly-tuniced purveyors of bubbly roadside patter are the ambassadors of a growing economic parasitism within the British charity industry and, like any parasite, will eventually destroy their host if left unchecked. This morning, as I emerged blinking from Chancery Lane station on my way to work, I was confronted by a young lady sporting a nylon tunic emblazoned with the words ‘Every Child’ and a fat clipboard full of Direct Debit forms. As I approached, she began to play out some ridiculous dumb show of desperation worthy of the sad clown in a cut-price circus and entreating myself and the guy walking immediately ahead of me to “Pleeeeeease stop and talk to me!” in pathetic, ‘can-I-have-a-pony-Daddy?’ tones. In response to her transparent and two dimensional plea, I fixed on my best chugger-proof thousand yard stare (they can’t catch your eye if you look through them!) and trundled blithely on. My fellow pedestrian, however, felt no such need for reserve in his response, calling out loudly “there’s a good reason why no-one’s talking to you, love, it’s because you’re a f***ing parasite!” A crass and imbalanced response to a kind-hearted soul trying to make a difference, you might say; a callous dismissal of the efforts of a good, honest individual to make a difference to the cruel world we live in? Not so, say I! Let us take a moment to examine the economics of this new, self-made industry sector and see if there might actually be some mileage in this young man’s claim. Some years ago, whilst I was still at university supplementing my student by loan working in a bar up to five nights a week and living in a shared house, one of my then housemates came home announcing that she had found ‘an amazing job’ which allowed her to work just one day a week and bring home more money than my five bar shifts used to earn. Intrigued, I asked for more details of this wonder job and sat back as my housemate launched into a breathless account of how she and her fearless new colleagues were out to save the world. “Firstly, she gasped, in a froth of self-congratulatory altruism, “the best thing about the job is that it’s working for charity!” So far, so good I thought; charity is good. “Basically, you go out with a team of people and you talk to people in the street and you ask them to sign up to donate money for your charity.” “Which charity is this?” I asked. “Oh, it could be a different charity every week, we work through an agency” she replied. At this point, alarm bells began to ring. To cut a long story short, it transpired that my housemate was being paid around £9.50 per hour to stand in the street, harassing the general public into surrendering their direct debit details and donate to charity making, over a ten hour shift a daily total of £95, which was a pretty damn good take home for a days work for a 20 year old student. Add to that the fact that employment agencies of any sort levy a charge on top of this daily wage to the employer, in this case the charity, which can easily be equal to or even in excess of the actual wages paid to the employee. Lets be generous in this case and assume that the agency in question charges 30% on top of wage charges. That leaves a daily cost to the charity in question of £123.50. After a rushed mental calculation, I exclaimed to my housemate “wow, you must have to work really hard to pay for yourself; how many are you expected to sign up in a day?” “One” she replied, “at least while we’re new to the job, later on you’re expected to be better at it, the really good ones get four or five in a day!”. Four and five in a day sounds like a pretty low rate considering the cost; “how much are these four or five people donating?”; “about £3.50 a month on average”. I was gobsmacked! I couldn’t help it, the calculator came out. “I hate to piss on your parade,” I said, five minutes later “but at one signee per day for £3.50 a month, you’d need to work for 35 days straight, or seven full working weeks to bring in enough revenue from initial payments to pay your wages for a single day. To put it another way, the one person that you sign up today has to maintain this direct debit for just shy of three years before what you did today becomes profitable for the charity that hired you. I fail to see how this is a good thing you are doing.” Two days later, my housemate returns from a second shift ‘chugging’, “we are raising awareness” she says, “increasing the public brand visibility of the charities we work for”. Sure you are, you’re raising my awareness of the fact that people in nylon tunics are to be avoided; you’re raising my awareness of the depths to which unscrupulous agencies and cash strapped students will stoop; you’re raising my awareness of exactly how much voluntarily donated cash intended for charity use gets siphoned off into the pockets of middlemen and smooth talkers. I fail to see how this is a good thing! If you really want to donate to a charity, do it via their website."
7,Nuclear Terrorism,politics," The major obstacle to nuclear terrorism is not obtaining the weapon.  It is obtaining the terrorist group.    A single terrorist fired the weapon that ignited World War 1.  When the Archduke Ferdinand died, Europe erupted into a war, which resulted in the deaths of millions.  Not since then has a single individual or small group been able to commit an act that has caused such devastation. Until a few years ago, the repeat of such an act would seem unlikely. Today, a terrorist act resulting in millions of deaths is increasingly likely.  A single nuclear weapon in the hands of a well-funded, technically able, and properly motivated individual could result in upwards of millions of deaths.  The act that started World War I, the assassination of the Archduke was committed by the Black Hand, which was sponsored by Serbia.  The gunman, Gavrilo Princip, was captured.  Serbia was destroyed in retribution.  While the assassination was successful, the consequences greatly outweighed the benefits.  Traditional terrorist organizations have had one or more limitations, which prevented them from committing acts or large-scale terror: retribution or loss of support.    Retribution is the limiting factor for state-sponsored and economic-based terrorist groups.  State sponsored terrorist groups have to temper their attacks, unless their parent-state faces the retribution as in the example of the Black Hand and Serbia.  Irani-sponsored Hezbollah appears to be in an all out war with Israel.  However, they are conducting a series of attacks designed to turn opinion in the Arab-Persian world against the Israeli’s while limiting the outrage in the Western media.  By firing rockets at Israel inside Lebanon, the Israeli’s are unable to defend against the missiles.  They are forced to invade Lebanon and destroy the missiles or create a buffer zone in Lebanon that exceeds the range of the missiles.  If Iran were unafraid of Western retribution, Hezbollah would take a more direct approach when attacking Israel.  However, right now they are more interested in the pictures of Lebanese civilian casualties killed by invading Israeli’s for public opinion purposes, than they are doing real damage to Israel. Economic-based terrorist groups such as the narco-terrorists of Columbia only want to commit enough violence to ensure their business.  They want to avoid incurring the wrath of a state.  The best example of this was the eradication of the Medellin Drug Cartel by the combined forces of the United States and Columbia.  It must be noted that since the Medellin Drug Cartel was destroyed dozens of more subtle organizations have risen to take its place.  Ethnic or religious organizations such as the Irish Republican Army (IRA), Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), or the Basque Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA) tempered their attacks after September 11 so as to not lose the support of their backers.  Any of these groups had the expertise to perform a large-scale attack such as the September 11th attacks.  However, an attack of that size would have resulted in severe retributions against their affiliated ethnic or religious groups.  The resulting hardships - would turn these groups against the terrorists.  An example is current battle between Palestine and Israel.  During the Infatada, Palestinian nationalism soared.  Israel was with suicide bombers and popular opposition rallies.  Israel counter-attacked effectively by building a protective wall which forced Palestinians to pass through security checkpoints.  While this was intended to prevent bombers from sneaking through, it was most effective as an economic threat against the Palestinians who rely on Israel for work. Another effect from a September 11th size attack is that victims would not be guaranteed to be from the target group.  An attack of that magnitude by the IRA in England would likely kill many Irishman in addition to the English. Once again this would cost popular support without any recognizable trade-off.  The success of the September 11th attacks can only make large scale attacks by similar groups more likely.  The United States suffered several thousands of deaths at the hands of a small number of poorly armed terrorists.  Years later the United States and its allies have been unable to enact proper retribution against the leaders of the Al Qaeda Terrorist group. This is because Al Qaeda lacks a single national affiliation.  Utilizing terrorists recruited from neighborhoods throughout the Arab world, Al Qaeda has an inexhaustible supply of soldiers.  These soldiers come from various countries including those allied to the United States such as Saudi Arabia. This denies the United States an easy target for retribution. Like the average Al Qaeda terrorist, the organization's leadership could easily be replaced. The group is well financed and led by a single individual - Osama Bin Laden.  Possessing the organizations largest source of financing and being the most recognizable leader, Osama Bin Laden is the only leader of any true value. Killing him would destroy the organization but not the model.  All other acts of retribution against Al Qaeda are meaningless.  Lacking a single national identity and recruiting its soldiers from several different countries including our allies prevents the target nations from taking the simplest precautionary measures.  The terrorists who were involved in the September 11th attacks were mostly Saudi citizens.  Knowing this a logical precautionary measure would be to place tighter controls on immigration of Saudi citizens.  However, if we did this, our ally Saudi Arabia would be deeply offended.  Another logical step would be to freeze Saudi assets which are just as unlikely.  Governments can not be held accountable for actions performed by the citizens which are contrary to the governments policies. The Al Qaeda terrorist is a religious fanatic.  He or she is ready to give up their lives for their cause as has been evidenced in the September 11th attacks and countless others.  This type of fanaticism combined with virtual immunity from retribution is a combination that makes nuclear terrorism possible.  Add to this combination billions of dollars of Osama Bin Laden’s personal wealth and a nuclear terrorist event becomes probable.  In terrorism, success breeds imitators.  While Al Qaeda will only continue to exist as long as Osama Bin Laden is alive or free, other groups will take its place.  Seeing that a target country could not strike back against a stateless terrorist group will breed imitators.  Without any deterrence, what is to prevent Al Qaeda from performing a nuclear terrorist attack?  More horrifying, once that genie has been let out of the bottle, what is to prevent other groups from repeating the act?"
8,Gas Prices To Come Down Unless George Bush And Big Oil Intervene,politics," The average price of gasoline has now reached an all time high in the United States at $3.03 per gallon.  Higher even than in the Hurricane Katrina aftermath.  The recent cease fire and UN agreement between Israel, Lebanon, and the Hizbollah and the recent downgrading of the years predicted hurricanes and gulf coast storms have reduced the risk to the oil industry.  There are no foreseen major disruptions or implications to the oil supply in the near future so experts are saying the price of crude oil on the world market should be seeing a large drop over the next few weeks.   That’s not to say that George Bush won’t create something again to help his Big Oil friends and campaign contributors. Over the last few months Americans have been shelling out upwards of $3 per gallon on average and equipped with a stalled and weakening economy this really hits the middle and lower class in the pocket books.  To weather the storm, savings have been ravaged and Americans are saving less and carrying more debt than ever.  90 percent of Americans carry debt and the average credit card debt is now well over $10,000.  This is in part due to George Bush and his republican view that the middle class needs to disappear. George Bush has passed laws and paved the way for Big Oil to have its biggest paydays ever.  Exxon Mobil and other oil and energy companies are reeling in record profits this year at the expense of the average American.  George Bush and the rich don’t feel the squeeze as the middle class does.  They use their creative tax write offs, accountants and tax lawyers to whittle away their taxable income to around or below 1 percent on average for the rich and wealthy.  The middle class, on the other hand, pays an average 0f 30 to 35 percent of their income in taxes.  Is this fair, absolutely not, but since the rich aren’t paying their share of taxes it has to come from somewhere. Regardless, right now there are no soon foreseen oil commerce problems and so the price of oil and therefore gas at the pumps should be dropping and the American consumer should be seeing a little relief.  Just don’t tell George Bush about this or he, Big Oil and his Saudi Friends will find a way to bring the price back up.  I don’t see why the government can’t take over the oil industry like they did with USPS, the United States Postal Service and mail delivery.  USPS is one of the best run industries in the U.S. and it is still the cheapest method for mail delivery in the states or overseas.  IF USPS ran the oil industry in the U.S. gas would be $1.50 or so per gallon.  USPS doesn’t charge what the world market price is for mail delivery and shipping it charges a fair price and doesn’t make $12 billion in sick profits and $100 million dollar CEO compensation packages.  George Bush could learn a lot from USPS and needs to stop screwing with the middle class and helping out his rich friends."
9,The Arrogant Path To Extinction,politics," If the richer developed Nations don’t help the poorer undeveloped nations on planet earth we are just speeding up the extinction of our species. People from the underdeveloped countries will continue to move legally or illegally to the richer nation seeking a better life, jobs and money to send home to their starving and deprived families. It is always the strongest, bravest and most resourceful that will leave driven by desperation to emigrate looking for a better life. They want the benefits, privileges and life style they envision available in the developed countries. They want what the “have’s “ have. Some succeed in finding jobs but many fail unprepared for adapting to a new culture, and not having qualified  job skills.  Consequently, they often are forced resort to crime either in gangs or individually, or they may become dependant on their adopted countries draining medical and social services and costing the countries millions of Euros,  pounds or dollars. Tax paying citizens of the richer countries resent supporting these interlopers. Those who emigrate leave behind the elderly, women and children and the sick thus diluting their culture and the ability to protect themselves from marauding bands of warriors from neighboring countries as we see this in Africa today. This results in the deprived countries sinking farther and farther into despair and oblivion competing and fighting for fewer and fewer resources. They lack the basic necessities required to sustain life like clean water, food, housing, good soil, access to health care, education, birth control, and immunizations from diseases long controlled in developed countries. They lack infrastructure to develop resources basic to modern progress. Requirements like roads, water, dams, bridges, tools for cultivation, animals for food and so on, are not available to them. These same problems have existed from the beginning of civilization in tribal wars over food, rivers, clean water, and land boundaries, and oil.  Today we see similar problems in the Southwest states of the United States, with illegal immigrants from Mexico and Central and South America risking their lives to get into the US to do any job that will allow then to send money home to their starving families. Similar situations exist with Africans invading Europe; eastern European country citizens moving into Germany, Austria; Asians moving to the United States; Cubans to Florida; Middle Easterners to Detroit, Israel and the Palestinians to name a few. We must learn and fast that the deprivation of any of our fellow humans is a problem for all of us. Our current approach to solving these problems is like ostriches with our heads in the sand. Denial won’t work any longer. Instead putting out fires after they start we need to work on a formula of prevention. We must be more pro-active in helping poorer countries develop their natural resources, build their infrastructures, help them learn cultivation and modern farming methods, create jobs, and educate their people to improve the standard of living and quality of life. Together we can implement actions to save our species.  And together we can construct a more humane civilization. No peoples on earth today should suffer starvation; or die from rampant disease like the pandemic of AIDS in Africa, malaria, and dysentery from drinking dirty infected water. We collectively have the money, knowledge, resources and motivated people to work toward solving this problem. Many volunteer programs worldwide are able and willing to help the United Nation to create jobs, oversee and implement programs to achieve these goals. It is imperative that we look at the BIG picture and set large goals and small achievable baby steps to move forward to raise the standard of living and quality of life for every human being. Education is key to giving everyone the opportunity to unlock and achieve his or her potential. We privileged humans are like children playing in a sandbox, selfishly holding on to our precious toys mostly gained from the hard work of others and given to us as gifts. When we don’t share bullies will take them away from us or two or more will gang up and together take them away with force if necessary and will do so with hatred and resentfulness at our selfishness, feeling no qualms or remorse at their means of our defeat. The fervor at their victory will encourage them to attempt more conflicts, riots and revolutions hoping for more victories. No one will win. We will all loose in the end one-way or the other. We cannot afford to wait any longer, if we don’t act now the human species may not survive. The undeveloped countries are producing the most children and in time they will overrun the developed nations. The world population reached 5 billion in 1987 and just 12 years later it reached 6 billion in 1999. The United States Census Bureau reports that approximately one fifth of all humans that have ever existed in the last six thousand years are alive today. Population issues alone clearly demonstrate this. Population projections indicate that the world population will reach, 7.6 billion by 2020, 8.2 billion by 2030, 8.7 billion by 2040 and 9.1 billion by the year 2050. The greatest increase will in the underdeveloped and developing nations in Africa, Asia, and India and among Hispanics. At the same time the United States and European population has decreased significantly with lower birth rates. On the average the developed nations are losing population, at the rate of 30% with each successive generation. We are on the edge of a crisis living on the top of a sharp razor blade. Slice it one way and we will all survive, slice it another way and we will all die—and take humankind with us. Over population isn’t our only problem but it speeds up and creates other problems like crowding, scarce food production, pollution of air and water sources, global warming and the consequences that go along with climate changes issues like melting ice caps, contamination and destruction of our oceans and forests, green house effect, to name a few.  All are impacted by overpopulation and accelerated by uneducated and uninformed people living and dying at subsistence levels, which can lead to the possible extinction of out species. If you don’t know where your next meal is coming from, worries or care for the earth is the farthest thing on your mind. Basic needs for survival come first. Only when these needs are met can someone focus on higher issues. When bellies are full, food, clean water, and shelter are readily available, then people can go to school, and learn about restoring scarce resources, not polluting, birth control, cleanliness, and preventive health care. Then they can participate in being good stewards of the planet and consequently raising the quality of life for themselves, their children and for all humans. A good place to start could be using Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal programs that brought the United States back from the disastrous great depression of the 1930’s. Two of these programs alone created 10.5 million jobs  The Civilian Conservation Corp (CCC) and with Work Progress Administration  (WPA). The United States is still enjoying the long-range benefits of these forward thinking projects. The construction component of the WPA built 650,000 miles of roads, 125,000 public buildings, 75,000 buildings, 800 airports, the Hoover dam and parks.  The CCC constructed 3,982,000 dams as a form of erosion control, built 141,000 bridges, 44,475 buildings. They devoted full time to soil conservation work on 4 million acres in 31 states, and built park and picnic areas, planted trees for state, municipal and private forests. This program alone put 2.5 million physically fit unmarried young men to work, and sent money home to their families. If we did this 75 years ago why couldn’t it be done today? While these programs were not flawless they were inventive. We could learn from and remedy any mistakes that may have been made then. A second possibility is to take the best of the Marshall Plan implemented from 1948 to 1951 for the reconstruction and rebuilding many European countries after the devastation of World War 11. In just four years it assisted the economic recovery.  Every country included, except Germany grew beyond the pre-war level. Industrial production increased by 35%, agricultural production increased, and poverty and starvation disappeared. With political reforms and under supervision of neutral parties like the United Nations this could solve the illegal immigration problems in the world today. If we did this 60 years ago why couldn’t we do it today? We know how! We are all connected, it is time to recognize this and act to save ourselves, all of us and create a brave new world for our descendants. Human survival depends on our actions today. Our challenge now is not to focus on why not and find all the reasons why it won’t work, but to ask WHY NOT! And go for it."
10,Truths about the Nehru Dynasty,politics," At the very beginning of his book, The Nehru Dynasty, astrologer K.N.Rao mentions the names of Jawaharlal's father and grandfather. Jawaharlal's father was Motilal and Motilal's father was one Gangadhar Nehru. And we all know that Jawaharlal's only daughter was Indira Priyadarshini Nehru; Kamala Nehru was her mother, who died in Switzerland of tuberculosis. She was totally against Indira's proposed marriage with Feroze. Now, who is this Feroze ?  He was the son of the family grocer. The grocer supplied wines, etc. to Anand Bhavan, previously known as Ishrat Manzil,which once belonged to a Muslim lawyer named Mobarak Ali. Motilal Nehru was earlier an employee of Mobarak Ali. Rajiv's father Feroze was Feroze Khan before he married Indira, against Kamala Nehru's wishes. One frequently hears that Rajiv Gandhi's grandfather was Pandit Nehru. But then we all know that everyone has two grandfathers, the paternal and the maternal grandfathers. In fact, the paternal grandfather is deemed to be the more important grandfather in most societies. Why is it then no here we find Rajiv Gandhi's paternal grandfather's name ? It appears that the reason is simply this. Rajiv Gandhi's paternal grandfather was a Muslim gentleman from the Junagadh area of Gujarat - Nawab Khan who had married a Parsi woman after converting her to Islam. This is the source where from the myth of Rajiv being a Parsi was derived. Indira was Chased out of the Shantiniketan University by Gurudev Rabindranath himself for misdemeanour, the lonely girl was all by herself, while father Jawaharlal was busy with politics & women; while Kamla Nehru was in hospital. Feroze Khan, the grocer's son was then in England and he was quite sympathetic to Indira. Indira changed her religion, became a Muslim woman and married Feroze Khan in a London mosque. Nehru was not happy; Kamala was on deathbed. The news of this marriage eventually reached Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. Gandhi called Nehru and practically ordered him to ask the young-man to change his name from Khan to Gandhi. It had nothing to do with change of religion, from Islam to Hinduism for instance. It was just a case of a change of name by an affidavit. And so Feroze Khan became Feroze Gandhi. The Father of nation didn't mention this game of his in the famous book, 'My Experiments with Truth'. When Feroze and Indira returned to India, a mock 'Vedic marriage' was instituted for public consumption. On this subject, writes M.O.Mathai (a long time Private Secretary of Nehru)in his renowned (but now suppressed by the GOI) Reminiscences of the Nehru Age on page 94, second paragraph: ""For some inexplicable reason, Nehru allowed the marriage to be performed according to Vedic rites in 1942. An inter-religious and inter-caste marriage under Vedic rites at that time was not valid in law. To be legal, it had to be a civil marriage."" It's a known fact that after Rajiv's birth Indira and Feroze lived separately, but they were not divorced. Feroze used to harass Nehru frequently for money and also interfere in Nehru's political activities. Nehru got fed up and left instructions not to allow him into the Prime Minister's residence Trimurthi Bhavan. Mathai writes that the death of Feroze came as a relief to Nehru and Indira. The death of Feroze in 1960 before he could consolidate his own political forces, is itself a mystery. Feroze had even planned to remarry. Those who try to keep tabs on our leaders in spite of all the suppressions and deliberate misinformation, are aware of the fact that the second son of Indira (or Mrs. Feroze Khan) known as Sanjay Gandhi was not the son of Feroze. He was the son of Mohammad Yunus. Indira's second son as originally named Sanjiv. It rhymed with Rajiv, the elder brother's name. It was changed to Sanjay when he was arrested by the British police in England and his passport impounded, for having stolen a car. Krishna Menon was then India's High Commissioner in London. He got another passport issued with his name changed name to Sanjay. Incidentally, Sanjay's marriage with the Sikh girl Menaka (now they call her Maneka for Indira Gandhi found the name of Lord Indra's court dancer rather offensive!) took place quite surprisingly in Mohammad Yunus' house in New Delhi. And the marriage with Menaka who was a model (She had model for Bombay Dyeing sporting a towel) was not so ordinary either. Sanjay was notorious in his own ways and had many a relationships. When Menaka got pregnant, her father Colonel Anand, threatened Sanjay with dire consequences if he did not marry her daughter. And that did the trick. Sanjay married Menaka. It was widely reported in Delhi at the time that Mohammad Yunus was unhappy at the marriage of Sanjay with Menaka; apparently he had wanted to get him married with a Muslim girl of his choice. And it was Mohammad Yunus who cried the most when Sanjay died in the freak plane accident. In Yunus' book, 'Persons, Passions & Politics' one discovers that baby Sanjay had been circumcised following Islamic custom, although the reason stated was phimosis. It was always believed that Sanjay used to blackmail Indira Gandhi and due to this she used to turn a blind eye when Sanjay Gandhi started to run the country as though it were his personal fiefdom. Was he black mailing her with the secret of who his real father was ? When the news of Sanjay's death reached Indira Gandhi, the first thing she wanted to know was about the bunch of keys which Sanjay had with him. Nehru was no less in his own ways. At least one case is very graphically described by M.O. Mathai in his ""Reminiscences of the Nehru Age"", page 206. Mathai writes: ""In the autumn of 1948 (India became free in 1947 and a great deal of work needed to be done) a young woman from Banaras arrived in NewDelhi as a Sanyasini named Shraddha Mata (an assumed and not a real name). She was a Sanskrit scholar well versed in the ancient Indian scriptures and mythology. People, including MPs, thronged to her to hear her discourses. One day S.D. Upadhyaya, Nehru's old employee, brought a letter in Hindi from Shraddha Mata. Nehru gave her an interview in the PM's house. As she departed, I noticed (Mathai is speaking here) that she was young, and beautiful. Meetings with her became rather frequent, mostly after Nehru finished his work at night. During one of Nehru's visits to Lucknow, Shraddha Mata turned up there, and Upadhyaya brought a letter from her as usual. Nehru sent her the reply; and she visited Nehru late in the night ... Suddenly Shraddha Mata disappeared. In November 1949 a convent in Bangalore sent a decent looking person to Delhi with a bundle of letters. He said that a young woman from northern India arrived at the convent a few months ago and gave birth to a baby boy. She refused to divulge her name or give any particulars about herself. She left the convent as soon as she was well enough to move out but left the child behind. She however forgot to take with her a small cloth bundle in which, among other things, several letters in Hindi were found. The Mother Superior, who was a foreigner, had the letters examined and was told they were from the Prime Minister. The person who brought the letters surrendered them...""I(Mathai) made discreet inquiries repeatedly about the boy but failed to get a clue about his whereabouts. Convents in such matters are extremely tight-lipped and secretive. Had I succeeded in locating the boy, I would have adopted him. He must have grown up as a Catholic Christian blissfully ignorant of who his father was."" Coming back to Rajiv Gandhi, we all know now that he changed his so called Parsi religion to become a Catholic to marry Sania Maino of Turin, Italy. Rajiv became Roberto. His daughter's name is Bianca and son's name is Raul. Quite cleverly the same names are presented to the people of India as Priyanka and Rahul. What is amazing is the extent of our people's ignorance in such matters. The press conference that Rajiv Gandhi gave in London after taking over as prime minister of India was very informative. In this press conference, Rajiv boasted that he was NOT a Hindu but a Parsi. Mind you, speaking of the Parsi religion, he had no Parsi ancestor at all. His grandmother (father's mother) had turned Muslim after, having abandoned the Parsi religion to marry Nawab Khan. It is the western press that waged a blitz of misinformation on behalf of Rajiv. From the New York Times to the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post,the big guns raised Rajiv to heaven. The children's encyclopaedias recorded that Rajiv was a qualified Mechanical Engineer from the revered University of Cambridge. The reality is that in all three years of his tenure at that University Rajiv had not passed a single examination. He had therefore to leave Cambridge without a certificate. Sonia too had the same benevolent treatment. She was stated to be a student in Cambridge. Such a description is calculated to mislead Indians. She was a student in Cambridge all right but not of the University of Cambridge but of one of those fly by night language schools where foreign students come to learn English. Sonia was working as an 'au pair' girl in Cambridge and trying to learn English at the same time. And surprise of surprises, Rajiv was even cremated as per Vedic rites in full view of India's public (it was aired live on doordarshan). This is the Nehru dynasty that quite a few Indians look up at and now an Italian leads a prestigious national party because of just one qualification - being married into the Nehru family. Maneka Gandhi itself is being accepted by the non-Congress parties not because she was a former model or an animal lover, but for her links to the Nehru family. Saying that an Italian should not lead India will amount to narrow mindedness, but if Sania Maino (Sonia) had served India like say Mother Teresa or Annie Besant, i.e. in anyway on her own rights, then all Indians should be proud of her just as how proud we are of Mother Teresa."
11,A Brief History of Flags,politics," In this day and age, the origin of flags is a highly debatable matter even though flags were used as symbols thousands of years ago by ancient cultures. There is a section of people who believe that flags first originated in China, whereas there are others who say that Roman Empire’s “vexillum” was the first true flag. Some people don’t accept “vexillum” as a first true flag because the original standards of Roman legions were not flags. They were symbols like eagle of Augustus Caesar’s Xth. A military unit from Scythia used a dragon as their symbol, but it had a flexible tail which swirled in the wind. Legions took no time in copying this idea and ended up having a flexible standard for themselves which is our modern-day-flag. Flags were also used in the battle field. The primary purpose of the flag was identification of individual leaders. For example: The knights (in Europe), the Samurai (in Japan) and the Generals under the imperial army (in China). Since the time of Christopher Columbus and onwards, it was made customary for ships to carry flags that stated their nationality. It has become a legal requirement now. These flags eventually evolved into the national flags and maritime flags of today. Since there was no means of communication between two ships in the ocean, flags became the preferred means of communications. This resulted in various forms of signals used in Navy today. For example: Alpha, Bravo and so on. At the start of the 17th century, centralized armies completely replaced European knights. This was the time when flags not only became the means of identification of nationalities but also individual military units. The significance of flags was elaborated to new levels. However, these flags were too dangerous for those who carried them and by World War I they were withdrawn from the battlefields. Since then, flags have been used only at ceremonial occasions."
12,Al Gore’s Inconvenient Infomercial: A Movie Review,politics," Who is the chubby, aging baby boomer waddling through airport after empty airport, wearily tugging along his 2-piece luggage roller? Hey, it’s not Michael Moore (again). Why, for heaven’s sake, it’s none other than a bored, disgruntled Al Gore, Jr. – the Man Who Personally Believes He Coulda/Woulda/Shoulda Been King! Well, at least Saturday Night Live believed him. Instead of ruling the Western World with a Green Fist, he’s starred in a new movie persuading us to stop using up so much energy. Meanwhile, Al Gore Jr. cruises about foreign capitals in one gas-guzzling, chauffeured Mercedes after another, pondering one very deep thought after another while solemnly tapping away on his Mac Powerbook. Earth to Al Gore: Actor Steven Seagal already nailed down the slick but glazed ‘poseur look’ about nine movies ago. Is “An Inconvenient Truth” a documentary about Global Warming, or Al Gore’s microphone-grabbing, spotlight-snatching platform to whine about, and revisit, his presidential election loss, six years ago? Is former Veep Gore really hoping to educate film audiences about the very serious dangers of carbon dioxide emissions, greenhouse gases and abrupt climate change, or conniving to create a multi-media white paper for the Democratic Party’s energy agenda? We’re not sure, actually. Perhaps, it is because Al Gore, and the film’s executive producer Davis Guggenheim, were themselves confused as to the direction in which they were heading with this narcissistic political propaganda. C’mon, a former high-profile Vice President of the United States shuffling through airport security like the rest of us hoi polloi? If so, then why didn’t the alarm bells go off? For those who missed it, in one scene Gore wore a belt buckle the size of a small dish, when passing through the airport’s metal detector. And it didn’t screech? Right! Or how about the scene where a pompous Al Gore (sans bodyguards) was hailing a cab in Manhattan, but no one recognized him? Well, perhaps that part was realistic. Who really cares about Al? Was the former #2 man doing a for-the-people inspirational routine, along the lines of “He Walks Among Us,” so that we’d buy his punch line about self-sacrifice at the end of the movie? The man, who at one time claimed to have invented the Internet, more carefully documented his alleged 30-year personal campaign to help bring Global Warming to a screeching halt. Amazingly, he didn’t include footnotes with his film speech. We’re sure Gore was anticipating the “I invented the Internet” jokes and dutifully prepared his track record for audiences. He shamelessly dredged up memories of his old Harvard science professor, Roger Revelle, whom he once called into congressional hearings to have the scientist warn about CO2 emissions and rising water temperatures. How seriously can we take ‘Scientist’ Al Gore? In a Washington Post article (March 19, 2000), Al’s grades and scores were questioned, during the presidential campaign, and the assistant headmaster at Gore’s private school, St. Albans, reportedly “chuckled at (Gore’s) science results.” He had scored so poorly. Gore’s one constant, his glibness, manifests in this quasi-documentary. Mostly it’s a political infomercial, but for whatever reason Gore was so fervently pitching and hyping Al Gore was never made clear. He hasn’t quite grasped how serious the earth’s climactic changes could impact our civilization, other than flicking through multiple photos of receding glaciers and a few other tidbits. Gore mentions we might have 100 million refugees if sea levels rise, as if those many would actually survive. In contrast, Dr. Lovelock, author of “The Revenge of Gaia,” is forecasting the demise of billions of people under the same “earth is melting” scenario. Whom do we believe? We vote Lovelock, not Gore. After all, the politician admits, in a recent Rolling Stone magazine interview, Lovelock has forgotten more science than Gore has ever learned. Whatever gravity the poseur portrayed during his supercilious narration, and in his deep-thinking (but awkward) poses, Gore nullified these moments with clumsy flashbacks to the 2000 presidential campaign. (Well, Gore reportedly did a lot of drugs in college, so we guess he's entitled to his flashbacks.) While he claimed in his movie to have moved on, the man still sounded downright bitter during this pre-campaigning film farce. His movie oozes contempt for the man who defeated him, and offers the same ill will toward anyone distantly related – family, business or otherwise – to the man who is now President of the United States. For those who helped keep him out of the White House or dissed him? He repays his enemies in a way only a screenwriter could: Gore adds his enemies to his movie. Gore’s rapid-fire “subliminal images” are cleverly aimed at Florida and the 2000 presidential campaign. Take that Senator Katherine Harris! Guess which state gets submerged first when the polar ice caps melt? You got it, Florida. Of all the lakes in the world which are drying up, Gore selects Lake Chad. For those who have forgotten, it was the notorious “chads,” which cost Gore the presidency. Darn it Al, will you let it go? It’s been six years, you know. You LOST the election! Film goers should wonder why an ex-tobacco farmer, and erstwhile U.S. presidential candidate (going 0 for 2 on presidential campaigns), has only NOW come out against fossil fuels because of Global Warming. What’s his agenda? To educate the public? If that is the case, then the filmmakers should have focused on the matter at hand – the earth is getting hotter, and we need a solution. Dr. James Lovelock’s mandate is simple: Nuclear energy is the single solution. Listen up, Hillary Clinton – you might have enjoyed Al’s ramblings, and said so in your pretentious New York Press Club speech last May, but where is Gore’s actual solution to the Global Warming crisis? The self-righteous Al Jr. offers no solution in his movie. Even when asked by an audience in China for his solution, Gore spouts non-sequiturs – political rhetoric, but no word of a solution. The movie director deftly cuts away before Al can look even sillier, while we wonder why Al offered no solution. The film shows images of a nuclear reactor, a wind farm and running water. Was the blustering Al or his bewildered movie director hoping the audience would choose a solution for them? At least Ross Perot, in his infomercials, had some solution for the ills then facing America. Al has none. Zippo. Nada. Just join Al’s crusade and start driving a hybrid car. Or did he mean a bicycle? After all, in one scene, Al boasts about the Chinese riding their bicycles and flashes a dated photo showing this. Wake up, Al, last we heard, the Chinese were driving Beemers and Benzes, not bicycles. Bikes are reserved for environmentalist weenies who can’t find a real job. Al seems to be pro-nuclear, but claims there are problems with proliferation and waste disposal. In an interview with Australia’s The Age newspaper, published in November 2005, Gore told the reporter he was not “reflexively against” nuclear energy. Wearing his hat as a fund manager for the Generation Fund, he told the newspaper that investing in uranium mining comes down to sustainability. In another interview with “Grist Magazine’s” David Roberts, published in May of this year, Gore responded to questioning about the nuclear energy renaissance, saying, “ I doubt nuclear power will play a much larger role than it does now.” How’s that for naiveté in the context of dozens of countries having already announced their plans to advance their nuclear energy programs? Perhaps, Gore will begin touting renewables, as Hillary Clinton has done on behalf of lapdog/energy guru Amory Lovins. We asked third-term Wyoming legislator, David R. Miller, who is also president of a U.S. uranium development company, Strathmore Minerals, about the madness over renewables becoming a serious factor for baseload electricity generation. Miller told us, “We were 100 percent renewable 300 years ago, 50 percent renewable 100 years ago and 30 percent renewable 50 years ago. Now, we are less than 10 percent renewable and shrinking fast.” About nuclear energy, Miller added, “It nearly unlimited. We are learning to use better technology to make purer energy to do more for us.” Miller’s rebuttal on Al Gore’s message was emphatic, “Those that preach about saving the earth should practice what they speak, but the loudest voices are those that consume the most.” Miller pointed out, “Only the rich and idle have time to rail against too much consumption. But they want you to stop the consuming, not them.” One could look deeper to better understand Al Gore’s ambiguity toward any solution. For example, is Al Gore’s family still a large shareholder of Occidental Petroleum? After all, his father took a consultancy with a subsidiary of the multi-national oil firm, upon leaving the U.S. Senate in 1970. Just in time to cash in on the oil embargo of 1973, Al Gore’s dad was paid $500,000 per year for his services. Al Gore Sr. also served as a company director. Why was Al Gore’s father on such great terms with Armand Hammer, the founder of Occidental Petroleum? Hammer was a good buddy of Josef Stalin and his Kremlin successors. Hammer’s dad introduced Little Armand to Stalin, who helped him build the Hammer Empire. All this in return for one small favor: Julius Hammer founded the U.S. Communist Party. Have the sins of the father visited the son? For the past thirty or forty years, Al Gore has allegedly received a “mining royalty” check from Occidental Petroleum for zinc ore discovered on the Gore family property. Reportedly, Al has been paid about $20,000 annually for mining rights to the property. But, that’s just chump change. Long before the Buddhist Temple fund-raising fiasco in Los Angeles, Al Gore was involved in dubious political financings. We didn’t look that much more deeply into Al Gore. Truthfully, why bother? Gore’s remorse appears rigged; his acting is pathetic. For example, his sister died of lung cancer, before the family stopped growing tobacco. He makes a really big deal about this in his movie (despite his own alleged chain-smoking habits as a college student). But he failed to mention he continued receiving royalties from his tobacco farm for years after his sister died. Gore also forgot his vivid 1988 presidential election campaign speeches, defending tobacco farmers in the southern United States. Imagine Mr. Clean telling tobacco farmers about how he, himself, tilled the soil with his bare hands and picked dem dar tobacco leaves wit his own fingers! Our research shows Gore continued accepting campaign donations from tobacco companies until at least 1990. Instead of being truthful with his audience, Gore mentioned in passing that the reason he ran for President in 1988 was to give Global Warming some exposure. Hypocrisy or ambivalence? You decide. In his film, Gore claimed to have changed the way he performed his congressional duties after his six-year old son was hit by a car and nearly died. Throughout his movie, Gore uses every personal tragedy to play upon the audience’s heart strings. What does that have to do with Global Warming? Nothing, but it aids and abets an otherwise insincere politician to better sell his purported sincerity concerning abrupt climate change. The message is good; the messenger needs to take up a new hobby. Like unsuccessfully running for president again so he can finally get his just deserves: “Strike Three, you’re outa here!” Why pay good money to get bored out of your skull with this blasé movie? Save the $7 to $10 (or more) on “Al Gore’s Inconvenient Infomercial” by reading the same stuff for no charge whatsoever (and without the deep-thinking, brooding ex-politician who spends nearly all of his 100 minutes preaching in your face). Kevin Bambrough and Eric Sprott wrote a detailed report, covering a great deal, if not more than what the Gore movie attempted to discuss."
13,American Flag History,politics," Every flag has a history of its own and if one delves deep, a fascinating story comes to light. The American flag is no exception. Nobody knows for sure who first designed the Stars and Stripes, though there are some commonly accepted stories about the origin of the flag. According to one school of thought, Congressman Francis Hopkinson was the man who designed the flag, but some historians believe that Betsy Ross, a seamstress from Philadelphia, was the one who designed the American flag. It was not till June 24, 1912, that the proportions of the American national flag came to be prescribed. As a result, flags made before this year show different patterns of the stars and unusual proportions. But mostly, stars were placed in a straight row and had proportions more or less similar to the ones now accepted. Several acts have determined the evolution of the American national flag. According to the First Flag Act, passed in 1777, it was established that the American national flag would comprise thirteen red and white stripes and thirteen white stars against a blue background. In January 1794, it had 15 stars and 15 stripes. In 1818, the flag had 13 stripes and one star for each state. In 1912, President Taft decreed that the stars should be arranged in six horizontal rows of eight each. He also came up with new proportions of the flag. In January 1959, President Eisenhower decided that the stars should be arranged in seven rows of seven stars each, horizontally and vertically. And in August 1959, Eisenhower again made changes – this time, he said that the stars should be in nine rows horizontally and 11 rows vertically. As of today, the flag has 50 stars and 13 stripes."
14,How to Master the Art of Influence – Washington Style,politics," Congressman Patrick Kennedy, Representative of the People of the 1st District of Rhode Island, proved his mastery of influence with the use of a powerful influence strategy just this weekend, after crashing his car into a guard rail near the Capitol building in the very early morning hours. The influencing strategy Patrick Kennedy employed is called ""Self-Disclosure"". The communication act of self-disclosure, in order to be defined as such specifically, according to social scientist Paul Cozby (1973), must contain the following three elements: Personal information about the sender must be contained in the message The sender must communicate the intimate information verbally A specific audience must be the target I would add to this that in order to truly qualify as a strategic influencing technique, self-disclosure must have a firm objective. Examples of objectives for self-disclosure could be to establish rapport, gain sympathy, inspire loyalty, self-validation, moral obligation, self-defense, et cetera. In Congressman Kennedy's case, his decision to disclose highly personal information about himself to a national audience can be traced back to the following objectives: • Self-defense: Rather than wait for the news media and tabloid reporters to ""dig up"" the sensitive information and present it in a sensationalist fashion, Kennedy decided to preempt any negative press, by volunteering the information about his addiction to prescription medication and his ongoing bouts with depression. This would neutralize any notion of a ""cover-up"" and underscore the perception of Kennedy as an honest and ""human"" public servant. • Image management: Research has shown that we perceive people as more positive and attractive when they disclose personal information about themselves in conversations and social interaction. Patrick Kennedy has already indicated that he has no intentions of stepping down as Congressman, so in order to maintain and likely enhance the relationship with his constituents in Rhode Island, it is in his best interest to be seen in a particularly positive light after the embarrassing incident last week. • Social influence: This is another powerful component of this strategy, in that it helps position Patrick Kennedy as a role model to others with similar issues. The message: I have a problem. I'm fessing up to it and I'm immediately going to seek help. The Congressman promptly checked himself into the Mayo clinic over the weekend to start treatment. Others, confronted with addiction issues, by a family member, friend or their own, will likely see Kennedy as a person ""doing the right thing"", feeling sympathetic and positive towards him. • Moral responsibility: Patrick Kennedy not only represents himself, but as an elected official represents the people of the 1st district of Rhode Island in Congress. To them he has a moral obligation to perform his duties to the best of his abilities and in their best interest. His disclosure of the personal issues he's facing as evidenced by the incident of the other night, will show his sincerity and moral fabric to his constituents and again position him as a person who can be trusted to tell the truth even if it is embarrassing and a potential risk to his credibility. The inherent candor of the act of self-disclosure effectively counteracts any loss of credibility the self-discloser may suffer. Patrick Kennedy will likely increase his popularity in the State of Rhode Island, and the nation in general, after his genuine act of self-disclosure over the past few days. Politicians often suffer the wrath of public opinion with their tendency to cover up potentially embarrassing or reputation- damaging information, when a well-timed act of self-disclosure and honesty could improve their public standing and increase the public's faith in their elected officials."
15,Local Government Politics - Rules of Combat,politics," If you expect to be effective in local politics, you have to know the rules and procedures. If you expect to be taken seriously on issues, you can't afford to lose credibility by not knowing the rules and procedures.  A good opponent will know all this information. Don't let them outmaneuver you on procedure because you didn't know the rules of combat. Controversial issues will no doubt have multiple steps that must be followed. Sometimes there will be formal Public Hearings; other times there will be less formal public input opportunities. If you are going to be having an interest in a particular issue, find out what exactly the rules and process will be. Decisions are not made at the Board level. By the time most controversial or big issues reach the governing body the final outcome has been predetermined. The hard work and tough decisions are made at the committee level. It is critical if you expect success on your issue, that you make sure your input is provided at the earliest possible opportunity. That is at the committee level. If you don't know which committee(s) will be reviewing the issue, ask. Someone will be able to tell you. One committee may focus on policy or procedure and another on financing. You need to know the responsibility of every committee that will be reviewing your issue. There may be only one, but find out for sure. If you don't know, what do you do? You ask. Committees at times have set days of the month they meet. Other times they meet on an as needed basis. You can't make up meetings. You need to be there. If you don't know when the meetings will be held, what do you do? How long is this issue going to be discussed and reviewed. Some issues take months. Others move very quickly. The decision makers do have some idea of how long they expect before a final decision is reached. Ask them. That will determine your urgency to plot strategy. You need to learn at least the basics. That is how meetings are conducted. There are procedural methods of amending, delaying or killing motions. Knowing and using these tactics is not cheating. Knowing and using these tactics is playing by the rules. But, if you don't know them, you can't use them. Every game or contest has rules. If you expect to win, you have to know them!  If you don't know the rules, there is only one way to learn. Ask questions."
16,Take Thousands of Bureaucrats and Call me in the Morning,politics," The Avian Flu is the latest cause to inspire Washington to new heights of fiscal foolishness. Using the theory made famous by PT Barnum that ‘a sucker is born every minute’, Washington’s latest scam is to make spending more palatable by wrapping it inside the issue of public safety. The idea is to justify irrational spending with terrorism, pandemic diseases, or a combination of both.  If the taxpayers think they will be safer, they will accept any spending. Under the guise of terrorism protection, we welcomed thousands of new bureaucrats and consultants to provide oversight to our existing agencies.  The only true test of the efficacy of this policy was the Katrina Hurricane relief effort as the Department of Homeland Security had jurisdiction.  Six months after the rescue, people are still homeless, large areas are still an unlivable, and the relief effort itself is widely considered a disaster.  Now Washington is asking us to do the same with the Public Health. Senators Joseph Lieberman and Orin Hatch did exactly that when they proposed their Bio-Shield II legislation. The threat of a large-scale epidemic, also known as a pandemic, is a good excuse to hire thousands of new bureaucrats and payback their political donors. At first glance, the Bio-Shield II legislation sounds logical. In it, the senators propose a new government agency to fund the creation of vaccines in cooperation with the private sector. They also propose a shield from lawsuits for the companies creating the vaccines - so that they could put a best effort into creating vaccines without threat of lawsuits. Upon closer examination, since the National Institute of Health (NIH) already funds private research directed towards the creation of vaccines - why do we need another agency to do the same thing? For example, on March 9th, the Iomai Corporation received an award from NIH for Pandemic Flu Vaccine Research. In fact, other agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) also funds vaccine research and perform functions to help the private sector produce vaccines.  Companies are lining up to accept government help to produce vaccines.  Since vaccines have a limited shelf life – many only remain viable for about one year – these vaccines would have to be produced and disposed of regularly, which would only increase a company’s profits.   This merry-go-round of revenue is made more attractive when one realizes the vaccines will most likely never be used – as was the case with the Smallpox vaccine.   As for the legal shield, any company would love to have the same protection. However, without the protection from lawsuits, companies are still accepting government assistance to develop vaccines. Is this a poorly disguised return on investment to the drug industry by two of the senators? The drug industry has been the leading donors to both senators’ campaigns for years. This year Joe Lieberman received 329,229 from the Healthcare industry while Orin Hatch received $168,900 (from January to March when this article was researched). Creating a new government agency to fund and promote vaccine research and development would require thousands of bureaucrats and supporting consultants. These individuals would be would owe their jobs to Lieberman and Hatch. It is a great way to create a constituency especially if you are planning on running for president. Both Senators are rumored to be running for President in 2008. Even their fellow Senators could not let Bio-Shield II pass through the Senate, other bills just as dangerous have passed. These bills siphon money that could be spent on existing public health programs for programs that add little to the public health efforts. Syndromatic Surveillance is one of the catch phrases, which have been soaking up your tax dollars. The idea is computers will scan medical records to identify symptoms, which may be caused by a bio-terrorism. If this seems like a great idea, it is. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), the U.S. government has been doing this since 1878. The CDC and the Public Health Service (PHS) has been performing this task for decades. As part of the Bio-Terrorism spending carnival, duplicate projects have been set up at Harvard University, the Department of Homeland Security, and other organizations for over $400 million dollars. These are not isolated incidents.  So far 59 Bills from the 109th Congress addressed the Avian Flu while 10 address Anthrax. In October of 2001, two letters were sent through the Brentwood Postal Facility to Washington, D.C.   According to the CDC, over 2000 individuals were potentially exposed to Anthrax.  Twenty-two got sick.  Eleven contracted Cutaneous Anthrax which is seldom life threatening.  Five died. The Anthrax attacks were ineffective in what should have been an optimum site for such an attack.  The Brentwood facility was a closed facility occupied by a large number of individuals who remained in contact with the Anthrax spores for upwards to several days.  The death rate was one quarter of one percent.  Despite this, thousands of U.S. Service men and women were vaccinated against Anthrax and according to Investors.com the U.S. government spent over 1.2 billion was spent on Anthrax Vaccines How serious is the threat of Avian Flu? Since 1997, the World Health Organization has tracked over 100 cases of Avian Flu (Avian Influenza A Flu) in humans. Four different anti-viral drugs are recommended by the Food and Drug Administration to treat the Avian Flu. However, the strains may become resistance to these drugs. Is an outbreak of Avian Flu pending? Who knows?  The reason we were so startled by SARS in 2003 was that we were preparing for a bio-terrorist attack using Smallpox back, which never materialized."
17,Local Government Politics - How to Be Effective?,politics," So, you have an issue with your local government. How can you most effectively convey your message?  Without being able to effectively convey your message not just to the governing body, but your fellow citizens, your job of swaying public opinion and votes your way, is difficult. You need to organize your points. You need to start by deciding what is the one BIG reason for you supporting or opposing an issue. One BIG reason is better than a multitude of small reasons. It is the old KISS theory. Keep it Simple Stupid. Your one BIG reason is how you start and end every discussion of the issue. People can understand one BIG reason. They might be able to remember one BIG reason. They cannot remember a number of little reasons. The one BIG reason should make “your cause” also “their cause.” You must be able to explain why the decision is important to them, and not just to you. If you don't have one BIG reason, you risk the danger of switching your reasons around from one discussion to the next. People will get confused as to your real motives. If you don't have one BIG reason for your position, your job of swaying opinions just got much harder. Finally, if you don't have one BIG reason for your position, why do you have any interest at all? Beyond your one BIG reason, you then must list your smaller concerns in priority. You do this in order to become organized in your position. You must be able to recite your smaller concerns one right after the other. As your issues progresses, some of your concerns on your list may be satisfied. Cross them off the list. Or, maybe new concerns are developed. Add them to the list. Your goal is to have every one of your concerns satisfactory decided in your favor. Realistically that won't happen as compromises almost always have to be made. But, your goal is to win every concern. Along with knowing your side of the issue, you must also know your opponents side of the issue. You should attempt to know their side even better than they do! Only be studying their side of the issue will you be able to develop arguments to counteract their position. If you really wish to be effective in local politics remember these tips. They will help you to become a winning local government activist."
18,Mexican Immigration & US Expatriation: An Irony with a Silver Lining?,politics," It’s been over fifteen years since I learned a profound lesson while in Guanajuato, Mexico with a college semester abroad program.  One day during a discussion with my host family and some of their friends about U.S./Mexico relations, I was asked about the name of my country.  “You are from the United States of what?”  In response I said, “America,” with a bemused expression.  Big mistake.  For the next hour I looked like a deer in headlights.  Headlights from a Mack truck. Any country in North, South, or Central America is considered “America” technically.  Mexicans are Americans and so are Canadians, not to mention Brazilians.  Never thought about it that way?  I hadn’t either.  “We are the United States of Mexico.  We have an identity that is distinct.  You are from the United States of Nothing/Nada!” I have frequently reflected on this idea of being from the United States of Nothing.  There was a special National Geographic issue on Mexico in 1996 and in one of the sections a Mexican woman said something akin to, “I don’t understand it.  Our country lacks nothing.  Why are we so poor?”  It is a compelling question and evidently the nothing they lack is in the U.S.  About 400,000 Mexicans emigrate to the United States every year.  They leave behind precious family and communities for the opportunity to earn a decent living and I know they are constantly wondering, “Why does it have to be this way?” I have since had conversations with U.S.-born citizens who are very disillusioned with life here and they spend as much time as possible in Mexico.  Hundreds of thousands retire there.  One woman recently told me that she feels more at home and at ease in Mexico than anywhere else.  She loves the sense of community, the fact that people talk to each other and walk everywhere, and the vibrancy of life.  She returns home with her illnesses abated and her spirits high, but after a month or so in suburbia she is faced with a returning ennui and suffocating anonymity.  Why do over 15 million U.S. Americans visit Mexico every year?  To relax, unwind, forget, give up, rebirth, tan, drink, dance, revive, and do nothing.  We work more than ever and it shows no signs of slowing down, despite “technological advances.”  Stress is at the root of more problems and illnesses than ever before and a recent study showed that the longer Mexican immigrants are in the U.S. the more their health problems increase.  This could be because only half of their heart is here while the other half is still in Mexico (like many U.S. Americans who are working in a cubicle while their mind has them on a beach in Acapulco).  It’s ironic that they have to become more like us, whether they stay in Mexico or come here, in order to be more economically competitive and we should be more like them to address the chronic health and societal problems caused by compulsive competition. What is to be made of the magnetic forces between the United States of Nothing and Mexico?  Could it be that our citizenry is drawn to the distinct cultures, community identities, and colors in Mexico, while Mexicans come here mainly for the particular form of esoteric nothing known as money?  Money is after all a symbolic exchange with no inherent value.  In an economy based mainly on the exchange of symbols (that are now even less concrete because we hardly even use paper money anymore), is it any wonder that we often feel so anonymous and exchangeable ourselves?  In turn, we often discuss Mexican immigrants as if they are interchangeable hired help automatons whose greatest attribute is that they will do work most U.S. Americans will not touch.   In fact, Mexican immigrants do that work because they have dreams, aspirations, ideas, and values for themselves and their families that if channeled properly can contribute greatly to the strength of the U.S. economy and society.  Mexican immigrants are not unwitting pawns in an international chess game.  Sustainable solutions will not arise unless we engage in organizational, community, state and national conversations that lead to a shared vision. With so many interconnected issues it seems to make sense that rather than marginalizing the Mexican immigrants who are here we should include them as problem solvers.  Mexico is developing macroeconomic stability and will hopefully continue to increase the educational and economic opportunities for citizens across their country.  However, the changes will take time and our interdependence with Mexico will not soon disappear, if it ever will. And it is a viable question to ask if we should pay more attention to what each country offers that people truly value…what reminds us of our worth as human beings, our ability to contribute, and our sense of belonging to something bigger than ourselves.  It’s not an all or nothing game and the United States of America has the potential to overcome the audacity of our country’s name by changing the rules of engagement used toward other Americans from the Western hemisphere."
19,Bhutanese Refugees in Nepal,politics," Between 1989 and 1993 more than 95,000 Lhotshampas (Bhutanese Nepali-speaking Hindus of Nepali origin who live(d) in the southern plains of Bhutan), nearly a sixth of the kingdom's total population of approximately 600,000 have been forced to leave or forcibly evicted from the country by the Bhutanese Government, this has made Bhutan one of the highest per capita refugee generators in the world due to the implementation of the “Driglam Namzha” (Cultural Code of the Ruling Elite) with a ""One Nation, One People"" policy which imposed the language, dress code, and customs of the northern Bhutanese on the entire population. The crackdown on the southern Bhutanese continued as the government began closing schools and hospitals in an attempt to force out those of Nepali origin. Often the countries most overburdened with refugees are already among the poorest in the world. Nepal continues to be ranked as one of the poorest countries in the world in terms of human development yet hosts more than 100,000 Bhutanese and 20,000 Tibetan refugees. Nepals inadequate social and physical infrastructural services are overstrained by such an influx of refugees. There are seven camps with a population of 101,000 refugees, about half of whom are located in Beldangi camp. The camps are situated on the plains of east Nepal, spanning two districts (Jhapa and Morang) which are the most heavily populated in Nepal. To get to the refugee camps, one has to drive on winding dirt roads through fields or forested land for at least half an hour. The forest clears out all of sudden and distinct rows of huts appear in the clearing. It seems as if you have come upon a civilization long hidden from the rest of the world. In the seven camps there are 45 schools, 40,000 pupils and 956 teachers. The student/teacher ratio is an average 40:1 but in reality the classes are much bigger than this as the number of teachers includes headmasters and teacher trainers which are given very few periods, if any at all. A school environment provides more than just basic needs to read and write, but also provides an outlet for children to experience a sense of normality, safety and routine after many years upheaval. Most of the classrooms are temporary structures (often made of a mixture of brick, bamboo and grass) due to the limited life-span of the camps. Many of the lower classes do not have desks and the children are sitting on jute mats which have been manufactured in the camps during the income generating activities initiated by Oxfam. However, all classrooms are provided with a table and chair for the teacher. The blackboards are portable with an easel. Each school has a large open space where assemblies can take place. On structural appearances the schools are identical to many seen in the rural areas of Pokhara and Kathmandu Valley. No land is available to refugees for cultivation yet the vast majority of the refugees come from rural backgrounds. Artificial life in the camps for more than ten years is therefore not preparing the younger generation for a farming life back home in Bhutan. Most of them have not been involved in farming for the past decade and there is a fear that they are losing their knowledge and experience in the area where they will have to make their future livelihoods. Although vocational training programmes and income-generating projects have been initiated, they are not a substitute for the agricultural work to which most of the refugees will return. In contrast, access to medical care, food rations, education and training has resulted in improved conditions for many of the refugees. The Author started the green directory and 5% of turnover goes to charities in Nepal."
20,Local Government Apathy - Alarming Statistics,politics," At every level of government and politics, an informed electorate is needed to understand the  candidates and issues of their community. That sounds pretty basic doesn't it? Citizens cannot make informed decisions before they vote for candidates if they do not know the individuals running for office. Nor, can they make informed judgments on issues, if they are not knowledgeable on the points of discussion and disagreement. With that in mind, a very disturbing news article has been published by USA Today. In that article they report that “local TV stations have nearly given up covering local political races and issues.” It further stated that “just 8% of the local evening newscasts in 11 of the nation's largest TV markets devoted time to local races and issues.” The report which this information comes from was prepared by researchers at the Norman Lear Center at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communications, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Seton Hall University in New Jersey. When we factor into the equation of voter apathy “most people - about 60% - get more of their news from local TV than from any other single source” it is no wonder why we find ourselves in the predicament we are in. Local government voter apathy, running rampant across the country. We also can add into the equation of voter apathy, that in small town, USA there is no local TV coverage whatsoever, because there is no local TV stations. Granted, many issues that local government deal with seem boring. Who cares about storm water runoff? Until it is your property is that inundated with water because of poor planning or design. Who cares about the condition of the Fire Department equipment? Until the high cost of replacing that equipment, prohibits the Fire Department from adequately protecting your property. Who cares if because of budget constraints, the routine maintenance of streets is delayed a year? Until because of that neglect, it is your vehicle that sustains damage attempting to utilize that street. If you talk with almost any local government official, they all recognize and complain that a lack of communication with the public is a problem. Yet, nobody has an answer to it. Public Notices are printed in newspapers and nobody reads them. Public Information Meetings are held on issues of importance and nobody attends. Crazy ideas are proposed and nobody takes them seriously, until after they are implemented. This communication problem has no easy solution. It cannot be solved overnight. It will take baby steps by all concerned to begin to solve the problem. It will take a concerted effort by elected officials, the media and citizens to fight this local government apathy. The “baby step” which citizens can take, is to start attending meetings. Just one meeting to start. Take two hours out of your busy schedule to show your interest and concern. Fight the urge to throw up your hands in despair and claim there is nothing you can do. If citizens started to show a little interest in what is happening in their neighborhood and city, maybe, just maybe, the local media will notice. After they notice, they may decide to start reporting. If they report, maybe more interest will be generated. Or, maybe not. But, it might be worth a try?"

1,"AAA Monkeys - ""See No Evil?""",politics," AAA Monkeys – “See No Evil?” In 1990 the US Federal Government passed the Clean Air Act.  Since the state of Pennsylvania was not in attainment of the standards set, they had to create a program, to be approved by the federal government, in order to avoid stiff penalties.  Part of this program was the Pennsylvania Clean Vehicles Program. The Clean Vehicles Program helps improve air quality since about one third of smog is created by exhaust.  Reducing smog-forming emissions is much cheaper and easier than reducing pollution from business and industry.  Additionally, since state programs are stricter than federal programs they do much more to help air than the federal standard alone. It is increasingly important to pay attention to the quality of the air we breathe.  Over one million Pennsylvanians alone suffer from respiratory problems such as asthma.  Every year more children are put on inhalers, and more and more stay on them throughout adolescence.  Respiratory disease is exacerbated by poor air quality.  The quickest way to correct problems with air quality is to reduce pollution.  AAA, however, is pushing to increase it. A new Flash movie called “The AAA Monkeys” that rips into the popular automobile club AAA for its opposition to the Pennsylvania Clean Vehicles Program was released online today at www.cleanair.org.  The humorous web animation portrays AAA as a group of mischievous monkeys who “See No Evil” when their antics burden people with high gasoline costs, limited consumer choice and dirty air. “AAA needs to stop monkeying around with air quality, gas costs and consumer choice,” said Arthur Stamoulis, Director of Government Affairs for Clean Air Council, the statewide environmental organization that released the Flash presentation.  “The Pennsylvania Clean Vehicles Program will reduce air pollution from cars and trucks, while improving gas mileage and expanding hybrid options available to consumers.  AAA’s opposition to the Clean Vehicles Program is a slap in the face to Pennsylvanians concerned about poor air quality and high gasoline prices.” For the past several months, AAA’s Mid-Atlantic office has engaged in a lobbying and media outreach campaign in support of HB 2141, legislation in the Pennsylvania House that would block implementation of the Clean Vehicles Program.  This legislation has been opposed by Clean Air Council, the American Lung Association, the Pennsylvania Public Health Association, the Pennsylvania Nurses Association, the Pennsylvania PTA, Citizens for Consumer Justice and many others. “Most AAA members sign up for the roadside assistance and other benefits.  If they knew that AAA was lobbying against air quality programs, they would be outraged,” said Stamoulis.  “We hope this animation will help inform AAA members that the auto club is supporting anti-environmental, anti-consumer legislation in their names.” Clean Air Council’s website encourages you to contact AAA and ask them to drop their opposition to the Clean Vehicles Program.  The website also contains facts correcting the misinformation that AAA has spread about the policy.  This information is all on the website, www.cleanair.org  and the animation can be found at www.cleanair.org/AAAMonkeys/"
2,Speaking at Local Government Meetings,politics," Before anything else, preparation is the key to success. Alexander Graham Bell. I have read opinion polls that find most people fear public speaking more than they fear death. This fear obviously plays into the fact that few people appear to speak before their local government boards, commissions and committees. So, what is a person to do when they believe they have something important to say to their local government? You prepare, if you wish to be successful. That can be done in one of two ways. Send the letter to each of the members of the board or committee you wish to convey your message. Send this letter if possible, at least a week before the meeting. Include you name and contact information so they may be able to get in touch with you for more information. Do not send an anonymous letter. An anonymous letter will mean nothing and probably be thrown away. You want this letter to arrive early so that they have time to think about what you have to say. You want your message to stand the test of time. If the letter arrives the same day as the meeting, the member does not have much time to digest your opinion. Letters sent in advance of a meeting give the members time to think about your message. By doing this, your message can sometimes be much more effective than waiting to speak until the last minute at the meeting. Write your speech. The complete speech. Word for word, how you want to say, whatever you want to say. Then practice reading the speech. Word for word. You will only have a 3-5 minute speech so you can read and practice your speech many times. As you read and reread the speech you will automatically learn which words and phrases are most important and where the emphasis goes in the speech. Don't be bashful about reading your speech. Believe me, the members of the governing body would much rather have you read your speech than have you “wing it.” Over the years I have seen many citizens appear without a written speech or even notes. They ramble on from point to point with no coherent message. They stumble and stammer not knowing or remembering what exactly they thought they wanted to say. Their message is ignored, because nobody could figure out what their message was. Don't let that happen to you! Prepare for success!"
3,How The Poor Were Lost,politics," When the poor were the majority. The poor in developed countries like the USA and UK are now a minority, though up to maybe the 1950’s or 1960’s they had been a majority. While the poor were a majority their main problems were simply economic poverty and economic exploitation. Government bodies manned by the upper and middle classes understood this sufficiently to be able to handle the poor with some appropriateness, if not always entirely to the poor’s liking. The votes of the poor majority were basically sought with a policy mix of small economic titbits and nationalistic policies. The poor becoming a minority. In the USA by 1950, and the UK by 1960, growing economic prosperity saw the numbers of the poor begin to fall until soon they became a minority. This was helped by more enlightened government policy, and was good for the many that then escaped poverty. Unfortunately the remaining poor as a minority were to face seriously increased problems. There were two main reasons why the modern minority poor in advanced countries faced increasing problems. The first was that the poor soon had more complex, though supposedly helpful, welfare systems applying to them and giving them new problems – and also as a minority they now also hit new minority social exclusion problems. The second main reason the modern poor in advanced countries faced increasing problems was that they became less seen and less understood by the governing upper and middle classes, so their governing became wildly inappropriate and plain wrong. How affluent governments lost their poor. When the poor in developed countries became a minority, democratic political parties began to see their votes as unnecessary, though the poor are a socially significant minority whose misgovernment can seriously undermine society. Majority middle-class issues became prioritised, for example huge anti-tobacco-smoking resources being applied by government and employer bodies but much less on drunkenness, drug-taking or weapon-carrying – pushing many from cigarettes to these. Socially tobacco is a small undesirable but the available alternatives for the poor are really much worse. And some of the health problems of smoking may be due to inhaling cigarette lighter flints rather than inhaling tobacco. All government, charity, employer and other bodies being now run by a middle-class having no real understanding of modern poor minority problems has led to many policies affecting the poor becoming totally inappropriate. And developed countries prioritising middle-class issues and worsening the position of their poor minority are in effect doing a Nero and ‘fiddling while Rome burns’, but their governments basically lost the poor. Re-finding the poor. In developed countries now, those producing policies are educated professionals with little or no experience of the poor today, and they may commonly have correct general theories but often be missing the correct practical detail needed for correct modern policy making for today’s minority poor. They urgently need to find and involve the tiny handful of street-wise professionals who somehow do happen to have substantial real experience of today’s poor themselves – but as yet they are totally unaware that this is needed. Or if modern affluent middle-class government cannot find a way to better govern their poor and other minorities, then perhaps modern democratic government will demand less middle-class officials. Maybe a percentage of politicians should not be elected, but instead be randomly selected from elector lists ?"
4,Local Government - Solving Problems,politics," ""Politics is not the art of the possible. It consists in choosing between the disastrous and the unpalatable.""  John Kenneth Galbraith Oh, how true! When you have a problem in your personal life, does your options for solving that problem come down to the “lesser of two evils?” Probably so. If your options for solving your problem are good or excellent choices, you don't have a problem, you have an opportunity. Same in local government. When local government  has a “problem” the choices they have are the “lesser of two evils.” Or, as Mr. Galbraith would say “between the disastrous and the unpalatable.” It is truly unfortunate that local elected officials do not admit this, when discussing problem issues in public. This dilemma is certainly discussed in private between individuals involved in the decision making process. But, it is rare when a local official publicly states that the problem they are facing has no good solution. The options available consist between “the disastrous and the unpalatable.” On top of that, add into the equation that elected local government officials who are making these decisions, are amateurs. Amateurs make mistakes. Lots of mistakes. So when choosing between those “lesser of two evils” they can often choose the worst of the choices. Run government like a business! How many times have we heard, or maybe even said that? How many businesses do you know, when looking for a new member for their Board of Directors throw the position open to amateurs, with absolutely no experience? Or, do they look for the best, most experienced person they can find to help guide them into the future? Is it any wonder that some local governments bumble along? Is it any wonder that John Q. Public gets disenfranchised with the system? We know that problems aren't going to go away. We also know we aren't going to change the way local elected officials are hired. Is there anything that can help this process along? Yes, there is. The solution involves you, your friends and your neighbors. You may find this solution ""unpalatable."" Involvement. Citizen Involvement. Citizens need to go to meetings. You need to go to meetings. Citizens need to be there to give support and encouragement to these rank amateurs who are attempting to do their best under very difficult conditions. They are doing a job that must be done by someone. Citizens who may have expertise on particular issues need to give their constructive input before the decisions are made ... not after. Local elected officials universally lament the fact that citizens avoid attending meetings where their input is not just invited, but needed. These local officials also acknowledge the fact that they are amateurs and do not have the experience on many issues, that they need to make decisions. Silence by citizens can be deafening, and destructive. Your local government needs you to become involved!"
5,How Can  This  be a Shocker?,politics," Headline, New York Times: ""A Shocker: Partisan thought is unconscious. ""The thought process of a partisan being challenged is almost entirely emotional, and there are flares of pleasure when unwelcome information is rejected."" Benedict Carey,  January 24, 2006. Evidently neuroscientists using MRI scanners now prove what your mother has always known.  Don’t discuss politics or religion at dinner. Remember the arguments you had with her when she'd say, ""Now don't you bring up politics when Uncle Harry's here."" ""But, Mom, I want to know why he thinks the way he does."" ""Don't you dare question him.  He gets all riled up and your father gets into it, too."" ""But if you can't discuss politics you can't have a true democracy, an enlightened exchange of ideas."" ""With Uncle Harry you get lightning, not enlightened.  So don't mention religion either. You hear me?"" Unless you have never witnessed a political demonstration or have never had your views challenged by someone in your family with opposite views, you might be surprised that an MRI scan reveals that partisan thought is unconscious. I was shocked by the word ""shocker"" in the headline.  Who doesn't know the heat of political rhetoric? If we all understood the basic fact that our emotions support our political views, we might be able to exchange viewpoints without shouting. If we all realized that the ""child is father to the man"" and that everything learned in childhood is stored in the subconscious mind and powers our emotions, we could avoid a lot of family dinner friction. Children in the same family perceive different messages from their parents. For example, my father grew up relatively poor on a farm in Massachusetts. He went to college on scholarships and felt socially inferior to his wealthy classmates. Consequently, he worked hard to become relatively wealthy by the time I, his fifth child, was born.  He was a staunch Republican. He retired when I was nine years old and began traveling around the world.  He witnessed extremes of poverty and wealth that disturbed him. Although he still espoused Republican rhetoric after he traveled, he communicated, indirectly, the values that my youngest brother and I associate with the Democratic Party. His first three children still vote Republican. His last two generally vote Demcocratic. Not so strangely, I have never discussed politics with my older siblings.  I do with the youngest of my brothers who most influenced me.  I know exactly where each of my siblings' partisan viewpoints came from. In the last U.S. presidential election the country was divided into red and blue states.  The blue states, predominantly democrats, are heavily populated.  If you grew up in such a state you inhaled its partisan politics as a child.  If you grew up in a red state you inhaled opposite politics and religion, opposite identity within your identity as U.S. citizen. Do you remember other kids at national elections asking, “Are you a Democrat or a Republican?”  It was part of your identity. My daughter is married to an Australian.  She has dual citizenship, as do her two sons.  One son asked, ""What religion am I, Australian?""  She answered.  That's your nationality.  You were baptized Anglican.""  He said, ""I thought I was part American."" Identity.  It's confusing for little kids. And for big kids, too. Do you have a dream of an ideal world? I do. We're in a new century.  Technology changes at exponential rates. Amazing good is possible. We seem to be in a terrible quagmire worldwide now, but the pendulum can swing the other way.  It's due. I think it will when more people understand the power of the subconscious mind and fewer people are shocked by the fact that partisan politics has subconscious roots. Do your family a favor.  Discuss the emotional roots of your political and religious beliefs instead of the beliefs themselves."
6,Local Government Elections - The Great Unopposed,politics," “My Beat” is Northwestern Wisconsin. I monitor the local government units in an eight county area. Mostly, I am concerned with the actions in the areas of land use, planning, zoning, building, economic development and private property rights. It is a rural area. How rural is it, you ask? The eight Wisconsin counties of Ashland, Bayfield, Douglas, Burnett, Sawyer, Washburn, Barron and Rusk encompass 8493 square miles. The total population (2000 census) was 183,382. That works out to 21.60 people per square mile. The total area of the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island is 5890 square miles. Their total population(2000 census) was 4,453,884. That is 756 people per square mile. That is how rural we are. Forty percent larger than the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island combined. With four percent of the population of that area. That's rural. Would you like some more statistics from “My Beat?” Nomination Papers were due a couple of weeks ago. Local elections. A couple hundred or so. All County Board of Supervisors, in all eight counties. Numerous Mayors and City Council Seats. There are 218 seats up in all, in this area. (Not counting School Board and Town races. I have no idea how many more hundred of those there are.) How many of them do you suppose are unopposed? Of the 218 seats, there are 159 of those seats where there is no opposition. The candidate is running unopposed. That is 73% of the seats up for election. Unopposed! Only 59 seats have competition, for a measly 27%. Why? Why, so many unopposed races? It's not the citizens think their local officials are doing a good job. That's for sure. There is enough complaining going on. On a variety of issues. At Coffee Clubs, neighbors talking, whatever. Complaints can always be heard. So, it's not citizen contentment that drives this problem. We have too many races and positions to fill. We don't have enough people per square mile who are really interested in serving on these boards. Let's have larger governmental units and smaller governing boards. Thus, fewer candidates to elect. Let's start some serious consolidation out there! However, talking with my counterparts across the country, I learn this is not a “rural” problem. High density areas have just as much a problem getting opposition as rural areas do. The number of people in a district is irrelevant. So, that's not the problem. We have a national problem, but without being able to identify just exactly why, it is very difficult to come up with solutions. But, we do have a problem. Who can defend a system that produces 73% of races being decided, because the name listed on the ballot was better than “nobody.” How do we start solve a problem, when we can't even get to the root cause of it?"
7,Conflict Management – Parisian Style (part 2),politics," Continued… Toxic Rhetoric Leads to Poisoned Communication Climate A leader’s inability to choose an appropriate communication strategy in a conflict situation can have disastrous consequences, as witnessed by the French riots. Instead of using language that could calm heated attitudes and discourage further violence, Nicolas Sarcozy chose to declare war on the young rioters and challenged them anew by announcing, ""I will fight them in the back alleys of the suburbs!” To no big surprise, the rioting teenagers accepted the challenge and increased their attacks on suburbia with Sarcozy’s rhetoric providing the fuel of hatred and desperation. What lesson can business leaders learn from the French Interior Ministers communication strategy? Irreversible Damage All communication, whether intentional or unintentional, is irreversible. We often wish that we could take something back we’ve said, and rephrase or rethink our language. But that is of course impossible. While retractions, apologies and explanations serve as attempts to “smooth things over”, once a damaging or toxic remark has been uttered, it has already hit its target without any chance of being recovered. The impression is created, the message received. Such is the power of words. Hence the value of the old saying, “think before you speak.” While most of us do not carry the burden of running a country, important communication lessons can be extracted from the leaders that are directly involved in France’s unrest. Lessons in Conflict Conflict is a part of life, as it represents a struggle to have one’s needs and goals met. This is instinctive for most humans and whenever we face a barrier in our quest to have our needs met, we have certain options. Submit to the circumstances and suffer silently; speak up, assert ourselves and argue for our position; or take action to change our situation and fight for what we believe in. The worst strategy in any conflict situation is to insult your opponents, tell them they are wrong and promise to squash them. To try and press a lid onto a boiling pot of water brings about predictable results every time. It’s the same with communication during conflict. Rather than applying counter-pressure, smart leaders seek to release tension and de-escalate conflict by adopting a collaborative communication style, focusing on facts while diverting the focus from often heightened emotions. In the case of the French riots, Interior Minister Sarcozy should have immediately addressed the rioting youths by acknowledging their frustrations and letting them know that he understands their pain and struggles. Further, instead of publicly insulting the protesters and labeling them as “scum”, he could have avoided an increase in rioting, by clearly and demonstratively communicating his commitment to promptly launch an investigation into the deaths of the two immigrant teenagers that sparked the rioting. A conciliatory next step in his conflict communication could have been to address the need to evaluate housing, unemployment and infrastructure in impoverished suburban neighborhoods throughout the country. The first and most important step in any conflict situation is to consider and understand where the other side is coming from. That consideration has to be stated as clearly and sincerely as possible. Your opponents, particularly in a potentially explosive situation, have to understand that you are genuinely interested in considering the issues from their perspective. This will aid you tremendously in calming emotions and focusing on resolving conflicting goals when communicating during a crisis. Our Communication Options in Conflict Situations Whenever we are faced with a crisis, it is important that we remember that we have options in the way we respond to the situation. Here are some of the more productive strategies you can use in place of the ones that tend to escalate a conflict rather than contribute to resolving it: • Instead of resorting to personal attacks and insults, focus on making the issues the center of discussion. • Instead of trying to make your point with emotionally laden rhetoric in an already emotionally heated climate, argue with reason and rational thought, sticking to facts and telling the truth. • Instead of focusing on winning your argument at any cost, offer ideas on how both sides can collaborate to find solutions to contentious issues. • Instead of pressuring your opposition, work to persuade them with logic and simple language. • Instead of pushing the other side into a corner with no way out, give them an opportunity to change their position without losing face. • Instead of “digging in your heels” when you argue your point of view, leave open the possibility of genuinely considering an alternative, mutually acceptable, solution. • Instead of thinking and speaking in limitations, adopt an attitude of possibility and collaborative creativity. • Instead of refusing to listen to your opposition’s arguments, show sincere interest and appreciation for their point of view by active listening and asking clarifying questions. Mind Your Language Leaders are always on record. Interior Minister Sarcozy may become painfully aware of this fact, as his counterproductive rhetoric during the riots may come back to haunt him during his effort to replace Jacques Chirac as President of France. As arrogant leadership rhetoric is an unfortunate but pervasive trait suffered by employees and citizens the world over, it is a universal liability leaders of organizations and countries everywhere must guard against. Particularly in a conflict situation, people look to leaders for answers. They look for direction, optimism, hope and comfort in the leader’s words. Thus, when a leader contributes to escalating a conflict with careless rhetoric rather than resolve it, his credibility suffers and people’s faith in his leadership may be irreversibly damaged. To avoid such a fate in my own communication with others, I always think of my dear Mother’s words from childhood: “Watch your language, young man.” And I do."
8,Mistreatment and misgovernment of the poor in developed countries.,politics," Misgoverning the poor. The poor in developed countries like the USA and UK, honest and dishonest alike, are handled only by the non-street-wise middle class who run government departments and other bodies - ensuring that the poor are generally badly mistreated and misgoverned. Of course the poor in developed countries are a minority so that democratic political parties may easily see their votes as unneccessary, yet the poor are a socially significant minority whose misgovernment can seriously undermine society. Mishousing the poor. Often the poor are housed badly as when new social housing is produced in areas of severe affordable housing shortage like London, it is often produced in the form of very big estates with hundreds or even thousands of rented homes - generally with a view to hopefully making some scale cost savings, although that does not always result. Such big social housing renting estates easily incline to being tenanted badly and managed badly. Like private slums (and they do tend to become social housing slums over time), they often concentrate problem households including criminals in excluded sub-societies. The large numbers of children and youths brought together will tend to forming gangs that may be a mere nuisance or become more seriously criminal. Of course these problems are not confined only to big estates, wherever there are concentrations of poor families then children with little indoors will take to the streets and form street-gang sub-cultures. Developed countries' social exclusion policies, by government and by social housing landlords and other bodies, will hence often need to especially address areas housing large numbers of low-income families. However, those expected to produce such social inclusion policies will generally be educated professionals with little or no experience of living in social exclusion housing, and they may commonly have correct general theories but often be missing the correct practical detail needed. Consultation with less educated low-incomed renters themselves is likely to help only to a limited extent, and those dealing with social exclusion housing need to find the tiny handful of street-wise affordable housing professionals who somehow do happen to have substantial experience of themselves living in and raising a family in such low-income housing. The UK is now making some limited attempts to copy the equally limited US Hope VI scheme to convert big bad estate areas to a mix of the unemployed, low-income earners and the better-off. But this sort of housing inclusion move needs other non-housing inclusion policies to be also addressed at the same time or they are doomed to failure. The poor will have some good ideas on practical solutions, but poor housing areas are also likely to have an occasional housing professional resident. It is undoubtedly preferable if all big new housing developments are tenanted more reasonably, as by including a mix of some affordable rent units, some sale units and some market rent or near market rent units. Existing big social housing renting estates will often need to be made mixed tenure and often also need to have the proportion of unemployed households reduced. The management and policing of poor housing areas is often inappropriate, basically taking them as no-go areas, and it also often attracts inappropriate solutions. Some support heavy police presence and/or continuous CCTV camera use, while others oppose both police presence and CCTV cameras as 'police-state' intrusion. But most tenants in such areas favour a practical position of both being always available but with just sufficient police presence when needed and with CCTV cameras to be used only some of the time as needed. On both police and CCTV cameras, the extremes of 100% and 0% are generally not acceptable - the right balanced uses of both is what is wanted and needed. Tenants can easily feel stuck in a big bad poor housing estate, especially bad for children, if there is a local shortage of affordable housing as in London. A transfer request may get the reply ""in about 30 years time"", and they may be unemployed and/or unskilled. Realistic transfer alternatives really need to be found in these circumstances. And a family with young children having to , or deciding to, stay on a big poor housing estate should be advised to try to avoid their children making friends with other local children, as by not using the local schools. Miseducating the poor. Governments tend to treating older children like adults for school attendance, bad behaviour and crime - but treating them completely as babies for state money. Older children will act adult whatever governments want, and poor children often take over the streets and most schools - and they increasingly teach successfully a pro-crime anti-learning anti-government lifestyle that will threaten democracy if not properly addressed soon. Older children need a much more consistent set of policies from governments, treating secondary school children more like adults for everything and one MUST is some pay for school attendance - if necessary taking it from other family welfare payouts. This will most directly affect poor children especially, but will be better for all. The many unneccessary problems of the honest poor may also include eg having only black-and-white TV with few channels - for which the UK has a mandatory license fee and not buying that brings criminal prosecution (for being poor and not dishonest ?) - and even those having such license are still harassed 'as possible-evaders of the dearer colour TV license'. And eg if the honest poor's children have no passports because they are expensive then they cannot accept an offer of a free foreign holiday. Policing of the poor is often unhelpful to them rearing their children to become honest citizens, with a real need for police to greatly increase catch-rates for the main crimes of their young children - street vandalism and shoplifting. Even a big improvement in one of those would be a great help. Of course street vandalism needs many more police on the streets. And shoplifting needs an extensive police-run shop CCTV system for smaller stores. It is catching child crimes early that needs big improvement, not necessarily jailing children or parents. Attempts at inclusion of the poor. Many non-street-wise middle-class professional 'experts' may claim that poverty is fine for children as long as they have love - but poverty and social exclusion always do some damage and good government should try to help minimise it if possible. But affluent country governments have been increasing legal constraints and sticks to beat poor children and poor parents - as towards making parents smacking their children illegal. It is largely poor parents who smack their children for misbehaving mostly over having no money to buy treats to reward good child behaviour ?! Increasing sticks for poor parents on parenting, looks like a plan to take away all their children and put them in government 'care' - a disaster tried and failed before in many countries ! But middle-class run governments just cannot understand how to best deal with the poor. In developed countries like the USA and UK, the poor and other minorities may effectively be excluded from obtaining reasonable work, education, or holidays etcetera or generally equal opportunity and fair treatment - and at the extreme a society may treat some minorities as social Lepers and/or social or political Scapegoats. This sort of social exclusion harms those concerned, and making them anti-social also harms all of society greatly. But can middle-class run governments ever learn how to best deal with the poor ? Increasing their oppression only fires increasing backlashes, but democratic political parties in affluent countries mostly continue to ignore these major issues. If developed middle-class government cannot find a way to better govern the poor and other minorities, then maybe modern government needs less middle-class officials. Maybe a third of politicians should not be elected, but instead be randomly selected from elector lists - but can any middle-class politician such a constitutional change that might cost them their very profitable job ?"
9,Local Government and Politics - Meetings are the Challenge,politics," There are a couple of problems that exist, which hinder local government from being the best  it can be. One problem that prevents some citizens from attending local government meetings, is the fear of the local elected officials. They are strangers. We don't know them, therefore, we avoid them. Who is a local elected government official? Let me tell you. They are someone who ran for local office, for one reason or another. They give up an enormous amount of time for their “public service.” They truly want to do a good job. They are someone just like you. They have the same family, professional, and money problems that you have. They have good days and they have bad days. Many of them ran un-opposed. The voters decided that they were better than “nobody.” They are not “experts” in the field of local government.  In extremely small units of government they operate without any “professional” expertise. Their options for solving problems is the “lesser of two evils.” If you have two good or excellent choices as solutions, you have an opportunity, not a problem. When you have a problem, your choice for solving it, is the “lesser of two evils.” They are amateurs. As amateurs, they make mistakes. They make lots of mistakes. Everyone in public service makes mistakes. Every good elected official I have ever known, all agree that they would be able to do a better job if more citizens attended meetings and gave their input. Yet, citizens fail to do that, unless and until it is almost too late. A common complaint of local officials is the the “public” does not pay attention to issues until the research is far into the process. Public Information Meetings are held. Nobody shows up. The Press reports on the Public Information Meeting and nobody reads the article. Months of Committee Meetings are held discussing possible options and solutions, and nobody listens. When the issue finally comes to vote, opponents come out of the woodwork claiming the proposal is being “shoved down their throat.” Tempers flare. A second reason some citizens won't go to meetings is the fear of not being “listened” to. There is a big difference between not being listened to and not having local officials agree with you. If you play by the rules of the meeting, speak at the appropriate time and have a well prepared statement, you will be listened to. You will be respected. If you speak appropriately, and the local officials do not agree with you, that does not mean you were not listened to. What it means is they have a difference of opinion with you. There is a big difference between not being listened to, and not agreeing with you. So, here are a four suggestions if you wish to become more politically involved at the local level. Attend some meetings just to learn the rules, procedures and players in the local political game. You do not speak at these meetings. You simply learn by observation. You begin to take away the “fear factor” of not knowing who are local officials. If you believe an issue is important, get involved in the issue at the earliest possible meeting and discussion. The longer you wait to get involved, the less your chance of helping to determine the outcome. When it is time for you to speak on an issue, make sure you know before the meeting, the rules of when to speak, how long you will be allowed to speak and then follow those rules. Write out and PRACTICE your speech. You won't be sorry you did, and neither will the audience who listens to you. These simple suggestions can go a long way in helping you to become more aware and respected at the local political level."
10,Conflict Management - Parisian Style,politics," Conflict Management – Parisian Style   (part 1) The suburbs of Paris are in flames. For the last couple of months civil war like conditions have reigned in the suburbs of the French capital/metropolis. Arson attacks are rampant. Thousands of cars and buses are being set ablaze. Also among the targets were a synagogue, warehouses, auto dealerships, schools and other public institutions. Even members of the local Police and Fire department are being bombarded with crude firebombs, rocks, bottles and other injury-causing items. The wave of violence throughout many of Paris’ suburban areas was rooted in the accidental electrocution-deaths of two North-African teenagers, which prior to getting killed were chased by police. As hundreds of protesters were arrested, French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin summoned his Interior Minister Nicolas Sarcozy, as well as other cabinet members for a crisis conference in the French Capital. But Sarcozy’s emerging conflict-communication style has the rest of the world, including his most ardent supporters, scratching their heads. Fighting Fire with Gasoline The world’s perception of the French government’s handling of this national crisis is one of helplessness and paralysis. Their struggle to find an effective solution is apparent to France’s own citizens as well as a stunned global audience. Add to that the minister of the interior’s inflammatory rhetoric, calling the rioters “scum” on national television that needs to be “cleansed out of the suburbs”.  The resulting effect: The so-labeled “scum” promptly reciprocated with increased violence, rioting and arson attacks. Battle-rhetoric and insults are becoming a signature style for Nicolas Sarcozy, as he’s repeatedly labeled the rioting, mainly Arab and North African, immigrant youths as “scum” and “gangsters”. Predictably, the aggressive tone and inflammatory rhetoric of the 50-year old presidential candidate served only to further ignite the aggression and violence that garnered world-wide attention as arson attacks on vehicles and schools and wide-spread rioting increased night after night in the suburbs around Paris. The frustrations of thousands of young immigrants continued to be fueled by the battle-declarations of Sarcozy, as their actions suggest a battle of the wills with their primary hate-figure in the conservative French Government. “It is our job to eliminate this cancer and rid ourselves of this scum,” rants a defiant Sarcozy. His plan, according to insiders, is to “cleanse” the Parisian suburbs, counting on support from French right-wing voters. Similar to his radical political colleague, Jean Le Pen, Sarcozy is well aware of the emotional push-buttons of the average French citizen, and their attitude towards the “hooligans and rioters” from North Africa. “Hostile rhetoric is often the cause of hostile actions, and hostile actions often escalate into violence, conflict and worse.” UN Secretary General Kofi Anan in a Speech in Salzburg Austria, April 2001 titled “Dialog Among Civilizations” In the meantime, the French government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, is struggling to contain the violence and rioting. Facing relentless onslaught, even law enforcement officials are speaking out against the counter-productive language of Interior Minister Sarcozy. “The situation in the suburbs is at a boiling point, and we’re in the middle of it 24/7, so the last thing we need is to pour gasoline into the fire with comments like ‘cleansing the cities’. It’s inappropriate and counterproductive,” says Francis Masanet, Vice Secretary General of France’s Police Union. Escalating Frustrations While experts, politicians and sociologists debate the likely reasons for the recent ongoing violence and riots, fingering everything from failed integration policies to a rise in poverty and unemployment in the suburbs, particularly among young immigrants, many agree that the interior minister’s aggressive rhetoric and inflammatory language sparked an already simmering fire of unrest, igniting a wave of destruction from thousands of desperate and frustrated young rioters, tainting the French governments image as it struggled to maintain control amid the escalating violence. One Mayor in the French suburb of Rosny-sous-Bois likened the situation to “Guerilla Warfare” and called for calm and collective thinking and acting by citizens and police alike, to start containing the furious rage that has cut a scorching path through many of Paris’ suburban immigrant neighborhoods. To be continued..."
11,Fight Local Government Apathy - Become Involved,politics," The basics of learning how your local governments operate, can be mastered over time by devoting only two hours a year, to that goal. That is the time it would take for you to attend, just one local government meeting a year. Just imagine every citizen over the age of 18 attending one local government meeting a year. What could happen? It is only natural if someone is “watching” you do a job, you will take a little extra care to make sure the job is done properly.  I believe most people would agree with that statement. Following through on that premise, if citizens would take the time to attend local government meetings and “watch”  local government, local officials would take a little extra care to make sure that their job is done properly. However, when left totally unattended by citizens, local government can sometimes become sloppy. (How many citizens do you think ever attended a New Orleans Emergency Management Committee Meeting?) Simplistic? Yes. But, we are talking about local government, the most basic, accessible and simple form of government that we have. If everyone would devote just two hours a year and attend one local government meeting, every local government meeting would have “someone” watching them. The road block to this simplistic cure for apathy through involvement, is “fear.” Fear of the unknown. The unknown of what really happens at these meetings? The unknown of possibly meeting the other people who will be there. The unknown of thinking you may have to “say something.” These fears are very real, for many people. It is this road block, that must be taken down. To alleviate those fears, I propose that when you go to the meetings that you only go to watch, listen and learn. That's it. You need not speak at all. I see four benefits for you to this very simple cure for local government apathy. You will receive better government because by simply watching a meeting, you will prompt local officials to do a more thorough job of research and deliberation. The more research and deliberation, the better the decision that will be made. You will become more respected by local officials because you participated in a meaningful way. You came, you cared, you listened, you learned. What is there not to respect about that? You will have broadened your education by learning more about how your local government works. You will feel more comfortable going to your next meeting ... next year. Where you will learn even more. And so on, and so on, and so on. Just imagine what could happen?"
12,Income Trusts Insider Information,politics," Confessions to CARP and 50 Plus and to all Canadian Seniors: If the Ontario Securities Commission is still searching for the Culprit who leaked to the public, Finance Minister Goodale's ""good news"" information on taxing Income Trusts, they need look no further. I will fess up and take the blame. Rest vindicated CARP and 50 Plus. I believe you. You did nothing wrong. This I understand after reading your article published on the current CARP website: http://www.carp.ca by Judy Cutler and Bill Gleberzon, Directors. Here is the scoop. I listened to his Interview on CKNW with Bill Good, a Vancouver Radio Talk Show Host, a few days ago. It was a surprise but an obvious fact that Warren Kinsella is now a re-baptized Conservative who once backed the Liberals in previous Election Campaigns. Now he is sitting on the side lines in a staunchly conservative riding in North Vancouver, cooling his heels while all the political action swirls around him. What a feeling for a Guy who once was the centre of the Canada Elections Campaign Universe. His were the brains behind Jean Chrétien's and the Liberal's phenomenal Election successes of the recent past. Now his arch-rivals, the nameless Paul Martin's ""Back Room Boys"" (read Darrell Reid?) have ousted Kinsella from power as the ""Eminence Grise"" of the Liberals' Election Campaigns. So he must find a way back into the spotlight. Hence the Income Trust Taxation Tempest in a Teapot. In Vancouver, Kinsella was predicting a minority Conservative win based on dubious logic. Well Warren, I want a share of the Financial Spotlight too. Is there room for both of us in British Columbia? While counselling Consumers to get rid of debt, from my Vancouver offices of Consumer Credit Solutions, I encouraged my Clients to increase their Income by using Income Trusts. Then one of my clients phoned and asked me to sell all Income Trusts because Ottawa was about to tax the Trusts down to Zero. Did I not read the News? That was some time in September. So I started to pay more attention to the Income Trusts and   Dividend Tax Credit debates. A bit of research revealed the recommendations that were coming to me from Mutual Fund Companies and their Money Managers. I shared that information not only with Clients, but in an article published October 10, 2005 by Content Desk.com titled Investing in Canadian Income Trusts.  In fact, some time earlier, in September perhaps, I had created a blog on the subject. Its contents are readily   available as evidence by clicking on this link: http://www.investinginincometrusts.blogspot.com . When you read the contents of that Blog, more so than the published article, you will find out that the analyses, speculations and predictions, shared with those Financial Advisors who keep current with investing information, were that Dividend Tax Credit Rules were the heaviest tax burden likely to come down on income trusts. I do not recall which Mutual Fund Company's Consultant grabbed my attention on this one. But, now that there is Hell to pay, I will take the Blame if no one else will. I did publish these articles and I have been advising those of my Clients who would listen that this is a time to buy into Income Trusts, when Prices were low. Institutions have not yet entered this market in a big way. When they do, some time in the future, prices will shoot upwards. Amid the debate over the safety and risk levels of Income trusts, I have discerned a considerable amount of mis-information. The biggest mistake is the lack of distinction between an investment in a single business organized as an Income Trust and a Mutual Fund organized as an Income Trust. Beginning Investors must seek professional advice before they act on these matters. I just hope, these Advisors understand the difference. I will now share my understanding of the good news that came from the Finance Minister's announcement on the eve of the Election Call. These comments are detailed further in the website: http://www.Mortgage-Freedom.com . But, let me quote the tax benefits of the Dividend tax Credits directly from the Content. Com article: Income you derive from Interest on a Savings Account, for example, is very heavily taxed…. up to 100% in Canada. By comparison, only 50% of Income derived from Capital Gains is reported and taxed. As for the Dividend Income from Canadian Sources a complicated formula gives a tax deduction for the interest you paid as the cost of borrowed money. It also gives you a Tax Credit, the Dividend Tax Credit, which reduces the Taxes you would be required to pay normally. This is the best way to receive Income in Canada. The Canadian tax burden has least impact here. It sits on my conscience that CARP AND 50 Plus, these Innocent Organizations that support and advocate the causes of Canadian Seniors have been blamed for what I may have done. In fact, I would be surprised if many a Mutual Fund Advisor did not do the same. Maybe I was the one who did the wrong and leaked the Finance Minster's Information, not just the day before, not just one week before, but at least one if not two months before the Minister's announcement of his Tax decision on Income Trusts.  In fact, in my article, I did use the terms ""good news"" and  ""Insider Information"". May be I will now receive the visit from the Ontario Securities Commission. May be the RCMP will come knocking on my door. I was hoping I would simply receive a flood of calls from Seniors and other Investors who needed sound advice on where to put their money in order to receive a steady Income from their hard earned savings. Now I see that at least, I must receive the visit from a Priest in Confession because CARP is taking the blame for my action."
13,"The Supreme Court: Past, Present and Future",politics," The United States Supreme Court has been an active focus of politicians, news media, and concerned citizens in recent months. The scrutiny of the Supreme Court Justices erupted when Chief Justice Sandra Day O'Connor retired from her position on the Supreme Court. Debate about who should replace her on the Supreme Court filled daily talk shows, political arenas, and dinner tables. President George W. Bush nominated John G. Roberts and the process of his confirmation is in the works. Recently another Supreme Court position opened as Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist passed away. President George W. Bush will need to appoint another candidate for confirmation. Therefore, the composition of the Supreme Court Justices will be an intense topic of debate for many months to come. Why not become an informed citizen and improve your knowledge about the United States Supreme Court? Perhaps you already listen to news talk radio in your car on the way to work. Try popping in an audio book instead. Go head to head with the news talk radio hosts when you learn more about the political system. For instance, let's say you are interested in learning more about soon-to-be retired justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Try checking out her audio title ""The Majesty of the Law: Reflections of a Supreme Court Justice"". This title will help to give you greater insight into this remarkable lady. To acquire a more thorough background on the United States Supreme Court there are a couple of courses that you'll likely enjoy listening to. The Teaching Company has a great course called ""The History of the Supreme Court"" by Peter Irons. A similar title from the Barnes & Noble Portable Professor series is ""Shaping Justice"". These courses cover some of the landmark cases in our Supreme Court's history and allow you to hear more details of controversial rulings like abortion and free speech. Do you watch ""Meet the Press"" with host Tim Russert? In April of 2005 he had the opportunity to interview Chief Justices Stephen Breyer, Sandra Day O'Connor, and Antonin Scalia and the audio version is available here. Hear their thoughts and experiences as Supreme Court Justices and how the interpretation of the Constitution is integral to their roles. And there are even a couple of Supreme Court-related podcasts you can try listening to. Check out ""The Oyez Supreme Court Podcast"" by Jerry Goldman. This is a bi-weekly discussion of Supreme Court cases from the past and present and insight into future Supreme Court cases is included. Another podcast to try is Evan Schaeffer's ""Legal Underground Podcast"". It's not entirely devoted to the Supreme Court but there are some very relevant episodes. These are great supplements to the audio books listed earlier and to news talk radio. Plunge into the debate by understanding the Supreme Court as well as the Chief Justice nomination process. It's an incredibly important part of our political process and now, thanks to these audio programs, is easier to learn about than ever before."
