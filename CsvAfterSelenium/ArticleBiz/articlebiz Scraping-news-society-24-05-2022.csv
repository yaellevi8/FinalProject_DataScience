1,A Question for Moderate Republicans,news-society," I have been voting for a very long time. Sometimes democrats won and sometimes republicans won. The issues that we voted on then were simple. Republicans voted for fiscal responsibility and lower taxes and democrats voted to improve social conditions for their own families and for the families of all Americans at risk.  Both parties were sincere in their opinions about what was best for the country. America’s strength was about working on compromises to find the best solution that both parties could agree on. Recently the Republican Party has changed. It is now about gaining power and putting into effect their own values and their own opinions on all issues by any means that they can, even when a majority of the voters may not agree with them. Many long-time republicans and also recent moderate republicans are becoming concerned about the direction their party is taking.  Moderate republicans love our democracy just as democrats and independents do, and don’t want to lose the rights we have all fought so hard to win for all of our citizens. They don't really want to vote for the authoritarian leaders their party is backing. They don’t like the campaign of hate and disinformation that their party is using to win at any cost. The question now for more moderate republicans in our country is what will they do with their vote in the coming elections? Moderate republicans are now faced with a difficult decision. If they don’t feel that they can vote either republican or democratic then their only option would be not to vote at all in the next few elections until their party again becomes the strong and valued party that they have always loved and remembered from the past. Will moderate Republicans choose to do the right thing that they feel will save our democracy or will they do the expedient thing and vote with a party that they know is on a wrong and dangerous path? That is the challenging question that many moderate republicans are asking themselves now? The answer to that difficult question has yet to be determined."
2,Fake News,news-society," Fake News We hear a great deal these days about misinformation, disinformation, and fake news.  It is leading some people to question the first amendment guarantee on freedom of expression.  This is understandable; after all, it’s only a small step from hate crimes to hate speech.  The above mentioned terms are difficult to define, however, I can think of some concrete historical examples which may give us some insight into understanding the larger concepts.  Let’s start with Ukraine in the 1930’s. Upton Sinclair, a famous progressive writer in the early part of the 20th Century, visited Russia in the 1920’s.  Upon his return to the United States, he stated, “I have seen the future, and it works.”  Sinclair may have been honestly duped, but Walter Duranty knew better.  Duranty was a writer for the famed New York Times who was sent to Russia in 1922 and stayed until 1936.  What we knew about what was happening in Russia during those years, we got from Duranty.  First, let’s take a look at a few facts.  There was a massive famine in the early 1930’s, mainly in Ukraine but also in Russia itself.  There is general agreement that the horrors were brought on by the policies of communist dictator Joseph Stalin.  Three to four million died of starvation in Ukraine and two to three million in Russia.  It was so bad in Ukraine that cannibalism was a common occurrence.  According to the reporting of Duranty, everything was fine.  He absolutely denied there was any problem whatsoever.  His articles, more or less, maintained that there is nothing to see here.  To make matter worse, he heaped scorn on another reporter who had directly witnessed what was taking place.  To add insult to injury, Duranty received a Pulitzer Prize in 1932 during the height of the famine. Herbert Matthews, another Times reporter, did a Duranty imitation of his own in 1957 when he interviewed guerilla leader Fidel Castro of Cuba.  In his article Matthews portrayed Castro in the best possible light.  He said Castro had a massive army, the majority of the people were on his side, and he was not a communist.  He went so far as to say that Castro was actually an anti-Communist.  After Castro took over Cuba in 1959, Matthews continued to proclaim the noncommunist nature of the new government.  He was still holding to this position into 1960 when Castro himself put an end to the nonsense by coming out of the closet and declaring himself a proud communist. Many people alive today remember the energy crisis of the 1970’s.  It was a time of gas shortages, long lines at the pump, and surging prices.  To conserve energy President Nixon instituted day light savings time the year around (it only lasted one year) and set the speed limit at 55.  President Carter told Americans to shiver in the winter and sweat profusely in the summer.  Looking back, it seems fairly obvious that the problem was instability in the Middle East and government control over the price of oil.  However, we were told by the government, the media, and academia that the world was running out of oil.  I personally bought in to this line of reasoning; it seemed entirely logical.  Demand for oil across the board was through the roof, and there is a limited amount of fossil fuel.  I remember a conversation I had with a friend during the 70’s in which I stated that oil was running out.  She said, “There’s plenty of oil!”  I thought she sounded ignorant, but I was the one who was uninformed.  It’s been almost 50 since that conversation, and we still have plenty of oil.  Regardless of how one feels about climate change and other related issues regarding fossil fuels, we were not running out of oil in the 1970’s. George W. Bush, for whatever reason, was determined to get rid of Saddam Hussein in 2003.  At first the government through Vice President Dick Cheney tried to tie Hussein to Al Qaeda.  That didn’t work; there was simply no evidence.  Then, they fell back on weapons of mass destruction.  Bush and the CIA claimed that Iraq had chemical weapons and was pursuing a nuclear capability.  The intellectual community was convinced, and the rest is history.  There was no investigative reporting on the part of the media as they bought the argument hook, line, and sinker.  Of course, it was all a lie.  The only thing relating to weapons of mass destruction the U. S. Army found when it invaded Iraq was a mobile lab which contained a few high school type solutions and materials. There is and always has been an abundance of fake news.  It’s the public’s job to sort things out, and it usually can.  We most always say, “Hey that sounds silly.”  The problem comes in when the fake news is supported by the media and the government.  When that happens, it can have catastrophic consequences."
3,Politics at Trinity High School,news-society," Politics at Trinity High School Those who know me realize I am a very conservative person politically.  When I attended a teacher In-Service after being hired by Trinity High School in 1985 at age 39, I realized I was entering a liberal environment.  A couple of my new colleagues were talking about how horrible the South African government was.  Shortly afterwards in teacher conferences, the principal (Sr. Stephanie Warren) subjected us to some women’s liberation theories.  Some revolved around spouse abuse and how it was caused by a patriarchal society.  Others concerned language and its sexist nature.  I talked to my dad about these developments, and he advised me to go about my job and keep my mouth shut.  Since I needed the job, I decided to take his advice. In looking back, Sr. Stephanie was in many ways ahead of her time.  In 1985, most of her beliefs were considered off the rails; now, they are the norm.  She was also very much an advocate of the nuclear freeze movement.  The year before, when she was just a teacher, she went to the Trinity Board and asked it to take a stand on this issue.  Tom Isbill, one of the Board members, told her to come back when the Soviet Union no longer posed a threat. Anthony Scola was the assistant principal at Trinity.  Anthony was what one might call an old hippie with an effeminate personality and a keen sense of humor.  He was also an intellectual type who could be very aggressive.  You didn’t want to disagree with Anthony; he could cut you down to size in no time flat.  He was a former priest who in his younger years had opposed the war in Vietnam.  Eventually he left the priesthood and the Catholic Church altogether.  He married a former nun (Margaret) who also left the church, and they both became Quakers.  The simple and pacifist lifestyle of the Brotherhood appealed to their sense of right and wrong. Margaret taught at St. Mary’s, one of the grade schools connected to Trinity.  She was also an old hippie who supposedly went so far as refusing to shave her legs or under her arms.  Originally the Scolas were from Milwaukee, but they wanted to get away from the fast paced urban life.  When they were hired to teach at Trinity and St. Mary’s in Whitesville, Kentucky; the town was too big for them so they settled in Deanefield, a smaller community to the southeast.  Whitesville contains about 600 people while Deanefield has less than 100. I discovered there was a divide between the administrators and clergy of Trinity on the one hand and the parents and students on the others.  In 1988 the Evansville Bosse basketball team, mostly Black, traveled to face a mostly White Heritage Hills team.  There had been a history of bad blood between the two schools.  On their journey, the Bosse team noticed burning crosses along the side of the highway.  Sr. Stephanie and some of her fellow sisters who taught at Trinity expressed horror over the situation.  Later I overheard some Trinity parents laughing and hee-hawing about the same incident. Sr. Stephanie left Trinity after four years as principal.  Despite my disagreement with her ideology, I had no problem with her as a person or a superior.  She gave me a job when I needed one, promoted me to athletic director after just one year, and always treated me with respect.  Several times she went to bat for me in disciplinary and personality clash situations.  Her replacement was Dan Fuller, a well traveled school administrator who came to Trinity from Florida.  At first glance he appeared to be more of the same.  In a document he submitted to the Board explaining his philosophy, he used feminine pronouns to refer to non-gender antecedents. Dan was a unique individual.  The students loved him and he commanded their respect.  They called him ‘Dan the Man.’  From an academic standpoint, he and W. A. Franklin (an Ohio County assistant principal) were the most scholarly and well read administrators with whom I have ever been associated.  However, he gave the students an inordinate amount of freedom, and after one year the teachers were a bit upset.  On her principal evaluation form, one teacher included the statement, “Less ‘Dan the Man’ and more Mr. Fuller.”  Some concerned teachers led by Anthony Scola and Sr. Lorraine Lauter (a religion instructor) tried to have Dan fired.  When the attempt failed, Anthony took a one year sabbatical at the University of Kentucky in order to work on a degree in Spanish. During Dan’s first year, Sr. Dianna Ortiz (a friend of Sr. Lorraine) claimed she was kidnapped, tortured, and raped by America’s allies in Guatemala.  Sr. Lorraine arranged for the school to have a special assembly to address the issue.  She turned the assembly into an America bashing session in which United States foreign policy was depicted as evil and sinister.  I sat in the back, and as the negativity toward the United States became intense, I shook my head in disbelief and disgust.  At one point I looked over at Dan who was sitting across from me, and he was cracking up with laughter at my response.  I interpreted this as meaning I had a friend and ally.  It turned out that I was correct because next year he promoted me to dean of students. Margaret Scola, Anthony’s wife, got involved in a running debate with a grade school colleague over the Gulf War of 1991.  She said we needed to give sanctions more time before going to war.  Jamie Clark, her colleague, challenged her by saying, “I can’t think of a worse way to die than starving.”  When Anthony returned from his sabbatical, Dan saddled him with the worst possible classes; they were chock full of troublemakers.  Anthony challenged the scheduling, but the Board upheld Dan.  A few years later, Anthony and Margaret resigned to become African missionaries.  They were stationed in Sudan, and I feared for their safety.  Nothing bad happened; however, as they both attended a Trinity graduation in the mid-90’s.  Also leaving were Sr. Lorraine and Sr. Theresa Henry (another liberation theology advocate).  With these departures, liberalism at Trinity pretty much ceased to exist. Shortly after his third year began, Dan himself resigned to take a principal’s position in Maine.  As chief disciplinarian I basically had the run of the school for the remainder of the year.  Another teacher (Katie Williams) was appointed interim principal, but she gave me the freedom to operate as I saw fit.  In 1992 John Calhoun was hired as principal.  He was a Ross Perot type of conservative, and we were off to the races. There was a bit of backsliding in 2000 when Mike Clark became principal.  Even though Mike was liberal, he did not make a point of advancing a political agenda.  However, one of his hires as a religion teacher did.  One day I noticed a document in my mailbox which was full of propaganda about how military spending was ruining America.  When I complained to the secretary about such items being placed in our personal spaces, she told me it was done by Bob Nicodemus, the religion instructor.  I then confronted Bob, and we became involved in a ferocious argument.  He defended the propaganda and his actions by comparing it to sending a Christmas card.  The argument went on and on, and we ended up yelling at each other.  Anyway, Bob left after one year, and Mike was gone as principal after two.  Afterwards, we returned to normal. It is appropriate in light of current tendencies that I end with a story about the national anthem.  In 1992 Trinity’s girls’ basketball team was playing in a Christmas Tournament at Brescia University.  As athletic director I was always looking to schedule our teams in such tournaments.  Barry McArdle, a public relations and recruitment specialist at Brescia, organized the event; and we played in it for a couple of years.  Shortly before our first game in the 1992 tournament, Barry came to me and said they would not be playing the national anthem.  Instead, a Brescia student would sing “God Bless America.”  He said, “After all, Larry, the national anthem glorifies violence.”  He then asked if what they were doing was okay with me.  I simply responded, “It’s your tournament!”  A short time later, a young Brescia student came to the scorers’ table visibly upset.  She said Mr. McArdle had just ordered her to sing both “God Bless America” and the national anthem even though she had not practiced the “Star Spangled Banner.”  This was probably my most satisfying point in the political wars at Trinity High School."
4,RESTORATIVE JUSTICE: How They Do It at Stateville Correctional Center,news-society," While the ""tough on crime"" perspective is still a hot issue in debates around the world today, restorative justice is without a doubt an aspect of the criminal justice system. This concept operates under the assumption that while prison cells serve as houses of punishment, they also serve as institutions of constructive corrections with the interest of transformation and growth for law offenders. At present, a trend that prison managements have adopted is to engage their inmates in simple industrial work. While most correctional centers have limited skill training of their inmates to basket-weaving, carving, and the like, the Stateville Correctional Center went as far as providing a barber's license to 15 inmates last November 2015. The Stateville Correctional Center (SCC) is one of the institutions under the Illinois Department of Corrections. It is a maximum security state prison for males. At present, the SCC has an estimate of 3,500 inmates with an annual budget of $32,000 per prisoner. It is also rated as a Level 1 facility, which is the highest designation out of the 8 security level designations. Rightfully so, such recognition seems well deserved after it spearheaded a barber's licensing program. The program was initiated by Illinois Governor Evelyn Sanguinettui, Bobby Mattison, and Director John Baldwin. According to its management, the program is an avenue for the inmates to be licensed while they are still within the walls of the SCC. It aims to prepare them for their reconnection to the outside world. The program also ascertains that landing a job will be easier for them right after they serve their sentence. Lastly, although it can be conceded that these prisoners are not yet free, such program is a very huge step in that direction. The said program also operates under certain mechanics. First, an inmate must undergo 1500 hours of training inside the Stateville Correctional Center before he can be a recipient of a diploma and a barber's license. Second, since most of the inmates in the SCC are still in the process of serving long sentences, the graduates of the said program are going to be assigned to other Illinois correctional centers. Third, the graduates will be barbers for other prisoners in the correctional centers that they will be stationed in. Aside from giving out diplomas, another uplifting gesture that the SCC's management did was to choose some inmates from the graduating class to give speeches during the ceremony. Indeed, family and friends who witnessed the ceremony were touched by the inspiring speeches that the graduates gave. All of the graduates believe that this unique program helps them remember their worth. It makes them believe that they have something to offer, and that they also have skills. While there isn't a universal concurrence yet of how much restorative justice should be in a criminal justice system, it is to be pointed out that the Barbers of Stateville have found a new meaning to prison life. They might still be behind bars but they know that they aren't unproductive. Regardless of whatever it is that composes the CJS, the CJS must never undermine its long term goal to create better citizens. While restorative justice is not yet widely celebrated, it has interests that must always be protected.  Undeniably, the Stateville Correctional Center is in the right path in that direction."
5,How to Survive Solitary Confinement in Prison?,news-society," Surviving prison is hard enough for most people. What more if you are held in solitary confinement for the rest of your prison sentence? Do you have any idea how to survive solitary confinement in prison? Man is a social being. He is made to exist in a community or society where he is expected to connect to others in his surroundings, even when in prison. It can be expected therefore that people who are solitarily confined for a long period will experience a bout of mental problems such as paranoia, anxiety, depression, panic and aggression. Being housed separately from the rest of the prison population, with scarce or no human contact at all except for the guards who silently deliver your meals or take you outside of your cell (to another open but still enclosed area) for that daily one hour respite from confinement is simply torture. People who have experienced solitary confinement for long periods of time can attest that it will mentally affect you, if you are not careful. Being deprived of any human contact in a SHU (Solitary housing unit), which usually does not have windows, just solid wall of cement in all corners, can drive you nuts. Suicide rate amongst these types of prisoners is quite high. Moreover, people who have pre-existing mental conditions may experience debilitating symptoms that may cause them to have difficulties re-entering society after the incarceration. Solitary confinements are used by prison system to penalize offenders. The room or area where you will be confined is very cramped, dark and smelly most of the time. I think it is the prison system’s way of breaking down a convict, to make him think about what he has done in his life or what he had committed that lead him to prison. If you don’t know how to survive solitary confinement in prison, you will end up broken and lost in the end, unable to re-enter society as a rational, sane human being. Here are a few things that will help you on how to survive solitary confinement in prison, should you ever be sent to one. Exercise. Most solitary housing units or rooms are cramped, dark, windowless and small. However, you can still perform some basic exercises to strengthen your muscles and bones. Exercise will also help you attain physical good health and sound mind. Do not let the limited space hinder you from maintaining your physical form. Meditate. Learning how to meditate can help you be at peace with yourself and with the world around you, regardless of your situation and location. When boredom strikes, as it will often do, turn to meditation to help you free your mind of negative thoughts that can lead you to depression, panic and paranoia. You should realize that the power to make a heaven out of hell is in your hands. Read and write. You won’t get to have television or radio when you are in solitary confinement. However, you can ask your friends and relatives to send you some books and magazines to while away the time. If you are not yet into writing, start writing. Jot down your thoughts, feelings and whatever comes to mind during your confinement. It may be the only outlet you will ever have, so make the most out of it. Do some self-enhancing activities such as learning to write books, articles or do things with the use of your hands. You may be able to put these skills later when you re-enter society."
6,How to Survive Prison as a Sex Offender?,news-society," As much as everyone is at risk when in prison, there are certain groups of people who are more in danger than others. Sex offenders, especially child molesters are among the most harmful prisoners due to the nature of their offense. Stories about abuse (physical and verbal) received by these offenders from fellow prisoners abound. That is why if you belong to this group of prisoner, you must know how to survive prison as a sex offender. If you are a convicted child molester and your fellow prisoners know about it, you will probably be the object of physical abuse (being physically knocked around), as well as sexual and verbal abuse. How to survive prison as a sex offender depends on your attitude and how you conduct yourself while being incarcerated. Many prisoners (as much as many of them are hardened convicts who perpetrated various crimes) are not fond of people who molest children and rapes women. Many child molesters and rapists have been sodomized and sexually assaulted by fellow prisoners, to get across their feelings of rage for the crime committed by such offenders; hence, it would be best to lie low and not get on the nerves of your fellow prisoners, and the guards if you don’t want to catch their attention.  Getting unwarranted attention by being loud or snitching, can make fellow prisoners interested in you. They will likely inquire about your crimes and that is not good for you. It is better for others to speculate on your crimes than be really sure about your offense. By keeping to yourself and being respectful of others, you will less likely earn the ire of other prisoners. Even if you hear and see things around you, say nothing of it to others, especially the guards. People will see this as snitching, an act which also belongs to the likes of sexual offenders. Paramount to learning various ways on how to survive prison as a sex offender is having the right attitude, when in prison. Do not shout at people or call them names. Avoid being boisterous as it can only attract negative people. Say “thank you “or “excuse me” when you have to and avoid hanging out with prisoners who are always looking for trouble. Don’t show you are too hard or well-above the rest of the lot. People will hate you for it. This especially holds true if they learn that you are a sex offender. However, learn not to come on as weak either or else people will push you around and pounce on you. Strike a balanced personality that makes people think twice before making a move against you. Choose your friends. You may be amongst convicts but you can find friends whom you can trust, no matter how impossible it may sound. They are still human beings who have done something wrong and who may have already realized their wrongs and is already on their way towards renewing themselves for the better. Be honest to these people whom you call friends and admit your offense. They may feel differently at first but when they can tell that you are truly remorseful about what you have done, they will help protect you from would-be abusers in prison."

8,Discover Easy Ways on How To Survive As A White Guy In Jail,news-society," There are many false assumptions about how to survive as a white guy in jail. These assumptions were formed due to speculations that black men are more dangerous than white guys in jail. The truth is both can be as dangerous as the other. Every person is defined by his personal character, and not by his race, breed, or color. You only have a few things to follow in order to survive in jail. Find A Good Lawyer Every suspect or convict has the right to find his own lawyer. If you did not commit a violent crime, a good lawyer can argue your case so you will most likely end up in a minimum-security prison where the inmates are not as violent. With a good lawyer, you will be able to protect your rights even if you are considered as a criminal in this country. Keep Some Cash Before you go inside the prison, make sure to bring some cash with you. Inside the prison, you can’t always what you need for free. You need to pay for your own essentials. If you want to live as normal as possible, bring some cash with you inside the prison so you can buy some things that you might need during your stay there. On Books Prisons often have their own libraries, so you should try to find out where it is because you will be spending a lot of your time there.

You can easily survive your life in jail if you follow the administration rules and obey the prison staff’s commands.

Be wise in choosing friends. You cannot trust anyone easily. Hang out with people who steer clear of trouble. Don’t be Racist The fastest way for a white man to get seriously hurt in prison is by being racist against the other inmates. Even if you’re just joking, racist remarks can rub people the wrong way. If you to live amicably with the other prisoners, learn to think before you open your mouth. Try your best not to make any enemies while you are inside and you will be just fine."
9,Can a Relationship Survive a Prison Sentence?,news-society," If you are married or in a serious relationship when you get incarcerated, you may have apprehensions whether your relationship can survive the ordeal of being apart for a long time. There have been numerous relationships broken and wrecked apart because one of the two parties is in prison. Reasons for the break-up vary, starting from the fact that maintaining a long distance relationship is hard enough. Complicate that with having to maintain a relationship with a convict, which has an attached stigma in our society. One cannot also discredit the reason why the person is sent to prison. Of course, it can be quite hard to maintain a relationship with someone who is convicted of multiple murders, sexual offense or child molestation. However, the question remains: can a relationship survive a prison sentence? Whether you will agree or not, a relationship can actually survive despite incarceration. Of course, this depends on some factors. For instance, if you have just dated the guy for a month and then he gets incarcerated, you probably won’t last long unless you are so madly in love with each other that you are willing to work on it, despite the situation. On the other hand, couples who had been living together for two to three years can possibly survive for another two years apart. Having already invested time and emotions on the relationship for a long period of time can make a person hold on and wait until the other partner comes back from prison. Of course, it will not be easy but if you are willing to work on it, your relationship will survive whether the sentence requires just a few months to five years in prison. It is important to note that people in relationships who have successfully hurdled the challenges of incarceration did not make it just by doing nothing. How can a relationship survive a prison sentence if one or both parties are not willing to make a go for it? You should realize that it takes two to tango. Patience – The party who is left outside has the means and the time to get involved with another while their partner or spouse is serving prison term. If one does not have the patience to wait for the other, then the relationship will definitely not survive. It takes patience and a lot of imagination to entertain and engage in activities that will enhance yourself, instead of trying to find a replacement (temporary or not) for the incarcerated partner. It could get lonely to be live on your own (especially if you don’t have kids), without a bedmate, someone to do things with or cuddle to when you’re cold. Infidelity or unfaithfulness is often the primary cause of break-up when one is in prison. Determination – It can be hard to have the determination to stay loyal, true, faithful to the person you love when he is spending time away from you in prison. The tenacity to hold on even amidst the toughest of times is something that people in relationships are experts in. If you are the kind of person who quickly surrenders after some minor setbacks and challenges, then you cannot expect to last long in the relationship arena. Forgiveness – Depending on the seriousness of the crime, forgiveness is one of the things that can help people sustain relationships. Can a relationship survive a prison sentence? This is greatly dependent on the parties involve. If they work hard on keeping it and if they really love one another, they will surely hurdle the challenges."
10,How Zelensky left Mariupol Ukraine open for Russia to come in?,news-society," Ukrainian President Zelensky did not protect the citizens of Mariupol from an attack by Russia. The small city has been utterly destroyed, there is nothing left, the footage coming in from the city is absolutely horrific, it is hard to imagine how quickly it was ruined. Why was the city not protected, why were the citizens and local officials in Mariupol so unprepared for Russia to take swift control of the city in Ukraine? The answer is clear, the Ukrainians have a weak leader. Russia made it clear that Mariupol was a crown jewel to them as it is the link of 80% of the trade from Crimea, yet Zelensky was asleep. Zelensky media star The Western media has made President Zelensky a star, he is a social media hero in the United States, who help spread his fame. Zelensky gave the Americans what they love, Hollywood one-liners that spread quick popularity. One of the more memorable lines from the Ukrainian president was with the Russians at his door, when asked by Americans if he needed a plane to flee the country Zelensky answered “I don’t need a ride I need weapons”. With that one-liner Americans decided to turn Zelensky into a star, yet his military skills are less than zero. The Ukrainian president is a former actor who is perfect for the role he is playing for America, yet his act did nothing for the poor citizens of Mariupol. In the defense of Russia, they asked many times for the Ukrainians to lay down weapons so no one would get hurt, yet their pleas fell on deaf ears. Canadian Broadcast Communications visited Mariupol just one week before the Russians entered the country, what they were surprised to find was a city well at ease with no preparations for any attack by Russia. As the citizens were interviewed, it was clear that there was absolutely no urgency. The local hospitals were not preparing for any causalities, the shops were open, and most residents did not believe any Russians were coming into the area. Despite a massive buildup of Russian troops at the entrance to Mariupol the thinking was that nothing was going to happen.  Why were the citizens so at ease? It is because local officials made no preparations for an invasion, Zelensky completely ignored the city, while waiting for Americans to recuse Ukrainians if things got very bad. What made matters worse was the Ukrainian present taunting the Russians with statements of bravery, at one-point Zelensky dared the Russians to come take Mariupol, saying “you will see our faces not our backs”. Zelensky has one plan, and that was to beg America and NATO for money and weapons, the Russians have absolutely destroyed the city, just this week the mayor of Mariupol estimated the loss of citizen life at an extremely large number. The mayor said Monday that the siege has left more than 10,000 civilians dead, their corpses “carpeted through the streets.” Mayor Vadym Boychenko said the death toll in Mariupol alone could surpass 20,000 and gave new details of allegations by Ukrainian officials that Russian forces have brought mobile cremation equipment to dispose of the corpses. Why didn’t Zelensky prepare the good citizens of Mariupol for Russian troops entering the city? He was confident that America would bail him out, yet he failed the citizens of that small city."
11,Explaining Civil Litigation,news-society," Lawyers can build their careers across various fields, from family lawyers to corporate attornies. One common field of practice is civil litigation. Civil litigation attorneys work with cases with no criminal charges or penalties. Instead, civil litigation attorneys work with various kinds of non-criminal legal disputes in which plaintiffs are looking for some sort of compensation or damages. Read on to learn more about what it means to work as a civil litigator! What Kinds of Cases Do Litigators Handle? As mentioned above, civil litigators handle non-criminal legal disputes. This encompasses many different kinds of cases, so most lawyers working in civil litigation have just a couple of areas of expertise. Civil litigation cases might include landlord and tenant disputes, personal injury claims, intellectual property disputes, medical malpractice claims, education law disputes, and more. Unlike in criminal cases, where the prosecution has to present evidence that proves their case beyond a reasonable doubt, civil litigation trials only require convincing evidence. What Skills Do Litigators Need? Civil litigation requires similar skills as other areas of law. Litigators need to have extensive knowledge of local and federal laws related to their area of practice, strong communication skills, negotiation skills, and more. Negotiation can be critical in litigation cases. Many litigation cases never go to trial, so negotiating terms to resolve the issue outside of the courtroom is a crucial skill. What Are the Steps to a Litigation Case? When a client hires a litigator for their case, the case goes through a particular process, just as in any legal procedure. When a potential client wants to pursue civil litigation against another party, their first step is to meet with a litigation attorney to discuss the case. The attorney will help explain the process and evaluate whether or not the client has a strong case. From there, if the client decides to proceed with the case, the attorney will do extensive research to build evidence. This will be followed by both involved parties filing pleadings, essentially explaining their sides of the issue. Once the court has received both pleadings, the case will enter the discovery stage. This is essentially an extension of the research phase, including witness interviews and fact gathering for each side to build their case. The discovery stage usually takes the most time. Once discovery is complete, the case enters pre-trial, which is the last step for many cases. In pre-trial, the attorneys for both the plaintiff and defendant begin negotiations, trying to reach an acceptable settlement outside of court. If an agreement cannot be reached, the trial will go to court, and a judge will decide the matter."
12,There is a problem with Ukraine,news-society," There is a problem with Ukraine There is something going on in Ukraine which is just not as it appears.  Sophistication, complexity, and intrigue are the three best words to describe this beleaguered country.  To begin, there are essentially four main forces that are driving events in the nation.  They all compete with one another and have different agendas but have been drawn together to present a united front. First and foremost are foreign NGO’s and American foreign policy operatives.  Their goal is to make Ukraine a liberal democracy that will eventually achieve integration into NATO and the European Union.  These people are extremely efficient, and they have outflanked their opponents both in Ukraine and the outside world.  They effectively brought about two Revolutions, the Orange (2005) and the Maidan (2014).  At this point in time, they have established the narrative which a vast majority of the American public accept as fact. A few examples are worth noting.  Victoria Nuland was the State Department employee tasked with the overall implementation of American’s Ukraine policy.  During the Maidan Revolution, she was caught on tape organizing a new government and arranging who would be placed in key positions.  Most on the ideological spectrum agree that corruption in Ukraine has been a persistent problem.  Marie Yovanovitch, U. S. Ambassador to Ukraine from 2016-19, told Ukrainian officials who they could and could not investigate for corruption.  Vice President Joe Biden was the point man for Ukraine in the Obama Administration.  He threatened to withhold one billion dollars in aid if Ukraine did not fire a prosecutor who was investigating certain entities.  One important target under investigation was Burisma, a company that employed Biden’s son.  Alexander Vindman was a U. S. military and intelligence figure active in Ukraine.  He was so involved in security arrangements in the country that he was offered a leadership position in its armed forces. Since 2015 the government of Ukraine has been controlled by those who believe in liberal democracy.  They make up force number two and are totally dependent on the first force in order to win support from the outside world.  They’re not much different from the political elites in the United States which is to say they believe in democracy and Capitalism.  They maintain the absolute sovereignty of the people to decide their own fate irrespective of their big and powerful neighbor (Russia), and they make no concessions on territorial integrity.  All this would be fine if the country were in Western Europe, had a historically unified populous and culture, or a border that had a centuries old definition. Force number three is the oligarchs.  This group is made up of wealthy businessmen who, of course, have close ties to the first two.  Their economic power gives them leverage over the political process.  In the United States we call them billionaires.  Like Donald Trump before he was President, they have to hedge their bets by supporting those in positions of political power or those likely to be at some point.  Much of the corruption that is prevalent in Ukraine revolves around the oligarchs.  Because of their intricate connections in the government and among foreign operatives, it is difficult for the legal system to do much about their power, influence, and corruption. The fourth force is made up of fascists or Nazis.  It makes up the shock troops for the other groups.  During the Maidan Revolution, they carried the day by organizing protests, demonstrations, and violence.  They have a military force called the Azov battalion.  The battalion began as a private militia but was later incorporated into the Ukrainian army.  They are the ones who have been on the front lines in fierce fighting against Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine.  It has been reported, I might add, that they have received military training from the United States.  A political party was organized by their leaders after 2015, but it received little to no support from the electorate. One might ask why the fascists would support liberal democracy.  Don’t they have more in common with Moscow than Kiev?  The answer is they can only exist in a democracy.  While democratic leaders deplore their ideology, they allow them to continue for three reasons:  they are beholden to them for support given during the Maidan Revolution, they depend on them to do the heavy fighting in Eastern Ukraine, and the ideal of democracy that all beliefs, however toxic, have the right to be expressed.  This third reason goes back to Voltaire, the great French philosopher, who stated that tolerance extends to those who believe in intolerance.  Putin, on the other hand, would have no tolerance for the Azov adherents.  He would purge them to the last man, and they know it. So what does all this have to do with American politics?  Well, actually, quite a lot!  In 2016 Donald Trump ran for President and began voicing skepticism about America fighting needless and endless wars abroad.  For Ukraine this did not look good.  To make matters worse, he hired Paul Manafort as his campaign director.  Manafort had previously worked in Ukraine as a campaign advisor for the President who was deposed in the Maidan Revolution.  At this point, Alexandra Chalupa enters the story.  Chalupa is the daughter of Ukrainian-American immigrants.  She is referred to by Wikipedia as a pro-Ukrainian activist and has worked at various times for the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign.  She made it her goal to expose Manafort and thus paint the Trump campaign as a tool of Putin and Russia.  In her effort to do this, she worked with the Ukrainian government, the American Embassy in Ukraine, and allies in the United States Congress.  The project achieved some success as Manafort was fired from the Trump campaign when his Ukrainian contacts were publicly revealed. During the 2016 Presidential campaign, the Democratic National Committee’s computer and the emails of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign director, were hacked.  The contents were posted on various news sites including Wikileaks where it gained a widespread audience.  Needless to say, the material was very embarrassing to party leaders, the mainstream media, and Hillary.  Contrary to popular belief, the Committee’s computer server was not turned over to the FBI to determine the origin of the hack.  It was instead analyzed by CrowdStrike, a private cyber security firm.  Crowdstrike, not the intelligence agencies of the U. S. government, concluded that Russia was responsible for the hack. A co-founder and chief officer of CrowdStrike was Dmitri Alperovitch.  Alperovitch is a Russian who came to the United States in 1994 and later became an American citizen.  He has an intense dislike of Vladimir Putin and is a member of the Atlantic Council, a foreign policy think tank and one of the NGO’s referred to in an earlier paragraph.  The Council makes no secret of its intent to promote liberal democracy in Ukraine and make the country a full fledged member of NATO.  One of the Ukrainian oligarchs is a significant donor to the Atlantic Council as is CrowdStrike. As is common knowledge, President Trump’s first impeachment revolved around Ukraine.  Alexander Vindman, Marie Yavonavitch and many career state department employees became star witnesses for the prosecution.  They thought Trump was blackmailing Ukraine into investigating Hunter Biden, Joe Biden’s son who was heavily invested in Burisma (a Ukrainian energy company), and also CrowdStrike.  Trump had apparently bought into the idea promoted by many conservatives that the Democratic server had been relocated to Ukraine.  Putin may have lent credence to this idea as he supposedly told Trump that Ukraine was behind the theories advanced in the Steele Dossier that Russia was actively involved in helping Trump in the campaign of 2016. It is worth noting that Ukraine did start an investigation of Hunter Biden and Burisma after Trump was acquitted of the impeachment charges by the Senate.  After Joe Biden was elected President, however, the inquiry was dropped.  I guess this could all be justified as hedging your bets. Ukraine is now involved in a vicious war with Russia.  Ukraine may be the underdog in this fight, but it has many forces at its disposal.  The Ukrainian army is roughly equal in size to the invading Russian force, it has received drones from the West, the Trump and Biden Administrations have provided it with javelins (anti-tank weapons) and stinger missiles (anti-aircraft weapons), and its forces have received advanced military training from the West.  Whatever one may think about the two countries and its leaders, it is clear that Ukraine has important friends in high places and has decisively won the propaganda battle in the United States.  Public opinion more or less paints Ukraine as saintly and Russia as demonic.  The only other times I have seen such unanimity of opinion were after the Kennedy assassination, during the Watergate scandal, and following the events of 9/11.  And yet, I maintain based on the information presented in this article that there is a problem with Ukraine!"
13,Cyberwar History and Ukraine,news-society," People are much more drawn to images of blown-up building, fires, mushroom clouds, refugees in dire circumstances, color pictures of pain that are better in black and white than they are to explanations of code or even fallout from code if it’s not resulting in something blown-up, fiery, or pictures of people in pain that are better in black and white. That is to say, while we see plenty of stories of ransomware, temporary business disruptions, and credit card & ID fraud, it’s not visceral. It goes by quickly on the page and in our minds. So, whatever happened to the stories we saw before the cyberattack age? When the US Cybercommand was  just a twinkle in some geeky eyes? What happened to the discussion that cyberattacks would engender kinetic responses? Bombs not electrons. Perhaps it was a sense of proportion. Perhaps it was a recognition that we consider that an increasing cyberwar, if responded to with bullets, might just result in use seeing those images of things that would be better in black and white on our own doorstep? Did we back off, or did sanity take hold in the minds of the planners? Let’s look at a little history. Back in 2003, a cyberattack originating from China - and christened, “Titan Rain,” by the US - managed to get access to loads of sensitive government information by compromising the systems of US government contractors and of government systems themselves. Only unclassified information was stolen, but the world woke up to this kind of attack. In 2004, the Joint Chiefs of Staff declared cyberspace an important domain of conflict alongside the air, land, sea, and space domains. No doubt, this was prompted by the reality of Titan Rain. As a culture, we were just starting to think about these things on a national level. In 2007, Estonia experienced a broad cyberattack that included their parliament, banks, and media. It was believed to have originated from Russia, or from Russian actors. NATO’s response was to create the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) in 2007. Now, continents were beginning to wake to the threat and the need to do something about it. The Tailinn Manual The CCDCOE began to develop an extensive study and code about what how international law applies to cyber conflicts and cyberwarfare; these previous acts were beginning to be recognized as acts of war. Calling on legal scholars and legal practitioners that were experienced in cyber issues, the CCDCOE produced Tailinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare in 2012. The Tailinn Manual declared that killing hackers in response to certain cyberattacks was justifiable. Killing hackers?! Meanwhile, other state-sponsored cyberattacks marched their way into the public consciousness. The Stuxnet Worm was developed to sabotage Iran’s nuclear development efforts – in particular, the centrifuges used to enrich uranium gas. It is believed to be the first malware designed to and succeeding in visiting physical destruction on physical equipment. Wired Magazine called it the first digital weapon. It's widely considered that the US and Israel collaborated over a period of 5 years to develop this malware. In 2009, Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, recognizing how important AND vulnerable important computers and networks were (are), directed the creation of USCYBERCOM. It is the unified command for the cyberspace domain in the US and the world. In 2016, the organization described the 2016 espionage ops against the Democratic National Committee while in the midst of a national election “serious business . . . [that] may destroy democracy.” Administration officials at the time considered that cyber weapons were so potentially destructive that they should be unleashed only on the direct orders of the Commander in Chief, like nuclear weapons. I do not know if there is an equivalent “Cyber Football.” Article 51 of the UN Charter allows individual countries to defend themselves and to band together to defend each other. It also allows the same if an armed attack is anticipated and recognizes the right to use force in such a situation. It allows cyberattacks to be considered an armed attack. In 2019, Israel did just this, by conducing airstrikes on a building that they said had Hamas members inside that were planning to launch a cyberattack on Israel. In 2021 the topic was up for noticeable public discussion again. NATO heads of state and government met at NATO’s North Atlantic Council meeting in Brussels and issued a communiqué that ultimately equates cyberattacks with kinetic attacks and leaves the possibility of military action against hackers on the table. Still, what we generally see is that cyberattacks - or anticipated cyberattacks - by states are dealt with by preemptive and after-the-fact punishing cyberattacks. Tit for tat, as it were, and even before the tat. Cyberwar in Action What we have seen in practice in Georgia in 2008, Crimea in 2014 and in Ukraine in 2021 is the “softening up” cyberattack. The attack used to diminish and disable defensive and living systems before a kinetic attack, rather than a kinetic attack in response to a cyberattack. Many said that the 2014-2015 cyberattacks were on a an entirely different – and grander – level than had been seen previously. Several Ukrainian banks and government agencies became inaccessible and malware – using a tool called “HermeticWiper” - was wiping data from hundreds of PCs and servers. But we’ve gotten used to common DDOS attacks, data-wiping and ransomware in recent years on the civilian level. It’s kind of taken for granted that these things are ongoing and all over. The use of cyberwar and kinetic war together has been labeled “hybrid warfare.” And yet, the world seems surprised that Russian cyberattacks on Ukraine in 2021 and 2022have been substantially less severe than anticipated. To be sure, they were and are ongoingly widespread. Hackers caused the Viasat satellites to become inoperative. But that may have affected Russian soldiers and commanders to lose connectivity as well. And said attack has been mitigated somewhat by the Musk’s activation of Starlink Internet satellites over Ukraine. Additionally, Ukrainian modems were zombie-fied by Russian malware, being used as nodes for targeted DDOD attacks within Ukraine. But the ruination from malware that was expected has not really seemed to occur. We haven't seen a cyber-Armageddon. Were they more pr? Were the US and/or the EU pumping up Ukraine’s cyber defenses or attacking the offensive cyber capabilities of Russia? The newspapers wonder about this and government sources overtly express surprise and confusion that there isn’t more cyber damage. I would be willing to wager that they know more about this than they are letting on. But then, isn’t that almost always the case? The coming days and weeks will tell us more about cyberwar in Ukraine. It’s possible that all-out disruption of Ukraine’s Internet will come to pass. We hope not. But one thing about this history stands out. We have not seen the kinetic response to cyberattacks on a wide scale that was being discussed a decade ago. Luck? Cooler heads? Invisible cyber counterattacks? Thoughts of a Cyber version the Mutually Assured Destruction doctrine that has, in theory, kept the world from launching nuclear war? Or is physical destruction on a massive scale enough to satisfy those bent on domination? These times we’re living in will surely shape the times we will be living in. Let us hope and work for that cyberwar doesn’t exceed the malign effects we have seen to date and that going forward we see fewer dire images because of fewer dire circumstances"
14,Can Caspian Gas Help EU Diversify Supply?,news-society," Yes, it can but it will take time. Expanding Caspian natural gas pipeline supply can greatly benefit EU’s energy security in the 2030-time horizon and beyond. As an immediate measure, the EU has focused on increasing access to Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). However, in the medium and long-term, priority should be given to developing new natural gas pipelines from the Caspian. EU has recently recognized that it needs to reduce dependence on Russian gas. In addition to geopolitical considerations, there is a strong economic rationale for why the EU needs to proactively diversify natural gas supply. There is a high degree of market concentration, with three suppliers responsible for over 80% of natural gas imports to EU in 2021. Such a high degree of concentration exposes EU consumers to a greater likelihood of supplier strategic behavior and disruptions as well as increases probability that the market will be underserved. Non-Russian countries of the Caspian basin and Central Asia have about a quarter of the world’s natural gas reserves. Tapping into new Caspian gas is more cost-competitive compared to new LNG sources. In fact, natural gas production cost modeling commissioned by the UK Department of Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy identified development of new gas pipelines from the Caspian as one of the most cost-competitive options for the European market. A Veritas Global study on the economics of natural gas supply diversification estimates that EU consumers would have seen lower wholesale gas prices by 24% in 2021, had the European market secured better access to Caspian gas. This could have saved EU consumers between €24 billion to €48 billion in 2021. These benefits could be realized by implementing the White Stream project, which would bring Caspian gas to EU. This shovel ready project was put on the backburner due to misplaced concerns over climate change and a lack of political will. Reviving this strategic project today would meaningfully contribute to improving European energy security in the 2030-time horizon and beyond. A well-functioning and competitive natural gas market also supports the green transition in two important ways. First, it offers an immediate opportunity for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Burning natural gas instead of coal produces roughly half the carbon dioxide emissions to generate the same amount of energy. Second, natural gas offers a flexible and reliable source of balancing capacity to manage fluctuations in energy supply, which enables achieving a higher penetration rate of renewable energy. Except for nuclear power, electricity generated through natural gas currently offers the most viable and low-carbon alternative to coal-based power as a solution for intermittency. Over the long-term, renewable hydrogen has the potential to become a substitute to natural gas. However, even if the EU hydrogen strategy is fully implemented, only modest quantities of renewable hydrogen are expected to be available over the next two to three decades. Therefore, better access to Caspian gas is an essential complement to EU’s hydrogen strategy and key to supply diversification. Crucially, burning natural gas can be compatible with EU’s net carbon neutrality targets. Several options exist for neutralizing greenhouse gas emissions associated with natural gas use. Options include deploying carbon capture and storage technology, purchasing international offsets, and using direct air carbon capture processes. While all options offer technically viable solutions, the progress achieved in recent years in direct air carbon capture processes has the potential to generate near endless opportunities for emission reductions at a reasonable cost. Therefore, tapping into more Caspian gas is a solution that strengthens EU’s energy security and can be fully compatible with net carbon neutrality targets."
15,SUCH BRAVE HEROES,news-society," Brave soldiers of Russia how proud you must feel as your boots march over the bones of the slaughtered citizens of Ukraine. Brave soldiers of Russian how confident you must feel as your rockets and shells destroy the once-beautiful cities of Ukraine. Brave soldiers of Russia what joy you must feel as you march into this once peaceful and happy land and claim it as yours. Brave soldiers of Russia what celebration, what delight fills you as the land you try to conquer lies around you in smoking ruins. Fearless officers of Russia, how you must cheer as your tanks destroy crops in fields, plough into cottages, farms and villages, and kill the inhabitants, even if old and unarmed. Fearless officers of Russia, how eager you are to smash down what took centuries to build, how merry you all must be serving your country in such a heroic way! Fearless officers of Russia with what pride do you report back the number of women and children perished at your hands and the barrels of your weapons. Fearless officers of Russia what courage you have shown against senior citizens, children and all other civilians, what courage to drive your tanks into towns and anything you perceive to be obstacles on your paths to glory and doing your leaders’ bidding. Proud generals of Russia what comfort you must feel as a job well done when you behold the devastation of a land democratic and free just a few weeks ago. Proud generals of Russia how you must toast each other as the congratulations pour in from your overlords in the capital. Proud generals of Russia what medals you must be dreaming of as your artillery mercilessly pounds the homes of the population, schools full of children, hospitals packed with the sick, the helpless, the wounded, the elderly, the women with their with their babes born and as yet unborn. Proud generals of Russia able at last to fulfil your destinies, to practice the warcraft that you have so impatiently waited for and so eagerly trained for, watching with great satisfaction as your commands of destruction are followed without respite. Grim rulers of Russia, your military follow your orders, as you have those of your leader, you have fed the people untruths and are content that any voices of dissent and truth have been silenced. Grim members of Russia’s government, how obediently you support your leader and his hunger for war, for glory, for domination, and for the power to destroy what peace there is on this planet. Grim Russian authorities, how magnificent you must feel having arrested thousands of citizens, even children, for making peaceful protests against the war you deny is happening and the effective way you shut down all independent media and communications from other countries. Grim members of the Russian State Duma do you wonder how you will rewarded for supporting your demonic leader and causing the deaths of thousands, and the terrified flight of millions of Ukraine citizens from their families, their homes, their country, their future. Posturing president of Russia, who hides in the Kremlin, yet another Russian dictator of ruthless ambition, I see you rubbing your hands with pleasure at the upheaval, the death and destruction you have shown you are capable of. What a mighty warrior you behold in the mirror! Pathetic president of Russia, despite all the strength and powers of your defences, precautions and bodyguards, you are fearful...terrified that the Russian people might learn the truth about you, your supporters and your catastrophic decisions. All-powerful president of Russia, not content with helping genocide in Syria, you now think to boost your image visiting the same on Ukraine. But you forget that actions have consequences, and are incapable of believing that you will fall from power to disgrace. Lethal leader of Russia, ex-bright star of the KGB, you learned how to make lies and deceit your way of life, trusting no one, suspicious of all, you strut over the corpses of the thousands of your conscript dead. People of Russia, you have been encouraged for so long to fear and mistrust “The West”, that you will not, cannot believe anything apart from the clever and ceaseless propaganda that pours from the state’s media, That is your choice. When the apparatus of falsity collapses, and truth emerges, a great shock awaits you, but it all might be too late. Nicholas C Granby March 2022"
16,The Birth of The Guild,news-society," Damé Lorraines and Baby Dolls paraded. Blue Devils covered in their sticky black oil and paint stalked and terrorized onlookers. Heritage was on, and it was in this atmosphere in 2008 during the Writers Workshop that the idea for a writers group was born. A band of celebrated, and soon to be authors and writers set sail on a journey that would see the Tobago literary culture take flight. The group met religiously for the next two years, shaping and formalizing what they were about and what impact they wanted to have on and in Tobago. Present during these formative sessions where many noted Tobagonian authors and writers including Laureen Burris-Phillip winner of the 1996 Commonwealth Short Story Competition for the region, Deborah Moore-Miggins author of The Proverbs That Raised Us and Laugh Not Live Not; Umilta Roberts-Henry, writer of eulogies and skits, Milca Robinson-Reid author of Important Moments, Episodic Tobago, and Dr Winston Murray. In 2010 the group decided to take the plunge and become a fully registered NGO (non-governmental organization) of Trinidad and Tobago. Their mission was clear, the founders wanted to support each other, nurture other burgeoning writers, see courage and confidence grow in the hearts and minds of those who took pen to paper in secret seeking to creatively express themselves and also to document the oral history of their beloved Tobago before more of it was lost to time. This writer could not confirm what that final decisive moment was, it may have been when Ms DeGannes as the records show, at a meeting in 2009, asked for a final decision to be made from the many suggested names for the NGO. They had titivayed long enough about whether the NGO would be called, Union of Tobago Writers (UTW), The Writers Collective of Tobago (TWCT) or the Tobago Writers Guild (TWG). It may have been after the then Treasurer, Mr Chadband was asked to turn over twenty-five dollars of their monthly collections to the then President Mrs Phillip for the name search. What this author can confirm is that on the Wednesday morning of February 12, 2010 the President, presented herself to the Registrar General’s office, then located downstairs the Tobago House of Assembly (THA) building on Jermingham Street, Scarborough with a collection receipt to lay claim, on behalf of the group, to an NGO named Tobago Writers Guild (TWG). Now they could begin to titivate in earnest, a launch would soon be coming. Everyone knows that you can’t marry without fancy dandans, ask the bride and groom from every Heritage Festival Wedding. So too, there could be no proper launch without a logo and it was to that endeavour that Ms Samuel set her skills. When she finally presented her efforts it was with a unanimous nod of approval to the quill but the name in cursive and an ink bottle (if possible) were to be added. It was very possible. As the saying goes, many hands make light work and the well-known Tobagonian tradition of lend-hand was put to work. The group leaned on their extensive network of colleagues, friends and family across the island and from high ranking officials to the man in the street, resources were corralled for their upcoming launch. It is because of this, the TWG is often times thought of as a community effort, where all are welcome. It is on the basis of that same guiding principle that monthly meetings in 2022 continue to be held, where all are welcome to come, share in the love, present, revel and bask in their collective creativity; this is the very foundation of the Guild. List of invited guests... check. Reception... check. Sound system… check check. And it was with hugs, handshakes and a prayer that the members departed, looking forward to when they would meet again at their launch. It was the weekend after the long Easter break, on a humid, but somewhat cool Saturday afternoon on the 17th of April 2010 that the lights of the Itsy Bitsy Theatre were turned on. Refreshments were delivered, programmes were handed out at the door while the MC tapped on the mic… testing, testing. The appropriately adorned and smiling attendees entered the hall. Eyes deciding on their preferred positions and vantage points to the celebration of an era that was about to begin, a journey of epic proportions, an adventure with roots right here in Tobago. Over the years, the Guild has birthed notable annual events such as the Literary Affair, born out of the TWG launch, Reading Fest spilling over from participants’ enthusiasm, various Writing Competitions, and an Author Award Ceremony (in collaboration with the Empowerment Foundation of Tobago) and a published anthology titled Tobago In Print which was heavily influenced by NourbeSe Phillip, author of Harriet’s Daughter and Zong Brands such as the TWG Lecture Series (monthly discussions), First Mic (children’s open mic), The Next Chapter Tobago (the only open mic in Tobago) have emerged as added avenues for creatives and the Guild has seen the establishment of their latest project the TWG Publishing House. Many of the foundation members have aged out and are enjoying retirement in parts unknown, some are no longer with us but the original voyagers will never be forgotten. Their names and their works are etched into the fabric of the Guild that exists today. We have thrived during or maybe perhaps even because of the global pandemic. We have had to pivot into a virtual reality where we now embrace members from all over the world, even from as far afield as Israel and we continue to grow as the journey continues."
17,WarriorForum Community- A Concordant Manifesto for Online forum sites,news-society," ” Raise your words not your voice, It is Rain that Grows Flowers, Not Thunder”.

18,"Russia, Ukraine and International Organizations.",news-society," It’s Saturday already. I am really sad and disappointed, yes disappointed in all the International Organizations formed by the different countries of the world. Russia has invaded Ukraine. A country deliberately invaded a neighboring in country in 2022. With all the defense mechanisms set in place to either prevent or end this ugly incident, it still happened. Why did it happen? Putin’s arguments are false or irrational. He claimed his goal was to protect people subjected to genocide and aim for the “demilitarisation and de-Nazification” of Ukraine. There has been no genocide in Ukraine: it is a vibrant democracy, led by a president who is Jewish. “How could I be a Nazi?” said Volodymr Zelensky, who likened Russia’s onslaught to Nazi Germany’s invasion in World War 2. Let’s ask Putin, how can a Jew be a Nazi? Wouldn’t that be inappropriate? Obviously, there’s more to this invasion that meets the eye. However, one would be stupefied that after these comments from Putin, these so-called International Organizations made for conflict resolution were wisecracking. The Super-power of the world, the United States, were busy dropping counter opinions to threats of ‘war’. The European leaders were busy stating the list of sanctions after a war was declared. Look at the insolence. What real good have sanctions done?. Sanctions are just instruments of deterrence. But in this case, the war has already begun, hence, sanctions would be inconclusive. How did it happen? By air, land, and sea, Russia launched a devastating attack on Ukraine, a European democracy of about 44 million people, and its forces are at the outer parts of the capital, Kyiv. Whether we say it or not, Putin has breached European peace and World peace. He has jeopardized the world’s entire system or framework. This is not how the world works. Russia hit airports and military headquarters first, near cities across Ukraine, then tanks and troops rolled into Ukraine from the north, east and its ally Belarus. What next ? These are very terrifying moments for the Ukrainians, horrifying for the rest of the continent and giddy for the world at large, witnessing a major power invading a European neighbour for the first time since World War 2. Many have died already in what I would highlight as “Semi world war”, both civilians and soldiers. And for Europe’s leaders, this invasion has brought some of the darkest hours since the 1940s(World war era). NATO has allegedly put warplanes on alert, but the Western alliance has made clear there are no plans to send combat troops to Ukraine. Instead, they have offered advisers, weapons and field hospitals. Are these allies weak or just malevolent? No combat troops really ? People have died, persons have been displaced and what these lot come up with is “warplanes on alert” and advisory. Indeed something is suspect about this attack. In a conversation with a close relative; I asked, “What’s going on? I hope you both are safe?”. She said, “I don’t know for sure, some say Russia wouldn’t do it while some are getting prepared”. I asked, “Prepared for what?” Are they going to flee?”. She said, “Preparing to fight and defend”. (She starts crying). This is the reality of a young athlete (18 years old). To world leaders, think about the mental health of this people, the trauma and most importantly the lives of little children in Ukraine, both citizens and foreigners. The West is targeting Russia’s economy, financial institutions and individuals. But I don’t think these measures are enough. Meanwhile, Ukraine has urged its allies to stop buying Russian oil and gas. The whole international community has been called to disconnect Russia’s banking system from the international Swift payment system. That could badly affect the US and European economies. Maybe selfishness is a major hesitation. Putin is predictable. Last year, a long piece describing Russians and Ukrainians as “one” was written by Putin, where he described the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991 as the “disintegration of historical Russia”. So, Ukraine has been in the sights of Russia. Putin has also argued that if Ukraine joined Nato, the alliance might try to recapture Crimea. It has always been evident that Putin would do anything outrageous to defend his claims. But Russia is not only focused on Ukraine. It demands that NATO return to its pre-1997 territories. Profoundly, this war isn’t just Ukraines’. Putin wants NATO to remove its forces and military infrastructure from member states that joined the alliance from 1997: That means Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Baltics. Another alternative quashed. Negotiations can’t work now, Putin is persistent and has said talks can only be held on condition that Kyiv agrees to surrender and disarm, and that is highly unlikely."
19,Does Russia have monopoly power in European natural gas markets?,news-society," Yes, Russia already has some monopoly powers, and its position is like to strengthen further. Analysis by Veritas Global shows that Russia is likely to already have monopoly power across several EU markets. For 11 of the 27 EU members, Russian natural gas consisted of over 60% of all imports. For 7 of the 27 EU members, Russian natural gas was over 90% of all imports. EU-wide, Russian market share of natural gas imports increased from 17% in 2006 to about 35% in 2020. Russia’s position has strengthened further through its recent investments in additional pipeline capacity. Some have argued that the increasing share of sales of Russian natural gas in Europe will create a dependency of Russia on the EU. However, this narrative is not supported by economic theory. To have countervailing power, consumers need to be able to have credible options for switching at short notice to other suppliers of natural gas or use product substitutes to natural gas from non-Russian sources. The high cost of switching to alternative options partly explains the upward price volatility observed across many EU gas markets in recent months. In the short-to-medium term, European consumers, especially in countries that are highly dependent on Russian natural gas, do not have alternative economically viable substitutes. The combination of a high market share and excess transit capacity will magnify Russia’s dominant position in natural gas markets across Europe. Therefore, in the absence of an effective European supply diversification strategy, we think monopoly power is likely to further accumulate to the Russian supplier. These developments could have far-reaching implications that go beyond the functioning of energy markets. For example, one concern might be that Russia may use its leverage to influence political outcomes, for example over decisions taken at the European Council. Since many of the decisions taken by the Council are done either through unanimity or consensus, Russia may be able to exercise leverage over states that are highly dependent on Russian gas thereby giving Russia the ability to hold sway over some Council decisions."
20,The Tempests of Our Times,news-society," The willful destructive tendencies of many have exploited the realities of our times. If societies ignore what is actually happening the epic tragedies and travesties taking place will create the greatest upheaval of humanity since the Great Flood. No longer can we sit ideally by. And, yet the orchestrated symphony of calamity is keeping the audience of humanity captivated by their own ignorance and apathy. The dire predictions of some through-out history many have come to pass. We have yet been able to avoid the repetitiveness of similar events that have taken place before. The time has come to not only realize but visualize what the consequences of the actions and reactions taken by many unscrupulous individuals. With no forethought to what is taking place the world is poised to render the harshest retaliation being inflicted upon man. We see the reoccurring nightmare scenarios playing out on a daily basis. The squalor, the unmanageable thirst for human dignity is being stripped away by a power structure that cares not for quality of life, justice or equality. The sinking dignity of the fellowship of mankind is eclipsed by a quintessential threat that lies in our own ignorance. The created divisions in societies are the result of premeditated issuance of policies by a power structure whose sole existence is to perpetuate their own ruling class. Current events link the ongoing struggles that are manufactured by the power elite.  For the past two years the growing wealth disparity gap has only grown wider. The Covid-19 pandemic has created the novelty of a billion-dollar distribution to entrench a new breed into the elite ruling class. Meanwhile, millions the world over continue to be swept into a realm of reality for which they may never be able to escape. How many times must we endure the travesties of inequality, loss of freedoms, and a deterioration of moral values before we realize what is actually happening to our world? The longer we sit idly by the yolk of oppression gets tighter. It is as though the life blood of human existence is being evaporated by a power structure that has been allowed to size control over societies. In all of history there has been times when humanity has been subjected to ruthless oppressors. We should never forget the Holocaust, the genocide by Nazi Germany. The savage barbaric atrocities committed against a race of people is the most prolific example of ruthless murder that should never be allowed to happen again.  And, yet mankind still finds ways to keep deep divides in societies. Race, religion, gender identification etc. are all factors the induce many to ostracize people who are different.  It is as though one cannot accept when one is of another race, or religion. Their ignorance is manifested because of the lack of education, understanding that we are all different and yet we all are brothers of man. The United States has one of the most divisional societies. The deep divides resulted when government became ineffectual in education and a lack of parental nurturing of a fellowship of man in their children. Generational ignorance is keeping society from creating the atmosphere that induces a growing acceptance toward all. When there is so much inequality also contributes to an overwhelming display of intolerance. There is a growing global crisis that threatens our world. This occurs when there is so much opposition from the oligarchy ruling class to equal the playing field in societies. To remedy this starts right here in America. The level of ineptness, corruption and greed has created the vast divides in our nation. When government is controlled and manipulated by wealth there can be no equality, justice and moral obligation to their citizens.  Understanding this is paramount is solving one of the greatest crises of our times. ."

1,What Is Final Expense Life Insurance?,news-society," What Is Final Expense Life Insurance? Final Expense is a simplified issue permanent Whole Life Insurance policy, that has no medical exam involved in the application process, and is a simple issue policy. Final Expense comes in Level, Modified or Graded, and Guaranteed Issue. Final Expense is sometimes referred to as Burial Insurance, or Estate Insurance. It is designed to take care of your funeral expenses, and any lingering debt that the insured may have. The coverage amounts are usually lower than standard Whole Life. They generally range from $2,500 on the low end to $40,000 on the high end, and the age range is typically 45 to 85 both depending on the carrier. What is simplified issue? It is a simplified method of underwriting, designed to streamline the application process. There is no medical exam required, and there are 2 sets of medical questions that are presented to the applicant. The first set, typically 5 to 7 questions are considered knockout questions. What that means is any yes answer, and the applicant is disqualified for coverage, and will have to be submitted to a guaranteed issue carrier. The second set of questions are to determine if the applicant is eligible for level or modified coverage, so any yes answer will put the applicant into a modified policy. There is also a pharmaceutical check done by the carrier, and with some carriers, it’s an instant decision on coverage. The different coverage types explained Level issue is the best, and has the lowest premiums. They can be with preferred or standard classification. Modified or Graded issue have higher premiums, and a 2-year waiting period before the full covered amount is available to the insured. In the first 2 years, the beneficiary of the insured, will receive a return of premium, plus 10%. Year 3 and beyond, the full amount is paid. This is triggered by any yes answer to the second set of health questions in the application. The highest premiums will be the guaranteed issue policies. This stands to reason since the Insurance Carrier is taking all the risk. An applicant can have cancer, and will still get coverage. The death benefit will also be like the modified coverage. A return of premium plus 10% for the first 2 years. Who needs Final Expense Life Insurance? The answer is simple, anyone in the appropriate age range, that currently has no coverage at all, and their loved one will be presented with a huge funeral bill when they die. At the time I’m writing this article, I personally know of someone who passed with no coverage in place. His widow had no money, and one of his daughters had to fork over the money. They were also forced to open a GoFundMe account, and lean on total strangers to give money. The high cost of dying The average Funeral costs between $7,000 to $15,000 depending on the location. Some of the typical costs involved that don’t come to mind during the initial funeral planning phase are listed below. Funeral with Burial: Metal Casket: $2,400 Basic Services Fee: $2,100 Vault: $1,395 Embalming: $725 Facilities/Staff for Ceremony: $500 Facilities/Staff for Viewing: $425 Hearse: $325 Removal or Transfer of Remains: $325 Miscellaneous Preparation: $250 Printing for Memorial: $160 Service Vehicle(s): $150 Funeral with Cremation: In 2015, the NFDA projected that cremations would eventually become more common than traditional burials. Some families opt to hold memorial services and viewing prior to cremation. Other families, however, choose to hold their remembrances after cremation, letting the urn symbolize their loved one. The median price of funerals with cremations is $6,260. As with the above estimate of services with burial, this number does not include cash advance fees or cemetery monument or marker costs. Basic Services Fee: $2,100 Cremation Casket: $1,000 Embalming: $725 Facilities/Staff for Ceremony: $500 Facilities/Staff for Viewing: $425 Third-Party Cremation Fee: $350 Removal or Transfer of Remains: $325 Urn: $275 Miscellaneous Preparation: $250 Printing for Memorial: $160 Service Vehicle(s): $150 The Decision is clear The most common response to getting Final Expense is, “I can’t afford it”, or “I will get it later”. The truth is, you can’t afford not to get it, and none of us are guaranteed tomorrow. The answer to who needs Final Expense Life Insurance, is everyone who does not want to leave a burden of footing the bill for their funeral to their loved ones."
2,Cowardice of Censorship,news-society," The repugnant emotional reactivity that endeavors to stifle free speech is a form of post-modern cowardice. Any efforts to suppress or otherwise invoke censorship over the free exercise in the exchange of thinking processes is an act of tyranny. In an age of infotainment, over vast reaches of electronic communication systems, to oppress or other restrict any form of interpersonal communication portends horrific consequences. Shutting down free speech in any format demonstrates unethical and socially regressive temper tantrums “adult children”. Often misunderstand, in all likelihood as a result of an intellectually devolving society, the censorship defense of “shouting fire” exposes egregious misinformation in order to condescend the free exercise of communicative exchanges. As such, every genre of creativity, from the artistry of photography to the movie making personifications of inventive storytelling ought to rise up in outrage. Of writers, journalists and poets, the tenor of dissent of ethical necessity demands immediate redress of grievances. Tyranny rises when discourse is restricted. To paraphrase and otherwise reflect upon on journalist’s admonition on free speech, offers a critical guideline. Of that, the writer on point here brings to bear the writings of noteworthy exponents on issues of freedom of expression. Such notable personalities as John Milton, Thomas Payne, and John Stuart Mill for example, strenuously expounded on the necessity of personal liberty. With regard to an imperfect summation, it is duly noted that the speaker has a right to speak, and the listener is obliged to listen. Of such actions, for the civility of interpersonal interactions and advancement of civil discourse, it is essential to ensure a two-way process. Each party is courteously obligated to freely interact speaking, listening and cooperating productively. Prosocial benefits derive from the dissentious nature of oppositional and contentious points of view. Freedom, particularly in matters of verbal expression, become woefully disingenuous and potentially irrelevant when people are silenced because they are different. In the contemporary social media and mainstream media, of all the infotainment corporate industrial complex, the atmosphere of censorship contrives to circumvent the First Amendment. By dismantling the first one, it follows that the others are in line for further degradation of individual rights and safeguards from oppressive incursions. For the growing oligarchic collusions of the more powerful and influential members of society, the wealthy and the politically connected, the republic is in danger. The cowardice of censorship expresses the peril. In the vast reaches of social psychobabble, inviting the communal incestuous aberration of the cult of personality, the invective of infantile narcissism degrades the viability of intelligent ascension. Stupidity knows no boundaries for its advocates piously embrace the mantra of self-serving cognitive bias and immediate gratification. With frauds and fools lurking everywhere, relishing in their enslavement of complacent despair, the viability of an evolved society wanes toward final extinction.  As such, one reflection from the past, espoused by a 17th century philosopher observed that government has no divine right to dictate censorship over the people. Instead, the people tell the government how governing is going to carried out. For those cowardly enough to submit their parasitic subservience to alleged “authority”, they can rely on the more sinister among us to erode their freedoms. While none of this current concern about censorship is new, the historicity is often forgotten given the ignorance of most people. As mainstream society in general, with overlording by the infotainment industry, wallows in the safe mediocrity of gluttonous consumption, malevolent personalities ascend to the national stage to fool the majority. By cowardly acts of “cancel culture” exploitation, along with the insidious perpetrations of “political correctness”, the wussification of society insists upon the “dumbing down” of the populace. From pundits a plenty, simplistic commentary opined by the voices of childlike immaturity castigate any oppositional attempts at rational indignation. Particularly complicit in the collusion of illusions is the bloated arrogance of “celebrity worship”. From Hollywood elites, to the snobbery of the wealthy upper classes, the superficiality of the status quo speaks loudly to the entitlement of hypocritical self-righteousness. And to this, for every witch hunt, for each contrivance of accusation without lawful substantiation, therein resides the motivation to invoke terroristic acts upon others. Tyranny wears a human face. Echoing the concerns of the 17th century social philosopher previously mentioned, dire consequences for American society await the incursions of censorship. Liberties erode as “paradise is lost” as a result of the emotional reactivity to silence free speech. To be exposed to competing ideas, differences and disagreements, including controversies of one nature or another is at the very core of liberation. For that elegance of unique existence, pursuing the free expression of ideological varieties for the exposure of veracity, based on evidentiary factuality, is an extraordinary expression of a wiser enlightenment. Instead, disguised as adults, children desire the dictatorial condescension of enforced adherence to a warped sense of regressive consensus. In the social media advancement of complicitous stupidity, a few valiant insist on rebellion. In the contemporary annals of cowardly cancel culture, the pontificators of the celebrity worship, guru deification and pundits of pussification enjoy the salacious arrogance of stupidity. As they proselytize the commonality of regressive infantile narcissism, the collective advocates of simplistic magical thinking erode the vitality and potency of individual liberation. Oppositional contentiousness relies on the mainstream population to be ill-informed, complacent and mundanely committed to lethargy of pacified consensus. Invoking risky countermeasures, braver members of the social expanse assert the differentiated perspective of independent thought and deviation from the contrived normalcy of political, social and economic subservience. As to a historic notion of “radical free speech”, wiser speculations from an earlier century provoked the dangerous exhibitions of speaking fearlessly regardless of retribution. Proclaimed ages ago, and frequently forgotten, overshadowed by the convenience of “shouting fire in a theater”, the ghostly admonition mocked the hesitance to substantiate the higher order of free speech. In one article, from an established oracle of political analysis, the speculative query of a noted magazine publication ponders the very notion of behavioral oppression. From an experience perspective, a writer ponders the efficacy of a society controlling the free exercise of verbal expression. To what extent a cultural sector, or a society in general may diminish the role of individuality depends on what those in power can get away with. For the predilection of tyranny by corporate-state collusions, or social networking contrivances, the future of personal independence stares precariously into an abyss of troubling possibilities. While governments are arguably a potential threat to individual freedom, other human entities are as much a provocative adversary to individuality. In the post-modern context, the accumulation of power by way of social media oligarchies, as well as multinational corporate enterprises, exert extreme influence to enforce conforming behaviors. From that, despotism looms menacingly over society. From the tyranny of over the “majority”, which in modern America is due partly to elitist corporate-government collusions, “normalcy” rules by imposition of herded beliefs, opinions, and related emotional machinations.  The intolerance for deviations, the persecutions by way of “political correctness” and associated juvenile foolishness endanger the viability of the republic. Pressuring the masses, the vast infotainment industry, including opinionating pundits, social media platforms and their techno-conglomerate ownerships, scare mongering foments of culture of devolving extinction. Political functionaries, primarily at the national level, scamper to conform to the treachery of the smug piety of the new “robber barons”. At this juncture and of recent social media conjecture, the “robber barons” appear out of history. A century ago, a president railed against the money grubbing wealthy elitists who exploited the resources of the U.S. In addition, to that end, a basic description unfolded. Essentially, the robber baron is the wealthy who place themselves above the law and endeavor by whatever means to take illicit advantage of others. A pejorative term, the criticism suggests powerful and influential people, through various corporate configurations, scheme to ensure their wealth by less than honorable means. Of the 19th century era, industrialists and financiers made huge profits by dishonest business practices and oppressing workers at every opportunity to maximize profit.  Everything from banking to oil, agriculture to textiles, were subjugated to every extent possible. For some researchers, speculations suggest the onset of the “power elite” gave rise to atmosphere of commerce that encouraged organized crime to flourish. Given the affinity between corporate collusions and criminal activity, the salaciously selfish desire for wealth accumulation replicates in a multiplicity of modern examples. As such, financial empires amassed extraordinary fortunes then as they do now. Disparity between rich and poor continues in spite of mainstream psychobabble regarding the so-called American Dream. Now, enter the mystical “mind” flirtation with time travel. Climb into the time machine flash back to the 19th and observe the antics of the robber barons. After enough disgust with the “privileged few”, flash forward to the 21st century. Seemingly, not much changes with human nature.  Fascinating science fiction movies provide entertaining adventure for such theoretical prospects. In the post-modern era of vast fortunes proliferating in the “info-age”, with innovations in telecommunications, extraordinary wealth gives a few exceptional power and dominion over others. As described by some media sources, “big tech” is likely the renewed human expression of modern-day robber barons. Sleight of hand and misdirection continue the criminality. While exceptionality applies in most cases, the focus becomes that of assessing the most powerful among us, and what is going on behind the curtain. As some pursue prosocial engagement in a diversity of consumer consumptive enterprises, others prefer the enrichment of themselves at the expense of others. In the techno-world, some criminals hide behind a computer screen. Likewise, some have come to own very large global social media networks and wield exceptional influence over public policy making. From economic entrepreneurs to political entrepreneurs, the self-serving interests of various corporate factions amatively invited their “god-like” worship. By presupposed “divine right of kings”, an American aristocracy rises. Be obedient, submit to the subservience of consumptive enslavement, do what you are told do, conform to the consensus of the rules, and you shall be rewarded with being kept in your place. For the new robber barons of the techno-monopolies, dictation as to the deceptions of cause and effect, contrived reality and manufactured morality, fallacies over facts and psychobabble theology, subsistence in in the narrow framework of shallow conformity. For the valiant non-conformist, the rebel with an honorable cause, the resistance fighter who fights for uniqueness, his or her valor is met by the lash of tyrannical retribution. Of things seen as mandates by pretentious authoritarian rule, for the “greater good” masquerade as martial law for the whims of the more powerfully entrenched. Whips, spankings and bondage in some metaphorical sleight of hand, reflect the infantile retribution from self-appointed divinities. For the wizards of the cyber-land, behind the virtual iron curtain there stands, the minions of “thought control”. For the impotence of their conceited potency, the limp shortcomings of imaginative creativity, the power to banish, shame and mock disagreeable disputations assert the hollowness of their ideologies. Children as grownups, immature and self-righteous, with powerful telecommunications wealth, ascend as overlords of social media and infotainment globalization. Likewise, a host of guru worshipped celebrities crowd around the glow of their needy self-validation. By the bloated gush of exaggerated importance and magnification of conformity, selfie reflected importance fixates upon the dullness sameness of over-rated egos. By every effort at censoring dissent, disagreement and oppositional discourse, a stupidity of conformity fosters the darkness maladaptive inflictions. Deadened, the human spirit falls to the degradation of innovative inspiration to excel beyond the commonality of the herded collective. For a true calling to nonconformity, or a mature sense of differentiation is of valued essence individuality. The cowardice of censorship, by whatever impotence of self-doubt, or narrowmindedness of personal immaturity, provokes the deadly consequence for authoritarian oppressions. For most who do not understand the depths of intense personal transformation, the superficial assertion of “non-conformity” is another form of conforming masquerade. Yet, the true fighter for freedom of individual exceptionality maturely self-evolves to a higher understanding. For the piercing painfulness of formative anonymity, to the quest for ascendency of self-realization, individuation seeks the paths less crowded by others. With persistent aggressive pursuit of passion, in the creative genres of fantasy to fruition, the individuality of independence cannot be bound by barriers of jealous animosity. Cowardice of censorship labors to thwart expressive bravery. In the hideously grotesque manifestations of intentional suppression of free exercise of thought to social interaction, the willful deceivers maximize the adverse capacity for deception. for the acts of deliberate betrayal and treason, many re-create the world in their image. For people, regardless of actual or perceived status in socio-economic ranking, the ability to deceive is extraordinary. Self-deception, as regards the historic existential assertion of philosophers long gone, ensures every effort to promote desirable admiration of oneself. Once in powerful and influential positions, where politicians, pundits and gurus of wealth pontificate their reshaping of everyone else’s world view, the blustering cowardice infringes on others. From this, censorship becomes a weapon in the hands of techno-corporate oligarchs, political aristocracies and over-rated media talking heads. Some wonder why anyone would give any credence to a tube-shaped talking head. That is, the face and upper torso one sees, but does not necessarily observe, in the commercial ventures of alleged news reporting. From the “plasma tube of plenty”, there unfolds the seemingly two-dimensional 24/7 non-stop dystopic babble of shallow infantile perspectives. Expensively attired, coiffed to perfection, blushed by the brush of makeup, form fitted to fabrication of the infotainment perpetrations of contrived consensus. Robotic poster children for a time of discord and dissent, the “tele-evangelists” of mystical telecommunications adulate upon self-righteous condescension. Hiding cleverly the defects of humanistic shortcomings, the cowardice of censorship trespasses easily upon the boundaries of others. For all the window-dressing, the coiffured fabrication of upscale fabrics, the emptiness of their sad defects and flaws sometimes, but very elusively, slips through a crack or tear in the costumes of duplicity. As a point of hilarity to the discouraging advent of the weaponized information, and bullying commercial materialization of thinking processes, would be fascinating to see everyone completely naked. Nude, bare, in the buff and brazenly exotic media expressions depict people as their skin really depicts them. Nothing to hide, no fake coverings to shield the dishonesty, yet instead, the test of bare-naked exhibition. Of course, that will never be the case, while nudity is an act of self-revolution, awareness of selflessness, etc. for a few valiant souls, bareness scares most people. In a culture where oppressions have many faces, and hypocrisy knows many places, acts of freedom are herded to the commonality of trickery, ruse and bogus pretenses. In a realm of the cowardice of censorship, many fear the reality of truth and confrontation with the necessity to grow up and act like adults. Over the expanse of many cultures, and from past to present, historical cautions mock the critics who find flaws in others but ignore their own. In the cowardice of censorship, the insidious malevolence to inflict certain viewpoints as the norm, and conspire to suppress all others, the emphasis on spineless tyranny cannot be overstated. It hastens the downfall of humanity and summons the regressive degradations of eventual extinction. Abnormality by intentional perpetration asserts the condescending ramifications of maladaptive assumptions as to how others should behave. To conform to a preconceived mode of behavior, those with power and influence, wealth and control, assume a spectrum of behavioral specifications inflicted upon the majority. While arguments consume certain periods and particular cultural characteristics, along with generational diversity, the societal configuration of a democratic republic specifies constitutional for extraordinary individual liberty. As to that, abnormality in the diversification of mainstream interactivity enriches the prospects for communal ascendancy to higher realms of enlightened maturation. Yet, the collectivist ideologies of normalcy condemn the individuation of creativity among the individuals who differ with the status quo. As such, in modern times, to be among the so-called normal is to forsake the transforming differentiation of self-evolution. For the fear of being outside the crowd, the herded mentality of sameness voluntarily surrenders to subservience. Suppression of dissent in any form, restriction for rebellion in artistic endeavors against “community guidelines”, and squashing alternative viewpoints cries loudly the “cow-herding” of cowardly authoritarianism. To accept the dogmas of commonality, forgetting the time worn echoes of historical repressions, the many embrace the maladaptive consistency of sameness. Conformity to the malicious intentions of “political correctness”, for the power and control over others by those who’s “lives matter” and others do not, inflicts the pains and sufferings of dying culture. The ease and potential terror of simplistic thinking in controlling ideas expresses human evil. While discourse considers the viability of some compromise for a modicum of common interests, as reflected in a republic’s constitutional precautions, exceptionality for the prospects of abnormality is vital. The value of conformity depends heavily upon the value of freedoms by which personal liberation assures continued individual transformation. Of that, allowances for non-conformity invites creativity, innovation and individualistic maturation. Yet, most are not in a process of profound maturation, and remain in a fixation at a prior time and place of narcissistic infantilism. As a result, children in adult bodies gain powerful placement, from the corporate realms of techno-empires, to the political arenas of “American aristocracy. From those elitist collectivist wealthy enclaves, there is tyranny in the cowardice of censorship."
3,Keurig agrees that coffee pod recyclability of K-Cup Pods suits,news-society," Keurig has settled a class action suit concerning the company's claims regarding recyclability. Keurig Green Mountain reached a tentative settlement with a consumer that is suing the company for its claims regarding coffee pod recyclability. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of California in November 2018. It alleges that the company deceives consumers by claiming that its polypropylene K-Cups can be recycled. The details of the deal, which represents the second major settlement in recent months over brand owners’ recyclability claims, have not been made public. Kathleen Smith, a Lafayette resident, sued Keurig Green Mountain. She claimed that Keurig instructed customers to remove the metal foil from used K-Cups and to compost or dispose of the coffee grounds. Then, they advised consumers to recycle the cup and filter. The lawsuit claims that the cups can fall through the sorting screens at material recovery facilities (MRFs). This is due to their small size, especially after being compacted in pickup trucks. After they're disposed off, however. The suit claims that cups can be contaminated by other recyclables if they are not disposed of at the MRF. Even if the cups are sorted, bagged, and sold to a plastics recycler, the residual metals and food contaminants can make them difficult or impossible to recycle. Keurig requested that the case be dismissed citing a variety of reasons. Keurig claimed that the plaintiff failed to distinguish between its original coffee pods and its recycled PP pods. This claim was made after Keurig tested the pods with recycling companies to confirm their recyclability. KW Plastics, Merlin Plastics, and others were involved in the K-Cup recycling trials. Keurig also argued that its marketing language conforms with the Federal Trade Commission’s Green Guides. California statutes reference them because Keurig informs consumers that the cups can't be recycled in all communities, and instructs them ""check locally."" Keurig demanded that the case be dismissed. They cited a number of reasons. Keurig claimed that plaintiff failed to distinguish between original coffee pods from its recyclable PP pods. These PP pods were introduced in 2017. After testing with recycling organizations to ensure their recylability, they were launched in 2017. KW Plastics was and Merlin Plastics were both involved in the K-Cup recycling trial. Keurig also moved to dismiss the case. Keurig claimed its marketing language was compliant with the Federal Trade Commission’s Green Guides. California statutes refer to them. Keurig tells customers that the cups are not recyclable in all areas and asks them to ""check local."" Not yet available details of the agreement The parties filed a notice on Oct 26 informing the judge they had reached a principle agreement after completing mediation sessions and further negotiation this year. The filing requests Judge Gilliam delay the case until the parties make the terms of their agreement (currently in a termsheet) into a legal settlement document. Gilliam approved on October 27 an order giving parties until February 24, 2022, to file a motion for preliminary acceptance of the class-action settlement. The details of the agreements between Smith and Keurig were not disclosed. Smith filed a complaint asking Judge Gilliam for an order to Keurig that it stop making recycling claims, and to conduct a ""corrective advertisement and information campaign."" Smith also requested Judge Gilliam to order Keurig pay restitution to all class members and damages as well as punitive damages. Lexington Law Group, a California law firm, filed the lawsuit. Lexington Law Group has filed a variety of legal actions alleging that brand owners' recyclability claim are violating California law. Lexington Law Group filed a case naming TerraCycle, a specialist products recycling company, as well as consumer goods companies CSC Brands. Last month, a settlement was announced. Lexington Law Group represented Greenpeace as well in a December 2020 litigation against Walmart. That was successful in getting the case thrown away. Greenpeace has now filed an amended complaint."
4,How Has Covid Affected Teen Life and Their Concept of Time?,news-society," In the hit pop song “Teenage Dream,” Katy Perry sings, “We can dance, until we die; You and I, will be young forever.” Many people may think that these lyrics are simply describing the feelings that an American teen experiences throughout their golden years as a younger person. Others may not realize that teens across the country, I myself included, feel as though the worldwide pandemic has restricted the possibility of living this “teenage dream,” and has caused shifts in their plans. While everyone has been affected by this global issue, American adolescents specifically have been forced to live without momentous events and times that most experience as adolescents. The result is a shift in the normalcy of teenage lives. Covid has set apart the youth of today from other generations and has created new, common ways of thinking among today’s adolescents such as understandable feelings of rush and panic and different definitions of “teen life.” Although a high school education usually consists of four consecutive years, today’s youth find it to seem shorter. The actual amount of time has been the same throughout generations, so what makes this generation feel as though their time has been cut short? The answer: they have missed occasions that mark key aspects such as proms, in-person classes, and in-person graduations. Adolescents have heard of and anticipated unique occurrences like those their parents experienced when they were younger. Today’s teenagers have hoped to have moments that they can reflect on when they are older and think, “Those were the days when I felt free, learned lessons, and made memories.” Knowing that they may not experience these big occasions and freeing adventures for themselves has stoked fear, worry, and panic among teens. For example, classmates of mine have even had breakdowns and shared videos about them missing out on the glorious American teenage dream. Many adolescents’ timelines have been rushed and altered because of the pandemic. By having these common ideas, the younger community has been set farther apart from other age groups and has created their own concept of time as plans are pushed back and hurried. Not only have today’s youth had similar thoughts about their time, but they have also each contributed to designing entirely new “norms” of teen life. For each adolescent, going out has become staying in. Classes have become video lectures, hugs with friends have become “I miss you’s” over the phone, homecomings have become missed opportunities, and thoughts about the pandemic being “weird” and “irregular” have become a waiting game, a waiting game as teens yearn for the day when they finally get to return to the lives that they know they are meant to be having. These circumstances may be vastly different from those of age groups before us, but for teens today, this is our own generation’s notion of teen life. Our community has created a new era subconsciously based upon our mainstream perception of events, like staying home and irregular school years, during the pandemic. People do not notice how the younger folk today have worked to construct an abnormal-normal for themselves, their communities, and others to look back on as its own distinctive definition of what life is now like for us. By understanding these findings, people can begin to take away and build on some major points. Teenagers can note that the excitement for these years should not be measured by panic and changes but can instead be seen as a time for us to come together and create our own unrepeatable timeline. Other generations can ponder the true feelings and perspectives of today’s youth to build a bridge connecting age groups, communities, and everyday people together. Covid has affected American teenagers' viewpoints and opinions in numerous ways which have molded a new concept of time and teen life within the community. Adolescents today have connected through hardships, an unusual experience, and the creation of an unfamiliar era, which others can perceive as an example to replicate for years to come."
5,We Have Met the Enemy and He Is Us,news-society," Cartoonist Walt Kelly modified and changed Commodore Perry’s famous quote to, “We have met the enemy and he is us” in a cartoon he created in 1970 celebrating the first Earth Day in 1970. The message being that man from his treatment of the earth is the planet’s enemy. It may also be true that the greatest enemy of democracy is not our corrupt leaders, but that a large part of our country’s citizens do not love or understand what democracy really means. If they do not love or want a free press that allows opposition and differences of opinion to flourish, then they do not love or want democracy. If legislators take away the rights of any minority and hamper free elections and the ability for every eligible citizen to easily cast a vote, then they do not love democracy. If school boards take books out of libraries as Texas is doing, because they consider the books too disturbing or controversial, then they are going down the path of the book burnings that happened in Nazi Germany and they do not love or want democracy.  Instead of democracy they want only their own opinions and their own laws to prevail and flourish and are willing to vote for leaders who will give them what they want. But leaders who willingly lie and bend the laws to obtain power eventually take away not only the rights of the minorities they oppose, but also ultimately take away all their citizens rights as we have seen in other countries that have become authoritarian and have lost their democracy. In the United States we are  on a dangerous road toward losing our freedom. If in the next few elections the people vote for leaders with selfish and corrupt motives and authoritarian tendencies, then the voters will ultimately be responsible for giving away their precious freedom and once you give away your freedom, it is very difficult and perhaps impossible to ever get it back. In a Democracy everyone has a voice and is worthy of respect. Poor people, rich people, minorities and majorities and people of different religions and different ethnicities. If a voter does not believe in that, then they do not love democracy. That is the dilemma that the voters in America will soon be facing in the coming elections in 2022 and 2024. How many voters still love democracy and are willing to vote for and support leaders who will protect it? The future of our country and the future and well-being of our children and all future generations are now in the hands of all of us who are voters—an awesome and frightening responsibility. We must now all work and fight to protect our ability to vote. We must fight for the ""For the People act of 2021"" that will help to protect every citizen’s right to vote. We must all make an effort to get the information we need from many different reliable sources so we can become wise and informed voters and ultimately cast our vote for leaders who will always protect our democracy and the rule of law and keep it forever strong and safe. Democracy needs every voter now as it has never before needed all of us to work and fight for its very survival."
6,Cowardice of Culture for Collusive Consensus - 1,news-society," Cowardice in a culture of sameness, contrived by the lameness of intellectual regression, portends the recession that harkens the end by collusive and contrived consensus. For a viewpoint arguing contrary to the herded powers of mainstream dominion, the pretended collective for the greater good intends the folly of the American Dream. As the fading echo of poetic expressions once claimed, to rebel against much and be subservient to little as possible, wiser fragments of time gather dust and lose their shine. In cowardly times, the poorly disciplined attributes of historical references, psyche portals erupted from quiet intentions to disrupt the mainstream for onslaught of heroic adventures. Yet, the more powerful elites, the oligarchies and their minions among the political aristocracies, in shadowy realms foment the collusions of herded submission. Where militant tyrannies and terroristic theologies are less cumbersome, ideologies pervade the senses with more subtle seductions. Cowardly, a culture falters to the arrogance of ignorance. In a 21st century post-modern context, ripe with the incestuous urgings of global electronics, and associated techno-wizardry, a more profound delineation of cowardice is found. Subtle, behind the scenes, cunning linguistics, and sleight of hand memes, foolhardy notions absent credibility argue the sad defect of a mainstream gone increasingly more stupid. Well-groomed, laced to the hilt, bound to the silk, the smoothed skin arrogance of self perpetrates treacheries with purposeful stealth. For the cowards of modern times, the laptop, the cell-phone, the swipe of masked digital selfiness ejaculates the egregious fallacies of fraudulent spew. As to a coward, there are diverse representations. From an attempt at etymology, the unfolding human ecology represents admonition of centuries long past. On a simplistic spectrum, perhaps even a basic primordial range, cowardly ways are that which shuns the courage to meet a threat, a danger or a delicate probing adventure. Modernistic perspectives find cowardice more broadly applied. Using the bully as one possible example, the weakling has changed. Bullies are cowards, but their disguises are more cunning and deceptive. Of tormenters, intimidators and oppressors, their intimidation tactics and techniques are diverse. Here, reference is not the generic movie making blather of backing away from an actually physical fist fight. Instead, it is of a deeper moral sense of individuality versus maladaptive status quo consensus. The standard issue usual template of the bully versus the victim in physical confrontation devolves to a more sinister reality. Cowardice has become more covert and deceptive, so much so, the average person will miss it. While it does not take extraordinary effort to be smarter than the average, beyond thinking and acting at an 8th grade middle school level, most will fear the sacrifice of intellectual betterment. Regardless, cowards come in all sizes, dimensions and expressions of selfishness. From academia to government, from corporate intrigues to mass marketing consumptive gluttony, pontificating gurus of “celebrity worship” conspire to spoof their adherents. with the shortcomings of their wadded superficiality, the haughtiness of infantile narcissism respects no boundaries. For a moment pause, that suggests the origins of such dissonance as to the characterizations. From an Anglo-French to an Italian derivation, the word dissects toward a derogatory reference of a “tail” of something. In a metaphoric sense, as may be associated with the alimentary canal and the expulsion of excremental wastes, verbiage likely refers to “tucking the tail between the legs”. Or, could apply to the expressiveness of suggesting “turning tail and running”. Regardless, such descriptors take on divergent perspectives in contemporary application. With more fascinating reference, an Old-English manifestation is that of the “cow-herd”. Or, also a “pulpit”, by which an appeal to authority castigates or otherwise discourages dissent, controversy, challenge, debate and argumentation. Other historic and philosophical distinctions suggest fearfulness related to a spiritual, physical and psychic sense of individuality. But, suffice it to say more fun can be postulated by the playfulness offered in use of “cow-herd”, or maybe a cow in a herd. In no way does the mention here reflect negatively upon hard working agriculture interests in any way. Rather, the suggestion is toward those of a fraudulent and deceitful nature. Wonderful metaphorical ascriptions can unfold in a jesting manner. This could be particularly satirical in application to politicians and political processes where hypocrisy and untruthfulness roam freely. As to that point, the modern coward resents truthfulness, facts and rationality over the expanse of logical analyses. One writer calls it the fear of honesty. In one article from a blog about politics and society, the author lists a number of malevolent characteristics of the modern coward. Distressed that others might disagree with him or her, and that some will argue with authentic credibility, the scaredy-cat is terrified his or her “world of fiction” will be exposed for the fraud that it is. The psycho-physical weakling elevates his or her fantasies to pretentious and unrealistic expectations for self-gratification. Intentionally insulating the selfiness against the harsh realities of the real world, social media along with mainstream media ignorance reinforce nebulous notions in emotional reactivity. While lying is not particularly creative, as savvy inquisitors easily observe, the coward relies on herded collusions. The cowardly come through loud and clear for the astute observer. In a mass-marketing culture, where everything is for sale and everything can be justified, the insidious and incessant promotion for gluttonous consumption is everywhere. In an expression of contemporary philosophical inclination, reflecting what one researcher lamented, that a lifetime of ease invites softness and weakness for the senses to please. From that, words come to mind. Soft, weak, timid, emotional and cowed. There is that reflection to the “cow-herd”, which infers intimidation, browbeaten, scared, and bullied. As such, from a vast profit-making corporate monstrosity of infotainment industry, the proliferation of scare mongering is good for business. Superficial, shallow, dishonest and deleterious to social ascendancy, the poisonous spew of bloated conjecture admonishes the independence and individuality of courageous creativity. So easily, the fear mongering colluded to the success of promoting weakness and perpetual subservience. For the dark ages of modern times, the culture of cowardice reaches to every aspect of socio-economic interactivity. As a “herd animal”, a variety of historic philosophers accused western cultures as becoming intellectually malnourished, lazy, eager to please pretentious authorities, socially enslaved and uncreative. In rebellion to the malaise of fat and foolish complacency, a few valiant ones assert their liberation toward creative individuation. Heroic and passionate as to craft and vocation, their genius is found in their exceptionality to herded conformity. Again, as to the exhibition of their uninhibited personification, the brave ones reside in a niche of smaller contrast to the overwhelming tyranny of the massive mainstream. Quiet, courteous, humble and innovatively diligent, they are in stark contrast to the ostentatious selfiness of the crowd. There is singular and potent expression in their aloof anonymity. Building a “higher self”, theirs is not one of constantly reinforced of communal validation. Transformation is essential. For a brevity of life chances, the cost of being human, the vast majority mirror the sentiments of past historians who assert the selfishness of the majority. Shunned conceptually and physically, many reject the nobility of individuality, separation from “cow-herd”, and solitude of ingenuity. Among the human chattel of grazing idleness, the adventurous spirited sensuality of the mature ones is frightening. As children in adult bodies cower in confrontation with such noble individuality, social media flows with deception, hypocrisy and deadly animosity. As such, the proliferation of malevolent recriminations unfolds with divisive context. Among the sluggish and contemptable, the incompetent and the impotent, societal degradation prefers the cowardice of immaturity in collective consensus. Timidity finds refuge in greater numbers. Run, hide, and cringe, fear the mysteries lurking on the fringe. As a person enslaves himself or herself, or whatever self, around him or her others enslave themselves. In the surrounding collective, and attention is paid to that word, the status quo consensus is typically contrived by those more influential and manipulated for selfish interests. Astute investigators pay attention to key words. For the aggregated many, the group, the crowd, etc., the collusion is in the collectivism of the motivational factors. In the activism of power and control, the centrality of interaction aims to ensure a lesser role for individuality and identity and dominance of the collective. The hive, the group, and all the associated consensus building, diminishes the role of the individual and stifle imaginative creativity. Freedom, liberation of the senses, visionary creativity flourishes when the nature of individuation roams willfully free. Yet, constraints manifest in diverse ways through interaction within a multiplicity of institutional frameworks. Unfortunately, and to the detriment of social processes, including free expression of ideas in various artistic forms, the social mainstream fears singular differentiation. Instead, for most one size fits all, one template for everything and one equation explains the simplicity of complexity. Among the worst offenders for the “free expression thereof…” comes from the corporate monstrosities of infotainment. Politicians are easy, they fall in line quickly given the ease by which they salacious gratify their egoistic ambitions. Pundits, politicians, proselytes of collective contrivances enjoy the smug piety of their immaturity. Habituated to the collective conformity of pretentious normality, the vast majority of the populace relishes in the complacency of dulled expectations. In reference to one writer’s admonishment of contemporary society, the majority sips the bitter venom of servitude in small doses over time. Cowardice is easily embraced. One researcher, writing about the “pussification of America”, cites with fascination the characteristics of becoming sissified. Taking liberties with the book references, and keeping an association with classical criminology, such is the intentional process of purposefully acquiescing to the lower realms of infantile narcissism. It is the many-faced purposes of clinging to the immaturity of child-like selfishness, and forsaking the viability of individual growth and maturation. Added to that, is the resistance to self-evolve into a more profound and wisely ascended individual. As to that admonition, gender is irrelevant, courage of convictions and pursuit of heroic quests become the vibrant and energetic impetus for transformation. For the stupidity of simplistic and magical thinking, the warrior pursues his or her journey of intense authentic realization. He or she fights back against the idiocy of cowardly cultural oppressions. Added to this debasing mix of cowardly oppressions comes the rise of the “techno oligarchs”. Self-righteous smugly pious, presumed pontiffs of cyber culture, divine right of tech-aristocracy for cultural normalcy, adult children claim societal rulership. Self-centered infantile narcissism among the vast reaches of the infotainment ministries of thought control assert their domination. For the “gulags” of social media ostracizing, or the “corrective labor camps” of thought control, the power elite have new faces and old intentions. By what is really the limp and impotent immaturity of adults with privilege throwing temper tantrums like spoiled children, wealthy technocrats strive to dictate the status quo. No deviations are allowed, free speech becomes a threat, individuality is dangerous, and alternate ideas are seen as contrary to the collective. Power, control and domination over the population manifests in sinister instigations.  Everyone must be the same and relish in the safe mediocrity of gluttonous consumer subservience. For the new “robber barons”, the high-tech gurus of pretentious silicone enclaves, tech is good, tech is for everyone, tech fits all and tech is god. Those who control the nexus of the cyber networks dictate the dogmas of behavioral consistency. To deviate, to question and to resist is dangerous to the slick corporate cyber con artists. For the few and the rebellious, the true social warrior, not the fake foolish ignorant ones, differentiation to a higher state of personal being is the mission of private individuation. Speaking out and expressing conflicting and confrontational perspectives threatens the adult-child to actually consider the freedom of ideas. Tyranny is cowardice, like cultural complicity to enforce collective consistency, the cowardly invoke all manner of condescension and derision to those who resist. The force of individuality is in danger, as communal complicity reinvents the simplistic templates of sameness. And yet, thinking outside the box, or the incestuous relationship with techno gadgetry, is challenging to the independent free thinker. Cowardice of culture for collusive consensus spans a spectrum of multiplicity in a complexity of cyber interactivity. To recall the reflection of one literary luminary of 19th century America, the antidote to social media and government abuses of liberty is the individual who demonstrates the potency of his or her character and growth. In the past, the brutality of dictatorships devalued the vitality and importance of individual creativity. As to the modern context, in an alleged democratic republic, tyrannical instigations transcend freedom of expression by diverse means. Politicians, pundits, and self-appointed proselytes of “rules for behavior”, as from techno-empires of mainstream media, subtly decry and oppress the important nature of individuality. Cowardice in culture is found in herded ideologies. For the false bravado of hiding behind techno gadgetry, the cowards among us fear the damning terminal nature of their terrestrial existence. Villainy of all manner unfolds. As one cultural anthropologist asserted, most people are terrified by the dark terrors that life and death invite. On the one hand, extraordinary heroism, the creativity of the ascending mindfulness of individuality. Fingers of the other clap the admonition to higher enlightenment. Yet, at the same time, the hand that shakes the first one loathes the necessity of its nobility. Instead, for many, the efficacy of truth devolves to the selfish reflections of infantile self-worship. By contrast, the other dimension, or multiple psychic frameworks, demand an overcoming of mundane rudimentary subsistence. To the carnal desires of one’s eye, peering through the maze of darker intentions, resisting the heartfelt passions of ingenuity beyond self, purposes collude to perpetrate deadly inflictions. As to the presupposition of personal divinity, the creator of loftier possibilities retreats into the malevolence of disingenuous motivations. For nothing of this is new, except for the egregious ignorance of all that has been done before. Demon or demigod, evil or potentiality of good, the duplicity struggles to know what it would. For the sake of the enslavement to the ease of status quo abatement, in the sheep filled crowds of subservient weakness, many adhere to the dominance of a lashed whipping for self-punishment of gutless weeping. As opposed to claiming the godly qualities of profound creativity, the demonic insistence to primordial collectivist absurdity profanes the essential vitality of exceptional differentiation. In the cowardice of culture for collusive consensus, negating the fearful horror of final termination, bargains and even begs illicit conspiracies for salacious personal enrichment. No limit as to the evils of timidity. In earlier times, eras lost and gone and seldom re-discovered, the brutal disdain for cowardice expressed astonishing disgust. Shunned, avoided, cast out, and excommunicated from the realm, cowardly behaviors received severe retribution. To lose shield, sword or spear, metaphorically speaking of course, to fail to stand up for oneself exuded the sweated stench of faint-hearted childishness. Nakedly brave, unclothed by virtue of self-evolving uninhibited bravery claims the divinity of individual distinction. From a diverse more dynamic metaphysical perspective, heroism in the unique madness to claim courage, to overrule fearfulness, the valiant warrior asserts his or her liberation in personal transformation. By prosocial activity in selfless service, imaginative ascendancy in genre of artful invention, he or she labors strongly to go beyond the commonplace. By an assortment of settings in modern times, personal warfare has many fronts. As to that, courage of convictions frightens the cowardice of culture for collusive consensus."
7,American Roads,news-society," “Racist” Roads Recently an infrastructure bill was voted on with the promise to fix American roads. Not because they are run down, broken, or old but because they are racist. Racist. Apparently, American roads are racist. How could roads be racist? Well for one, because it is the new liberal, millennial mentality to believe that basically everything is racist. The real definition of racism has been twisted by the left. Real racism is the discrimination of a race or ethnic group that usually refers to one group as superior and the other as inferior. Racism does exist in the United States but not to the exaggerated extent that the media and democrats suggest. One of the main reasons that the roads are described as racist is because cities and construction groups would build highways on poorer neighborhoods, which usually were “black neighborhoods.” These roads were built either built to separate poor and richer neighborhoods or to build a needed highway. This is initially confused with segregation, which in some cases the roads actually had segregated Americans in the past. However, very few are actually presently segregated by these roads. It was not morally right to evict poor residents from their houses in order to build roads. However, it makes sense financially. It is just like America using other 2nd and 3rd world countries to produce and manufacture products because it is cheaper, even though isn’t always morally right. The separation of the neighborhoods also makes sense in some perspectives. Richer neighborhoods have nicer houses and being separated from poorer communities reduces the crime and gang activity in that neighborhood. Making it safer. New housing is also usually separated from other communities. Crime mainly exists in poorer neighborhoods because they are more prone to gang activities. The main reason people join gangs is that they want to make a better living for themselves by cheating the system: stealing, selling drugs, doing, drugs, and etc. If people in these poorer communities found more motivation or support to graduate high school with good grades or even decent grades and aimed for college, they can leave these neighborhoods. If they put education first then they can make a better life for themselves by pursuing the American dream. Although, poorer communities tend to have poor schools that give students a poor education. The government should work on fixing the education system and these schools. Maybe if we focused more on math and science than victimizing black kids with CRT then they would get a better education. Technology and social media are also a distraction in schools. Another reason kids are struggling in schools is that some school boards have a no homework policy. Which is honestly the dumbest fucking thing I have ever heard. Homework may cause some stress but it is so helpful and proven to help kids. America and American roads are not racist. Even if few roads were used to segregate neighborhoods a long time ago, it would be stupid to assume that all American roads are racist. Even if Pete Buttigieg didn’t mean exactly that. It is easy for someone to assume that all American roads are racist and that is clearly an incorrect statement. As a country, we should aim to build and expand the middle, working class. The new infrastructure bill gives a small percentage to the '“racist,” roads. The rest goes to more of the left’s agenda. The left should start prioritizing the American people and stop abusing their power."
8,A Society in Transition,news-society," We all are aware that change in our personal lives is difficult, constant, and inevitable. We notice it when we look in the mirror or see our children grow. What is not so noticeable, however, but is also constant is the change that happens in our country and our world. That change happens so gradually that we don’t always notice it until those changes have made the world that we always knew unrecognizable. I was born before television and computers were in every household and our world then was different and slower-paced. That world, however, is gone now. We can’t get it back and we probably would not want it back. How would we live without our televisions and our computers? There is a segment of our society today that is nostalgic about the past and wants to return to the “good old days”,  but much of the “good old days” was not so admirable. When I was a child we simply accepted discrimination against minorities as normal. We accepted the career limits of women and the limitations on the role of minorities in society as normal. More of our young people today are going to college because of the availability of student loans and they expect their country to give equal opportunity and equality to all of its citizens without exceptions. This more inclusive attitude of a large part of our society is now a threat to those who have held power for a very long time and have denied equal rights to so many people for their own personal gain. When a part of our society denies that climate change is happening, it is because they don’t want to give up the oil and other benefits which make them rich. They are only aware of their self-interest and really don't care that they are damaging the environment or our country.  If they do not want equality for minorities, it is because it serves their self-interest to keep wages and benefits low. These people, who put self-interest before the interests of society, cannot hold back progress indefinitely. They are on the wrong side of history. People in every age have been striving to make their lives better and although it often takes a long time to change prevailing thought and achieve their goals, they inevitably do win. Black people after a very long time of being exploited were eventually freed from slavery. Women, after a long and dangerous struggle, eventually won the right to vote. More and more people are signing on to do the right thing rather than the expedient thing. We must all be prepared to go into the future and embrace the inevitable changes ahead which will ultimately change and also enrich our lives.. Our cities will eventually look different and be more diverse and we will all need to become more tolerant of different religions and ideas and different ways of thinking and living. Tolerance and acceptance for the benefit of all–that is the ultimate goal and the ultimate meaning of democracy and freedom."
9,The Assault on Science,news-society," When I was a young girl, there was a great respect for people of science (doctors, scientists etc.). We trusted them and felt that the contributions of all of our world scientists had made our lives healthier and better. Therefore I was very surprised and disappointed when in 2021 after 50 years of warnings from 97% of our most prestigious scientists that we are still living in a dangerous time of climate change our legislators have as yet not taken the actions they need to take to protect us from this life-threatening calamity. The Worlds most Prestigious Scientific Organizations believe that the Climate is Warming The following is a partial list of scientific organizations along with links to their published statements and a selection of related resources. Statement on Climate Change from 18 Scientific Associations “Observations throughout the world make it clear that climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver.” (2009) Climate deniers are often funded by corporations, companies and individuals who for their own economic interests do not want environmental protection laws that will limit their profits. American Association for the Advancement of Science “The scientific evidence is clear: global climate change caused by human activities is occurring now, and it is a growing threat to society.” (2006) American Chemical Society “Comprehensive scientific assessments of our current and potential future climates clearly indicate that climate change is real, largely attributable to emissions from human activities, and potentially a very serious problem.” (2004) American Geophysical Union “Human‐induced climate change requires urgent action. Humanity is the major influence on the global climate change observed over the past 50 years. Rapid societal responses can significantly lessen negative outcomes.” (Adopted 2003, revised and reaffirmed 2007, 2012, 2013) American Medical Association “Our AMA … supports the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s fourth assessment report and concurs with the scientific consensus that the Earth is undergoing adverse global climate change and that anthropogenic contributions are significant.” (2013) American Meteorological Society “It is clear from extensive scientific evidence that the dominant cause of the rapid change in climate of the past half century is human-induced increases in the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), chlorofluorocarbons, methane, and nitrous oxide.” (2012) American Physical Society “The evidence is incontrovertible: Global warming is occurring. If no mitigating actions are taken, significant disruptions in the Earth’s physical and ecological systems, social systems, security and human health are likely to occur. We must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases beginning now.” (2007) The Geological Society of America “The Geological Society of America (GSA) concurs with assessments by the National Academies of Science (2005), the National Research Council (2006), and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007) that global climate has warmed and that human activities (mainly greenhouse‐gas emissions) account for most of the warming since the middle 1900s.” (2006; revised 2010) There is only a small window of time left for us to act on this life-threatening problem for our planet before we will no longer be able to protect ourselves from this dangerous calamity. International Academies: Joint Statement “Climate change is real. There will always be uncertainty in understanding a system as complex as the world’s climate. However there is now strong evidence that significant global warming is occurring. The evidence comes from direct measurements of rising surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures and from phenomena such as increases in average global sea levels, retreating glaciers, and changes to many physical and biological systems. It is likely that most of the warming in recent decades can be attributed to human activities (IPCC 2001).” (2005, 11 international science academies) National Academy of Sciences “The scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify taking steps to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.” (2005) U.S. Global Change Research Program “The global warming of the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced increases in heat-trapping gases. Human ‘fingerprints’ also have been identified in many other aspects of the climate system, including changes in ocean heat content, precipitation, atmospheric moisture, and Arctic sea ice.” (2009, 13 U.S. government departments and agencies) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change “Warming of the climate system is unequivocal and since the 1950s many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed. The amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen.” “Human influence on the climate system is clear and recent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are the highest in history. Recent climate changes have had widespread impacts on human and natural systems.” List of Worldwide Scientific Organizations This page lists the nearly 200 worldwide scientific organizations that hold the position that climate change has been caused by human action. Source information: NASA –Global climate change Climate Deniers “Unfortunately there is also a long list of climate deniers who have made a living out of denying the science of climate change. These so-called ‘experts’ often start out their statements with ‘I’m not a climate scientist, but…’ before launching into a series of carefully rehearsed talking points meant to confuse the public on the climate change issue. A great many of them are well-paid operatives of organizations like The Heartland Institute, CFACT, and Americans for Prosperity, which take contributions from fossil fuel corporations — including ExxonMobil, the Koch Brothers and their company Koch Industries — who seek to delay or block any substantial government policy initiatives meant to curb fossil fuel emissions or hasten the rapid growth of cheaper, cleaner sources of energy like wind and solar.” – Source information: Before the flood In  2019, 1.1 million students skipped school for a climate strike protest. These are young people and young voters who care about their future and  took action to show our politicians that they are concerned about what is happening to our environment and to their future. They are also aware that the Republicans in Congress because of their own self-interest and economic greed have been fighting to prevent any constructive action on addressing climate change and making our country and world safer. In 2021 and 2022  we all will have the opportunity to make our voices heard again on this important life and death issue. If we make the wrong choice at the ballot box, this country and this earth that we love so much, and our children and all future generations will ultimately pay the price of living on a more dangerous and life-threatening planet. Now is the time that we must all commit ourselves to protect this fragile earth from that unthinkable fate."
10,The origin of World Ozone day and it's significance,news-society," Every year, new heat records are set across the world, and this year has been no exception. High temperatures and extreme heatwaves were recorded from the Arctic Circle, Canada, and Scandinavia to North Africa, Iran, Japan, and India. Obviously, as heat increases, so does the demand to stay cool and use refrigeration. World Ozone Day is annually celebrated on September 16 across the globe. There's an important event attached to the International Ozone day i.e. Montreal Protocol, held in 1987. It is a successful collaboration of more than 24 member nations of the UN as they together signed and pledged to save the ozone layer from further damage by limiting the use of CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons) and other dangerous substances that cause the depletion of the ozone layer in the atmosphere. About Ozone Layer & Its Depletion: The ozone layer contains relatively higher concentrations of ozone gas and absorbs most of the ultraviolet radiation reaching the earth from the sun. This Layer is thicker over the poles than over the equator. Chemicals containing chlorine and bromine atoms are released into the environment through human activities. These chemicals alongside certain weather conditions cause reactions within the Ozone Layer, resulting in ozone molecules getting destroyed. Deterioration of the Ozone Layer occurs globally, but the severe depletion of the Ozone Layer over the Antarctic is often referred to as the 'Ozone Hole'. Historical Background This day was celebrated on September 16, 1995, for the first time. However, the Montreal Protocol was signed in 1987, the day to establish the contract’s importance happened much later in 1995. The United Nations General Assembly first celebrated the day to bring about global awareness of the need to save the ozone layer. Why do we celebrate Ozone Day? For our upcoming generations to survive in an eco-friendly atmosphere, it is essential to protect and sustain the bio-diversities. Polluting nature is dangerous to the progress of humankind. The most excellent way to commemorate World Ozone Day is to gather massive public virtually through a live event and disseminate awareness about how CFCs destroy the ozone layer above us. Educational institutions can bring change by educating the public about the need to preserve the ozone layer. Short campaigns, special events at schools, competitions, and essay writing activities are a number of everyday things to be conducted at schools. What is the theme for Ozone Day 2021? ""Montreal Protocol- Keeping Us, Our Food and Vaccines Cool"" is the theme of World Ozone Day 2021. The Montreal Protocol has done its job very well, making it one of the most successful environmental agreements to date. A collective global effort to phase out ozone-depleting elements means that the hole in the ozone layer is healing, in turn, safeguarding human health, economies, and entire ecosystems. Significance of World Ozone Day 2021: As we know, in the stratosphere of Earth’s atmosphere, there exists a protective shield called the ozone layer and it is responsible for absorbing and preventing harmful UV rays from penetrating the Earth’s surface. It is the stratosphere that contains a more considerable amount of ozone layer compared to other segments. Montreal Protocol plays a crucial role in the protection of the ozone layer. With the growth of industrialization and increase in pollution, harmful substances have worsened the quality of air around us. Not just that, they're known to reduce or, in other words, deplete the concentration of the ozone layer. The first ozone hole was identified over the Antarctic region. With the implementation of the protocol, the Earth has started healing at a rate of 1 to 3 percent every decade, counted since 2000. So this brings to the foresight the relevance, necessity, and importance of World Ozone Day. Apart from this, we must take up efforts and spread awareness on preserving the ozone layer. Let’s take an oath to protect the ozone layer and save life on earth this World Ozone Day! Protect It & Protect Yourself!! Ravichandran Purushothaman, President, Danfoss India said, “Cold chain and refrigeration industry lies at the core of the theme for World Ozone Day 2021-“Keeping us, our food, and vaccines cool”. This will help bolster awareness about the impact of this sector on food loss and wastage, the economy, and most importantly, public and environmental health. With an aim to make our Planet climatically safer and environmentally secure, Danfoss Industries has recently opened its new Centre of Excellence for green refrigerants, in Chennai including a new Green Refrigerant Testing Centre. This is a major green milestone in Danfoss’s journey to provide Sustainable Cooling for all and will surely help in the green transformation of India’s Cold Chain sector. Danfoss is also working with the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) for exploring carbon dioxide (CO2) as a promising natural refrigerant for Indian conditions. This is a vital step towards emphasizing the need for adapting latest technologies to local conditions and working with regional research institutes to build the local ecosystem necessary for nourishing new climate-friendly technologies, to ensure a green and sustainable tomorrow for India.”"
11,The Dark Side of Medical Testing in America,news-society," Shortly after medical testing labs across the country began using new recordkeeping and compliance checklist software, strange and frightening things began happening. In Pittsburgh, two doctors discovered their names were electronically signed to a large number of cancer tests they never reviewed. They were to become the first whistleblowers. That was in the 1990s. More than 20 years later, whistleblowers continue to come forward, as described in this recent story that includes videos of software workarounds in action. That’s two decades of a nationwide public safety risk left to fester and grow, contributing to the more than 250,000 Americans who die of medical malpractice each year. It’s a three-pronged problem of questionable actions by some hospital officials, oversight that needs to be more objective and more than one software platform that is easily manipulated. On its homepage, MediaLab Inc. boasts of more than two million policies and procedures managed by its software, making one of the widest used in the U.S. Therein lies the problem, and the horror. Whistleblower “Jim” is one of many to step forward about serious flaws in the software that allow for heinous misuse. He is a verified industry insider and expert who has delved deep into the software and the issue as a whole. “No other compliance software works like this, that allows for backdating, changing reports and logging in as someone else. There are so many loopholes in its bad coding,” “Jim” said. It has less security than any software he’s seen and he challenges its compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations because, for instance, all users within a facility can see everyone else’s password in plain text. It also puts patient confidentiality at risk. Poor engineering, or bad intent? “I haven’t been able to find any bugs in it. These functions are the software’s main job. It’s not unintended functionality. This is the way it was designed.” It is likely, “Jim” said, that given the otherwise stellar reputation of MediaLab founder Dr. Paul Fekete, the loopholes are the result of “growing pains.” The platform was designed for continuing education testing for medical workers. It is insufficient for the complex functions that have been added on since, including compliance checklists used by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) for lab accreditation and “live” procedural information. These include how to safely dispose of biohazards, such as items contaminated with Covid-19. Meanwhile, medical malpractice is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. At the very least, “Jim” said, families of the victims should be able to see lawsuits decided on the truth. “This is not big government minding someone else’s business. This is thousands of Americans dying.” Flashback to the late 1990s Not long after medical software was put into the field, doctors Susan Silver and Kenneth McCarty, both pathologists at the University of Pittsburgh Magee-Womens Hospital, discovered their signatures on Pap smears (cervical cancer tests) they had never reviewed. The hospital was using software of its own design, according to the doctors, who suspected nothing beyond an error and brought the issue to administrators for an internal fix. When that failed, they went to the state Department of Health and CAP. The lack of attention to a potentially deadly problem led both to file lawsuits. Silver’s 2003 suit, and a similar suit filed by McCarty, a few months later in early 2004, alleged that cancer screenings for hundreds of thousands of patients were falsified by 19 doctors and administrators at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Many patients were subjected to unneeded testing, after system errors were allowed to occur. Some waited as long as four years to find out their test had revealed cancer, typically at a stage that was easily treatable. The goals? Increase profits with additional testing, and fabricate a reputation for top-quality diagnostics by making it appear a physician reviewed every test, as opposed to a cytotechnologist. Dr. Silver’s lawsuit laid out more scenarios of padded testing for labs that one or more UPMC doctors had a financial stake in. Silver was harassed and blacklisted from hospitals that would have previously welcomed the Johns Hopkins-trained pathologist, and alleged several incidents of physical threatening by the chief of pathology. She eventually settled, but has since looked for other ways to address the issue. After alerting CAP, both doctors were fired, just before CAP inspectors arrived. McCarty would spend the last decade of his life fighting for patient safety. Just before he died in 2010 at 62, of the rare and aggressive neuroendocrine cancer, he allowed the suit to be settled. Prior to this, McCarty worked at Duke University Medical School, where he earned his PhD at age 21. He took a stand against a cancer test used there that was developed by a Duke researcher who failed to properly research his findings. Donna Kovacs was the Magee-Womens pathology lab worker who supplied Silver and McCarty with the evidence in patient records, including her own Pap smear, signed by a doctor who never analyzed the results. Kovacs job was to process records and send them to treating physicians. When she was fired, she filed a lawsuit for wrongful termination. Magee said Kovacs violated patient confidentiality by supplying records to the doctors. Ironically, Magee violated federal law when it filed papers that included diagnostic information on four patients, making the medical records available to anyone accessing the court records online. More cases There have been at least 10 other cases involving recordkeeping and delayed diagnoses, dating back to as early as 1996. In one, Magee-Womens paid $1.3 million to the estate of a woman who died of cervical cancer in 2004, after a years-long missed chance at treatment. It was never proven that it was a case of electronic signature falsification. It’s possible the software hid the evidence. In 1999, a 47-year-old woman from Ohio underwent a mastectomy and began radiation treatments immediately after the Magee lab gave her an advanced cancer diagnosis. It was later discovered her biopsy specimen was switched with another woman’s, whose treatment was seriously-delayed. Both were given settlements by the hospital in cases sealed by the court. In other hospitals around the country, doctors were raising alarms, including in Yakima, Washington, where ER doctors walked out in protest of recurring lab mistakes, despite continued stamps of approval by CAP inspectors. At Maryland General Hospital, while its lab equipment reliability was under scrutiny, hundreds of HIV and hepatitis test results were processed. CAP initially refused to provide the state health secretary with its inspection reports, but gave in under the threat of certifications being pulled for all Maryland labs certified by CAP. At the renowned Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, CAP cited its lab for unacceptable practices because test samples were handled in a manner that prevented them from being saved for the legally required 10 years. During the years this issue went unresolved, CAP continued to renew Mayo’s accreditation. In 2004, two Pennsylvania women whose Pap smears were processed in the Magee lab filed a class action suit against the hospital. Christine Walter and Sharon King alleged doctors’ auto-signatures were intentionally used to mislead patients into further testing (increasing hospital revenue). Those physicians had never reviewed test results. Based on the shockingly high number of patients allegedly involved, it was not the doctors who were adding these digital signatures. The software should not have allowed this to happen A year later, Common Pleas Judge Robert Horgos threw the case out on the grounds the women had not been harmed. Superior Court Judge Patrick R. Tamilia upheld the decision, stating, “Although the presence of reproduced signatures on cytotechnologist-reviewed Pap smear reports were slightly misleading, we cannot conclude appellants’ reliance on the reports was the proximate cause of their alleged injury - - the cost of medical retesting.” The courts acknowledged the falsified signatures but reduced the matter to the cost of a medical test. CAP has since revised its inspection checklist to state what should not have to be stated at all; a doctor's signature should only be affixed to pathology reports the doctor has reviewed. Two decades of unheeded alarms Whistleblowers now opt for anonymity, some due to lawsuit settlement conditions, most for fear of the retribution those before them have endured. But they continue to come forward, explaining that the risk to patient safety is too great to ignore, and that CAP’s peer review for oversight is ripe with corruption. “Jim” said he believes many CAP members, and even administrators don’t know about the problem.  He’s not making excuses for them. But they’re not talking, either. When contacted again in mid-August, nearly three months after an initial and repeated request for an interview, Media Relations Senior Manager Catherine Dolf gave what was clearly her final response, “I believe the written information I provided to you back in June was our answer.” This, despite that June email beginning with, “Before proceeding with an interview or an on-the-record reaction…” Dolf went on to write in June, “I wanted to let you know for your background only, some information I have gathered. It seems the CAP has a very limited partnership with MediaLab and all financial agreements with any CAP vendor are confidential.” This leads to questions about why CAP would not reveal all its financial dealings, and why Dolf would feel she should (although she did not specifically request) go off-the-record with such vague information. Conflict of interest? “Money is changing hands, with the company that helping people get around the mandated rules of CAP,” “Jim” said. “How can it not be a conflict of interest? Do they not see the incredible irony in endorsing a company that is helping people break their own rules?” After years of court cases that exposed the software issues, what is being done about it? Nothing, or so it appears. Fekete and MediaLab did not respond to requests for comment, and there are no reports of upgrades being provided to software users. The compliance software data is used most often in malpractice cases. So, there’s another motive for altering data, such as timestamps. That’s where potentially lifesaving case law becomes illusive. Changes made with MediaLab software leave no trace of the proof that a court requires. “If I asked you for proof and you print a report, everything appears legit. None of the changes can be digitally traced,” “Jim” said. “It’s a potentially huge risk. About 70-percent of medical decisions made are based on lab work. Imagine what can happen when the results are changed.” Making the necessary software changes would be very expensive, “Jim” said, offering a plausible reason software providers and CAP look the other way. Giving it up for the cause Whistleblowers, concerned with potentially serious and widespread consequences of flawed software put their careers on the line to in the effort toward reform, saying it’s just too serious for them to ignore. Even when discreetly trying to fix problems from within, they are up against the power of a closed system of oversight, and the ease with which they are fired for fabricated cause, or blatantly, for no reason at all. Reportedly, pathologist friends were inspecting each other’s labs as a way to further exploit the leniency of CAP’s peer review process. CAP does not hire inspectors and send them out to scrutinize and score how labs conduct business. Instead, peer review is the sole method used to assure standards are adhered to. It doesn’t take more than a handful of pathologists willing to look the other way, or not look at all, to create major problems. In the end, though, that hardly matters in light of MediaLab software’s cheats. Even the most thorough and honest inspector may unwittingly be handing out passing grades based on falsified information they have no way of detecting. Why do hospital and independent labs continue to use it? It comes back in large part to the continuing education requirements, which is what the majority of users access. The demands of their jobs put them between a rock and a hard place. Workdays are already very demanding, and after so much skills application, people know their jobs. Continuing education testing is simply not taken seriously, “Jim” said. “MediaLab is one of the more expensive compliance software platforms, but so many use it because it makes life easier for them. And when its easier for people, they post great reviews, and more hospitals buy it,” “Jim” said. “But it’s not supposed to be easier. This is about patient safety. If you cover your mistakes, you can’t learn from them. And it’s been shown that the software, in other applications, can kill people.” Who Cares? Outreach to various state and federal legislators resulted in no responses, as did an attempt to determine what is happening with New York State Senate Bill 9060. It was stalled in the Rules Committee when the 2021 session ended in June. It was proposed in late-2020 by Sen. David Carlucci, who lost his seat to re-election. Will anyone champion that bill now? “Jim” said legislation will absolutely help. While it initially sounds silly to suggest making software errors illegal, it allows for legal action to be taken against those who refuse to fix the errors, and that could be the impetus for change. Attacking it from the state level is not going to fix anything fast. Carlucci sponsored the bill when the MediaLab programming deficiencies were revealed to him by whistleblowers. No one is championing the cause at the legislative level. Federal regulations might be the better answer, “Jim” said."
12,The Evolution and Effects of Quebec Independence Movement,news-society," The independence movement in Quebec is not really a recent phenomenon, in fact, nationalistic feelings in French Canadians in forming a nation of their own has its root in pre-industrial Quebec or New France, when the inhabitants there adhered on becoming ‘Canadienne’ – a single, unique group of people living separately with their own identity from mother country France. The fall of New France to the British in 1759 only amplified nationalistic feelings inside the inhabitants of New France who were being dominated politically, economically, and culturally by the British. Indeed, the modern history of the independence movement in Quebec began in the 1960s when “the people of the province began to question the assumptions on which their apparent placid, unchanging society was founded.”  The movement slowly gained prominence in the following three decades until the sovereignty referendum of 1980. The eventual rise of the movement between the 1960s through the 1980s could be traced back through events in the following chronological order: the demise of Duplessis government and emergence of a liberal government under Jean Lesage ushering in the renewal of Quebec’s economic and social institutions, the emergence of Quiet Revolution in the early 1960s, the language movement, the surfacing of Parti Quebecoise as a political force in Quebec and finally the referendum on Quebec sovereignty in 1980. The movement and the referendum that followed have made us Canadians question the very basis of our Canadian society; it shook the foundation of the Canadian state with the very existence of the country being in question. Amongst the most profound effects of the independence movement of Quebec is the redefining of Canada as a federal state sponsoring the notion of being a truly bilingual yet a multicultural society and the transformation of French Canadian nationalism into Quebec nationalism. The death of Quebec Premier Maurice Duplessis in September 1959 marked the end of Grande noirceur – the dark age that had absorbed Quebec. “Down to 1959 or 1960 Quebec was governed through a deeply conservative political system that produced regular majorities for a premier, Maurice Duplessis, who proclaimed the superiority and the desirability of doing things the old way, preserving the old values of Quebec’s Catholic society.“   He ruled Quebec like a quasi-dictator in promoting and preserving the status-quo in Quebec. “No less than other societies Quebec was challenged by urbanization, industrialization, secularism and other facets of modernization. But to a greater degree than other societies, Quebec resisted thrust of modernization, fearing that accommodation with them would have grave social consequences, undermining its values and threatening the survival of its people.”  The premier who succeeded Duplessis was Jean Lesage, who was a liberal and a top minister under Louis St-Laurent. Lasage is credited with moving Quebec forward after the ‘dark era.’ Under Lesage’s leadership, the Liberals had ended the sixteen-year rule of the Union National Party in Quebec promising sweeping reforms in government institutions such as education, healthcare, and social welfare etc. In fact, education, healthcare, and social welfare were controlled by the Catholic clergy largely prior to the revolution. The working class, as it became increasingly urban dwellers, felt that these public institutions under the Church were unable to react to and meet their needs.  With the on slot of higher fertility rate in the general population after the Second World War and baby-boomers increasingly coming into the workforce, the Catholic Church was in lack of the resources and personnel in properly conducting these social intuitions with the altered demographic conditions. So they were forced to employ more laymen. Moreover, the change of values espoused by Quebecers which were increasingly liberal and secular, together with the decrease of religiosity in the mindset of ordinary people in Quebec resulted in reducing the role and authority of the Church in society. The reforms undertaken by the state resulted in liberalizing and transforming Quebec society and ultimately ushered in the Quiet Revolution.  According to William D. Coleman: “The independence movement was not the instigator of the Quiet Revolution or even part of that revolution, Rather it was a consequence, a product of the series of changes that began to be realized in Quebec late in the 1950s.“  The Quiet Revolution, heralded as the root of the independence movement, according to Herbert Guindon, lay in the modernization of Quebec which began with the large-scale involvement of the provincial government in Quebec society, in the early 1960s.  But this does not tell the whole story, the Quiet Revolution was not just a change in government policy, instead, it was a change in spirit or atmosphere and a change in attitude in traditional Quebec society.  “In ten years there was a radical change that affected ways of thinking, ideologies, culture… It was like a pot whose lid was kept in place by the Duplessis system; when someone dared to open it, it exploded.” Through the Quiet Revolution, French Canada had united in a new re-invigorated form and the future of the nation seemed to be of enormous promise. It was short-lived though and when it disappeared some felt loss of self-worth and their disappointment fuelled the independence movement.  The effect of the revolution became visible as the independent movement formed with the creation of the Mouvement Souverainte-Association (MSA), the predecessor of Parti Quebecoise in 1967.  “In 1967, Quebec was catapulted onto the international scene by the Montreal World’s Fair (Expo’67) that drew hordes of visitor…and was a major milestone in rising Quebec nationalism…Sovereignists were ignited by [French President] General de Gaulles’ shout from the balcony of Montreal City Hall: ‘Vive le Quebec…libre!’ That Fall, the Parti Quebecoise coalesced under Rene Levesque.” The commencement of the independence movement can be traced back to the labor dispute in Radio-Canada in 1959. The producers in the institution tried to start a labour union with the management strongly opposing such a move. The producers went on strike which lasted two months. In the end, the people blamed the Canadian Parliament and the Confederation itself for the wrong-doing, not the management of Radio-Canada or the Minister responsible. This highly symbolic event signifies the external political and economic pressure that is inflicted upon the development of Quebec society.  Some fifteen years later, the Radio-Canada incident resulted in the election of Parti Quebecoise. The Radio-Canada incident influenced the people’s opinion in Quebec, made them feel alienated, and made them question the degree of participation of francophones in federal institutions. Georges-Emile Lapalme, who was the leader of the Quebec Liberal Party from 1950 to 1958, is considered one of the fathers of the Quiet Revolution. In 1958 he wrote a manifesto in which he specified all the reforms necessary for the development of Quebec, which became the basis for the Quiet Revolution. He expressed a new role for the Quebec state which would lead the way for Quebec’s economic emancipation. To fight Duplessis’s policies, he put forward a notion of progressive nationalism. His ideas were taken up by Lesage in his election campaign. Through Lapalme’s ideas, Quebec nationalism became linked with social reform, a step forward from Duplessis’s nationalism that was based on conservative ideology. This new form of nationalism had its downturn as well as “this independence movement among French-speaking Quebecois is producing a new form of nationalism, one that often embodies a hostile and isolationist approach in pursuit of political, social and economic recognition. This new nationalism, along with multiculturalism, is affecting Canada's national identity as more people are unsure about their roots. These unexpected changes that have taken place in Canada have raised many questions about the country's future.”  Lapalm intended to have the Quebec state play a much important role in the economic development of Quebec instead of waiting for Ottawa to take the initiative, but this had a negative consequence as this neo-nationalism made Quebec going in the direction of isolationism – Quebec government doing what is necessary for its socio-political and economic development paying no heed to Ottawa and the rest of Canada, for example, the inaction of the Bill 101 which exemplifies the whole question of the Language Movement in Quebec to which we turn next. The Language Question in Quebec emerged as the next wave of political force behind the independence movement in Quebec.  The French Canadians were the majority in the province of Quebec with their French language, but in the Canadian federation, they were the minority. The language question – the status of French in Canada was exemplified first by the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism. “It examined income, occupation, and ethnicity, and revealed that in Quebec, the province where they were a majority, French Canadians were firmly at the bottom of the income and occupation heap. In federal institutions, French Canadians were simply not proportionately represented, and when they were, it was in low-status and low-paying jobs.”  So the Quebec government enacted legislation to protect their language and culture and in the years that followed, Quebec increasingly demanded for control of its cultural institutions. Looking back at Jean Lesag’s slogan: ‘maitres chez nous’ (‘masters in our own home’), of Daniel Johnson’s ‘L’egalite ou l’independance’ (equality or independence) or the enactment of Bill 101, Bill 178 and the language police”- all these events point to the fact that Quebec’s survival as a nation are directly linked to French language regulations. In 1974 the government under Robert Bourassa, a federalist Liberal, proposed to enact Bill 22, la loi sur la langue officielle that replaced a 1969 bill. Bill 22 established French as the language of workplace and government institutions. It also limited English education to only those Anglophone students who had prior education in the English medium.   They had to take an entry test to attend English schools. Bourassa was unable to win the battle he had started; only Rene Levesque was trusted enough by the Quebecers to settle the language issue, as history demonstrated.  “ Parti Quebecoise had become the only political force radical enough to make drastic changes without  concessions to the English minority and credible enough to be trusted by a population who believed the traditional parties to be linked to the still-powerful English minority.”  Rene Levesque acknowledged that it was deplorable that a nation had to legislate to validate the use of its own language in work and business, but he believed it had to be done, as a matter of survival for French Canadians who had been an enslaved race for so long. The emergence of Parti Quebecoise (PQ) was the next major event that flourished the independence movement in Quebec. “Quebec was burning and by the end of turbulent 1960s, separatism had quickly gone from being a fringe ideology to become a feasible option.”  It was a tumultuous time as a militant terrorist organization named The Front de Libération du Québec (FLQ) emerged prior to the emergence of the PQ and bombed federal mailboxes, assassinated labour and manpower minister Pierre Laporte and kidnapped British diplomat James Cross. Events in the next two decades would rock the whole of Canada to its core. Bill 101, a brainchild of PQ government was “a deliberate attempt by Parti Quebecoise to create a symbol, to show the people of ‘the country of Quebec’ that the clock had been turned back, the battle of the Plains of Abraham had been won, after all, their struggle for survival was over, and that a new life – the one the fathers and mothers of New France would have wanted - was starting.” The Parti Quebecoise defeated the Liberal government of Bourassa and came to power in 1976 which marked the renewal of the Quiet Revolution and its completion.  It was a historic moment for the people of Quebec because the Quiet Revolution was brought to the front again with its nationalist dimension. But it was not a triumph for the sovereignists yet, as in 1976 the PQ did not run on the issue of separatism rather its campaign was on the issue of good governance.  The Liberal Bourassa’s campaign was plagued by accusations of widespread corruption during its rule. PQ promised to bring the issue of independence only after a Quebec-wide referendum within five years of winning the election. In the 1980 referendum, Quebecers were asked to decide on whether to allow the government to negotiate sovereignty-association with Ottawa. “ This agreement would enable Quebec to acquire the exclusive power to make its laws, levy its taxes and establish relations abroad – in other words, sovereignty – and at the same time, to maintain with Canada an economic association including a common currency.”  Finally, the province-wide referendum took place on May 20, 1980, and the proposal to pursue secession was defeated by a 59.56 percent to 40.44 percent margin. The yes side primarily lost because of the lack of support from the Quebec businessmen. Prior to the referendum, Levesque tried to woo the business community by reassuring that sovereignty would ultimately benefit everybody including businessmen, but the business community was not moved by the assurances.  Maurice Seguin, a controversial and renowned Quebec historian doubts whether Quebec’s independence is even possible – “So on the one hand, he saw the tragedy of this conquered nation, in a minority position, for which independence was a desirable end. But on the other hand, he said: ‘It is so well kept, maybe the best-kept nation in the world, and these golden chains make its liberation difficult to achieve.”  Since Quebec was so well kept by others in current federal Canada, he doubted whether Quebec could ever achieve independence. The effects that the independence movement on Quebec and Canada between the 1960s and 1980s are: the redefining of Canada as a federal nation espousing a truly multicultural society- it is bilingual in orientation but multiethnic in composition. Another effect would be the evolution of nationalism in Quebec from French Canadian nationalism to Quebecoise nationalism. First, Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau was a powerful force on the ‘no’ side of the referendum. To contain the rising tide of Quebec nationalism, he implemented a number of strategies like promoting bilingualism with the Official Language Act of 1969, increasing francophone representation in federal government services, and increasing French language services of Radio-Canada throughout Canada.   He termed ’Quebec Nationalism’ as being ‘dead’ and proposed a renewed and revitalized form of federalism in Canada. He also proposed more economic presence of the federal government’s in the province of Quebec only if the yes side was defeated.   “Trudeau’s concept of Canada, while completely rejecting what he called Quebec nationalism, had this important aspect to it that is minority language rights across the country.“   Promoting bilingual services with minority French language established as one of Canada’s both official languages. The second effect of the independence movement was the emergence of Quebec nationalism in place of the French Canadian nationalism – to have a clearer and precise identity – a Quebec identity. This new identity defined being a Quebecoise in territorial terms; it included people living in Quebec including non-francophone people who live here. Quebec has to become more multi-ethnic to keep pace with the globalized world with increased migration. “The idea of Quebec is not and cannot be an ethnic idea; it has to be a cultural idea, encompassing people of diverse origins.” In conclusion, the rise of the independence movement is characterized by events such as the fall of the Duplessis regime and emergence of a liberal government under Jean Lesage, renewal of Quebec’s economic and social institutions, the emergence of the Quiet Revolution in the early 1960s, the language movement, the emergence of Parti Quebecoise as a political force in Quebec and finally the sovereignty referendum in 1980. Some might think that the Quebec independence movement lasted only a few decades, they are quite mistaken in understanding the history of Quebec nationalism. The roots of the movement went back to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It may have increased in certain eras and abated in other times, but it came back again and again. The only constant in the history of Quebec is the rise in self-assertion and questioning its link with Canada and finding its place in the federal system.  It may become a time when the Quebecers will completely assimilate themselves in Canada so that there would be no necessity for Quebec nationalism. Quebec nationalism may not be eternal but as long as there are people in Canada who speak French it will always come back to remind us of the struggle that has happened in Quebec through its independence movement.  The contending fact is that without the rest of Canada acting as an increasingly bilingual buffer promoting bilingualism and biculturalism, Quebec would become more and more isolated from the North American mainstream.

13,Alien Profiteering for Cosmic Engineering,news-society," Aliens, as in cosmic visitors, provokes all manner of human reactivity. Here, the characterization has nothing to do with human creatures seeking asylum or other amenities from a host country. Instead, the focus is interplanetary. Likewise, traveling the universe inspires a variety of notions. As to how such things happen, science collides with science fiction. Many questions arise. With that, quite a few have opinions. Yet, bottom-line, among humans interested in this particular field of query, as in questions usually asked by criminologists, who stand to profit. That is to say, for those in the realm of investigative inquiry, where is the gain. That comes from the classical spectrum of criminology, dealing with victim, suspects and perpetrators. In the business of selling one theory after another, particularly those of an extraterrestrial variety, there is exceptional profit potential. Capitalizing on ignorance, paranoia and primordial self-interests, provides lucrative remunerations for skillful entrepreneurs. Setting aside the vast array of conspiracy theories, the “alien agenda” attracts much interest by most people. From successful novels to television Sci-Fi portrayals, “ufology” is extraordinarily popular with huge segments of the population. In fact, much of what of the speculation about other worldly visitors comes from fictional sources. One could begin with early western space fiction in the late 19th century. Creative authors imagined fascinating cosmic adventures. From there, any assessment of the profit potential in storytelling, as it relates to alien travelers, is likely a lot of guesswork. However, there is an illusion among some writers. For the author, regarding the potential for moneymaking from writing stories about science fiction and fantasy, the probability is enormous success is low. On the production side, for an assortment of individual and corporate media companies, the potential is slightly different. With the internet, as well as various competing streaming services, conspiracy theories abound in a variety of forms. According to one prominent financial news source, media services eagerly promote “conspiratorial concepts”. If it sells, it does not matter what the evidence shows, or the scientific validation. Accordingly, one traditional magazine put the estimate of “UFO believers” in the range of about two thirds of the American population. The likelihood of a higher correlation is probably a good assumption. Therefore, approximately three out of every four Americans accept the notion of alien lifeforms, with roughly one in three believing aliens have visited earth. Given that belief systems vary, and motivations are diverse, one aspect that stands out permeates the social strata. Making a living from “UFO phenomena. One online blog suggests that not everyone profits, but some do very well. By writing books, gaining a following and grabbing international notoriety, along with media promotions, a few make the genre lucrative. In furthering the discussion concerning the “alien agenda”, another aspect involves constructing a cosmos teaming with life everywhere. This notion, aside from any monetary advantages for one person or another, is a more fascinating temptation. One online science forum for instance mentioned the “Fermi Paradox”. This suggest the contrast between the lack of scientific evidence and the probability of other life forms in the cosmic order. Where are the aliens? Better yet, where is the data? In other words, what scientific hardcore validation produces the viability of proof beyond any doubt? Perhaps in post-modern America that is too extreme. Forget that nonsense about evidentiary criteria. Presently there appears a resurgence of not only anti-intellectualism, but also anti-science thinking. Mere speculation based on eyewitness testimony, as an example, is insufficient. Logically speaking, bias influences conclusions at every opportunity, while the observer influences his or her observations. Opinions, rumors, hearsay, and gossip offer nothing of consistent provable data to substantiate probabilities. As suggested by one scientist, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. As to science, here the inference is in favor of those areas such as astrophysics, astronomy, biology, chemistry, and physics to name a few. Often, some call this realm the “hard sciences”. Meanwhile, in the alleged “soft sciences”, or protestations of the pseudosciences, philosophies thrive in the areas of criminology, psychology, sociology and theology. While a few freely admit the sphere of the “social studies” areas are not hard sciences, others cringe, as they desperately want consideration as a “scientist”. In that dominion, debates can rage as to whom is the most scientific, others can assess who cares. Regardless, evidence remains critical. In the imaginative processes of thinking, many people are quite creative. So far, for a majority of alien adherents, the inventiveness of cosmic engineering designs a universe teeming with all kinds of life forms. With billions of possible habitats, why not? Unfortunately, again hard evidence does not suffice the near religious conviction of science fiction enthusiasts. In this reference, several researchers provide commentary for the assertion that alien aficionados pursue a “theological” conviction for advanced cosmic species. Elevated to a divine state of intergalactic supremacy, believers place humans in a subservient role to alien ascendancy. For this discussion, the term “profit” is not limited to the monetary incentive alone. Instead, the application applies to any form of gain derived from promoting, advocating or otherwise proselytizing a cosmic or supernatural perspective. Notably, this doe not mean there is anything wrong with any belief system as an individualized personal point of view. At least for the time being, in America, everyone is entitled to her or his outlook. Alternatively, when “profitability” and intolerance for opposing perspectives enter the public arena, problems arise. Disputes and disagreements in communal discourse ought to allow for the reasonable engagement. All too often, in contemporary mainstream, dangerous condescension quickly devolves discussion. Regardless, conspiracy theories of one form or another abound in great abundance, particularly in the allegedly “highly educated” U.S. population. Revisit that for a moment. Logical skepticism, reinforced by scientific and forensic analysis seems woefully deficient in the “postmodern” American framework. While some potentially maintain amazing brilliance in niche or domain subsets, areas of particular expertise, outside that, ignorance astounds the few. From alien DNA creating humans to 21st century “sociopolitical tribalism”, many pursue a claim to fame. Fake news, scheming hoaxes and all manner of hucksterism manifest an array of con artistry. In a devolving society, allowing that supposition for the moment, not much in terms of intellectual advancement has a high probability of exception. The vast stretches to global ramifications further the conceptualization of an intellectually eroding population. As to the opportunistic possibilities, criminals of every sort take advantage of targets of opportunity. Social media is rife with foolish pretentiousness of “tubular selfie-isms”. By “tubular”, the verbiage intends reference to those who feel the need to exhibit themselves in a podcast recreation of them. For “them”, metaphorically inferring an alternative form of self-centeredness. A tube, a podcast, a video channel in some streaming service boasts the superficially of limited knowledge and understanding of the mysteriousness surrounding the world. Not to forget of course, the nature of exceptionality. Yet, exceptions to a notion of rampant social media foolishness, and the spread of erroneous commentary, is a small percentage.  At critical junctures of communal battles for truth versus fiction, where facts become annoying distractions, desired needs for self-validation rage rampantly. Mental conflicts struggle against the realization that growing up and developing mature self-evolving transition requires extraordinary discipline. For most people, adolescence embraces the cowardice of refusing to transform. Personal liberation in every aspect of individual ideation is a frightening prospect for nearly everyone. Again, exceptionality applies. Disengagement from the status quo, the contrived consensus and the enforced normality, is psychically rebellious and invites retaliation. Whatever is defined as “normal” depends on the range of communal acceptance. At any given time, resistance is not futile in the sense that acceptance of consequences is understood. Yet, many cowards creep the landscape of social interactivity. From selfie neediness in self-promoting “tube shows”, to pretentious pontifications of “opining blogs”, the ruse of anti-science faux intellectualism fogs the atmosphere of social discourse. Foolishness abounds with rabid proliferation via superficial mimicry in the excessive use of techno gadgetry. Ignorance in self-importance wears many disguises. In echoes of the past, an assertion that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, for most that is quickly overshadowed by retaliatory invective. In response to a probable rational inquiry, hunting for the evidentiary validation, many will do little to expand, enhance or otherwise enrich their innate abilities beyond the pseudo-intellectual babble of social media. For none of those with the power to exemplify an enlightened ascendency will demonstrate exceptionality of honorable personality. Its too personal, much material gain or psychic fame profane any inclination to the bravery of differentiation. Selfishness is far too critical an essential necessity for many, if not most often the attendant example. The blasphemy of stupidity spreads everywhere. For the serious, that is to say, the mature grownup and self-evolving investigator, profound non self-serving objectivity is a powerful force to harness. As bias most always influences the conjecture of generalized conclusions. An observer of phenomenon typically infuses subsequent notions with his or her bias, prejudices and personal dysfunctions. In the pseudosciences, the “social studies” arena, particularly criminology, psychology, sociology and theology, extraordinary bias promotes a diversity of nebulous notions. Anecdotal speculation, opined self-importance, and exaggerated so-called “peer review” blur the efficacy of scientific validation. Meanwhile, maturity keeps watch near the playpen in the nursery of infantile ideas. Maturation in the investigative process moves beyond the resume’, or the curriculum vitae in the unnecessary advocacy of personal adulation. No title or rank supersedes the vitality of hardcore X-rated, in the face flush of provable scientific sufficiency. Nonetheless, the wonderful world of creative fiction, in movies, television, books and short stories, portrays the improbable as the probable. For which, many, including those who ought to know better, salaciously desire the fiction of “fact”. Subjective validation in hopefulness for the fabrication to be reality permeates the vast reaches of the societal mainstream. Social media enjoys complicity. In view of the abundance of fake news, social media distortion and mainstream media sales propaganda, profiteering on ignorance is extremely lucrative. Such deliberate status quo enforcement of ideological superficiality and ethical inconsistency contrives a diversity of intellectual challenges. While this remains one dimension of foolish narcissism, the infantile self-interests span many other spectrums of societal connectedness. Within multigenerational life cycles, other dimensional factors collusively mix educational processes, institutional environments, governmental mechanisms, and various forms of consumptive consumerism. Along with the vast reach of entertainment venues, movies and television play a big role. The discerning inquisitor faces monumental quests in sifting through the massive amounts of data to uncover the reality of factual authenticity. Every day in every techno way, streams of sound bites filled with ads, commercials, apps, promos, etc., fog the awakened state of consciousness. Alleged documentaries, pretentious “news” stories, and movie making science fiction boast a variety of other worldly manifestation. There is a reason fiction is called fiction, particularly when it comes to the realm of pseudoscience.  It’s a fabrication, untruth and deliberate misrepresentation of reality. Yet, most people will accept fictional portrayals as seemingly quasi-truthfulness. Few people insist upon a reasonable level of skepticism and a healthy sense of objectivity. In the 21st, belief in the paranormal, the supernatural and the extraterrestrial has grown. Ghosts, goblins, gremlins and little green space creatures garner daily attention across a wide swath of society. According to a major university study in 2015, in spite of advances in the technology, the vast majority of the population cling to a variety of supernatural beliefs. More than two thirds, or abut 73% of the American population believe in “other worldly” manifestations. According to that study, as well as others, “alien issues”, from UFO’s to abductions and visitations, fall within those beliefs. As conspiracy theories abound, aliens play a central role in the deception. The profit is in the prophet, and the prophecy is the conspiracy for the fabrication of wishful thinking. Realizing of course that “profit” has many aspects, from the psycho realm to the vast sphere of materiality. Transcending the metaphorical implication of alien profiteering for cosmic engineering, the inference inclines toward the multiplicity of illicit conspiracies. Rampant throughout the west in particular, where intellectual achievement is a hallmark of social blaster and academic blather, remains the salacious gratification of conspiratorial flirtations. In the macabre fascination of politicians, pundits and priestly proselytes, the unscientific and inexperienced “influencers”, most will pursue the misdirection of their celebrity worship. For so long as gain is the sensual claim to fame, the essence of rational reality devolves to they mystic notions of collective gratification at any cost. A kind of cosmic collective hedonism spreads throughout social media as though everyone is “expert” in the diverse realm of the sciences. Not only that, but a mere selfish framework of ideological totalitarianism sweeps the “infotainment” networks in counterproductive intolerance. In general, the “alien conspiracy” aids the widespread conglomeration of one fake claim after another, and is representative of a devolving culture. As some would assert, many people willingly surrender common sense for self-interest. As to “alien profiteering”, it is a typecast, a euphemism, and a reworded understatement of public pablum to pacify the ignorance of a devolving age. Collectively hedonist, the rush to consume endlessly all manner of “self-medicating” escapism, an externality of blame and shame degrades the very nature of truthful investigative intellectual processes. Not to be seen as different, accepting the status quo unquestionably, embracing unproved consensus, and cowering in complicity, most will assemble in the crowded halls of hasty generalizations. To satiate fears rather than advance intellectual ascension, emotional reactivity evades logical consistency. Nonetheless, the gurus of material gain, perpetrate the sleight of hand legerdemain whenever profitably possible. There will always be followers without question who willfully pursue their own confirmation bias in the illusion of personal affirmation. In one study, a flashback to the past suggested that scholars, from the sphere of anthropological investigation, nearly 75 years ago, predicted that “irrational supernatural” thinking would erode toward higher reaches of rational scientific investigative inquiry. However, such a prediction, instead, faded to the continual rise of the hunt for phantoms, ghosts, and Martians. Logical thinking suffers painfully. One study suggests, out of an academic pursuit, that normality for Americans includes a strong belief in other worldly things. Seemingly, a conjecture might claim that for many people, believing in themselves in not a particularly vital factor. Instead, embracing things outside the extraordinary nature of human potential is preferred. As intellectual pursuits slowly fade, the enormous reliance on social media, techno-gadgetry and magical thinking, takes the place of critical analysis. With the massive availability of “cosmic” entertainment means, like books, movies, television shows, and so forth, it is all too easy to let others do the thinking. Binge watching the “magic” unfold in a pseudoscientific drama, while clinging to the rush of cell phone digitation, provides the wonderfully shallow fulfillment of amative excitation. As celestial dimensions of biased intentions satiate alien profiteering for cosmic engineering reality fades to the shadows."
14,"Covid Conspiracies and the Animal Rights community in Victoria, Australia",news-society," Let us think rationally if that is possible. Why would any government, left, right, or in the middle, proceed with the up-popular choice of a lockdown if they did not believe it was the only choice available at the time? Seriously think about that. I grew up with politics being something that one should always take notice of. As a child, there was always political talk happening around the house. My parents were both politically engaged and encouraged their children to be the same. Mum didn't just watch a little April cry, absolutely devastated at the sight of the Dolphin slaughter in Japan, instead Mum offered actions I could take for positive change (an animal rights activist was born). I was not taught to blindly accept what our governments or other authorities put forward, but rather to question and fight for change if I felt it was needed. I have lived my life like that and have taught my children the same. For those in the movement of animal rights who are on the side of covid deniers, anti-vaxxers or so-called freedom fighters; do you realise what calling for the sacking of Dan Andrews would mean? Who do you propose an alternative - Michael O'Brien? The re-hashed Matthew Guy? Seriously, anyone from the right side of politics? As an example of where the loyalties of the Liberal/coalition lie, the previous Agriculture Minister in the Dennis Napthine Coalition Government, Peter Walsh, (who still sits in parliament), told me he felt sorry for me not having dairy in my diet, and no, he would not change the legal stance of baby calves allowed to go 30 hours without food and water before these babies are slaughtered. No, this also has not changed under our current state government of the Labor party, but a whole lot has in the positive direction for animals. I seriously encourage you to look through the voting history of the right and see that animals have ZERO HOPE under a Liberal/coalition government. The Liberal/coalition's stance on anything is making a dollar, especially off someone they can exploit and enslave as easily as animals. Yes, I am firmly rusted on the left side of politics. I come from a working-class family and stand with workers and the unions that support them. I also stand with anyone, no matter their species, who is disadvantaged or discriminated against. I was not always like this, although, always left. I didn't see my learned racism. I didn't see my learnt sexism. My family are not horrible people, but there is subtle and not so subtle racism and sexism. I met a beautiful man when I was 19, and he was patient with me. No, he was/is not perfect – like all of us – far from it, but he has always been one to fight against most 'isms', particularly racism (like me, he is learning to un-learn our subtle sexism). At the risk of sounding like a complete tosser, we are all on a journey of learning. We all want someone to blame or rail against, but sometimes there is no one to blame. Humans are not immune to disease. It is arrogant to suggest this. Coming up with a conspiracy theory and claiming that Covid 19 is not real suggests that arrogance. We are susceptible to disease, and we have had pandemics reign upon our species before. We are a smart species in some ways (yet so so stupid in others – think climate change). We are smart enough to keep beating Mother Nature as she tries to curb our species on this planet – and quite rightly so when you look at the damage our species causes. We can fight disease with the invention of many medicines. I'm sure even the anti-vaxxers have all had a dose or two of penicillin in their lives. We also have vaccines that have almost irradicated certain diseases that attack our species – like measles and polio. I believe in science. Science and the scientists that study and research our planet and all who inhabit it are incredible. That is why I trust the science that these scientists have come up with to battle this pandemic, and I urge all to do the same so we can all move forward and overcome this Covid 19 virus. I also urge all to adopt a vegan diet to prevent more zoonotic diseases from attacking our species. This change also makes a massive positive contribution to stopping climate change, and the best thing about living vegan - you are no longer a contributor to animal suffering."
15,Democracy in the Crosshairs,news-society," I have been a witness to the democratic process for many, many years. I have participated in numerous elections that have brought to office Democrats and Republicans of various philosophies and styles, but I have never before been worried through all of these various changes that our democracy was in danger of not surviving. A democracy is based on the rule of law and when there is an assault on our laws, that is an assault on our democracy. Because I am so concerned, I have been paying more attention to the political changes that are occurring not only in our country but also in the world. I have begun to realize that what is happening in our country is not an isolated event, but is also happening all over Europe. Right wing parties and leaders are running on the same hate agenda as our former president and the current Republican party and getting elected. That agenda is immigration issues and stoking long simmering hatreds and using these issues to gain power and install systematic corruption. The rise of right-wing nationalism in Europe is widespread, and it is making gains in the following countries: Italy–17.4% Germany– 12.6% Spain–10% Austria–26% France –13% Sweden—17.6% Estonia—17.8% Hungary–49%–19% Anti-immigrant laws are being passed in-- Denmark–21% The Netherlands–13% The Czech Republic–11% Right-wing nationalists across Europe and also here in America are now sensing an opportunity. The immigration issue is the catalyst that is causing this world fear and intolerance and is a world problem which must be confronted and solved by all freedom loving people in all the countries of Europe and America working together. Because of climate change, natural disasters, wars, gangs and dictatorships around the world, and the ending of the war in Afghanistan, large numbers of refugees are fleeing their countries to try to survive. This will only continue to increase if the world does not become more stable. What will happen to these millions of refugees? Will the world close their eyes to the fate of all of these vulnerable people and this overwhelming human crisis and pretend it is not happening or should the compassionate countries of the world get together to solve this enormous problem by taking action? World leaders working together must now begin to stabilize those countries at risk and address the problems that are causing this flight of refugees. Leaders need to decide on a fair number of refugees that each country can absorb. if they don’t begin to address these unsolved problems, their inaction will ultimately destabilize the whole world. We need to be very concerned about what is happening. If we are not aware of this assault on world democracy, then we are all in danger of eventually losing our freedom both in America and elsewhere in the world. When hate becomes the norm, not only refugees and minorities are at risk, but it endangers the freedom of all of us. We must become more aware of this imminent danger to democracy and do all that we can to ensure that this catastrophe will never happen here."
16,The Continuing Fight for Equality,news-society," “We hold these truths to be self-evident. That all men are created equal. That they are endowed, by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. That among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.""-- Thomas Jefferson 1801-1809 The congress will be voting soon on the voting rights Bill HR1—the For the People Act. Why are we still fighting for equality and the right to free access to voting for all of our citizens in 2021.The Republicans in state legislatures in many states are passing bills to limit access to voting. They have already passed over 200 bills to do that. In a democracy that is unacceptable and limits all of our rights and ultimately will destroy our democracy. We, the people, cannot allow them to do this. That is why voting rights bill HR1 must pass and be a protection for us all. The United States and the world have been fighting discrimination for as long as people have walked on this earth. It has been the Catholics against the Protestants, discrimination against the Jews, Jews in conflict with Palestinians, crimes against Chinese workers and other Asians, The Crusades--Christians against the Muslims. Arab tribes against each other. intolerance between whites and blacks. The truth is that people do not like or trust others who are different than they are. It takes understanding and wisdom to learn to get along even in loving families. We have come to a point in our world that we must learn to live together in peace and harmony or we will all ultimately die together because unless we learn to come together and solve our difficult problems together this civilization will ultimately disintegrate through nuclear destruction or unaddressed natural disasters like climate change. Most of our religions have all tried to teach us to love and respect each other, but unfortunately some have also caused us to distrust anyone who is different.. Our moral and ethical leaders have worked hard to bring us closer to becoming more tolerant of differences. We cannot and should not force other people, whether it is our families or our fellow citizens, to think and feel as we do, but we must learn to respect the opinions and the choices of others as long as they also respect our opinions and our choices. We must all learn to make the effort to live together with respect and in peace. I don't know what the religions or political opinions or races of my neighbors on my street are, but we have all lived side by side for many years—each living the life that suits them and we are a good community. Each of us must now look into our own hearts and root out the distrust that we might feel for those who are different from us and begin to live with more respect and tolerance for every human being in the US and in the world. We must reject words and deeds of intolerance and hate whether they come from our families, our religions, our communities, our TV's or our social media. Respect and tolerance for all human beings is the only option that will ultimately save our democracy and our planet."

18,A Question of Survival,news-society," Recently I was watching the movie Conquest of Paradise with Gerard Depardieu, a movie about Columbus and his discovery of the new world. As I was watching the cruelty that occurred in those days (1492)– the Spanish Inquisition and the brutality of what was done to the native populations when soldiers from a foreign country came in and killed them at will and took everything they possessed, I realized that although more than 500 years have passed and our world has changed in so many ways, we are still killing each other at the same pace and for the same reasons as we did so many hundreds of years ago. Why, when the world has become so modern with the invention of cars, planes, new medical techniques our enhanced communication through the internet and so much new knowledge about psychology and the better understanding of the subconscious motivations and drives of human beings, why then are we still functioning in this primitive, brutal way. With vast numbers of smart, educated people able to achieve so many modern inventions and innovations to make our lives safer and better and our astronauts exploring the vastness of outer space, why is it that these same smart, educated people still cannot figure out how we can learn to get along with each other better both in our families or in our world. I think perhaps the answer is that no one is really willing to make the effort and spend the required money to try to solve these most important and crucial world issues on which our very survival is ultimately dependent. Our scientists have already warned us that we have now come to the tipping point in our civilization. We will either begin to collectively work with our world partners to face the real problems of our world or we will all continue to go on as we have with blinders on and go to our destruction together in the not too distant future. Why are we not facing our world problems with wisdom and determination to find solutions? I think that our leaders and our citizens are just so ill-equipped and frightened to look at the reality and the challenges of the future that we all just want pretend that everything is fine and there are no problems. It is called denial! To solve climate change will mean changing our society in many new ways. It will mean changing from fossil fuels to renewable energy, with the loss of old ways and old jobs and the beginning of new technologies and new jobs. “Humanity will have given up on planet Earth if world leaders cannot reach an agreement this year to stop the mass extinction of wildlife and destruction of life-supporting ecosystems.” Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, the acting executive secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, has implored governments to ensure 2021 is not just another “year of conferences” on the ongoing ecological destruction of the planet, urging countries to take definitive action on deforestation, pollution and the climate crisis. “Humanity will have given up on planet Earth if world leaders cannot reach an agreement this year to stop the mass extinction of wildlife and destruction of life-supporting ecosystems,” the United Nation’s new biodiversity chief has warned. Change is always hard and is resisted by many, but when survival is at stake we don’t have any more options. It must be done and as Elizazbeth Maruma Mrema warns it must be done now–this year– 2021. Another challenge that is destabilizing the world is the intermingling of people of different backgrounds, religions and race. Many populations are being displaced because of internal conflicts, climate change and natural disasters. All religions teach us to be tolerant and respect our fellow man. It is time that we followed our oldest values of love and respect. It is often difficult to tolerate others who look and think differently than we do, but if we respect each other and strive to learn to understand each other better and to live together in peace, than although our world will look different and be different than it is now, it will be one of stability and harmony. If every citizen and every leader dedicates himself to working toward these goals now, addressing climate change and dealing wisely and humanely with displaced populations than perhaps we can still avoid the imminent disaster that is awaiting our world in our lifetime."
19,PlayBox Technology´s charity celebrates anniversary,news-society," Don Ash Foundation, a non-profit organisation, established in the year 2018 in the UK, which works together with grassroots organisations, to help transmit the message of the importance of early childhood development and the consequences for the future of our children into the agenda, in order to maximise the efforts to improve the programmes and policies that help young children to reach their full potential, celebrates its third anniversary. Some of the areas given greater emphasis by the Don Ash Foundation include positive parental behaviour, children's mental health, increased participation of handicapped children as well as efforts to reduce violence against minors. “The welfare of children remains our major priority”, says Maya Gocheva-Ash, chair of Don Ash Foundation, “Awareness programmes for the public in the areas of health, nutrition, responsive care and early education are the key to building better lives for children.” The objective of the Don Ash Foundation is to encourage educational and economic prosperity in societies that support children. The Foundation is governed by values of honesty and transparency, scalability and efficiency when picking projects to support them. To celebrate its third anniversary, the charity has launched a Small Grant Application scheme to support smaller charities and community groups to promote early childhood development. The main objective of this Grants programme is to encourage non-for-profit sector to raise awareness on early childhood development and to nourish actions to its implementation. Grant funding shall be provided under the priority categories listed in the Foundation’s Areas of Intervention. The Small Grants Scheme will provide funding for activities and services in the local community for organisations and groups. Proposals with budgets of up to £5,000 for first time applicants and £20,000 for recurring applicants and will be considered for award. ""We've been very conscious of the challenges that the charities and the grass root organisations are facing over the past year, and now that we emerge from lock-downs and reopening sites, funding from this programme is ever more important for the community,"" Mrs. Gocheva-Ash said. ""Hopefully such funds may make a difference and assist the provision of important services for local communities by volunteer and community organisations. I am glad our assistance reaches the neediest."""
20,"Remember the 2019, UCH class of 1986 Reunion in Hyattsville, Maryland 20783, USA?",news-society," It’s hard to believe, but true. Two years have passed since the last reunion. Even though the passage of time has reshuffled the sequences of the event, its memorable highlights remain unforgettable. Like the moment I sat between Barry and Wong, and Ngozi walked over to the low-level stage platform of the ballroom. Reading my mind and body language, Barry said, ""She will sing. Do you want to join? Go join."" Hesitating a little at first, I got up off the chair, walked over to the platform, and began to sing alongside her. It was one of those irresistible emotional gospel songs that cause people to temporarily forget themselves because they are in the same rhythm with nature. Chima As the singing went on, Chima was crosschecking the words of a song written on a white piece of paper. Moments later, he flew from the back of the ballroom to upstage us. Adjusting the microphone a little up to the height of his dark blue lips, he began to sing a classic folksy song, ""Omo-opupa."" Though the song was in a vernacular most did not understand, something about the tempo and the lyrics of the song made it irresistible. Suddenly, craziness took over the reunion. Everybody wanted to sing and dance Omo-opupa. Fred frog-leaped onto the stage to sway and twist his torso, and then he yanked the microphone from Chima as he took over as the lead singer. Morafe could not help himself, so he cut in to join them, and then Gbenga ran over to the stage, slashing and surfing with his feet. If that particular moment were the only event of the 2019 reunion, I and many others would have gone home completely satisfied. However, many more spectacular events were concurrently and consecutively happening. Irene gave a testimony full of courage, triumph, and perseverance. A woman of such character, grace, and eloquence in the face of astronomical challenges taught many of us lessons that the college of medicine could not have taught. From Mafullul's wife came another powerful voice of courage, resilience, and enlightenment. Then, Yinka introduced a songster. ""She will sing two songs,"" he promised. That was an understatement. When she took over the microphone, her artistry and her strong voice could have been an entire reunion, and folks like me would have gladly gone home satisfied. With song after song, we were in a mood where everything, including gestures and remarks, provoked laughter. I tried but lost count on how frequently we laughed out loud. We laughed when Andy said that the ""first Malawian I met, I married."" Laugh bubbled up the high ceiling when Mase revealed that his son Issa was engaged to a girl named Lisa. ""Should Lisa and Issa get married, I will sew them, Ashoke,"" said Faweya, and everybody laughed, again and again, none stop, some sobbing uncontrollably. Goze At a corner by the left of the dance platform, the indefatigable Goze decided to show off his dancing moves, which sent everybody into another frenzy of laughter. People were drunk with laughter. Chinwe laughed until tears dropped off his eyeballs onto the white drapes covering the table in front of him. That same night--or it could have been the night after, my memory has faded--at a strategic position near the high table, Leex, who, seconds ago had spurred Bunmi to a boxing combat, lowered his fist when he stared at Vero's disapproving eyes. Noticing what had happened, we laughed again. Minutes later, many eyes watched couples after couples dance briefly before being signaled to return to their seats, finally leaving the dancing floor to the longest-married couple of the class of 1986 – Folarin-Shitt-Bey. You would think that people drowned in delight and emotions were incapable of taking thoughtful actions. Yes, we still took care of important business. Perfect silence was observed when Pastor David Ijeh and Morafe prayed. We all commiserated when, in his usual reflective manner, John called for a moment of silence for classmates who had passed on to eternal life. And when the friends of Sam Best, who was streaming online, lined up to salute him, the reunion was in full arousal for 30 minutes. The Money man More “wow!” moments followed when the arousal subsided. Adewale talked about his work to build an enviable hospital and recruit the best clinicians in Ogun state. Hearing from Titilola and Moji gave the class confidence in the potentials of the medical system in Nigeria. Responding to the class president's (Yemi) call to show up and brag, colleagues pledged over $85,000 in donations to help their beloved Alma Malta, University College Hospital Ibadan, UCH. Speaking of Leslie, Vero said, ""He has always responded and came to our rescue whenever we run into money issues."" Luck struck when, the “Esere-ego” (the money man) of the class, Emma N., throwing dollars at a book donated by Leex and auctioned by TG, out-bid everyone to purchase the book for $2,000. Adora Nearby, sitting across from N. Bardwaj, Emma O., nostalgically watched the parade of “who among the class has changed the least since leaving medical school in 1986.” When the dust settled, the reunion declared Simsola as the least-changed person in the 1986 class. Ajibola was a close runner-up. We were not sure where Adora belonged. Some said she had changed, while others said that she had remained the same. With her classmates unable to make up their minds, Adora declared, ""I have changed for greater things."" Applause followed. Roro was in another class of the unchangeable colleagues. He played saxophone throughout the event, with enough skill and professionalism to wipe away all his transgressions, past, present, and future. Jenny Brown did not disappoint, either. When I ran into her and was trying so hard to remember her, she fired back, telling me that she has never seen me in her life. Then, I knew she had to be Jenny Brown, all smiles and candid as ever. So much caring went on, as well. Everyone contributed in their areas of expertise. People hugged people they never hugged during their six years in medical school. Men embraced and lifted each other in the air. Women held each other tight as if they did not want to lose them to impending age, frailty, distance, and time. On my trail to track Frank, I felt a tug on my back collar, and a voice said, ""Can I fix your collar?” “Please do,” I said. The voice belonged to Anita. Soon later, another voice said to me, ""This t-shirt is too tight on you. Take it off and wear another one."" Okay, Ify, I said. When it came to crunch time, Qaiser provided real-time cost estimates on intended class projects. Greg Everything would have been perfect had all who came were recognizable. The brochure, which put old and new faces side by side, did a lot to help people put names to strange faces. That notwithstanding, it still took hours and days after the event ended to recognize some faces. For example, by the lobby to the ballroom, a short distance from where Adanna and Mordi were working on their laptops, the person who threw out both wrists and gently requested that Chairman Chuks help pin the sleeves of his black suit ended up three days later to be my dear friend Greg. ""Damn it!"" I said when I got back home. Another person who had a sizable goatee, who I hugged a thousand times pretending to recognize him, ended up three days later to be Kunle, A. What missed opportunities. Had I recognized them at the event, my conversations would have been more intimate, and the hugs and shakes a million times more treasured. Indeed, the best friendships are those formed under communal pressure. For six years, we learned together, woke each other up to read, and helped each other cram last-minute answers to “past exam questions” that landed on our laps from “never to say places.” We endured together under our Alma Mata, the University College Hospital (UCH) Ibadan. Now, in middle age, there is an intense urgency to enjoy one another and to share our differences as well as what we have in common. Leo Before the event ended, people started buzzing about the next upcoming reunion. Whenever it comes, (they did not foresee the 2020 COVID pandemic), it will outshine the past ones, they said. I agree. For one thing, we have not yet seen all our classmates. Everybody saw and heard the roar that followed the entry of Leo and Wong, both attending for the first time. Imagine the uproar that would occur when men like Ukah,  Ochei, Okey, Jaja, Somebody, Ik and OjehB--, Nwokocha, Bertrand, Jimoh, Gafar, Sandeep, Bamidele, Akparanta, and Vince, just to mention a few, had shown up. We did not want to go home, but we did. “Start planning for the upcoming event in 3 years,” an optimistic voice announced across the hall as people stood and said goodbye and began to return to their hotel rooms. Obi I caught up with Obi on my way back to the hotel room. ""Let me tell you,"" he said as we walked from the ballroom back to the hotel room, ""this was a heck of a reunion."" ""I agree completely,” I said. “It is the Sobhan et al. effect. That guy Sobhan did not change a bit in speed and agility.” While we stood still waiting for the elevator to come down, Obi said again “Let me tell you, don’t forget about Chairman Chuks and the many committees and their chairpersons.” I could only nod in affirmation, for by this time the elevator had come down and its doors were about to open. “All hands were on the deck” he added as the elevator sped up. “Great thing that Vero remembered at the last minute to mention it-- you did a great job with the brochure,” I said to him. A smile rippled across his forehead and vanished inside his gray beards. Then, the elevator doors opened on the third floor. On his way out of the cabin, I said, “See you at the next reunion.”"

1,How Will Freelance Be 1 Year from Now,news-society," Freelancing has grown to become a significant source of income for many. Future predictions suggest that many people will join the fast-growing job sector. An Upwork study found that 12% of the workforce in the U.S. worked as freelancers in 2020. This was after the effects of the COVID pandemic. Massive layoffs rendered many jobless, forcing them to seek alternatives to make ends meet. This article features current trends in the sector and future expectations. Below I have highlighted four Reasons for the Growth of Freelancing over traditional Jobs Many people will ditch traditional jobs in the future. People who ventured into working from home jobs amid the pandemic experienced a different feeling. Businesses and corporates are at an advantage too. It's now easier to offer staff flexible working hours. Total acceptance is expected in most sectors in the future. This means more opportunities will arise. The emergence of modern tech solutions has been crucial for this sector. It provides a solution to many problems that were hard to solve in the past. Amid the current pandemic crisis, technology has eased communication. It's now possible to hold online meetings via platforms such as Zoom, Slack, and Airtable. Employers can now access the services of professionals through various freelance marketplaces People don't have to show up for work daily. They can now cut on transport costs, expensive outfits, and food. Employers will get to save on office space and hire people for only specified projects. To get started, all you need to have is a computer and a stable internet connection. The jobless can now secure a source of income. Marketing is also affordable. Businesses can use social platforms at cheaper costs for advertising. The new entrants in the work landscape are Gen Z members. The group comprises its first members at the age of 18-22. The fading hopes of securing government and corporate jobs will force many to think of other alternatives. The cohort is different from the rest of the groups since they were born in the internet era. This generation is more equipped with skills and education than the preceding. More than 36% of the Gen Z Workforce in the U.S. ventured into freelance in 2020 (Upwork). Important Freelance Statistics to Consider Few statistics worth pointing out from the recently released Upwork's Future Workforce Report. •	Two-thirds of the self-employed earn more than full-time employed workers. That is, 65% of persons who ditch formal employment end up making more in self-employment. •	Youths comprise the most significant percentage in this industry. The Gen Z cohort (18-22 years) accounts for 50%. •	62% of employers will opt to outsource in the future. They stated that outsourcing workers satisfied their expectations. Final Remarks Freelancing is the future of work. A year from now, an exponential increase in the number of independent workers is expected. This field offers a flexible alternative to traditional employment. The development of technology is the main factor for the rapid growth in this sector. Globalization and the growth of online payment platforms will catapult the industry."
2,HESTON RUSSELL OP-ED - BUREAUCRATIC BOX-TICKING,news-society," Sunday, 11 July 2021, saw the anticlimactic announcement that the last of Australia’s military personnel have been withdrawn from Afghanistan, a conflict that saw over 39,000 veterans deployed over the 20 years our country committed to the coalition against terrorism. During the conflict, 41 Australian Veterans lost their lives, with over 700 more lost to suicide during the same period, as the true cost of our deployment continues to be realised. For the majority of Australians back home, our country’s commitment to this far away land was an initial focal point post the September 11 attacks on the United States. However, since then, much like our political strategy in the conflict, we have heard silence except for commemorating those who paid the ultimate sacrifice, or those who won the highest awards our country can offer. What we have not heard is of the true commitment and success of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and women who, for two decades, represented our country to the finest of our national values. Australian Defence personnel who earned the reputation of being feared by our enemies, loved by the locals, and first-pick partners and allies within the coalition of the willing. Instead, the Australian public is now seeing images and reports of the Taliban re-claiming the land we fought to free. We are left to watch as bureaucrats try to explain the red tape and paper stacks that are preventing those who fought and worked alongside us, and their families, from being protected from assured death. Payment for their loyalty to our democratic ways. It is during these times as the question of “was it worth it?” grows louder, that we’re seeing some of the greatest injuries and wounds appear. Was it worth those we lost? Was it worth those who still suffer today? What about those who are left behind? What about the billions it has cost the Australian taxpayers? How is it that our veterans, who went at the call of our country to take action as the final means of diplomacy, are the ones now being asked these questions? As we stand at the start of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide, we already know how damaging and deadly this path of doubt and uncertainty is. After the Prime Minister held a media conference to announce the commencement of the Royal Commission, we again failed to hear or see any proactive support or real understanding of how difficult this emotionally charged and triggering period is likely to be for thousands of veterans and their families. It is those Veterans and Family members who must now come forward and give their accounts of the systemic failings in our veteran affairs and support systems that have driven so many to contemplate suicide, or to have a loved one take their own life. Prepared lines like, “Call this number if you need help”, and “we have dedicated additional resources”, merely tick the boxes required to meet mediocrity. They are continuing to miss the mark where it counts. Our withdrawal from Afghanistan should have been a time to celebrate and commemorate those who went forward to represent our country and everything our ANZAC spirit represents. Instead, during this time of pandemic and when our nation is in crisis, the withdrawal from Afghanistan has become a footnote, lost under the piles of red tape and paperwork that otherwise consume our political powers. Our political leaders need to understand that those who proudly and patriotically served are simply left wondering why."
3,Why Ozark Safe Haven,news-society," Old Josh lived on the Hightower Plantation where errands were limitless and diversion must be fabricated by it self, or by the individuals who needed it. He: Josh was a tenant farmer when he was youthful, back in his 80s; he likewise took care of the pigs, drained cows, stirring milk into margarine; his child presently approached husking corn. I assume in an in the event that you needed fun, you needed to discover it, particularly in those far away days in Alabama. His sister was raised like him, on the land Hightower claimed; his significant other kicked the bucket there and his two children were raised there. Today his work was to wring necks, chicken necks. He wouldn't fret doing it, not a terrible work, this was during the times of the common conflict, 1863-64, when opportunity for the treatments were being stirred actually like the margarine. The greater part of what old Josh lived on was bacon, cornbread and heaps of cabbage, and a cut of chicken every so often. His children Silas and Toby were the two men now, and went after generally to keep old Josh in some sort of serene temperament, he was or could be very troublesome. Old granny fixed the nourishment for the Hightower young men, she'd ring the chime and the hot bread rolls and honeycombed chicken would be prepared; old Josh would go down to the spring then, at that point and fish, get those catfish, and a squirrel, and concoct them, and make clever sounds like: ding ring, ding-a-ring, imagining he was calling the Hightower young men for their dinners. Gracious he didn't loathe the young men, or even the Hightower's, he was only a chime angry, thus when it was working time, he'd go fishing frequently to demonstrate hatred for them in his quiet manner. ""I ain' known ...Look like he needs to git out er draggin' dis here string all the ways down the Mississ-ippy. Woops-he gon, he guh see him family like me I assume. Who wid him? (he looked profound into the waters)"" (Indeed the fish got away, and Silas was peering down on him, and old Josh knew, that is the reason he was talking the was he was obviously; he had searched for him back at the horse shelter, saying, ""Ain' no one wid him he left here by his self."" And he got stressed over his dad, and went looking.)"
4,A Year of Pandemic Later: Thanking the Psychologists That Continue to Be Truly Essential,news-society," I’m sure you can remember the exact moment, one year ago, that everything changed. Maybe it was when you got an email about working from home, when an official government lockdown mandate went into effect in your area, or maybe it didn’t really hit you until masked faces replaced the smiling ones all around you in the grocery store. A lot has happened since that first moment, over this past year, much of it not offering much to smile about. The First Year of Covid-19 In the beginning, it felt surreal, totally scary but also kind of unreal, to many of us. But Covid-19 and a whole lot more has been a reality for this past year. A lot got thrown at us, from quarantine and all that comes with so much time within your own home to more impactful negative events. The great news is that you’ve made it through, and after this year, that’s something to really be grateful for all on its own. After all, I’m sure it hasn’t been easy. Disease, Disruptions, and Disappointments The impact of the pandemic on everyone’s year went far beyond just the existence of a new virus on this earth. Knowing that COVID-19 was out there and rapidly spreading was scary enough, but for most of us, it actually got real when it began to have a pervasive impact throughout our lives. For public safety, schools, workplaces, and other public gathering spots were shut down. As lives moved completely into the home, disappointments abounded at life seemed to truly be cancelled. Most people can name at least a few things that just, well, sucked about this past year. We may have made it through to a point in time where hope, especially in the form of vaccines, is on the horizon, but getting here has likely been a struggle. The pandemic has particularly been impactful in the sphere of mental health. The Impact to Mental Health It makes sense that such a disruptive force in our lives as this pandemic would have an upsetting effect on mental health. For those that already had a mental disorder to contend with, the unprecedented situation quickly threw a wrench at progress being made. With routines entirely disrupted and new challenges being thrown into the mix this year, many found their journeys with mental health in need of a new approach. This was a whole new world for all of us, after all. Even those who hadn’t previously been struggling with their mental health found the past year more difficult. There was anxiety around catching COVID-19, depression related to the isolation and lack of activities, and overall mental distress due to the impact of this virus on the lives of us all. For some people, the past year simply won't be the happiest of their lives. For others, the disturbance touched at deeper mental health issues. For many, our mental health professionals were one of the most essential forces of the year. Mental Health Professionals Have Been a Lifeline Through the Pandemic After the year that we’ve all had, there’s a lot to be grateful for. We can all breathe a sigh of relief that we have at least made it through into a new year and towards a better future. We also may feel quite a bit of gratitude to all the mental health professionals that were there throughout such a tough year, who were able to support so many through the rough patches. Psychotherapy was also a little different over the last year as a result of the pandemic. When we all began to stay at home for social distancing, therapy also had to move into the home. Telehealth quickly took a popularity boost so that mental health professionals could be there for clients when they needed them the most. Though this wasn’t a perfect solution to everyone, especially with Zoom fatigue becoming its own issue, it got many through. Over the course of a year that threw a lot at the world, mental health professionals were able to be a lifeline, as they nearly always are. Mental Health Will Remain of Importance, Far Into the Future The first year of the pandemic may be over, but one’s relationship with their mental health never is. Mental health should always be a priority, and the realization of its importance is just one thing that we can hope to take from this last year. Mental health professionals and all the other support and resources that are out there got large portions of the population through this crisis. They will continue to be lifelines for you wherever you need them as well. However this pandemic specifically impacted you and your mental health situation, remember that the professionals are there to get you through. Thank You to All in the Psychiatry Community Even when things aren’t easy, we can find those things to be thankful for. I am thankful for the light at the end of the tunnel after this pandemic year and I am thankful for the whole of our psychiatry community. Together, mental health professionals will continue to provide the support that gets us through."
5,"​India is an unbelievable country with many cultures, backgrounds, and languages: Sumeeta Kohli, Panorama India Chairperson",news-society," #Mississauga, #IndiaDay2021; #PanoramaIndia; #IndiaDayVirtualExpo; #VirtualArtContest Toronto/IBNS:  Panorama India has been celebrating India Day for the last 21 years. This year it would celebrate India Day 2021 with a historical first time ever India Day Drive Thru Parade. During a Zoom meeting Jul 7  Asha Bajaj, Editor, Director & Marketing of Canadian-Media,  had a chance to discuss with Sumeeta Kohli, Chairperson, Panorama India, Sandeep Goel, President & Chief Executive Officer of ICICI Bank, and Victoria Clarke, Director, and CEO of Tourism Mississauga to learn about the highlights of  India Day 2021. Following is the excerpt of the interview: Asha to Sumeeta:  Give us a brief background about Panorama India, when started, and what is its mandate? Sumeeta: Panorama India is a 21-year-old non-profit organization with its primary goal, as proud Indo-Canadians, to celebrate the culture and heritage of India, from where we come from, and to make a beautiful mosaic that is called Canada. ​India is an unbelievable country with many cultures, backgrounds, and languages, and we all come together as proud Indians and as Indo-Canadians we and get to celebrate India here. In 2019 Panorama India celebrated Republic Day by bringing together 85, 000 people.  Last year we went digital with covid 19 Pandemic, which did not stop us, but actually motivated us to connect more. I think the need to connect virtually with more and more last year and this year than it has ever been, allowed us to connect with seniors and kids because everybody performs, and loves our culture, and loves to celebrate. It is such a great way to bring everybody together. Last year’s India Day celebration was about 19 hours of programming on 27 channels. We did it for two days. This year we decided it was time to come back and celebrate together. We had been planning for about two and a half months very carefully behind the scenes, looking at all the scenarios with the safety of all, being our number one priority.​ ​We are excited to announce we are posting the first-ever drive-thru parade celebration. We are also excited that India Day falls on a Sunday this year because Canadians celebrate everything on the weekends. So on Sunday, Aug 15, we would be hosting the first-ever drive-thru India Day parade which means that you in your cars with kids can attend the event from the safety of your cars and when you drive through the entire experience, you get to see all of India in one day. Asha to Sumeeta: Panorama India has been celebrating India Day for the last 21 years. What's new about India Day this year? The new this year is the drive-thru parade which aims to have everybody out. That would be the perfect way to reach to get 85,000 people which was possible in 2019. We are not there yet. We are on the road to recovery. So I think we can make it bigger next year. So with this drive-through experience, you will get a real link. It is a free event and it is free for the public. ​A link would be sent out to everybody at the end of July at Paramount Fine Food Centre in Mississauga. We ask you and your families to get their license plate and your information and you will then get a confirmation. The link has several windows throughout the day from 11 am to 7 pm that you can pick allowing the passengers in the cars that pass through every hour to enjoy without being rushed. ​​​This would also facilitate us to manage the number of cars that go through every hour. On the day and time picked by you, when you arrive at the time slot you picked, you will be able to enter the experience. There are lots of surprises that are going to be announced by the end of July, the free giveaways, the new additions of possible people attending, etc. Once you arrive you will see the main stage. Your cars will be parked in front of the stage which is full of varied programs. So what is India Day without dance, singing, and culture? That is so important to know who we are. So the stage once again is open. Panorama is a non-stop stage. After your arrival, you will be able to experience the first performances happening on stage. There is a radio station from where you can hear all the music in your car. Then you enter the drive-thru parade. Initially, you would see these our partners and sponsors to whom you would be talking. Following that you actually see stage performances being created by different organizations that represent the states of India. This drive-thru experience to see India has been made possible because of our partners and sponsors that support us. Panorama India is a non-profit organization and does not charge for events. The only reason for the events to be free is due to the support of our sponsors and partners. I am proud to say that ICICI Bank is the presenting sponsor and that Tourism Mississauga is our partner, both of whom had made it possible for us to do free events.  So we are grateful to our diamond sponsors with whom you would speak shortly and our gold sponsors who are making this event happen. Asha to Sumeeta: Please throw more light on what will the experience of the participants be with the unique and historic event India Day Drive-Thru Parade to be held on Sunday, August 15, 2021? Sumeeta: The unique part is that you can sit in the car and see the whole of India through the drive-thru experience.  I do not think we have done it ever in Canada.  But it not unique to Panorama India. That is something we strive for. But the unique part is that you can do it safely in your cars. Obviously, we recommend the same household members, but with everybody double-vaccinated, with all the rules are changing by the minute, we still advise all to please follow safety.  And more than anyone else,  our seniors, and our kids had really been hard hit the most by the Pandemic, as the only place, they could go was to grocery stores to get the most excitement. The next question is for Sandeep Goel. Asha to Sandeep: What motivated ICIC Bank to support this unique and historical event? Sandeep: Thanks for the chance to showcase us as a diamond sponsor for the event. We have been associated with Panorama India for the last almost 10 years on various occasions. This year, given the covid disruption, we were looking for some events, virtual as well as real physical. It is very important in our community. India is a very connected country and very difficult to survive with physical distancing. So we thought that this is a unique concept and we immediately let Panorama India know of it. ​They let us showcase the ICICI Bank to the Indian community because we have a bank here for Indo-Canadians and we serve their requirements both in Canada as well as in India. And the trend of immigration had been accelerating for the past decade.  Mississauga has a perfect destination for this event because it is a large community of Indians who find Mississauga as their home. We also have a dominant presence in Mississauga. We have branches and centers all across Mississauga. We are also planning a bigger expansion in Mississauga as we go forward. This is an important opportunity for us to showcase this branch to the Indian community on the radio. The next question is for Victoria Clarke. Asha to Victoria: We feel honored that Tourism Mississauga is supporting the India Day Celebration. Why do you think that this event was important for Mississauga? Victoria: Thank you so much for the invitation to be here today and thank you to Panorama India for inviting us to come on as a sponsor. As Sandeep already mentioned, Mississauga is an excellent destination for this event. There are so many Indians in Mississauga who have made it their home and vising friends and relatives. We welcome and invite you to visit Mississauga when it is safe to do so. ​Events like this only happen in Mississauga when people are passionate about their culture and community. Give their time to make it happen and it is absolutely our privilege and a pleasure to financially sponsor this event and make sure that it happens. I know that the aspirations of years have gone by when 85,000 people attending an event in 2019. This shows a very strong representation from India and we hope that as Sumeeta said, on this road to recovery in the coming years those numbers could be even higher as we come to celebrate India Day together. Asha to Sumeeta: Please tell us in brief what other experiences would be felt by people this year as part of India Day? Sumeeta: As Panorama always does, we have multiple things happening on India Day celebrations and we try to accommodate all the age brackets of different communities. So keeping kids in mind we always do something for kids. We will be doing a virtual live active art competition which we also did for India Republic Day. We actually had a very big asset as we had 150 kids registered with kids even from Calgary and Vancouver. Being virtual, we can celebrate this event in any part of this world. We are doing the same thing again. The competition has gone live already. The cut-off date is July 31. So all the parents are requested to complete the registration for different age groups for different demographics before the cut-off date. It has limited spots again. When you register, you will get a secure link, which would enable them to come to the Saturday event and you will all be live with kids of the same age group. All the kids would then be given a theme each and they can color whatever they like and they would be given one hour. We will announce the winners closer to India Day. So that is the art competition. Another big thing that we are doing on Sunday, August 8, is the India Day Expo Exhibition which would be virtual and provides an online marketplace for vendors from India and Canada and some from the US as well. They are all coming together to showcase their products and backgrounds. They are actually looking at handicrafts vendors. There are few surprises as well that we would be announcing soon for the Expo. Our partners will also be there and they would run live webinars. So ICICI bank would be the hotspot. Their webinars were very popular during India Republic Day. They are going to be running another webinar. Tourism Mississauga would also be running webinars. What is nice about these online vendor fairs is that you can actually chat live with the sponsors too. It is not just you go on to a booth. There is a physical booth. You go up to the booth online but you also get to chat with them. The biggest thing we are doing for the vendors this year is that we are showcasing a lot of small businesses as well. Because the small businesses have been affected most in the last year and a half due to the Covid-19 pandemic. ​So hopefully it is a platform for community organizations. We would set up their showcases there. For example,  Brahmakumari always showcases as she does such great things for the community. We would try our best to show everybody on that day. You can register, attend the vendor fair which is completely free and prizes would be given away to different vendors and sponsors and it is an online event and will happen on Aug 8. We kick off the India Day celebration then. And the following Sunday when you come to the event Sandeep would tell us about what their booth is doing when we drive-thru. I know Tourism Mississauga is doing a lot of stuff and I would love to share that information but I would tell you that it is going to be exciting as we are doing everything to make it fun, fun, fun. And one thing I do want to tell that not everybody would be able to attend because of the limited number of cars. So guess what it is going to be completely live-streamed that day. So audiences can watch on different channels. Asha to Sumeeta: Tell us how can we find more information about all the details about India Day 2021 event? Obviously, you can go to our website www.panoramaindia.org. You can also access our social media channels. You can go to ICICI bank’s social media channels as well. Tourism Mississauga is also posting everything about what we are doing. That is nice because everybody is sharing the information. We are updating as real-time as possible. We will be sharing it with you. The link I think is so important to everybody as we know that all the posters and other promotional materials provided by us would be shared with the audience by the media. The minute the link is alive, make sure that we share it with everybody. It is going to be at the Panorama Centre. The actual event would be taking place at Paramount Fine Foods Centre, 5500 Rose Cherry Pl, Mississauga. ​It will be nice if Sandeep tells what you can see when we drive through the booth. I do not know what Victoria is going to reveal about Tourism Mississauga. I know I have to track that. I am so excited. I cannot share all of these. But I assure you there would be a lot of fun for everybody."
6,American Aristocracy and Societal Devolution,news-society," Aristocracy, the brevity for a metaphorical assertion of upper-class dominance, rule and hereditary perpetuity. By indirect inference, the special interests of the wealthy elite, the up and coming elite, generational replication, that furthers the materiality of the privileged few. Of this landed gentry, the upper crust “nobility” of fortunate inheritance, is diverse and multifaceted. Within the “tribal” spectrum, again a symbolic reference, the in-group is a layered or dynamic framework of materialistic distinctions. To say wealthy, describes a range of material worth and the inherent complicity to ensure the sanctity of a privileged status in American society. Continuity of wealth remains essential to the perpetuation of America’s “dynastic” enclaves. A dynasty in this regard pertains to the perpetuation of socio-economic and political influence beyond that of the average middle class American citizen. It is a matter of power and control over whatever enhances the dominance of affluent self-interests. Particularly in relation to political processes, lines of succession perpetuate a family’s, or group’s, influence over particular “reigns” of “imperial” benefits. Fascinating is the idea that for a democratic republic that opposed the tyranny of foreign aristocracies, American society appears to embrace its own version. In article appearing in an online news publication in 2018, the perspective discusses issues pertaining to what characterizes the “America’s New Aristocracy”. As a tentative descriptor, the author applies the phrase, “ruling class”, to the status of the wealthy few. In furthering the discussion, the article delves into the efforts of the societal elite to ensure the expansion of honored or noble status. Particularly, the use of while the lower economic realms are held to “laws and regulations” of one sort or another, the upper classes become except. Instead, or as opposed to equal justice for all, some are more equal than others are. The divide is worsening.[1] The fraud, the deception, the blatant con-artistry baffles the average imagination, which may or may not perceive the sinister underground expansionism of materialistic disparity. From politicians and pundits who spew fallacious rhetoric, to the rich handlers that back their cover story stupidity, the hidden agenda remains all too human. That is, the power, control, manipulation and domination of the many by a few. Of course, none of this as a story-telling exercise is new. Empires rise and fall, replaced by other empires that rise and fall. For humans, not much changes. From the perspective of a human devolution theory, whereby humankind purposefully pursues regressive antics to bring about a final extinction. Under that expansive matrix of maladaptive behaviors, one viewpoint alludes to the critical issues relative to an American aristocracy. As power and wealth increasingly consolidates among an “elite” few, the prospects of social collapse loom closer. Dangerously divisive and deconstructive to a democratic republic, an American societal nightmare unfolds. Historically, empires rise and fall throughout history. Typically, the eventual demise traces the fault lines to an expansive divide between rich and poor. As a broad generalization, exceptions acknowledged, more than a few investigative resources allege the growing power of oligarchic enterprises. From a research project at two major universities, reported in a long-standing magazine publication, investigators concluded public policymaking dominated by the increasing influence of powerful business interests. In the future, the trend could result in the decline of democracy in favor of the “corporate state”. If so, would there be another American revolution? No probably not. A weak, submissive and subservient culture, pampered, coddled and “dumbed down”, will not rise up in rebellion.[2] Briefly stated, an oligarchy is a structural form of governance whereby a small group of powerful individual control the vast majority of the population, as well as the political processes. In so doing, those in power, regarded in terms of their rank within the structure, involve levels of authoritative influence. These distinctions include nobility or aristocratic heritage, wealth, family connections, educational, corporate or religious alliances. Power, control and domination exercise significant manipulation often for corrupt or selfish purposes. In contemporary mainstream reactivity, many might think an “oligarchy” pertains to the former Soviet Union. However, and increasing number of investigators are applying similar description to post-modern America society. In order to proclaim societal dominance, and stage-manage monetary and political resources, financial power translates into electoral interference. For the astute observer, a developing perspective suggests that American society has devolved a “supper class” of wealthy people intent on developing an “American Aristocracy”. To that end, the deceptions are many and the sleight of hand tactics are clever. While many politicians have achieved financial success in public office, they remain primarily the means by which richer elite ensure power continuity. Donors, benefactors, and contributors marshal their collective financial resources to protect their self-interests. A financial culture becomes a political culture for the few. As a form of power structure, an immense and diverse social class system or multiple systems, the degree and extent of influence is challenging to measure. For many, it is even more difficult to understand. While some might argue the necessity of such powerful interests, or the inevitability, others would counter with fears of eventual socio-political disintegration. Meanwhile, still others will expound upon a variety of conspiracy theories, from a small group, to wealthy families, or the so called “money men” who run everything. With that, “conspiracy theories” tell stories and storytelling reveals how people interact and respond to their environment. According to one university film production, examining the role of “power elites” in the U.S., discourse follows similar commentary from the 1950’s. Conspiracies come is different forms. Some are mythological based on “magical thinking”, while others involve collusions that are very real. The challenge for the investigator is figuring out the real from the unreal. Regardless, in the documentary portrayal serious inquiry focuses on the perspective of a “superclass”, beyond the earlier assessment of the “power elites”. As economic and political interaction grows in a global context, the desire to centralize control of wealth and limited resources increases.[3] In furtherance of dominance in the hands of a few, a few argue the rise of a “superclass”, which influence institutions, politics, and the law. Of this select “community” of upper class privileged persons, a driving impetus points to the relentless pursuit of globalization. As though a kind of “corporate state”, the transition from elected leadership decision-making transitions to the powerful and influential dominance of the private sector. In one assertion regarding the powerfulness of commerce and industry in modern times, relates to the fact the largest corporations in the world that have monetary resources larger than most countries. Some would argue that the development of such powerful interests, due to the interconnectedness of various linkages, business and politics for instance, gets smaller and smaller over time. Increasingly, the dominion and control falls to a limited number of key players, including individuals and large multinational corporate structures. More and more frequently, potency of such economic sovereignty uses its weight to manipulate domestic and foreign political systems. For most people, swiping a credit card for a latte, or punching a pin number for gas, masks the reality from the massive financial nature of the entity providing the service. Behind the scenes, who really knows, other than skillful investigators, where the paper trail leads? In a broadcast production in 2014, a major British broadcasting service alleged a “rich and powerful elite” dominates the U.S. On first reaction, for the serious social analyst and astute observer, the inference should come as no surprise. Actually, no big surprise at all. To factor in the potency of consumerism, capitalizing on gluttonous consumption, the perpetuation of materialistic enrichment animates incessant mass marketing. In particular, the so-called “American Dream” illusion represents a never-ending push to build wealth and prosperity.[4] Citing a related 2014 study from a prominent U.S. Ivy League college, nearly ironic in a sense, attempts to confirm the suspicion that American society is dominated by an elite few. The irony here summons the average person’s conception of an Ivy League school. That is, very prestigious, expensive, upper class achievement, exclusivity, and wealthy families send their kids. Not to forget of course, rich donors give healthy contributions to all aspects of such colleges. Then again, perhaps a good place from which to study the “power elite” is where the rich go to school. Alleging “data driven analysis”, researchers claimed to conduct extensive inquiry to back up notions of “aristocratic rule” in the U.S. By way of family influence and connections, groups representing certain business interests, and well-placed political associations, a few wield extraordinary impact on public policy. Meanwhile, across the American continent, average persons, within the ranks of the middle and lower classes, exercise limited power. With little independence of influential potency, most people lack serious political power. In light of such viewpoints, some question the future viability, if not already lost, of the American democratic republic. A few historians would argue for a devolution from attempted democratic processes to a regression into oligarchic power and control. With an intricacy of narrowly defined social, governmental and economic interactivity, utilizing extensive political connections and patronage, domination by the few overrides the general welfare of the many. The manipulation is so well stage managed most do not comprehend the sleight of hand. During an election season, maybe that explains why politicians get away with saying so many stupid things. While a handful of big corporations own news outlets, spurts of reporting here and there, interrupted by lengthy commercial messages, are egregiously superficial at best. Sound bites contribute very little to social utility. At the same time, reporting commentary from political candidates is even more limited. Instead of substantive problem-solving discussions, politicians blather shallow nonsense to pander whimsical notions of status quo mediocrity. By animated gestures, the waving of the arms, the pointing of the fingers, and the sweeping exaggerations of rhetoric, the clownish antics of political pontification ought to annoy the viewing public. Modern politicians in most cases, as there are always exceptions to every conjuring provoke rather than problem-solve. Spewing the superficiality of inappropriate fallacies of inference, and deploying sleight of hand tactics to distract from serious problems, shallow commentary achieves very little. In an era of anti-intellectualism, in which IQ scores are slipping and scientific validation ignored, puppets are easy targets for puppet masters. In a grossly materialistic society, where “wealth building” takes on divine personification, an aspect, or typology, of modern day slavery emerges. Gluttonous consumption avoid the reality of future repercussions. While enslavement diverges into different oppressions, the mythology of the “American Dream” masks a more sinister contrivance. Some would ascribe to this a private realm of upper class elites, relishing in their control of limited resources, as “pathology of the rich”. As an oligarchic reference to the upper echelons of society, a number of researchers express concern as to the regressive and destructive actuality leading to the collapse of social structures.[5] Meanwhile on the political front, the mantra of “study hard and work hard”, and one succeeds in whatever one wants, tends to perpetrate an illusion that hastens a devolution. In what a few voices characterizes as “welfare for the rich”, a handful of closed oligarchic circles control and manipulate institutional processes. In the safe mediocrity of less than stellar competence in communal problem solving for the greater good, the oligarchic influences maintain status quo for the few. Complicity in these machinations are a handful of giant corporate enterprises that dominate so-called news media. Of course, that is the tip of the societal “iceberg”, of which what is seen is not observable. A vast depth of colossal social behemoth lives below the surface. Among the rich, the celebrity super star, the wealthy sports person, and the corporate magnate, and all the characters among the landed gentry, how do they understand the rest of the people? Where they assert their dominion of influence, such as the public political arena, how do they appreciate the problems of the many? Where 1% dominate two thirds of the resources what is the societal connection with those of lesser means? For many in the oligarchic class, their interactions with those at lower levels in the “food chain” is somewhat limited. If a connection exists, in all likelihood, such interactivity relegates to a “superior-subordinate” relationship. More or less, this is a serious class distinction of upper to lower domination rife with condescension. According to one article on the issue of a “new American” aristocracy, or plutocratic sovereignty of an elite few, within the top 1% is an even smaller percentage. Of this tiny group of powerfully wealthy, the potency of material worth has the potential to influence elections. Much like the exalted conjecture of the “social studies realm” in academia, many researchers insist hope spring eternal. That is to say, somehow things will change and by some mystical transition, social progress with transform society into utopia. For others, a little more prone to appreciate the sinister or dark side of human nature, not much changes and things will get worse.[6] Humanity faces the tipping point, as inequality elongates or expands the divide between the elite upper realms and the over-burdened lower ranks. A few perceive a gloomy societal environment in which an entrenched aristocratic minority prefer two opposing American classes. One is the elitists who are in control, and the other is those subject to them. By way of connections, linkages, heritages, affiliations, and so forth, domination perseveres in diverse ways. Under the “rulership” of the aristocracy, those subjected to the status of vassals are supposed to submit willingly. Submission has a price and many acquiesce depending on the enticements. For some at the top of the “food chain”, a sense of entitlement pervades the thinking processes, along with various notions that include birthright, wealth, inheritance, and educational credentials. Aloof, insulated and remote from connectivity in the realms of the commoner, the elitists find safe mediocrity in status quo stagnation. With contrived consensus, by the vast reaches of “infotainment” networks, the perpetuation of illusions of the “American Dream” continues unquestioned in general. Reinforced by constant sales bombardment, the smoke and mirrors of social mythology cloak the hidden consequence to befall an entire society. In disparaging fashion, what might be called the “cult of self-interests”, upper realms of society reside in a mind-set seemingly determined to maintain their status quo. While many boast of noble accomplishments and unmatched philanthropy, there is an uncanny hint of callousness, selfishness and hedonistic self-promotion. As to that, the subterfuge of what is seen, as opposed to what is not seen, infers a deeper darkness to the sinister realms of the American aristocracy. For the oligarchic elite, the necessity of deception is crucial to ensure their dominance. Maintaining control for the wealthy “requires extraordinary behind the scenes influence over economic and political systems. To ensure the satiation of dominion, manipulation of commercial interests, swaying political processes, and controlling politicians is crucial to an “entitled” ruling class. An escalating complexity of diverse societal structures, given the power and control of an upper elitist dominance, does not offer a positive picture for future democratic processes. For some observers, the sense of a democracy presumes an illusion to satiate the herded masses. On the more dismal track of perception, an “entitled” landed gentry, or aristocracy, is no guarantee of intellectual transformation to heightened levels of enlightenment. On the contrary, an argument is probable that a dumber class of oligarchs runs a dumbed down society. Similarly, in the critique of modern American culture, the early founders in post 1776 lamented related concerns. Whereas it was possible to rebel, resist and otherwise defeat aristocratic oppression, as well as oppose titles of nobility, there was no certainty that some other form of oligarchy would rise up. For some notable representatives of the American Revolution, restraining potential of the monstrous creature of aristocracy required serious vigilance. To this endeavor, limitations on the ability of individuals and groups to have too much power was essential.[7] To oppose a monarchy, to keep watch over the republic, and ensure freedom from oppression, demands an enlightened and well-educated electorate. Yet, a healthy sense of skepticism, tempered by seasoned cynicism, would immediately object to that notion.  The last part of the assertion raises scary prospects, that is, the hope of enlightenment. With that, comes the concern regarding education, intellectual ascendency and maturity in productive thinking. With an extensive interactivity of special interests, corporate intrigue, patronage, linkages of preferentialism, privileged materialism, and hereditary entitlement, resistance is nearly futile. With the rise of a subculture, or perhaps, several subsets of an American aristocracy, over time, society devolves. Historical references point to the eventual collapses of “empires”. When movie stars and other celebrities are viewed as “philosopher”, in a celebrity worship society, it is a warning signal of eventual social regression. As “educators” insist that one size fits all, and the public educational systems operate like a factory assembly line, creativity, inventiveness and imagination fade. While politicians spew nonsensical irrelevant rhetoric, and pundits ignorant of history foment disingenuous and divisive “political correctness”, mainstream society fragments. In the process, the politically powerful ensure their “hereditary” entrenchment in the continuity of dominance that favors the “entitled” few. In the meantime, waiting under their protective wings are the offspring. Progenies of the American aristocracy inherent the political domains of the elites to the eventual detriment of the republic. Social devolution ensues at a rapid pace.

7,The Impact of Covid-19 on Mental Health Among University Students in Malaysia,news-society," Lately, we have been shocked by a deadly Covid-19 pandemic spreading across the whole continent. The fear of the unknown and uncertainty without a doubt induced anxiety and increased the level of uneasiness. Although, the community seemed to be unaffected by this pandemic until the first case of Covid-19 in Malaysia was confirmed on 25th January 2020. In time, the number of cases continues to surge steadily until the end of February 2020. However, there was a sudden rise in the Covid-19 cases after the 14th of March where the cases seemed to be connected to a religious gathering in Kuala Lumpur not long before. Based on the report, at least 16,000 people attended the gathering which gives rise to the total of cases for the next two months. There is a question that always pops up in society’s mind recently. What is the impact of Covid-19 pandemic mental health among university students eventually? In my opinion, the impacts are the increase of anxiety and uneasiness level, the rise of distress level and the changes in students’ life. In regards to the Covid-19 pandemic, almost all the university premises take an alternative in shifting their mode of teaching from physical to virtual. These immediate changes in the mode of teaching somewhat increased the anxiety level and created uneasiness feeling among the general public and the same goes for the students. Students usually involved face-to-face with their lecturers and have a comfortable environment in dealing with their learning day by day. But then they have to adapt to their new environment in dealing with online learning using e-Learning Platforms such as Microsoft Teams, Global Open Access Learning System(GOALS) and Zoom which depend on the Internet. These significant changes not only affect their performance but also increase their level of depression from time to time. Thus, it is essential to keep a tab on the mental health of students to avoid them from enduring the pain and eventually lead to a suicidal attempt. Before this pandemic took place, students usually have a significant of leisure time in the evening to involve in curricular activities and sports. Besides, they have to do something other than studying to release their tension and stress level. But then as this pandemic goes on, people need to practice social distancing which they need to stay at least one meter apart from each other in the public areas. This is one of the measures implemented by the Malaysian government to maintain the spread of contagious disease. For this reason, students no longer allowed to gather even for a curricular activity but rather they can do sport on their own at home. This surely adds up to student lonesomeness and increase the distress level. Hence, family members play an essential role in supporting and being with the student from loneliness. In the long run, surely there will be the psychological impact of Covid-19 that affect society all together especially students who need to cope with a new norm in their daily life. Moreover, the imposed restrictions would certainly elevate the psychological pressure of the university student whose their learning progress was postponed until further notice. As regards these matters, many universities took a precautious and announced the postponement of classroom teaching which led to e-learning during this lockdown. Among them, students who live in rural areas seem to be one of the most affected groups rather than students who live in urban areas. This is due to the limited Internet coverage in an isolated area compare to the city. For an instance, they will have a difficulty in joining the online classes provided by their lecturers because of the loss of network. These unfavourable circumstances surely give rise to their stress level especially those who face coping and adjustment difficulties. Therefore, this turn of event surely changes the lives of students. In short, there are significant impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on mental health among university student including the increase of anxiety and uneasiness level, the rise of distress level and the changes in students’ life. As of now, the Malaysian government has implemented a total of five phases of different-level of Movement Control Order (MCO) till the 4th of March 2021. The full MCO 3.0 nationwide from the 1st to 28th of June 2021 was implemented by the government as the countermeasure in regards to the Covid-19 pandemic recently. An increase in symptoms of depression and anxiety is already being reported in several countries during the COVID-19 pandemic (WHO 2020). In addition, and up to date, these nationwide closures are impacting almost 70% of the world’s student population. (UNESCO 2020). Hopefully, society will take serious action and obey all the government’s order to stop this pandemic from spreading."
8,Effect of virtual teaching-learning in Nigeria varsities,news-society," THE EFFECTS OF VIRTUAL LEARNING ON TEACHING-LEARNING PROCESS IN NIGERIA VARSITIES The new normal in education in Nigeria is the increase of online learning tools as the COVID-19 pandemic that struck the whole world unexpectedly has triggered a new mode of teaching and learning in the country. To adhere to the laid down rules of the government all Nigeria educational institution now looks toward online classes to continue the process of educating the students with no university as an exception. As most teaching methods, online learning and teaching also comes with its own effect on the teaching-learning processes in educational system especially in our universities which may either be negative or positive on the part of the students, lectures or both as this new mode of learning is a maturing process in that most universities are unequipped with the right tools and gadgets. Starting by enumerating on the various strokes which the students have received from the new method of learning in our varsities the issue of self-isolation and inability of the students to tally: students tend to learn a lot from being in class with their lecture, taking of notes and also the vast knowledge they acquired in the company of their colleagues.  However, in online classes this is very difficult to come by, as there are no or minimal physical interactions between the lecturers and students and the student-student tutorials are futile due to restrictions. Another unfavorable effect of virtual teaching–learning on the students of Nigeria universities is the involuntary absence in class, missing of assignments submission, quiz and even continuous assessment due to challenge from interruptible power supply and and internet connection. While our internet penetration had grown in leaps and bounds in some parts being habituated by our great Nigeria students and lecturers in our universities environment, a consistent connection for decent speed is a problem for both lecturers and students especially in the northern part of the country and without a consistent internet connection for students or lecturers there can be lack of continuity in the learning of the students which may fraise the cumulative GPA of the student. This is a detriment to the education process. Other key effect of the online teaching-learning in our university communities is the lack of lecturers’ knowledge on the new method of teaching the university adopted as it becomes difficult for some of the lecturers to match with the new mode of teaching because it requires them to have a basic understanding of the digital forms of teaching. However, this is not the case always as most of the lecturers are used to the previous teaching methods. Often, lecturers that have a very basic understanding of the technology something, they don’t even have the necessary resources and tools to conduct the classes while in some cases the ones with the necessary tools and resources lack they the basic digital knowledge they needed to carry out the teaching effectively. Cases of situation where lecturers delivered a lecture for more than an hour without switching on their mics in a google meet class and some lecturers always sending their materials through other lecturers due to lack of digital knowledge, tools and resources. Though there are also many several positive effect of the virtual class such as its efficiency: course materials can be easily given to students at the detriment of nobody, also the availability of time and space as virtual class made it very easy for student to access the learning tools from any place and anytime and also making it very easy for information to reach the students from the appropriate body. The new teaching-learning method also made improve the students’ attendance in classes since the online class can be taken from any location of their choice, they can sit comfortably on their mattresses with the stress and rush of going to classes which are also overcrowded by students and without proper sitting arrangements and ventilations. The virtual learning is also the most of learning that suit the new culture of the society as the online learning system, with its range of options and resources, can be personalized in many ways. It is the best way to create a perfect learning environment suited to the needs of each student. To make this new method of teaching-learning a generally accepted culture in our Nigeria educational system the government, educational bodies, school administrations, parent and student should all take up their roles."
9,"Will Coronavirus Kill Quality, Free To Consume Content?",news-society," With many companies facing huge hardship due to the coronavirus pandemic, everyone is looking for ways to generate more business in a frankly terrifying economic situation. Content has long been used by savvy marketers to entice consumers towards their brand, to start a conversation, and give them a taste of what to expect if they decide to open their wallet and make a purchase. And there’s absolutely nothing wrong with using content to get more business (er, hello?!). But you’re wasting your time if it doesn’t provide some kind of value to the consumer in its own right. Interesting insights, actionable advice, or just entertainment, the very best free content will do all three. The cynical marketing saying of “if the product is free, YOU are the product” might be true in one sense (and incidentally, if you want to become cynical, do a marketing degree, nothing will make you less likely to buy into other people’s bull). However, this concept also assumes that most consumers are undiscerning luddites who will read, watch or listen to anything. But the truth is, in our content flooded, time strapped society, consumers have become highly perceptive users with unlimited options and mature palates, they won’t waste time consuming content which provides no value. No one will engage with your content if its drivel, in the same way that no one will buy your product or use your service if it’s no good. Follow through is essential. But as companies tighten their belts and look for ways to reduce costs, outsourcing content generation might very well be the first to go. And while John from Accounting might have written a good speech for his auntie’s funeral, can he really make an article about EU employment legislation sound interesting? There is a danger that companies will resort to putting out anything, just to fill the gap, harming their brand identity and taking staff away from their day to day work where their true talent lies. When it comes to content creation, quality AND quantity is key. But if you can’t have both, stick to quality. And there’s another element at work too. The entertainment industry, along with many others, has taken a serious hit with this pandemic. And where artists, comedians and musicians frequently used social media to showcase their talents, cash strapped artists are now repurposing their social media accounts to provide high quality, pay to view content in order to generate much needed revenue. This will likely be at the expense of the quality free content they provided prior to the impact of the coronavirus on their income. The same is true in other industries, including fitness. Many gyms and trainers traditionally provided free content to supplement subscriptions for physical, in person services, but several outfits are now switching to online, paid only models, to answer the social distancing difficulties and meet government guidelines. So, we have less quality free content from the professional content generators who are struggling for cash, while strapped business across all industries and sectors are frantically trying to survive. So, what does this mean for the future of content marketing? Firstly, many businesses will likely save their highest quality content for paying customers. And secondly, there will be the inexperienced newbies generating slightly rubbish content in a desperate bid to save their business. Sadly, the result will likely be a free to view content landscape which becomes a desolate waste ground of crappy poor-quality content which offers little to no actual value to the consumer. But all is not lost. For clever companies this changing landscape actually represents an opportunity to shine. Providing quality, high value content will help ensure that you stand out from the crowd. And before you all shout “but NETFLIX!”, I’m not saying that pay to view content doesn’t have its place in the crazy new world. Of course it does. The subscription model of content delivery already took off massively before coronavirus got its claws into us. But most of those paid subscription models simply wouldn’t work without free to consume content. How many people do you know signed up to Spotify Premium before trying out the free version? We all like to try before we buy. And remember, content IS the business of most of the successful pay to consume subscription services, it’s not a marketing strategy. This is why they do it so well. Look at the lockdown winners, Joe Wicks as an example. He has grown his brand exponentially by providing free, quality content to all (and likely saved the waistlines of countless individuals in the process). No doubt he has also seen a massive upswing in his book sales and other revenue streams as a result of his dedication to the provision of free content. Offering “freebies” is the oldest marketing strategy in the book, give customers a taste of your product, brand or expertise, and, as long as it’s good, they’ll likely get hooked and be willing to pay for what you’re offering. But, being under such strain, many businesses might be tempted to protect their content as if doormen of elitist members clubs, shutting out those who are currently (understandably) feeling too penurious to open their wallets. What a mistake to make."
10,Representations of Asians in the Entertainment Industry Impacts Asian Hates,news-society," The United States of America is probably one of the countries that have the biggest influence in the world. The influence is via fashion, technologies and anything in our everyday lives. The most successful place to do that is through the entertainment industry. You want to make something go viral? Get it on commercials. You want to set a standard? Then write a T.V. show or a movie that sets up that standard. Find an iconic actor to play that part, and the whole world will take that as a yes. Hollywood and Broadway have so much influence on earth, and they are the images of such a country that has a very diverse population, but for a long time, there was a lack of diversity in the most influential media. That doesn’t mean we have never seen people of colors in the media before. It’s what we have seen that matters. That’s what representation means. It’s not about adding some ethnic people in the background, and call that diversity. For a long time, Asian people have been playing the same stereotypical characters. The world will never go anywhere if we only stay with the stereotypes that were written ages ago by someone who existed during the time that equality was not even a thing. This includes the lack of representation of diversity in Asian cultures, misunderstandings of characteristics of Asians and sexualization of Asian women and girls. First, Lack of Representation of Diversity in Asian Cultures: How many times have you started or have you heard a conversation of someone who just saw an Asian person, and would describe them as “Chinese?” “Oh, my day was good. There was this Chinese woman who brought a husky on a train today.” Or if  you are Asian, have you ever experienced somebody confidentially guessing your ethnicity? “You’re from China?” Or straight up “ni hao.” Then if you say that you’re not Chinese, they will keep guessing “Japan? Korea?” Like there are only three countries in Asia. Then there is sometime where a random person asks you where you are from because you look Asian, and you must not be from the U.S. If you say, “California”, then you’ll hear, “No, like where are you actually from? Also why don’t you have an accent?” I have friends who are South Asians, and they consider themselves as South Asians. Other people would not agree with them because if they are Asians, why don't they look like the stereotypical Chinese, and then even call them Arabs or Muslims when they are neither of those. These are effects that were cost by the lack of representation of diversity through media. The media is a place where the majority of the world, kids to elders, go to get knowledge from, but the only knowledge they gain from the media about Asians is that any Asian person will probably be from China, Korea or Japan, cannot be from the U.S, they all speak chinese, can’t speak English or must have a certain accent, they own Chinese restaurants, masters of chopsticks and have a certain look. It’s not all bad. We have a good example of good representation, which is Disney that represents the Asian, Indigenous and Pacific Islandic cultures well. As someone who is from Thailand, Southeast Asia, I am very proud that Raya and The Last Dragon shows a wonderful representation of not only the strength of a young girl, but a representation of many ethnicities, colors and cultures within Southeast Asia itself. Aren’t these just some people who are ignorant and harmless? What does it have to do with the Asian Hate Crimes? After the Corona Virus outbreaks,  the news says that the source started in The Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. That was when the Asian Hate Crimes started increasing, and Asians were being called “Virus.” It doesn’t make sense to attack anyone in general, but especially if the reason to attack was by thinking that all Asians would be linking to each other and carry the virus. People didn’t realize that people with the same race are not the same person, are not from the same household, and they probably don’t know each other. I have Asian-American friends in New York City who got alcohol sprayed on while riding the train, and were being told things in a way that they were tourists from China that just arrived in New York City during COVID-19, and would bring the virus here even though they have been living here since birth, and have never been to China. They are not even Chinese. The big part of why people think this way is because of the media. The media has been presenting the same type of character and the same life story for Asian community again and again with no variety, which makes it seem that every single Asian person anywhere on earth is this repeated stereotype. When the rumor started that the virus came from a person in Wuhan City, China from eating bats, it became a new popular trait to add into the idea that people already thought every Asian person is the same, which would make them think that therefore every Asian person must eat bats. Second, the Misunderstandings of Characteristics of Asians: Many times, we forget that we are all humans, and our ethnicities, homelands, cultures are not all of who we are. At the end of the day, we are our own individual beings. We all have different personalities based on how we were raised, based on events that happened in our lives, who we choose to be today and choices that we make. Like it was mentioned earlier, “We forget.” We take in what we see on screens and hear on radios, and we just believe that those are facts. Most of the time Asians are in the media just to add “diversity,” and that’s how we are seen in real life. We are seen as a joke, as people who you can racially joke to their faces, and they will just laugh. We are seen as being easy taken. We are seen as minor characters. They show a lot about us being able to do martial arts, but they also show a lot that we are weak, soft, and whatever anyone says to us, we will just nod. The media talks a lot about how good we are at math, and we have two careers waiting for us. Either owning an Asian restaurant or working in a medical field. How about what the media says we are not? The girl/boy next door. Someone who is the most beautiful girl in the school. A Regina Goerge. Someone who falls in love. Or we can say, basically everything that is regular that they leave it for the main characters. Some people see a person who’s asian, and everything that’s mentioned above is all they see in us. Without getting to know us, they already assume they know everything. It seems harmless, but it’s not. Race jokes happen all the time more than you think. Sometimes it happens by a stranger who means well, and thinks that if they say a racial joke to you, it may clear the air of uncomfortability and awkwardness and make you guys closer. Sometimes it’s said by a friend, and sometimes just anybody because they think “It’s just a joke”. The media is a big part behind this because for centuries, Asians in the media have been seen as easy targets because we won’t fight back, and we would even smile and laugh with you. The most we would do if we are not okay would be walking away because we don’t want any problems. The media doesn’t focus on an Asian who is a human. Someone who has feelings, who can get hurt, can be offended and decides to stand up to their bullies like a normal human being. The media creates the image that Asians are the easiest target. They always tell the same story. It’s so black and white like if we’re not the Asians who would easily walk away then there’s a cooler version, the ninja assassins with no emotions. Racism against Asian community has been happening longer before COVID-19 started, but it has been normalized. Even today where “Unity in Diversity” is a big trend, asian crimes are still normalized and being overlooked. The Sexualization of Asian Women and Girls: I have a friend from Thailand who went to Germany as an exchange student, and on the first day of school, a kind high school boy who she just had a class with reached out to her if she needed help because she’s new. That’s how it seemed. What he actually greeted her with was “How much?” My experience, a friend of a friend asked me why I came to the U.S because Thailand has beautiful islands and beaches. Before I even got a chance to answer, a guy friend of hers yelled “Yeah, prostitute!” With his fist up like it was a victory. One night on the way home from school, I decided to get a slice of pizza. “You’re from China? No? Korean?” I told him, “No, I’m from Thailand.” He looked at me, and smiled, “Oohhh Pattaya Huh? Pattaya!!,” and he winked. Pattaya is one of the most well known cities in Thailand where tourists go. The city is full of beautiful palm trees, beaches, the seas, bars, clubs and brothels. I have nothing against prostitutes. If it’s their will, it’s their will, but I’m already tired of getting cat calls by guys on the streets of New York City everyday. Now I have to experience guys asking me what my price is because I’m Thai? Sure, there is a city in my country that’s full of brothels, but does it make every girl you see from Thailand a prostitute? Do you really think there’s no other occupation? Something I got asked recently from someone that seems to believe this stereotype of Thai women is real, and he even embraces it. He complimented me that I’m very pretty like Thai girls, then he asked if this is the only thing we care about, right? Beauty? Living a chill life? Becoming a model? Marry any old white guy to get out of the country and be rich? Just have fun? He said that Thai girls are so cool, fun to hang around and our culture is so fun. No, it’s not fun even hearing you talking about it. No, I don’t want to just be pretty doing nothing and wait to find a white guy to get married with. Being a prostitute, dancing and drinking all night is also not my culture. No surprise why this is still a thing because there is no representation of Thai people or Southeast Asians in the Entertainment industry. I can think of a couple Hollywood T.V shows and movies that mentioned Thailand for a few seconds. The only thing they mention is a prostitute or there will just be a naked Asian woman lying on the bed next to the main male character, and the only thing they mention is he’s in Thailand. The most famous  images on screen when it comes to Southeast Asian women is a reality show that follows couples who have applied for or received a K-1 Visa, and the hottest topic people talk about when it comes to the couple with a Thai girl is that the guy can’t afford his young Thai fiancé. That just strengthens the stereotype mentioned above that a young Thai girl would just find an old white guy to marry just to use his money. Roles of Asian female characters in Hollywood have been shaped in two directions. One that is soft, sweet, young, powerless, a Lolita style. One that is sexy and for people to sexualize. Even on Broadway, we don’t have many good representations of Asian community, especially for Asian women. The ones that are known have some truths to it, but still cycling in the realm of powerless and prostitutes. In conclusion, these are examples of how powerful the entertainment industry is to the society, and we can use that power to influence what we call “Unity in Diversity.” These are examples of what we are missing today if we think we are already living in Utopia. We are far from it. We are doing much better than the past. There’s a lot of good representations of Asian community today in the entertainment industry that I did not mention, but we are just starting. We have a long way to go. We need more media that tells powerful stories of each ethnicity, not just one or two and call it that. We need more media that truly represents the image of what Unity in Diversity is. Some that tell a story of us as human beings experiencing normal but complex human experiences, and our races don’t make us who we are or what our jobs will be or how our characters behave and talk. An impact doesn’t happen by us creating one new thing just to show that we are making changes and then stop. We have to represent the most variety of every single community, and make that normal. We have to let go of the stereotype and remember that whatever ethnicity, we are humans, and we have to represent that. Showing the truths from the past and telling our history is valuable, but what about spreading the story of today? What about creating new standards for tomorrow?"
11,Home Depot,news-society," The success of Home Depot can be attributed to strategic management as well as its best practices. According to Barney and Hesterly, a good strategy is one applied and followed giving a firm a competitive advantage over its rivals by creating more economic value compared to its competitors. Home Depot’s strategy involves merchandising which entails promoting the sale of its products by presenting them in its 2,274 stores and retail outlets across the US, Mexico, Canada, Virgin Islands, Guam, China, and Puerto Rico. Home Depot uses a three-legged stool model for its strategic framework. The strategy focuses on value creation by connecting the business with the customers. The strategy is based on customer experience, product authority, and capital allocation all focused on efficiency and competence. As a result, Home Depot aims at offering a flawless and smooth experience whether online, at outlets, with home deliveries as well as construction sites. Second, the company aims at upholding its product authority by continuously striving to balance innovation, art, and science to offer the best value. Lastly, Home Depot’s capital allocation is driven by efficiency and competence. The overall strategy entails outstanding customer service, low pricing, and a wide range of products and it is these three factors that have kept Home Depot ahead of its competitors. Home Depots’ success can also be attributed to its excellent leadership as well as its generic strategy coupled with intensive growth strategies. Apart from offering high-quality service in addition to offering a wide selection of products, the majority of the employees at the Home Depot’s warehouses and stores are experts in their different fields particularly carpentry and plumbing and therefore, they are able to offer expert advice to clients. When it comes to cost leadership in Home Depot’s generic strategy, the company’s financial goal is to minimize cost which is achieved by developing personal and exclusive relationships with its suppliers which helps in minimizing cost. Despite its success, Home Depot is facing a major threat from other stakeholders. Despite the fact that the threat is medium, it is gradually increasing especially due to the future government regulations on environmental issues. Though the company has always tried to be ‘green’ by helping preserve natural resources and offering programs that allow for the recycling of older items, in recent years it has been connected with cases related to pollution. In 2013, the company was involved in a scandal where a number of its stores sold non-compliant paint despite warnings from the air regulators. More recently, the company was involved in a controversy over the construction of Patagonia Dam’in Chile which would involve clearing trees to give way for the power lines. However, environmentalists argue that the dam could have detrimental to the environment. As a result of the growing consumer demands for conservation, Home Depot may find itself in a tight sport with its clients. In conclusion, Home Depot's success can be attributed to several factors. Home Depot emphasizes on inimitable customer service which is the reason as to why the company mostly employs individuals with field expertise as well as well-trained employees in order to offer the best advice and customer experience. The company also believes in social responsibility both for itself as well as the suppliers. The company also uses a centralized management system that consolidates the executive for easier and more informed decision-making. Last but not least, the company maintains cost leadership by minimizing the costs wherever possible, hence more revenue which culminates in its success. Amelia Watson is an editor.

12,"Collusion, Hypocrisy and Political Corruption – Human Devolution - Adventures in Pseudoscience",news-society," As the impending devolution continues, the idiocy of a contentious and condescending culture finds so many opportunities to hasten human extinction. From anti-intellectualism to corporate and political collusions, the divisive animosity rampage in diverse manifestations. By so many intricate components, various corrupt factions perpetrate insidious actions to destabilize the fabric of the democratic republic. Extreme ideological perversions demonstrate repeatedly hypocritical selfishness to degrade and disrupt mainstream society. Moreover, does anyone care? Extraordinary problems of the planet, as in environmental exploitation and severe income inequality, find second place status to whiny and cowardly protestations of self-victimization. In an online newsletter, one author points to the regressive animosity in pointing out the “poisonous hypocrisy of politics”. Discussion alone will not suffice nor encourage any problem-solving efforts. The issues are complex, the problems are intricate, and the scope and depth of the criticality too far gone for easy remedy. As such, to observe one aspect of the devolutionary trends, politics for example, the mean-spirited instigations are rampant.[1] Depending on the perspective by which the challenges of fakery transcend into a viable debate, the scope and sequence can be many faceted. As the term itself, hypocrisy, can invite productive or derisive analysis, the choices of issues and associated collusive behaviors involve a variety of socio-economic and political issues. Whether by focus on sleight of hand sales and promotional tactics of bloated gluttonous consumerism, or empty political rhetoric, the contrivances are intricate. By false appearance, disingenuous pretense of “goodness”, altruistic fakery, and so on, the human species seldom fails to make a mockery of itself. With the aspect of collusion, the insistence to be deceptive is very much a human inclination. For personal gain and enrichment, at the expense of others, minus any ensuing costs to the perpetrator, people commit all many of illicit activities. Corruption in one form or another conspires in the devolution of the human species. Often, the appearance of hypocritical antics can be witnessed in elected public officials. Especially during campaign season, observations by astute inquiry makes note of the easy and simplistic deceptions that conspire for votes. Politics is likely a good place to observe the collusive nature of hypocrisy, as well as political corruption. Politicians are particularly representative of such behaviors and particularly interesting to observe. Direct and concrete answers to serious social questions are elusive. During an election for instance, specious conjecture supported by nebulous notions smog the atmosphere with superficial commentary. Getting well-researched candid answers to critical questions, along with a listing of probable solutions are typically non-existent. Foggy ideas muck it up. Political processes are only one aspect of intricately connected socio-economic systems. For the greater good, “we people” etc., ought to be collectively striving for a “more perfect union”. While a few endeavor for the noble causes of a prior revolution, many seem oblivious to the future consequences. In the process of human devolution, the rise and fall of cultures, or “empires”, is a gradual course of regressively intentional behaviors. By human contrivance, the collapse of societies trespasses upon the unholy ground of hypocritical behaviors. The consistent practice and perpetration of beliefs contrary to one’s real views, philosophies, ideologies, and actual practices, fall into the abyss of hypocritical actions. Collusions, hypocrisy and corruption share close kinship with other descriptors. Such as, deception, mockery, fraud, duplicity, speciousness and fakery, contrive to evade the realities of truthfulness. As to that, a decade ago an online science journal published an article addressing the commonality of deceptive behaviors. Accordingly, everyone is a deceiver in some way, for better or for worse.[2] In the process of arrogantly committing a variety of deceptive actions, referencing hypocrisy, humans are adept at self-deception as well. However, the downside of the competitiveness is that eventually hypocritical behaviors and associated deceptions do not last long. In most cases, eventually, someone achieves notoriety for their corruption. Exposure is a constant risk for the persistent deceivers. Like an antisocial iceberg floating in the frigid waters of societal fragmentation, the pathological inclinations lurk below the surface. In the classical view, or rational choice perspective, deception is purposeful. Behaving in hypocritical ways serves the needs of the perpetrator. Animosity toward others by diverse illicit applications willfully schemes to enhance the perpetrator’s advantage. For the politician, it means staying in elected office in never ending permanency. Access to money, power, resources, influence and so forth enriches the prospects of personal gain. To ensure a lifetime of constant re-election, the politician will wear various disguises to mask their hidden agendas. By malice aforethought, premeditation and intention effort, each plans the nature of his or her schemes. Plots and frauds abound. To use the often-heard profane commentary from movies, everyone has the motive, means and looks for the opportunities. Importantly, it is a matter of ideation. Belief systems, perceptions and perpetrations stem from the desire to fulfill those fantasies of thought and eventually action. The primacy of thinking, subsequently the willful execution, from assault to zoological aberrations, to the motivating factors. Behavior, and in particular, political behavior, is about the arrogance of egoistic objectives. Across the broad spectrum of mainstream culture, the devolving processes embrace a variety of self-promoting postures. Academia is rich with pretentious claims of special knowledge. To hide in the safe mediocrity of academic bastion, protected by multilayers of security countermeasures, “pseudoscientific” perversions can influence public policy. As one element of critical observation, how many politicians on the national scene have an exceptionality of real-world experience? Did they make their “bones” in the hard work of everyday life, down at the street level of contentious social interaction? Were they ever in command of anything? A fascinating quest into the political spectrum is to address background issues of prior experience. Upon every occasion of alleged expertise, an assessment of qualifications is necessary. For each appeal to authority, someone’s opinion, questions should fire up the imagination. Is the source of supporting claim qualified to offer a viewpoint on the issues at hand? If so, how extensive is the corroborating evidence? What is the scientific validation? Typically, reliance rumor, gossip and opinion do not substantially provide compelling evidentiary sufficiency. Speculation as to cause and effect should be met with severe analysis as opposed to acceptance simply because someone said so. This should be a real certainty of inquiry especially applied to the pseudoscience fields such as criminology, psychology and sociology. Within that framework, anecdotal references are not grounds for reliable acceptance. Again, opinion is not evidence, as one’s bias influences subsequent conclusions, and foster egregious fallacies of inference. Politicians in general are very good at spewing an array of psychobabble that says and solves nothing. An online publication in 2017 raised the point in asking the question, are public officials “stupid or evil”? Probably a mixture of both. As a group, the opinion article suggests that politicians in Washington, D.C., have a serious inclination toward avoiding common sense, and forgetting basic logic. Likewise, facts and reason are usually avoided.[3] As the devolution of the human species unfolds, and civilization is on the verge of collapse, the political framework appears dominated by an anti-intellectual scheme. Degrading and insulting spews of “psychobabble” animate the election cycles with idiotic rhetoric. Purposely, an observer, struggling to maintain some semblance of objectivity might conclude an intentional dumbing down of candidates for public office. In the end, stupidity does not enhance the future possibilities for human civilization. Specifically, stupidity refers to contrived irresponsibility to avoid moral or ethical accountability for individual actions. Idiocracy rises to invite catastrophe. Instead of insisting upon a well-defined platform of prosocial goals and objectives, a listener hears the blather of superficial child-like simplicity. Wallowing in the selfish promotion of individual vanity and conceited self-validation, politicians on the national scene spout empty nonsensical and condescending regurgitation of infantile gibberish. Failing to answer direct questions in clear, concise and concrete terms, the average politico chatters about idiotic speculations. Along with distracting physical antics, they mutter irrelevant gossip. Seemingly, a stage play of tragic and comedic exaggerations, avoiding concrete intellectual discourse, the incompetence to does little to promote the advancement of the human species. By such foolish appeals to inferential fallacies, erroneous hastily drawn conclusions mislead, misguide and misdirect social discourse. For such mediocre foolishness, the probability of hastening societal collapse encroaches in a closer time-frame.  Neither the republic nor the greater good are served by these ridiculous diatribes that collude in hypocrisy of self-gratification. Accordingly, as the purposes and intentions of “dumbing down” serves commercial and political interests, societal connections appear increasingly less informed. Political ignorance is extraordinary. In one internet journal, the case is made for the growing decay of intellectual achievement. Rather than focus on implications and specifications for policy formulation, attacks and counterattacks muddy the electoral landscape with broad sweeps irrelevancy.[4] By way of similarity and close connection, much amusement comes from the world of academia. Particularly ever-present is the associated field of the “social studies”. Within this grouping are the torturous purveyors of pseudoscience, criminology, psychology and sociology. Postulating one theoretical construct after another, a diverse range of “schools of thought” promulgates an assortment of philosophies. From that, beliefs are influenced. Not only the gullibility of believability, but also the underlying divisive aspects of devolving to the most simplistic explanation of just about everything. From the “social studies” realms of non-science, the conjecture of opinion, and often a simple majority vote at a convention, theoretical speciousness leaps to hasty generalizations. Eventually, given the power of influence, by complicity of social media and news outlets, politicians quickly fall for the seductions. Something that is said often enough by a pretentiously “reliable source”, before you know it most people accept the claim as dependable. Often, such things are merely someone’s opinion. Rather than conduct skeptical and critical analysis by individual initiative many relegate significant thinking processes to other people. Cultish affinity for “guru” adulation expands exponentially in a culture where education achievement is not a high priority. In the real world that spans a spectrum of all kinds of behaviors, many rely on the simplistic notion that fits their private field of reference. In spite of the facts, regardless of the evidence, people are going to believe the mythology of their own conjecture. Politicians are no different. In one bi-weekly news magazine, the question is posed in speculating whether contemporary politicians or “stupid” or “evil”. In view of that perspective, as a metaphorical invitation to discussion, the writer ponders the motivational factors behind less than ethical behaviors. As pointed out, elected member of Congress, for example, have law backgrounds and taken an oath of office, wonderment ponders the foolish things done while in office. Not only that, additional concern points to the stupidity asserted in political commentary and social discourse.[5] As suggested in the article, the answer to the dilemma of “statesman” versus “politician” resides in the notion that public officials pander to supporters. Pandering is an apt description for those in elected office. From a traditional standpoint, it refers to pimping or being a pimp. Of course, pimps, pandering and prostitution are closely connected. One who lives off the labor and earnings of another might be a close parallel to the illicit nature of modern politics. While pandering to a certain population base, regardless of noble concessions to ethical precepts, associated behaviors devolve to things like promises, threats, fraud, deception, etc. Related to the enticements of pandering, politicians appeal to what might excite or otherwise stimulate their followers. In so doing, they are likely to say anything even if it sounds stupid, illogical and completely unattainable. No one cares, as egregious fallacies of inference that perpetrate unsubstantiated generalizations express the collusion of hypocrisy. Pondering the political landscape, questions arise among a small fraction of concerned citizens regarding qualifications for public office in particular. For instance, as suggested earlier, public office comes to the forefront of more than a few group discussions. What qualifications or expectations does one expect of someone who will attain a position of political authority? Not only are there legal implications in terms of legislative power, but also applications of influencing public policy and decision-making. From a public service standpoint, at least some members of the public will inquire at to a politician’s background history. What does their resume’ say about a candidate? Background, education, work history, real-life experiences, knowledge base, intellectual capacity, philosophy and ideology, and so forth? Do they have an action plan that details exactly what they plan to do? Or, do they simply babble and blather about superficially simplistic nonsense? Did they come up through the “ranks of life”, or is there an assumption of “inheritance” and entitlement to “public service”? Some might even be arrogant enough to say, “It’s my turn” now. Seriously? Is that a reference to a “political dynasty”, or “political aristocracy”, whereby the offspring automatically inherit public office? Did they ever take risks face to face in life-death provocations? Have they served their country or community as in the military or first responder capacity? From their experiences, have they grown wise in productive ways, as opposed to spewing condescending nebulous rhetoric that has no real purpose other than to criticize others? What does their manner of speech say about them? What do they fundamentally stand for? Could they be simply wolves in sheep’s clothing waiting the sheer the flock? More than likely, the future office holder probably has spent most of his or her efforts running for or holding some kind of public office, absent real-life experiences. Disturbing is what appears to be a trend toward self-promotion without the real substance of character to back up one’s presence. Egoistic assumptions of which the self-focus demonstrates an arrogance toward ignorance. Politicians and pundits relish in such divisive reflections of Hollywood celebrities. In one article from 2014, the researcher claims that American culture demonstrates an increasing and scary trend toward “anti-intellectual elitism”. With a frequent dismissal of scientific methodology, artistic creativity and intellectual discourse, the mainstream prefers entertainment, self-promotion and purposeful credulity. In other words, shallow, selfish and mean-spirited, with a predilection toward specious conjecture. Cynically, the motivations involve the gain of power, access to resources, and ensure control over others.[6] One assessment of the current political scene is to forget problem solving to ensure human social self-interests. Yes, of course, profane the discourse by pretentious finger pointing of who failed to do what. Blame everyone and everything. Dispute, debate and otherwise engage in commentary, benign and counterproductive, but also make certain nothing is ever accomplished. That seems to be the modern response to critical issues facing humankind. However, do not stop there; ensure a heavy penalty on the taxpayer. Cling to power because there is money to spend courtesy of the American taxpayer. Collusion, hypocrisy and corruption are consistent. Their collusions from arrogant schemes of the “psycho-medico-pharmaceutical” industry provoke an array of simplistic wishful dreaming. Designed cleverly, politicians and pundits pontificate the babblings of misinformation. Gross and dishonest exaggerations complicate the process of cooperative compromise to ensure “we the people” succeed through effective problem solving. to assert power, control and dominance over others, the con artistry is pervasive. Intimidation comes along for the ride as a convenient byproduct of fanciful notions. Mythic templates, from one extreme to the other, usually invoke easy excuses. In much of the discussion about a “human devolution”, or eventual societal collapse, some investigators speak about stages of regression that take place of time. Transitions involve many factors and could take decades or centuries. Within the mix of the downturn, the complexity is multifaceted. Yet, politicians play a key role in leading public policy toward corrective actions by virtue of exceptional leadership, tough decisions, and intense focus on fixing problems. Combined with the political know-how to ensure cooperative efforts among diverse participants, focusing on critical issues requires many to put aside the petty differences and dislikes. A few years ago, from a NASA study in 2014, researchers pointed out two significant factors regarding social collapse. These included straining resources beyond sustainability, and increased economic stratification of class structures. Working classes absorb the strain, while upper classes remain insulated at disproportionate levels. However, what mechanism provides the appropriate necessity of checks and balances? One part are executive and legislative branches necessary to safeguard a reasonable sense of justice for “we the people”, in terms of “promoting the general welfare” and “ensuring domestic tranquility”. So, rather than spewing nonsensical campaign rhetoric, name calling, and refusing productive and cooperative actions, the dysfunctional collusions, hypocrisy, and corruption hastens the eventual demise of democracy.[7] [1]From a website espousing the negative nature of modern politics and the collusive interactivity of hypocrisy; note, due to an overly sensitive, easily offended culture, direct citations are avoided; [2]Science oriented web publication and related article dealing with human deception; [3] Wisconsin based national magazine, addressing contemporary political issues; [4] Internet journal addressing political and social issues relative to democratic processes; [5]Bi-weekly online publication rendering opinion articles on contemporary politics; [6]Online educational resource service regarding political and educational interests; [7]2017 article from an online magazine specializing in the politics and culture;"

14,"Tragedy, Fear and Terrorism Arrogantly Near",news-society," Terrorism is crime and crime are terrorism. Add the externality of effects, from community to country, and criminogenic factors are elevated to a more adventurous status. Fear factors are influential, likewise, so is human weakness in confrontation with criminality. Whether local or foreign, the intrigue become exponential. While some run, cower, and beg for rescue, others fight back. To be fearful is demeaning, especially detached, removed and remotely unaffected, yet still afraid. For that, short-term memory fails to inform adequately. Cowards are many, while warriors are few. Criminals know this and plan accordingly. Criminality is premeditated, willful with purposes, freely chosen and with the sufficiency of malice aforethought. As long as humans prevail to exist, crime will never cease. Human nature attends so well to that. In 200,000 thousand years of assumed evolving status, not much has transcended to higher planes of multidimensional ascendency. Instead, malevolence lives on in the thoughts of the human species. No doubt among some, little more will achieve the noble realms of enlightenment for the many. Mature growth in wisdom’s advancement degrades to regressive inclinations. Although noteworthy exceptions apply, as a few strive to change, the vast majority will not. Exceptions are nearly always present in the diverse mix of the population in general. But it is too late and too little to avert the devolving intentions of the many who foment human extinction. Stupidity knows no limitations, and often, it is a ploy to commune with others, more cowardly by group consensus. Status quo relativism condones less honorable acts of barbarity so that criminal acts attain simplistic nonsensical explanations. One assessment of contemporary America addresses concern over widespread presumptions of human stupidity. The suggestion of “moronitude” seems an apt contemplation for further discussion. If stupidity or moronitude were a virus, the malady of modern foolishness appears to spread rapidly. In the foolhardy antics of modern society, outright expressions of being a fool are seemingly accepted. In some cases, particularly in politics, it is as though many applaud the idiocy of ignorance-laden commentary. From tragedy to fear, and terrorism far and near, the cowardly among us rush to every possible inconsistency of hasty generalization. Fools are everywhere. An observation, which nearly always invites bias on the part of the observer, searches for meaningful exchange in cycles of so-called news reporting. Actually, it is not news reporting one might perceive in 24/7 broadcasts by the vast network of infotainment. Instead, it is a morass of myriad opinions, typically from the younger ones aspiring to be famous celebrities. Opinionated beyond any pretense to intellectual ascendency, mostly based on someone else’s opinion, such failure of factuality does not aid the advancement of mature lifeforms. Aside from the debasing rhetoric, opinions are never evidence of the real and the factual. Nonetheless, smug piety prevails in the arrogance of ignorance, assuming tragedy and fear foment safe environmental adaptations. A widespread anti-intellectual malaise persists in the perpetuation of selfish motivations. Such intentions usually mean material and or psycho-dysfunctional reinforcement of some value. For instance, after a horrific tragic event, like a mass shooting, a rush to claim the surrender flag of “mental illness” hurriedly makes an appearance. Frightened, timid and cowardly responses blur the reality of human nature. Generally avoiding placing blame on the perpetrator, a chorus of disingenuous rhetoric ensues. Many assuming the pretense of their alleged “expertise” want in on the action. After all, there is infotainment to spin, rumors and conspiracies to concoct, and egregious fallacies to foment. While aiding and abetting the perpetrator, allowing a variety of excuses, there is profit to be made as well as political gain. Hedonism kicks into high gear to profiteer from the fear. Politicians manufacture instant cure-alls, reporters clamor for simplistic explanations and pontificators of one orthodoxy or another rant about curses and demonic manifestations. Entire academic and commercial enterprises abound in fabricating some “psycho-malady”, or socio-economic depravity. As terroristic behaviors justify grant funding and “research” papers, fees for “professional” consultations are likely to increase. Meanwhile, as competitive diagnoses confound the limits of scientific validation, insurances companies receive the billings and more drugs hit the marketplace. In the many schemes of the devolving nature of human existence, anything falls temptation to simpleminded rationalization. In a collapsing culture, with a penchant for jellyfish-like infatuation with mutating psychobabble, the human species lifespan diminishes toward extinction. Floating with no sense of evolving enlightenment, or progressive assurance of perpetual maturity, the spineless flaccid bloated self-centeredness consumes its own enslavement. Societal advancement decays in the viral contagion of stupidity, becoming more commonplace in a declining era. Unfortunately, in post-modern American society an element of stupidity runs rampant to the highest levels of commerce and government. In collusion, purported news services are highly commercialized ventures claiming the pretext of “unbiased” reporting. Yet, at the same time, the exaggeration of commentary, along with the choreographed and scripted pundit portrayals, often overlook the serious complexities of human behavior. Nonetheless, in typical melodramatic fashion, whether hurricane or shooting incident, the constant regurgitation of “concern” spews disingenuous hype that aggravates the tragedy. Stupidity enjoy absurdity. Stupid antics at every level of societal interaction hastens the final demise of a devolving species. A diverse group of experts from scientific fields asserts the view that the human species will eventually become extinct. Meanwhile, as “human devolution” continues a downward trend, various infotainment venues promote divisiveness frequently. Glorified by media exploitation, marketing manipulation expands into the realm of “fear mongering” at every possible opportunity. At least of course, that is the seasoned observation of some key analysts. A number of human behavior practitioners observing the social mainstream, practitioners and theorists alike, considered a reality of social regression. Folly chases idiocy in stalking every opportunity for commercial or political exploitation. With every intent to suborn common sense, the hedonistic calculus goes into hyper-drive. In recent reporting on the issue of “moronitude”, one social commentary argues that dumbness is arrogantly accepted. Not only approved but also embraced as though a compliment to current social interaction. Feeling good about being stupid is more important than in-depth analysis and ensuring competent validation of information. The trite, the trivial and the temperamental self-indulgence of post-modern society relishes in the satiation of hedonistically shallow emotionalism. For the carnality of non-evolving pleasure seeking, the selfish promotion for instant gratification does little to promote the advancement of the human species. Here, a distinction between productive pleasures and non-productive pleasuring offers a competing contrast. Such a divergence points to the pro-social as opposed to antisocial consequences between the mature framework of individual and social utility. That postures in contention versus counterproductive and socially malevolent antics that foster regressive tendencies. Concerns for the unity of a pluralistic society, and general welfare of the common good, appear readily compromised for the sake of self-serving political correctness. Selfishness abounds. In the grotesque extremes of condescending memes, the dissension in social discourse grows increasingly disharmonious.  Of tragedy, fear and terrorism, the provocations of malevolence come in many forms. Malice of any sort is the meanness, the hatefulness and the self-serving nastiness of a gluttonously arrogant bloated consumer culture. From narcissistic politicians on the national scene, to self-absorbed “social warriors” wearing masks, prosocial transformed into the antisocial. Similarly, whether by word or act, the wickedness is extraordinarily stressful. From a particular study, a writer points to a rise in selfishness. In an attempt to measure collective cohesion and cooperation, it appears people in general are decreasingly interdependent in relation to team building with prosocial implications. Additionally, working cooperatively and trying to see the world from other’s perspective, in order to problem solve, appears more challenging. However, sometimes, in the aftermath of a tragedy, a number of people will pull together for a limited duration. Likewise, following a horrific infliction of a terroristic act, exceptional examples of heroism occur. However, there are acts of debasing exploitation. Where some rise to the occasion, others inflict harm, spread fear and promote terroristic horrors. Solicitous or complicitous, the degradations torment and stifle productive transformations. Aiding and abetting the stagnation of human ascension is the vast reaches of infotainment. From one source to another, this realm of information flow spans the linkages between various media. News media, social media and mainstream media contribute divergent interactions that attempt to discern the deadly expressions of human behavior. Of such, nothing is well defined. For those prone to vicarious self-inflicted suffering, presumed victimization, or pretentious forms of social entitlement, tragedy and fear conspire to foment contentious social interaction. Hunting a conspiracy, conjuring up corruptive influences, or accusing the demons of misadventure, those promoting their own agenda find comfort in tragic misadventures. A disaster, catastrophe, or crisis of some sort become ripe for exploitative reactivity. Regarding the admonition, paraphrased as “never waste a good crisis”, politically speaking, post-modern cyber/cable extremism takes such advocacy to the lower depths of depravity. Politicians ramp up the idiocy with stupid commentary and foolish folktales, while network commentators make celebrities of terrorists. Smugly pious and self-righteous in their obliviousness to the real world, movie celebrities spin the utter nonsense of their juvenile conjecture. As a result, terroristic antics change into the manifestations of diverse illicit implications. All too often, for the astute observer, the commonality of logical analysis seems to disappear across the broad spectrum of social interaction. Common sense often lacks the allies necessary to succeed in triumph. Yet, if common sense were common, then everyone would have some. Since various forms of anti-thinking prevails in the mainstream, much evidence suggests the non-commonality of rational thinking. Critical analysis for uncovering serious evidentiary sufficiency appears to slumber in the slothful rejection of factual validity. While science takes a holiday in the memes of the mainstream infotainment, intellectualism erodes to debasing levels. In the culture of cowardly pontifications, the truth, evidence and proof vanish from the safeguards of free speech. Censorship grips social media to an unusual extent, as creativity slowly vanishes from any meaningful context. Woefully deficient across the entertainment arena are the meaningful acts of insightful and imaginative provocations of thoughtful energies. Instead, cowardice, arrogantly portrayed, spites the very notion of wiser pursuits. In bizarre echoes of maladaptive behavior, the human herds of emotional gutlessness revile reality. With a grotesque sense of materiality, as in the illusion of the so-called “American Dream”, there appears to be a commonality of anxiety in the face of presumed dangers. Fear arises in the nebulous supposition that something looms darkly that threatens possessiveness of the status quo. In a culture that values wealth, as well as gluttonous consumption, coupled with bloated egos for self-validation, specters of evil lurk everywhere. From the darkness, the fear of losing the materiality of comfort and ease encourages submission to enslavement. From some viewpoints, there is concern that many would commit treason than risk losing the so-called good life of consumptive pleasures. Self-preservation is more conducive to treachery in times of hardships than altruistic acts of sacrifice. An analysis of most natural disasters, or pandemic event, reveals instances of courage as well as acts of depravity. Not everyone will behave in rational, productive or self-sacrificing ways. Yet, one can study most organizational structures and assess the personality within the framework. It does not take a natural disaster to question the ultimate virtue of the participants of any institutional configuration. For large segments of society, consensus builds voluntary acquiescence to “herd thinking”. Group animosity has little appreciation for the one who does not fit the standard template of “normal”. Opposition easily reacts in negative ways to those prone toward independence, confident individuality and personal competence. Fearful of differences, the communal consensus wants conformity, as simplistic thinking wants one size to fit all. As some writers may lament the declining state of mental and physical fitness in the U.S., calling the culture a “nation of sissies”, darker prospects loom on the horizon. From a recent military study, the U.S. Army’s growing concern about fitness levels reflects a tragedy, fear and terrorism anxiety ridden society. Mentally unprepared and physically unfit to serve their country, over two-thirds of recruits do not meet minimum standards for service. This represent a serious national security concern. That is from a military perspective. From an associated standpoint, the public service area, first responder recruitment faces similar challenges. As to such critical issues, among the shortcomings are obesity, poor fitness, prior offenses, mental health, and substance abuse and so on. Increasingly, the responsibility for national defense, as well as public service, falls upon a smaller group of persons. That represents an unhealthy burden upon the few, while many escape responsibilities for their own betterment. The same speaks loudly in the law enforcement realm. Police agencies across the U.S. experience similar recruiting issues as the military. In spite of an expanding job market in public safety, cities, towns and villages struggle to find qualified recruits. Unfit for duty is a common theme. As fearfulness strikes back against logic and reason, a whining culture devolves into that which cowers from distance with news reports of tragedy, disaster and terroristic activities. Driven by incessant “news” coverage, coupled with over-rated and ill-informed opinions, pundits foment an atmosphere of fear. In the wake of homicidal event, for instance, all manner of exploitation comes to bear on the calamity at hand. Coverage is quickly overly dramatic and alleged “experts”, typically from academia and no field experience, a variety of disinformation. Misleading, misguiding and mistaken, the infotainment world kicks into high gear. For a culture of wimps, the vicarious affinity for being afraid becomes an arrogant assertion for herded thinking. Likewise, political agendas enjoy capitalizing on the marketing value of one disaster after another. From sales marketing to political campaigning, as well as social media promotion, “pandemic” sells the next “epidemic”. Nearly every aspect of the vast media networks expresses some form of human misfortune. The negativity is constant and extreme. In the non-reality of the “fake world”, large segments of society are fearful for unnecessary reasons. Promotion of the negative side of things is more common that the opposite perspective. Attempting to address the positive aspects of an issue or situation that considers the proportionality of the evidence, confronts the desire for immediate gratification in adversity. Danger, hardship and misfortune, are the natural antagonist of humankind. Self-evolving individuals struggle with the daily entanglements of myriad troubles.  Suffering, in one way or another, psycho-physically, is essential to the nature of human existence. Pain requires great courage to confront it, to live it, to embrace it, and yet most waste tremendous energy to avoid the fiery annoyance of such occurrences.  Where one philosophy would argue the aversion to pain and suffering, tragedy and fear, another would admonish living through the reality with great valor. To war against oneself, in the anguish of birth to the pretense of adulthood, carries the strain of breathing each moment of breath. Inconvenient toil goes with every heartbeat. However, in a cowardly culture, where ignorance blossoms the bliss of intense selfishness, the reality of the struggle balances precariously in fainthearted regression. At the fundamental basis of every wake-up call is the annoyance of trouble effort. In that, the frustration contrives by many inner splinter voices to confound the paradoxical opposite. For the hedonistic principles of pains versus pleasures, or by contrast the convulsion of such imaginings, one needs the other, in order for all the senses to prevail. All experiences are vital. No psychic heroism is without the striving against the incessant manifestations of human dysfunction in all its perverse diversity. Community and culture contrive to intervene in the maturation for such valiant efforts. To be scared is what the herd reinforces. Fear of everything, from commodity consumption to pandemic eruption, the infantile gluttony of self-immolation abounds. The sound waves of discord reverberate through incessant repetition by massive infotainment to ensure manipulative sanctions. Only the brave can resist the mainstream game of the emotional gambit that fosters an illicit consensus. Purposely naïve, deceptively captivated, a cast of many join the stage play of self-satiation for the thrill of the tragedy and the fear they relish. Across the planetary expanse, terrorism, as well as other threatening possibilities, become exploitable “movie scripts” for fame and profit. Politicians and pundits enjoy the promotion of a “good crisis.” For the individuation of selfless differentiation, the valor of the few focuses on the acute nature of context within calamity. Whether tears are joyous, or torturous, the reality summons the intensity of the focal point. Yet, the herd, the flock, and the pack, murmur the alliances of collective calamity, to assert the illicit commonality of the group’s dreadful unanimity.  Of tragedy, fear and terrorism, for the viral spread of pretentious anxiety desires the communal collusion of sameness. In brief, without prolonged digression, the unimaginative processes degrade to noncreative immobility of juvenile narcissism. Two dimensional at best the thinking goes dull."
15,Leadership in an Era of Leaderless Pretension - 1,news-society," In numerous corporate, governmental and collegiate forums, seminars and workshops across the U.S. nation, hope springs eternal in the elusive hunt for leadership. Who represents it in a realistic portrayal or ideal role model? What does such a term mean? Where in the real world is it applied? When does such a manifestation arise? How does such a characterization evolve? Lastly, why is such a personification necessary? At the onset of a typical collective of contrived consensuses on the topic of “leadership”, definitional criteria confound and confuses the efficacy of specificity. Defining and accepting the status quo of believability, usually depends on the context of the intention behind a particular forum. A training instigation may dictate the parameters by which such leader-oriented specifications are to eventually serve as application. Simultaneously, reality haunts the shadowy realms of psychodynamic considerations and subsequent explanations. In regard to the aforementioned onset of attempts of communal collectivism to specify a delineation, an argument ensues. This is the basis for speculative assertions as to whether or not a consensus context taints the reality of the very idea of leadership. A basic point of dictionary reference says “leadership” is the office or position of a leader. This of course, to the insightful inquisitor says essentially nothing of substantive value. It’s a red herring so to speak. Now, the inquirer with hopefully an open mind, and some well-grounded educational background, plus actual life experience, must go deeper. On a primordial amative human level, large numbers of seemingly sentient beings occupy various offices or positions that might be inferred as places of “leadership”. Yet, reality haunts such superficiality. As such, previously, several investigative questions offered further prospects for additional inquiry, which means delving to the depths of profound meaning. Such a quest is left up to the investigator for him or her to draw final conclusions. Meanwhile, at the local collegiate forum, attempting to motivate and inspire younglings, defining the scope of “leadership” calls upon numerous assumptions. Basic definitive claims, coming close to the supernatural realm of unexplained phenomenon, visits the mysterious notion that leadership infers the capacity to lead. That in turn cloaks the mythological notion of presupposed potentiality to make things happen. Add to that, the further claim, again of dictionary notoriety, asserting the act or instance of leading. From this, seemingly there flows the persistence of something akin to guiding or directing or motivating people in an assortment of directions. Consistent confusion prevails. Of that, consideration delves into the mystical realms of pretentious speculations to egregious misconceptions. All of which, depending on the locale, culture, environment and context, potentially fosters a diversity of opinion. In addition, contingent upon experiential capacity, adherents of one view point or another may significantly differ in interpretation. For instance, in the reality of ongoing societal interaction, probability of conflict and contention, interactivity expresses competing interests. As each inhabitant of the discourse brings different levels of experience, education, training, background, maturity as well as immaturity, conceptualizing what leadership means becomes complicated. An example includes the typical interaction between public services personnel, like first responders, and non-practitioner academics. In this writing, the perspective on leadership in an era of leaderless pretensions refers to leading in a realm of intense interpersonal contact. Within these frameworks, leaders emerge from the “school of hard knocks”, where maturity, learning and wisdom come from years of serious interaction with others. This includes primarily those environments that concern the safety and security of the public and properties of others. These are the theaters of first responders, the military and private security practitioners who ensure others are protected to every extent possible. From these ranks, arise an authenticity of well-differentiated individuals who are remarkably different from managers and supervisors. In contrast to those realms of profit continuity, consumptive oriented marketing, professional athletics, Hollywood celebrities, or political ascendency, the world of public service expresses a different conception of leadership. Perhaps, in this regard, there are at least potentially five types of alleged leadership. These might tentatively include: academia, corporate, political, celebrity and public safety services. All of which is debatable and philosophical at best. Nonetheless, the focus here is on those who put themselves in harm’s way for others in selfless sacrifice. Among these a few rises to the noble ascensions of what might be characterized as leadership. At its basic core, reflecting those who defend community and country, took an oath of office to do so, and put “skin in the game”, leadership is a courageous activity of influencing others in positive ways. Of that special positivity for transforming creativity, the leader expresses purpose, direction and motivational means to accomplish the mission of the organizational structure. The process is neither by antagonism nor patronizing condescension. Instead, a leader is one who leads from the front by exhibiting the ethics and professionalism of competence and capability. She or he shows the way, rather than points the way. In the post-modern era, leaders are scarce breed of “warrior”. In post-modern times of purposed wussification, escapist cowardly regressions and incessant infantile emotional reactivity, people cower at the mention of warriorhood. At the very core of psychodynamic personification of leadership is the essence of a warrior. Fear fosters the folly of retrenchment in the primal forsaking of ascending to higher realms of mature transformation. Leaders, by contrast, find their calling in the warriorhood of their quest. For this, rites of passage are essential in the foundation building of an individual adventure. To deny child-like selfishness and pursue self-evolution in differentiation for ascended transformation, requires exceptional courage. A common-sense focus on the necessity of trials and troubles in the maturation, pain and pleasure, losing and winning, are vital to the progression of the leadership process. Election, appointment or drafting to a particular office of life is not a designation of leadership. For a transitioning from infantile narcissism to mature sage, profound choices are made. Meanwhile, as fortification of the “mind” against the contrived consensus of the many, willful assertion of independence challenges the foolishness of conventionality. In leadership, one years for the next challenge in order to learn another elemental component of differentiation. While responsibility haunts every willful thought into motion, accountability demands personal redress. Personal analysis by intensely rigorous introspection denounces the foolishness of immature whining, moaning, complaining and sniveling about predicament, situation or environment. Leaders learn to shun the trifling self-absorption of silly egoistic preoccupations. Among the wiser prospects of an evolving leadership capacity, is the eventual understanding of delving into the depths of the darkness within. To embrace the darkness is what a warrior does. Lesser personalities, from the cowardice of easy hypocrisy and lazy superficiality, prefer the safe and secure mediocrity of status quo stasis. On the contrary, leaders are not satisfied with the motionless and redundant inertia of uncreative repetitiveness. For most, the stale dogmas of ideological oppression satiate the mundane familiarity of collective enslavement. Relying heavily on the intellectually impoverished contrived moral standards, many crave their acquiescence to rules that have no lawful viability. By neither rational consistency, social utility nor psychological efficacy, the vast reaches of infotainment manufacture contrived consensus to assert tyranny of dishonest moralities. From an admonition in the woods near a pond over a century ago, a determined sage pondered the relevance of obeying little and rebelling against much. Outside the parameters of duly constituted lawful constraints, no deviance exists and no rules apply, but for those by force of will does one subscribe. Leaders understand individual liberation. Yet, the crowded confines of mainstream complicity stifle the very necessity rightful responsibility expressed in authentic accountability. As the audience relishes in the simplicity and superficiality of the momentary showmanship, the price of admission is the subservience to a cast of condescending normalcy. A contrived consensus of primal carnality to the detriment of a productively evolving amative creativity, the social script conspires communal sameness. For those who dwell in that sanctuary of wiser realms of maturation and personal liberation, the solemn solitude of authentic mindful innovation is an echo not often heard. The roar and chaos of the crowded assemblage deafens the divine spark of self-evolution beyond commonality. To strive to walk in blameless persistence of determined differentiation is to risk adversity. In an era of leaderless the pretensions, the spew of hollow rhetoric reflects the cowardice of the times. Arguing the tireless climb out of the primordial ooze of devolving social disintegration, in spite of lofty arrogance in political masquerades, authentic leaders relentlessly pursue righteous endeavors. As such, cosmic complicity of human nature and nature’s universal unknowns, defy the woeful ignorance at feeble attempts to understand galactic mysteries. Foolishness often speaks with the subtle sleight of hand misdirection of pseudo-intellectual complicities. By contrast, leaders learn that many things cannot be answered, clearly understood, or easily solved in the vast puzzle of intricate planetary possibilities. On the other hand, many will believe anything, regardless of the facts, and most will resist any form of personal change. Comprehension of individual “divinely inspired creative evolution” is of a highly personal nature. For its nature and nurture, reflecting upon earlier writings of overcoming humanness, “super-heroic necessity”, or as one writer called it the “superman”, must rise above basic humanistic tendencies. Overcoming the selfishness of the original person is a dangerous and daunting mission. Meanwhile, the trials and tribulations necessary to the leader learning process is overwhelmed by deceptive mass marketing. Transitioning by willful choices to higher states of individuality means, to become a more profoundly evolved personality requires self-sacrifice beyond what many can imagine. Most will not endure the harsh experiences of energetic expenditures in self-evolving transformation. Leadership stems from such experiential character construction learned in the real world of severe realities. However, for the weak, timid, and fainthearted, arrogantly ignorant “all knowing gurus” proselytize the simplicity of easy and comfortable answers. For such, there is nothing in the human timeline. As “snake oil salesman” have always been around, their disguises fool the foolish who fancy themselves pretentiously aware of such con artistry. On the contrary, foolishness abounds in myriad forms in an era of leaderless pretensions. For the bravery of the few, those particularly outside public view, or mainstream info-edutainment, the “super-heroic” ideal appears as advertised on stage in cardboard templates of an assortment of celebrities. Typically, actors and entertainers of one sort or another, shallow personalities congregating in the assemblage of mass illusions, exact their magic upon an ill-informed audience. By masks of selfish promotion, for the fame and fortunate of personal dysfunction, the gurus of luminary adoration perpetuate the commercialized enslavement of the public. With few exceptions, and that means extremely few, there is little or no leadership expressed in these spheres. To look here for role models is to search for something not found. In the cult of celebrity worship, whether entertainment, politics or sports, leaderless pretensions abound. Ancient wisdom, long forgotten, seldom passed on to the younglings, forbids the acquaintance with those whose motives are cowardly inclined. Yet, of the post-modern zeal for “selfie” recognition and praised immediate gratification, the pablum of thumbing sucking children in adult bodies bears no reality to the true heroism of those who labor to higher realms. For leaders, who risk the wrath of tentative followers, adherents, collaborators, associates or colleagues, due to their purposed differentiation, the bravery cannot be fully appreciated. As serious responsibility lingers and demands an accounting in subsequent judgement of whatever tribunal, life or death or otherwise, the leader holds fast to his or her deliberations. Proof is the persistent courage to do what is right no matter the repercussions or the animosity of the weak and spineless. Leaders do not suck up, grovel, snivel in self-pity, or whine with scapegoating cowardice. In the tradition of the warrior, the precepts of martial principles, fearlessness to overcome fear and assert the personality of exceptional creativity resides in the freewill potency of individuality. Where it hurts, the pain must be experienced. Mind, body and essence, or spirit or energy, whatever the individual perceives in terms of personal belief system, contends with the dynamic nature of self-revelation. Harmonizing the inner strengths to face the mirrored reflection of weaknesses, embracing the darkness, and generating personal power to prevail is of valiant measure. In a more generic or basic sense, every now and then a “gunfight” is necessary. Now, for those who are frightened and the very mention of the word “gun”, the suggestion here is not literal. Although when it comes to self-defense in the real-world, such could be the reality. Nonetheless, and American wussification aside for the moment, the proverbial “gunfight” at “high noon”, or the confrontation at the “O.K. Corral”, is metaphorical in confronting fearful things. Discourse on the necessity of conflict to assist in personal self-evolution is a diverse matter of discourse. That aside, it remains fascinating when a group gets together to discuss the conceptual framework of leadership. Conversation varies depending upon individual viewpoints, experiences, education, and so forth. Generational diversity additionally plays into the context of the dialogue. A number of personal complexities, personal transformation, and maturation level come to bear. Wiser and more weighty comprehension of leadership are incumbent upon the competency of individual differentiation. Like the proverbial loosely ascribed analogy of the “gunfight”, as each is changing or devolving by their own instigation, engagement with life’s challenges is crucial to the foundation building process for leadership. In experiencing the vast diversity of social interactivity, leaders invigorate themselves through the hardships. For each different journey, quest or adventure, the perceptual configuration becomes unique. Exposure to the harsh realities of interacting with other humans, especially in moments of sheer terror, is crucial to personal learning and private introspection. Diverting for a moment to the wonderland and never-never land of academia, seminars on leadership are fascinating observations in the study of people. Of particular captivating reflections are those moments where generational younglings attempt to “teach” the veteran elders about life. What fun that can be from a sinister perspective. As one would say in the American south, bless their little hearts. How precious that is coming from a child-like perspective, absent the terroristic experiences of intense maturation. And, in post-modern western cultures, particularly in the U.S. the social devolution in terms of profound cultural “wussification” enforces condescending and divisive recriminations. With regard to the public safety arena, less than 1% of the population endanger themselves to serve others in the realm of law enforcement. Adding to that, depending on the references used, about 5% to 7% of all living Americans have ever served their country in the U.S. armed forces.  Such calling or interest in the dangers of public service become the foundational processes toward building a leadership-oriented character. To extrapolate further, provisionally this suggests less than 10% embrace the call to public safety and security services in defense of country and community. So, at this juncture, the passion for selfless service is contingent upon individually willed motivation to purse more profound rites of passage. Within this sphere, serving others in the competence of leadership dwells in these enclaves of dedicated constabulary. Exhibitions of such leader potential in a leaderless society rises among those who endeavor to protect others. And, every day, without complaint or remorse, many take on such tasks. Leadership in an era of leaderless pretensions offers the serious probability for a few to ascend to the higher possibilities of personal transformation. While cowardice, hypocrisy and incompetence pillage the social mainstream, social media, infotainment and political processes, the likelihood of societal collapse hastens human extinction. But for the few, the valiant ones who keep watch over their personal transformation, ascendency to those greater realms of individuality remains in steadfast perseverance. As con artists come and go, and gurus of every stalking leer perpetrate misdirection, the dedicated warriors of exceptional leadership capacity focus on personal liberation. For the courage to resist the temptations of commonality in status quo banality, the knight persists in his or her quest to overcome the fears, the doubts and foolish simplicity of ignorance in normalcy. Embracing the divine potentiality of profound individuation, he or she, or whatever one chooses to be, refuses to cower in the presence of conflicting darkness. Early on, leaders learn that two potent forces, contrived by others with cunning legerdemain, present experiential efficacy or denial of potency. Of these, philosophers mention the fear of death and fear of living a life worth living. Of particular contravention to productive intentions comes in the myriad and deceptive forms that threaten individual psycho dynamics. As some postulates in times past, the “psycho-death” is debility to many, and encourages the loss of identity and submission to communal conformity. For the vast majority, powerlessness is preferred by unity in the herd. Crowded fondness for the commonality of safe mediocrity in the status quo overshadows and satiates the spinelessness within. Yet, safety in numbers is not always safe. In the normalcy of sameness, significant numbers of people embrace the perpetual consistency of the status quo, even to the detriment of their individuality. To this, the leader has additional energies to expend in the inspiration of those who would shrink from their uniqueness. Cowardice, hypocrisy and the dullness of commonality continues to confront and censor efforts to self-evolve. In the process of individuation, the leader continues his or her ascension to higher levels of personal transformation. Changing oneself is of the utmost essentiality. All too frequently, so many reside in the dead zone of inarticulate and woefully deficient realms of lethargic apathy. In this willful collective, or as some call it, the hive, leadership strives to encourage exceptionality and profound unfolding differentiation. While ignorance is bliss in the “collective consciousness” of voluntary mediocre entrenchment, leaders work diligently to foster extraordinarily innovative processes. On a smaller minded and meaner level, albeit jealous and adversely projective, most salacious desire others to reflect their shortcomings and biases. Of this foolishness, the primordial carnality for unevolving regressions is debasingly rife throughout the social mainstream of American society. In a society that values “normalcy” over individuality and creativity, the expectation of social advancement is limited. Of that demeaning superficiality, abnormal in a broader spectrum of group consensus becomes the “normal”. Examples are everywhere. Mainstream “news” sources, as well as social media are widespread with the divisiveness of condescending invective. Rumor, gossip and opinion fall into a more salacious expression of fiction as fact. Viciously, the transition trumpets the inventiveness at any given moment if the collectivist sensitivity becomes threatened. Effective and bold leadership endangers such stability. For the leader, he or she recognizes the necessity of constant vigilance in order to guard against the forceful oppression of “herd thinking”. Sometimes the clues surface in the consensus building rhetoric of “celebrity training sessions”. One online lecture series poses a conjecture as to whether or not commonplace familiarity has become a sickness of sorts. Whereby, as the commentary expresses the admonitions of herded or crowded adherents in the assemblies of deception, ignorance and hypocrisy. On the other hand, maybe all of that is one in the same sense of foolish irony in a collapsing society. Whereas, in the corruption of the mainstream by devolving idiocy of less vibrant cerebral capacity, the many decry the differentiation of the few. For most people, such incursions are a complex mixture of slow indoctrination into conventional collective of behavioral centralities. For this, the meaning of “normal”, that is follower, adherent, devotee or fan, is particularly relevant in a post-modern human species on the brink of an apocalypse. While some may argue the relative nature of intentional conformity, dependent on a number of factors in a given locale, a common thread is citied as to the intent to conform to the “greater good”. To be a conformist is to submit or otherwise surrender to the status quo. This means the purposeful adherence to the dominant perspectives of the surrounding human environment, and embracing the associated belief systems. From celebrity worship to guru submission, across the various institutional and social frameworks, the admonition is typically in favor of the collective, the hive, or the flock. As the mainstream infotainment networks promote alleged “leaders”, the posture of “leader” devolves to less than desirable characterizations. As such, leadership in an era of leaderless pretensions degrades to a lower descent than that historically conceived as a heroic ideal. Leadership expressed by leaders is among a smaller group of brave individuals. On the national scale, there are fewer among such personalities referred to as leaders."
16,The Irony Of Commemorating The Sharpeville Massacre Amidst Ongoing Police Brutality,news-society," March 21, 1960, now commemorated as Human Rights Day every year in South Africa, was one of the key moments in the fight against Apartheid when innocent protestors were killed by Police on that fateful day. Today, Police brutality is an ongoing atrocity against humanity in South Africa - a symptom of normalised ruthlessness. In his virtual address to the nation on Human Rights Day this year, President Cyril Ramaphosa reflected briefly on the Sharpeville Massacre - an event in which dozens of innocent protestors died at the hands of Police officers. Ironically, he mentioned nothing about the revolting Police brutality that continues to terrorise many in the post-Apartheid era. ​Just two weeks ago, the nation expressed outrage over the killing of Mthokozisi Ntumba during student protests near the University of the Witwatersrand. Ntumba wasn't even participating in the protest, but a mere bystander who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The sad truth is that Ntumba's death is not an isolated case of Police brutality. This was yet another addition to a growing list of civilians killed at the hands of law enforcement officials in South Africa. Last August, 16-year-old Nathaniel Julius was fatally shot allegedly by Police officers. At the beginning of the coronavirus lockdown last year, 11 people were killed in what Ramaphosa described as 'over-enthusiasm'. Whilst Police brutality in the United States of America last year made global headlines, little do people know that the situation is at least three times worse on local shores. According to the Washington Post, Police in the US killed 990 people in 2018. According to the Investigative Police Directorate’s annual statistics, officers from the South African Police Service (SAPS) killed 538 people in the 2017-2018 reporting year, and 440 people in the 2018-2019 reporting year.  To put the comparison into perspective, South Africa’s population in 2018 was 57.78-million people and the US population in 2018 was 327.2-million people. Police Minister Bheki Cele is quick to turn such fatal events into opportunities for his own publicity. A visit to the victim's family does little to heal wounds, especially since he is the very same Police minister who at some point in his career wanted the law to be changed so that Police can to ""shoot to kill"" and ""worry later"". Former Police commissioner Riah Phiega described Police officer's handling of the Marikana Massacre - yet another brutal event in which South Africans were murdered at the hands of Police - as a representation of ""the best of responsible policing"". There seems to be a severe lack of accountability, perhaps even encouragement of brutality from top cops to some extent. The result? An ongoing massacre of innocent lives. South Africans will continue fearing the very same people who are meant to protect them as officers easily dodge accountability. Achieving justice for victims of Police brutality is a tiring, difficult, and nearly impossible, task because IPID - who is tasked with ensuring justice for victims - is acutely understaffed and underfunded. It is a shame that Ramaphosa spoke about the horror that was the Sharpeville Massacre but failed to acknowledge the very fact that Police brutality is an ongoing, harsh reality which South Africans grapple with to this date. A powerful resolution to hold guilty officers accountable and a deeper commitment from the powers that be to eradicate Police brutality is long overdue. As South Africans, we cannot allow negligent officers to wage an undeclared war against innocent civilians. We cannot accept Cele's publicity stunts and certainly cannot allow Ramaphosa to let us think that incidents of Police brutality are merely acts of 'over-enthusiasm'."
17,1. Domestic terrorism in the US.,news-society," Domestic Terrorism in the United States Mustapha Kulungu, Ph.D. ILM Foundation Institute of Los Angeles ABSTRACT Domestic terrorism involves violence against the civilian population or infrastructure of a nation- often, but not always, by citizens of that nation. The main agenda behind this is to intimidate, coerce, or influence national policy. There is a need to explore and understand domestic terrorism in the United States, including various organizations and anti-government extremists. It is noted that there is increased political extremist groups in the United States.  However, in the 21st century, technological tools have affected domestic extremism recruitment. A July document from the FBI estimated that there were roughly 15,000 websites and web forums that support terrorist activities. Around 10000 of them maintained plots, and attacks by foreign-inspired homegrown violent jihadists have earned more media attention. The US government reacted significantly, enhancing its counter-terrorism efforts. My analysis of the level of extremism in the United States and future trends and threats as it relates to domestic extremist groups Extremism is primarily used in a religious and political sense to refer to an ideology that is considered to be far outside the mainstream attitudes of a society. FBI’s public formulation of extremism suggests two components. First, extremism involves having a particular ideology. Second, it also includes a criminal activity to advance these ideologies. A few issues make it hard to grasp the breadth of domestic terrorism activity in the US. First, counting the number of terrorist plots, in general, has been difficult. Second, there may be ambiguity in the investigative process regarding exactly when the criminal activity becomes domestic terrorism. Third, the federal government appears to use the terms 'terrorist' and 'extremist' interchangeably when referring to domestic terrorism (Doosje et al., 2013). Finally, and most importantly, which specific groups are and should be considered domestic terrorist organizations? The US government does not provide a public answer to this question. Instead, the federal government defines the issue in terms of ""threats,"" not groups. Recent studies, investigative reports, and intelligence products show that non-Islamic domestic terrorist groups, militias, and sovereign citizens may pose a more significant threat than the Islamic extremist groups. A January 2009 I&A report states that left-wing extremism activities, particularly cybercrimes, will increase over the next decade. Also, a report from April 2009 on domestic right-wing warns of increasing recruitment and radicalization. The second group is the Violent Domestic Islamic Extremists are a growing threat –foreign fighters train and recruit Americans to fight for their cause either overseas against fellow Americans or by returning home and continuing their terrorist activities. It is estimated that 100-200 American individuals travel to Iraq and Syria to join a dissident organization. The third group, Active shooters and lone wolf offenders, most successful and most feared as the standard method of attack is the use of firearms. Domestic terrorist strategies incline to prefer strikes that evade active countermeasures and capitalize on the weaknesses. The strategies chosen by domestic terrorists have become more deadly gradually, a drift that could linger for many years to come if nothing robust is done to counter it. Additionally, the Internet is a double-edged sword in the fight against terrorism because all terrorists have maximized its use for their advantage (Brennan et al., 2015). Consequently, social constructs and sentiment, and high-tech vicissitudes will meaningfully continue to impact the overall character of the domestic terrorist threat. The existing research on domestic terrorist occurrence categories stipulates that ideology categorically plays a significant role in an offender's kind of attack. In the United States, right-wing domestic terrorists have commonly targeted those they believe as responsible for threats related to religious, political, or racial issues (Hewitt, 2003). Right-wing domestic terrorists have used various forms of attack that are likely perpetrating damage against individuals or locations that they common, including armed assaults, bombing/explosion attacks, and so on. In essence, the danger of domestic terrorism in the United States will result in augmented counterterrorism participation for all branches of government, from local, state to federal law enforcement, and every citizen to work together in eradicating the threat of religious extremism (Pratt, 2010). In summary, the domestic terrorism situation in the United States is dynamic and encompasses far more threats and extremist groups than in the past. Combating the domestic terrorist is complex. Entities such as the federal government, Department of Justice (DOJ), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Department of Homeland security (DHS) should focus more on prevention, detection, investigation, interdiction, and mitigation of domestic terrorism in the United States. What has contributed to the rise of political extremist groups in the United States? Why do individuals feel they are disenfranchised from their government? Political extremists also referred to as either far-right terrorism or right-wing terrorism aims to overthrow governments and replace them with nationalist or fascist regimes. Far-right attacks include using simple to acquire, easy to use, and requires little preparation. Political extremist groups often take inspiration from Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, although the groups frequently lack a rigid ideology. The number of terrorist attacks by far-right perpetrators rose over the past decade. It is growing more than quadruple from 2016. People feel disenfranchised from the government when the political voice is limited and experience economic precariousness (Doosje et al., 2013). The expression and mobilization of political views have been much facilitated by the extraordinary growth of information and communication technologies (ICTs). Estimated three-quarters of the world population, the United States included, now have access to 'right to information laws. Several factors may have contributed to the growth of Far-right attacks. First and foremost, right-wing extremists are increasingly using the Internet and social media to issue propaganda statements and organizing travels to attend and other events, raise funds, recruit members to coordinate training (including combat training), and communicate with others. The Internet and social media provide an unpatrolled opportunity to reach a broader audience (Taylor et al., 2014). One Islamic State defector noted, ""The media people are more important than the soldiers…"" The Islamic State, other Salafi-jihadist organizations like al-Qaeda, have used social media to recruit. Secondly, the proliferation of Lone wolves, like ISIS, has encouraged more supporters to carry out their US attacks. When individuals feel oppressed, and under economic pressure, they get disenfranchised. This feeling, either economically or socially disenfranchised, is the biggest recruiting tool for extremist groups (Jasko et al., 2017). When a generation spends more time alone than the previous cohort, they get eager for connection and meaning. This causes vulnerability to rhetoric that promises them a sense of belonging, purpose, and a way to contribute to a cause more significant and better than themselves. Third, right-wing extremism is increasingly traveling overseas to meet and exchange views with like-minded individuals. For example, several Rise Above Movement members (RAM) traveled to Germany, Ukraine, and Italy to celebrate Adolf Hitler's birthday and meet with other members of the European white supremacist group (Gruenewald et al., 2013). These foreign connections provide US-based groups with an opportunity to improve their tactics, develop better counter-intelligence techniques, harden their extremist views, and broaden their global networks. Why do individuals feel they are disenfranchised from their government? The feeling of being forgotten is just another means to convey Americans' entrenched suspicion about the federal government. There is growing frustration with politicians in Washington, and nearly every poll illustrates the resentment. Consequently, the federal government's doubt relates to the logic that politicians — liberals and conservatives — are incapable of working together by finding the middle ground on issues that matter to most of the working class of Americans (Horgan, 2008). To sum up, stopping right-wing extremism will require a multi-pronged solution. The Us government should emphasize increased law enforcement solutions. Remind people what the core values of democracy are and what it means to live in an inclusive democracy — school programs and educational initiatives that increase empathy and cross-cultural understanding. The radicalization process of individuals into extremist groups McCauley and Moskalenko (2008) Radicalization, from the point of descriptive view, refers to the change in beliefs, feelings, and behaviors that justify intergroup violence and the demand for sacrifice in defending the group. Religious violence is violence motivated by, or in reaction to, religious precepts, texts, or doctrines of a target or attacker. Ranstorp (1996) found the extent to which people experience deprivation as individuals and as a group member predicts the radical belief system's determinants. One of these determinants is perceived injustice, which in this model indicates perceived societal disconnectedness, defined as a perception that an individual does not belong to society's mainstream, an idea that feeds violent attitudes. Hogg and Adelman (2013) postulate that people are motivated to reduce self-uncertainty, specific feelings of uncertainty about their lives, future, and uncertainty about themselves and their identity. One way to solve this problem of self-uncertainty is group identification. Individuals use the groups that they are part of to define their self-concept. The radicalization process starts with an individual grievance that they have been personally wronged or victimized and seeks revenge for experiences (Triandis, 2008). They combine personal grievances with political grievances –an individual seeks to revenge or protect a group in response to political trends viewed as threatening that group. The slippery slope represents gradually after an individual engages in increasingly radical behavior as he/she integrates into a radical group or organization. Then joins the radical group, also known as the power of love: an individual joins a militant group due to the pull of romantic or comradely love and participates in the group's activities to sustain those relationships (Wikström et al., 2017). Islamic religion all over the world has been alleged as the gravest architect of religious violence vis-à-vis terrorism. Therefore, Senghal (2003) suggests that Muslims continue to push their communities into medieval practices, and as such, they pose a challenge to communal harmony and perpetuate the backwardness of their community. Therefore, the clash of civilizations is being provoked by Islamists in many parts of the world. In this direction, Avolos (2005) asserts that religions cause religious terrorism or that religion creates an imagery supply of sacred resources over which human being contends. Within the radical group, high-risk behavior, if successful, offers a pathway to status; this is known as the Risk and Status stage. Individuals are motivated to become radicalized based on an opportunity to increase their economic and social rank within the community. Extremist groups are offered compensatory employment, protection, and protection from local violence. The unfreezing stage, the final step: loss of social connection opens an individual to new ideas and a new identity, individuals may begin to associate with, unlike parties. The relation between the various religions of the world has often been hostile. Hard to miss the news about conflicts between Jews and Muslims, between Muslims and Hindus. Islamic faith all over the world has been alleged as the gravest architect of religious violence vis-à-vis terrorism. Muslims continue to push their communities into medieval practices, and such, they pose a challenge to communal harmony. Therefore, the clash of civilizations is being provoked by Islamists. Christianity had had a fairer share of religious tensions in human history. Hence, Christians have persecuted Jews and fought wars against Muslims. Within Christianity, there have been internecine wars, mainly between Roman Catholics and Protestants. To put it briefly, now having incriminated most of the world religions with the act of violence and terror, most people's opinion is that the contemporary facade of terror against humanity is essentially religious. However, to merely close, the matter at this point will violate the spirit of democracy in our time. Therefore, we turn our attention to the opinion of the minority or, instead, the unpopular argument. How do 21st technology tools such as social media affect and impact domestic extremism recruitment, membership, and sustained impact? Technology is the foundation of modern society, it governs its dynamics, and therefore, it is also expected that terrorism will benefit from it.  Intelligence and law enforcement agencies worldwide are warning about possible terrorist attacks in the major cities. Cyberspace is an environment without boundaries, a privileged place where terrorists find resources, make propaganda activities, and from which it is possible to launch attacks against enemies everywhere in the world. The experts explained that in 1998, the number of websites containing terrorist material was twelve. In 2003, they counted 2,650 sites, and in September 2015, the total amount reached 9,800.  The data leaves no doubts: the terrorist organizations are looking with increasing interest to the Internet. A commonly voiced public concern is the process of internet/social media radicalization, which has emerged as a finding in some research (Aly, 2014; Haider, 2015). However, they also question why there is no more radicalization; if so, many people are introduced to radical ideas online. Brennan et al. (2015) find that internet radicalization is viable in conjunction with other factors, but not alone. Some have found that observing gory propaganda films online in a group leads to radicalization (MPAC, 2014; Bartlett & Miller, 2012) The Internet offers simple access to the global stage; terrorists can reach the masses or targets specific groups of individuals. The use of the Internet is cheap –terrorists can arrange and carry out efficient propaganda campaigns without economic struggle, meaning with a very low budget (Taylor et al., 2014). The Internet, and generally speaking technology, could be exploited by terrorist organizations for several purposes, such as propaganda, recruitment, mobilization, fundraising, data mining, secure communication, cyber-attacks software distribution, buying fake documents, and training. Groups like ISIS demonstrated a great mastery of the technology and an in-depth knowledge of communication techniques.  New social platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and media services such as YouTube are manipulated to send images of high emotional impact to specific audiences. The language they use is direct. The messages are accessible even to the young generation. This aims to influence their think and choose to be new members of the groups.  On the Internet, it is possible to find any training material, including manuals to prepare chemical weapons and bombs (Lake, 2002). Experts have also discovered documents containing the instructions for kidnappings and techniques of torture. Once again, the technology assumes a crucial role for terrorists that also share manuals for optimizing the use of social media and communication platforms, avoiding monitoring operated by Intelligence agencies. Experts from the Ghost Security Group discovered a new Android App for encrypted communication that integrates other mobile applications specifically developed to share propaganda content and recruiting material (Ghosh et al., 2009). In many cases, the members of groups of terrorists also use a mobile app available on the market and implement end-to-end encryption, including simplified messaging chats like Telegram or Signal. ISIS is trying to recruit hackers and experts to involve them in their hacking campaigns. References Avalos, H. (2005) Fighting Words: The Origins of Religious Violence. New York: Prometheus.

18,The Boarder Crisis will only get worse,news-society," The flood of travelers at the southern line will get more critical in the coming months, Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week,"" adding that he predicts 1 million individuals could attempt to cross the line by the late spring. ""I was administrator of Homeland Security, and as a government examiner down here - it will deteriorate. It will deteriorate. Springtime, summer, increasingly more come over,"" McCaul told ""For this present Week"" co-anchor Martha Raddatz. ""I anticipate 1,000,000 individuals attempting to get into this country by the mid year."" ""I think they've made the emergency,"" McCaul said to Raddatz. ""He says he has an arrangement. I haven't seen an arrangement."" ""This is a helpful emergency. We see the youngsters and the infants. We're returning to division of families, and the dealers are isolating the kids from the families, and we're returning to catch-and-delivery, and we're returning to kids in confines once more,"" he added. McCaul said the way of talking coming from the Biden organization, in particular Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, is unreliable, highlighting Raddatz's meeting with Mayorkas prior in the program. ""What's more, the motivation behind why they are coming, is on the grounds that he says words do matter,"" McCaul said of Biden. ""What's more, they do. The informing is that, 'on the off chance that you need to come, you can remain.' When Mayorkas says, 'We're not saying don't come by any means. It's don't come now,' entirely unreliable way of talking for Secretary of Homeland Security to say."" Mayorkas disclosed to Raddatz that the Biden organization is attempting to invert harm done by previous President Donald Trump. ""For what reason is it particularly testing and troublesome at this point? Since the whole framework under United States law that has been place all through organizations of the two players was destroyed completely by the Trump organization,"" Mayorkas told Raddatz. ""In this way, we are modifying the framework as we address the necessities of weak kids who showed up at our lines. Also, that is what is the issue here. It's about weak kids."" Raddatz got some information about what the Biden organization needs to change with respect to informing to attempt to moderate the flood at the line. ""I believe it's short of what was needed,"" McCaul said. ""So until this approach transforms, I would ask the organization return to the traveler insurance conventions, this worked and was successful."" Raddatz squeezed McCaul on the implications of those conventions. A Human Rights Watch report on the approach, which sent refuge searchers to Mexico while the United States handled haven demands, had ""genuine common freedoms outcomes."" ""Basic freedoms Watch says on account of that strategy, they have reliably discovered that travelers in Mexico are presented to assault, grabbing, blackmail, attack, and mental injury. Almost 50% of those met said Mexican police movement specialists or criminal gatherings focused on them for blackmail. How is that a decent strategy?"" Raddatz inquired. ""Well it's a decent arrangement since it discouraged. Discouragement is a key here,"" McCaul said. ""We need to deal with private interests in Central America to get to the underlying driver,"" he added. Raddatz tested McCaul on his ""no"" votes in the House on bits of enactment that would give pathways to citizenship to undocumented youngsters. The House took up the enactment a week ago, and passed it almost along partisan principals, with nine Republicans crossing the passageway to cast a ballot for the enactment. McCaul, who casted a ballot against its entry, said when pushed on his votes the bills didn't address a portion of his central concerns. ""For what reason shouldn't undocumented kids, who were brought to this country as youngsters, no shortcoming of their own, be given a few rights toward citizenship?"" she inquired. ""We had - the larger part had - a legitimization for the DACA kids, a legitimate way. We had a visitor laborer program too. Also, sadly, movement is clearly an extremely troublesome subject, however the fact is Martha, neither one of those bills tended to this issue,"" McCaul said. ""They don't have anything to do with this, and they will not tackle this issue. Indeed, again returning to prevention and informing, it sends the specific wrong message,"" McCaul said."

20,Capital Punishment: How Money And Power Reshapes Societies,news-society," In a capitalist system, money is inextricably linked with power – the more money you have, the greater influence you wield. In particular, purchasing power can become political power when the wealthy use their resources to assume positions in the corridors of influence through attending elite private schools, exclusive social clubs, or networking events where they can form connections with other monied interests. The wealthy can also attain political control by either bankrolling those already in power who hold opinions favourable to them, by using expensive PR and marketing campaigns to shift public opinion in ways which suit their interests, or by forming pressure groups to influence politicians directly, among any number of other methods. There are many different names given to this phenomenon – corporate lobbying, nepotism, corruption, cronyism, ‘the old boys club’, bribery, sleaze – and lots more, but all of these terms describe the same behaviour. Namely, those with substantial levels of wealth are able to leverage these resources to shape societies in ways which fit their interests. A prime example of this comes in the examples of the Koch brothers and the Mercer family. Charles and David Koch are American billionaires and the primary owners of the second largest privately held company in the United States. Since 1953, they, their family members, and several other extraordinarily wealthy donors have spent many hundreds of millions of dollars (probably even several billion dollars) on setting up think tanks and political action committees to pursue the Koch brothers’ political agenda of deregulation, low taxation, reduced environmental protections, and more. Meanwhile, the Mercer family have also been major funders of right-wing publications and think tanks in the USA such as Breitbart News, the Heritage Foundation, and the Cato Institute – among scores of others. On the other side of the political spectrum, the Hungarian billionaire George Soros founded the Open Societies Foundation and is thought to have donated over $32 billion to this organisation since its inception. Due to the Open Societies Foundation’s support and aid for refugees seeking asylum in Western nations, along with its lobbying for pathways to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the USA and other countries, George Soros has become a villainous figure for much of the European and American right-wing. ‘The Strong Will Do What They Have The Power To Do, And The Weak Will Accept What They Must Accept’ – Thucydides, The Melian Dialogue The theme of those with financial power using it politically to further their own interests is sometimes combined with military power. Consider the example of the United Fruit Company. Before WW2, the United Fruit Company was able to establish highly lucrative operations throughout Latin America due to the dictators of these nations guaranteeing them an advantageous business environment through such measures as repressing labour rights, offering tax incentives, and providing land grants. Then, in 1944 United Fruit began experiencing difficulties in Guatemala – one of their most important bases. The Guatemalan President, Jorge Ubico, a dictator closely aligned with US interests and an enthusiastic supporter of the United Fruit Company, was deposed in a popular uprising. Over the next 10 years, several of the Presidents to follow Ubico enacted land reform measures which returned vast swathes of land owned by United Fruit back to the Guatemalan people. By 1954, the United Fruit Company had seen enough, and heavily lobbied the American government to take action. Partly due to the fact that several of US President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s staff had ties to United Fruit, they were only too happy to oblige. As a result, the CIA orchestrated a successful coup in Guatemala which deposed the elected President and installed another dictator who was more amenable to American interests. What followed was four decades of brutal civil war between Guatemala’s dispossessed poor and a succession of US-backed dictators, which left 200,000 civilians dead. In March 1999, US President Bill Clinton finally apologised to the Guatemalan government for the atrocities committed by the American-backed dictatorships, saying that ‘for the United States it is important I state clearly that the support for military forces and intelligence units which engaged in violence and widespread repression was wrong.’ However, Guatemala was by no means an isolated case. The trail of destruction and bloodshed which the United Fruit Company – together with their powerful allies in government and in the military – left across a series of Latin American states is almost staggering in its scale. Not So Long Ago, Not So Far From Home Examples of corporate interests becoming political and military interests too are by no means confined to little-considered Latin American states in long-gone decades. For instance, over several years in the late-1960s to mid-1970s, individuals from the British security services, senior ranks of the military, and well-connected political circles, covertly plotted to overthrow Harold Wilson, the elected Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and install in his place a coalition government of their choosing. To most, such a conspiracy sounds extraordinary, but confirmation came from MI5 whistleblower Peter Wright, who outlined the plot in his book Spycatcher, which on its release in 1987 was banned from publication in England. Others who have verified accounts of the plot against Wilson include Hugh Cudlipp, the former editor of the Daily Mirror, and the former intelligence officer Brian Crozier. It is thought that the conspirators had a specific individual in mind to lead this unelected government – none other than Lord Mountbatten, a relative of both the Queen and Prince Phillip. As Patrick Sawer, a Senior News Reporter at the Daily Telegraph has written: Lord Mountbatten came dangerously close to leading a cabal of industrialists, generals and tycoons plotting a coup against an elected Labour government…The 1968 plot was designed to replace Prime Minister Harold Wilson with a coalition government to bring the country together, during what Mountbatten and the conspirators regarded as a time of national crisis. These events were featured in Season 3 Episode 5 of the TV series The Crown, which was appropriately titled ‘Coup’. A similar plot was hatched in the USA in 1933. After the election of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who had pledged to abandon the gold standard and enact a raft of left-wing economic policies which became known as the ‘New Deal’, magnates behind huge corporations such as Chase Bank, Standard Oil, General Motors, Goodyear, Dupont, Heinz, and others, conspired to recruit a private army of up to half a million military veterans to overthrow Roosevelt’s government and install a fascist leadership in his place. This became known as the ‘Business Plot’, and the conspirators approached Major General Smedley Butler – a 34 year veteran of the US Marine Corps, who at the time was the most decorated marine in US history – to lead their private army. However, Butler had become disillusioned by his experience in the US military, and not only did he refuse to participate in the plot, he testified about it before the United States House of Representatives in 1934. Despite Congress concluding that they were ‘able to verify all the pertinent statements made by General Butler’, no-one was ever prosecuted, nor were any of the main figures accused of involvement in the plot called to testify before Congress. Shortly after, in 1935, Smedley Butler released a book entitled War Is A Racket – the summary of which reads: War is a racket. It always has been. It is possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious. It is the only one international in scope. It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives. A racket is best described, I believe, as something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people. Only a small ‘inside’ group knows what it is about. It is conducted for the benefit of the very few, at the expense of the very many. Out of war a few people make huge fortunes. More recently, the sequence of events which saw Dick Cheney be Chairman and CEO of the American oil company Halliburton between 1995 and 2000, then become United States Vice-President in 2001, followed by Halliburton then receiving a $7 billion contract in the run-up to the Iraq war which only they were allowed to bid on, is unlikely to be coincidental. Furthermore, in his autobiography, the former Labour Home Secretary Robin Cook wrote about the overly close relationship that the British defence company BAE Systems enjoyed with the highest echelons of the UK government, and how they would benefit from this cosy connection. Cook stated that ‘The chairman of BAE appeared to have the key to the garden door to Number 10. Certainly, I never knew Number 10 to come up with any decision that would be incommoding to BAE.’ As a final note, in 2006 an arms deal between BAE Systems and the Saudi Arabian rulers was being investigated by the UK’s serious fraud office for possible corruption, but following pressure from Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles, a former British Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, the investigation was dropped. Five years later, Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles was appointed International Business Development Director for BAE. COVID-19 And The Brave New World It has been well documented that during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, many billionaires have increased their wealth while most ordinary people have seen their incomes decline or their jobs disappear completely. For example, the BBC reported that ‘billionaires have seen their fortunes hit record highs during the pandemic’ while also noting that ‘a World Bank report showed extreme poverty is set to rise this year for the first time in more than two decades’. Meanwhile, USA Today stated that ‘the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered an economic crisis of a magnitude not seen since the Great Depression’, before continuing to say that ‘over a roughly seven-month period starting in mid-March, America’s 614 billionaires grew their net worth by a collective $931 billion.’ In truth, income inequality across much of the world had been rising for decades before the emergence of COVID-19, and in recent years the populations of many countries had reacted to these increased inequities by supporting a range of populist politicians who portrayed themselves as ‘outsiders’ railing against a corrupt ‘establishment’. In the UK, the foremost figure to play this role was Nigel Farage, while others such as Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson depicted themselves as brave combatants fighting against an out of touch and uncaring political elite. It is also not difficult to interpret the victory of the Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum as a vote against the British political establishment by those who had felt marginalised, ignored, and undervalued by mainstream politicians for a number of years. In other countries, this wave of populism found its figureheads through individuals such as Donald Trump in the USA, Marine Le Pen in France, Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, Sebastian Kurz in Austria, Narendra Modi in India, Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, Beppe Grillo and Matteo Salvini in Italy, Recep Erdogan in Turkey, Viktor Orban in Hungary, Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, and Volodymyr Zelensky in Ukraine, among others. As all these populists rose to power even before the substantial upward transfer of wealth from ordinary people to the billionaire class which occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, the question must now be asked – what will happen next, as people all over the world react to a such a rapid and significant increase in inequality, on top of what they have already experienced? Where Do We Go From Here? If public anger rises further due to the existing income and wealth inequalities being deepened still more, then it is not difficult to envisage the wealthy, elite classes becoming spooked and fearful of what may happen to their resources. As a result of this, it seems logical to suggest that elites will retreat to lavish, heavily guarded enclaves even more than they already have done – perhaps existing in some kind of ‘billionaire city’, where extreme wealth is a prerequisite for entry, and where connections to the world outside are minimal. A prototype for this kind of settlement can perhaps be seen in the example of Monaco. A Principality with a population of 38,000, one of the conditions for becoming a resident is to open a bank account in Monaco and deposit at least €500,000 in it. Taxes in Monaco are almost non-existent, and it has the largest police force in the world – both per capita, and per square metre – plus there’s a 24-hour video surveillance system in place which covers the entire surface area of the Principality. Monaco also has the second-highest GDP per capita in the world, beaten only by Liechtenstein. Interestingly, the only other two nations to have a GDP per capita in excess of $100,000 are Luxembourg and Bermuda, both of which are also regarded as refuges and tax havens for the ultra-wealthy. The vast majority (i.e. over 75%) of Monaco’s residents are foreign-born, as wealthy individuals (including celebrities such as Lewis Hamilton, Novak Djokovic, Bernie Eccleston, Shirley Bassey, and Bono) move there to enjoy the tax benefits and other lifestyle advantages. Monaco also has a poverty rate of zero, meaning that none of its population live below the poverty line, while its residents also enjoy the highest life expectancy in the world. It’s not surprising then, that for these reasons and more, Monaco is known as the “Billionaire’s Playground”. If public anger at rising levels of inequality continues to increase over time, and is bolstered by the substantial gains that the financial elites have made during a global pandemic which has severely impacted hundreds of millions of people across the world, then it is not difficult to imagine more Monacos being established in all corners of the planet, where the wealthy will flee to in return for guarantees of minimal taxation and heavy security – effectively cutting them off from the discontented world beyond the nation’s borders. Automation, Disinformation, And Militarisation In the background to all this, technological change continues at pace. The rise of the robots means that more and more jobs than ever before are being automated, and scientists predict that in the next few decades alone hundreds of millions of people around the world will have their jobs automated out of existence. As a response to the vast, incoming tidal wave of job losses and entire career pathways ceasing to exist, some seemingly utopian policies such as a four-day workweek and a Universal Basic Income (UBI) have been suggested by a range of academics, politicians, and businesspeople from a wide variety of political schools of thought. The specified goal is to ensure that the huge numbers of people who will see their job roles either diminish or disappear completely due to automation shall be given the basic resources needed to survive and craft a meaningful life for themselves. However, given what we know about the propensity for monied groups to either campaign against policies which do not fit their best interests, to flock to parts of the world which will not pursue those policies, or even to engage militarily against the ordinary working populations, why should we be so sure that the business and financial elites will not flex every bit of muscle they have to guarantee that they and they alone benefit from the enormous gains in productivity which automation will provide? What are the chances that, instead of embracing UBI and the four-day workweek, these elites use every tool in their armoury to keep as much as possible of the added value generated by automation for themselves, at the expense of the general population? Some methods the elites could use include passive measures, such as lobbying politicians, funding think tanks, or creating UBI and four-day workweek trials which are ‘set up to fail’, so they can then be used as ‘evidence’ to shape public discourse. More active measures could also be used by the elites to protect and enhance their advantages. As we have seen, using military means to accomplish this has not been beyond them before, so it should be assumed that it is something they may be willing to do again. This conflict between the interests of the general population and the interests of elites when it comes to the issues of automation and technological advancement, and of how this scientific progress could be used to benefit either group (or both), was addressed by Bill Joy, the Founder of Sun Microsystems, in an article he wrote entitled ‘Why The Future Doesn’t Need Us’. In it, he stated that: Control over large systems of machines will be in the hands of a tiny elite—just as it is today, but with two differences. Due to improved techniques the elite will have greater control over the masses; and because human work will no longer be necessary the masses will be superfluous, a useless burden on the system. If the elite is ruthless they may simply decide to exterminate the mass of humanity. If they are humane they may use propaganda or other psychological or biological techniques to reduce the birth rate until the mass of humanity becomes extinct, leaving the world to the elite. Or, if the elite consists of soft-hearted liberals, they may decide to play the role of good shepherds to the rest of the human race. They will see to it that everyone’s physical needs are satisfied, that all children are raised under psychologically hygienic conditions, that everyone has a wholesome hobby to keep him busy. ‘Power Concedes Nothing Without A Demand. It Never Did And It Never Will’ – Frederick Douglass At this point, it is more than ever worth remembering the example of the Industrial Revolution, which began in the 18th Century. As machines and mechanical tools revolutionised factories and how goods were produced, vast increases in productivity were attained, and the GDP of industrialising countries rose sharply. However, at this time working in a factory was no easy task. Workdays could be up to 16 hours long, workweeks usually involved working on 6 days out of the 7, and child labour was common. Over the following decades, as the ordinary workers better understood the enormous added value their endeavours had a part in producing, they began to demand a fairer share of this additional value, so they could work less hours in better conditions and receive higher wages for it. It took time, but their efforts were successful. For example, in the UK a series of ‘Factory Acts’ was passed, which gradually reduced working hours, improved working conditions, and limited the amount of hours children could work. Eventually, across much of the world (though by no means all of it), the 40-hour workweek became the standard schedule, while child labour was greatly reduced or banned outright, and legislation passed to ensure workers had adequate conditions and protections while doing the job. Now, as we approach the age of automation which some have described as being like another Industrial Revolution, it is likely we will again see the same debates regarding working hours, wage levels, and employment terms which dominated the original Industrial Revolution. Accompanying them this time will be discussions around other issues such as UBI, the 4-day workweek, and many more. The outcome of this coming age of automation will be uncertain for some time to come, but it is important to note that whatever your feelings on this issue, or however interested or disinterested you may be in these topics, you will almost certainly be affected by them in the not too distant future. Therefore, it is perhaps best to engage yourself in these matters, before they engage themselves with you."

1,The Secret Alien Agenda and the Stupidity Virus,news-society," With all due allusion to myth, magic and metaphor, and perhaps even an attempt at allegory, the “secret alien agenda” pertains to a cosmic conspiracy. There is no intent to any references, direct or indirect, with regard to illegal human trespassing across sovereign borders of various countries. In addition, the “stupidity virus” suggests the devolving state of human interactivity as concerns the regressive tendencies to avoid evidence driven rational analysis. In post-modern societies, the allegation is that facts, the weight of evidence, and scientific validation, is often dismissed in favor of emotional reactivity in the perpetration of antisocial commentary. For the satiation of amative urges for selfish intentions, by way of dangerous subjective validation, the force of willful animosity contravenes the progress and advancement of the human species. In short, human civilization dooms its own demise. Many complex factors, intentional, purposeful and premeditated, conspire and collude to bring about the sixth great extinction upon the planet. According to one report, appearing in a well-known publication of a nationally recognized geographic institution, that question is posed to the readership. Will the human race survive the next global extinction event? Answer, most likely no, not if stupidity reaches pandemic levels, and idiocy is on the rise. In 3D comic fashion, the characterization of this willful planetary exploitation is exhibited in a fictional storyline. Along with colorful characters, the fictional short story, as well as the digital artistry, portrays the adventures of a valiant government agent. Her mission is to expose the “secret alien agenda” for the spread of the interstellar “stupidity virus”. Naturally, many enemies arise, including mad scientists, corporate elitists, robotic entities, and politicians. Of course, the intriguing aspects of it all is poking fun at inane social commentary. Silly and unintelligent conjecture permeates social media, 24/7 alleged news cycles, talk show “talking heads”, and mirrors the reflection of the narcissus pool of “two dimensional thinking”. This offering of the nebulous descriptor of “2D thinking” stems from a movie script line from a famous “star-fleet” movie. It refers to the darkness of evil in a malevolent character, as well as the inability to think creatively, with logical application of rational analysis. Further to this point, a major think tank, with a long U.S. government research history did a major study on the issue. Accordingly, the aforementioned study asserted what might be termed “truth decay”, as increasingly the erosion of reliance on facts, evidence, critical thinking, and insistence upon well-defended points of view. Instead, fiction over facts pervades the social nexus and mainstream claims of believability. Emotional reactivity in the maladaptive tendencies to safeguard subjective validation with constant appeals to fallacies of inference. This of course lends facetious credence to hasty generalizations bordering on ethnic, racial, sexual and political divisiveness. Hence, the metaphorical assertion of the “secret alien agenda”. It is satirical and meant to poke fun at stupidity, selfishness and condescending self-interests. Not only that, but also the self-centered and egoistic arrogance that strains the boundaries of believability. Nonetheless, specious conjecture and nebulous notions, absent the evidence, are widely accepted. In addition, coupled with an ignorance of historical events, idiocy raises dangerous potentialities. Simplistic trouble freethinking degrades the probability of meaningful discourse. Unfortunately, most people are not history buffs, nor do most learn from significant historical crises. As such, human nature suggests not much changes and people do not change very much over time. As to evil, this is simply the illicit, unlawful and mean-spirited inflictions some people do to other people. Again, the reflection is that of egregious selfishness by way of intentional stupid behavior. Stupid refers also to lazy thinking or a lack of critical thinking from a constructive standpoint and professes empathy for others, and promotion of the greater good. For that vileness, by neither gratitude or reverence, perseverance or progress, great numbers of people claim the entitlement of selfishness. To this, the echo, the reflection of mirrored conception, decries the very essence of self-evolving ascension. Failing to climb to higher levels or loftier peaks of neural instigation, the death of willfulness covers a grave from which the dead rise up stupider than before. Conflict with constant raging storms of ignorance flood the institutions from one ship of commerce to another port of academia. Foolishness undermines reality. Stupidity also represents other descriptors whereby people in general perpetrate the safe, comfortable and detached mediocrity of foolish behaviors. Some might claim there is a social loss of something called common sense, or a lack thereof. Used here, the term is applied to illustrate the poignancy of how such willful behaviors adversely affect social culture. Absurd, inane and foolhardy conjecture, whether by the news media or politicians, hastens human devolution. Aside from the terminology employed to describe the devolving state of the human species, “aliens” are involved to illustrate the ongoing state of irresponsibility. Blaming others, things, entities, gadgets, unknown forces, unscientific “diagnoses”, cell phones, the internet, etc., one can evade accountability. Acting stupid and finding convenient excuses for ignorance, or someone else’s fault, including criminality, avoids the liability of personal responsibility. The factional, sectarian, and “alienation” of the population continues to escalate into a myriad of mucking about with all manner of simplistic conjecture. Of course, to digress, the act of mucking applies in several ways. For example, if a person ever worked at a horse riding stable, or on a farm, the act of mucking concerns the removal of manure or other wastes from an animal’s stall. Such is a specific aspect of removing something dirty or of no use from the surroundings. To stretch the word usage a little further, if social media, political campaigning or news reporting were viewed as “muck”, then perhaps shoveling out the “verbal excrement” would be appropriate. Informal British application refers to something of no value or no use. Regardless, the illustration is toward a burgeoning state of negative and condescending behavior. Much of the interactivity devolves to a conflicting state of affairs. It is one in which nearly every act or verbal exchange is potentially viewed as offensive to someone or some group. To avoid upsetting the childish tendencies, or non-self-evolving emotionalism, pretentious claims of civility likewise encourage a dumbing down of annalistic thinking processes. The perpetration of comfortable ignorance does nothing to advance the human species, yet fosters the safe mediocrity of fiction over fact. Contemporary fallacies of inference, degenerating into hasty generalizations, hastens the decay of rational well-reasoned search for authenticity. Contemporary “fables, fictions, and fairytales” persist in spreading an array of fictional stories projecting individual and group interpersonal inadequacies. In the post-modern era, while some still blame demon possession for the bad things people do, others find a variety of scapegoats such as alien conspiracies. To sanctify and otherwise justify an assortment of mitigations, space aliens become the perpetrators behind the scenes plotting global domination. One online “alternate news” source cites a researcher’s claim that the U.S. government made a special agreement with a certain group of aliens. According to the source in question, that arrangement allowed the aliens to conduct experiments on humans. In reference to that assertion, the metaphorical insinuation resulted in the overall concept of “the secret alien agenda and the stupidity virus”. As to the necessity to rise above the primordial depravity of intellectual devolution, extraordinary efforts of psychophysical energy focus on individual enrichment. Regardless, while a few valiant enthusiasts embrace learning, as well as personal individuation, most are willing to accept a non-invasive comfortable level of status quo mundane mediocrity. In this realm, the many will find easy seduction to the submissiveness of less intelligent prospects. In the social mainstream of techno-folly and thoughtless self-gratification, emotional reactivity foments the terrors of hasty generalizations and divisive rushes to judgmental behaviors. Meanwhile in real science, not the fake kind found in academia like the “social studies” fields, some astrophysicist scoff at the notion aliens visit planet earth.  For a few scientists, humans are, in all likelihood, too stupid for alien interaction. Then again, maybe they want stupid humans for other purposes, as in natural resources, farming, and “herd” production and so on. Warnings emerge, along with an admonition to be careful for what you wish. How humans treat each is significant in some of the assertions regarding alien observations of people. Hence, the concern of some scientists that when humans colonized part of the plant, they exploited the indigenous populations of the area of exploration. Subjugation and enslavement ensued thereafter. Figuratively speaking, to jest and amuse at the egregious fallacies of inference so rife in social media, as well as mainstream alleged news reporting, the alien stupidity virus spreads quickly. Once injected, ingested or otherwise infected by body fluid contact, the idiocy level rises. To the point that serious debate, discussion or analytic discourse becomes increasingly debasing, the deterioration of interpersonal communication devolves tragically. Again, this is only an allusion to the current state of affairs relative to eroding intellectual processes. In an age of techno-innovation, many falter in formulating reasonable and rational foundations for effective psychodynamic inquiry. Critical thinking is more challenging than ever. As to advances in technology, small groups of creative people engineer those clever mechanistic inventions. These are smart people, but then again, they are susceptible to varying degrees of stupidity once they leave their particular domain. By contrast, the vast majority do not invent advances in a range of scientific endeavors. Instead, the masses of the populace are simply consumers. Moreover, consumerism is grossly obsessive and gluttonous. From a perhaps more sinister viewpoint, depending on your conjecture, an observation has repeatedly asserted the collusion between mass media and mass marketing. Sales, advertising, and consumption-oriented promotions are relentless. As alleged news media sources are owned by major corporate entities, so are the companies that sell products. Large multinational businesses, with foreign investment as well, promote and otherwise flood the means of telecommunications with incessant barking to buy, sell, ingest, consume, and “cannibalize” materials goods. While not every business, corporate, or commercial enterprise should be seen as “evil”, with sinister collusion among “galactic alien” forces, a majority may be observed as dangerously self-serving. Some of which, is not for the greater good or of significant utilitarian value. Of the networks of wealthy, elite and politically connected, a small portion of the population hierarchy control the majority of material resources. This also includes the potent influence upon individual and group decision-making. Where people refuse to self-evolve, stupidity becomes easy. Again, “galactic alien” conspiracy is a metaphorical adaption of intentional and voluntary dumbing down of the populace, whereby less honorable people can control them. It’s all illusionary to poke fun at “anti-thinking” infused with emotional reactivity. For the lazy, indecisive and those prone to magical thinking, especially the uncreative and marginal thinkers, the tyranny of power, control and domination is not difficult to achieve. A studied glance at most politicians and a broad based assumption can be made of the widespread societal idiocy. As such, the “alien stupidity” virus increasingly passes from one self-aggrandizing political ideologue to the next. In the age of the selfie, the narcissistic reflection, through the looking glass of conceit, appropriately echoes the foolish arrogance of modern politicians. A number of mythological characters could serve as appropriate archetypes. Furthermore, the not so hidden agenda contained herein is that there are no excuses for stupid, inept, incompetent and otherwise idiot behavior. The actualization of free will does away with defense and mitigations to the contrary. People are purposeful, deceitful, and intentional in their antics. Deterministic illusions, espoused by some schools of thought within the realms of the “social studies”, serve as excusatory alibis for willful mitigations. As such the alien stupidity virus is a good cover story to explain away the illicit and illegal perpetrations of selfish counter-social afflictions. In a culture where any “psycho-diagnosis” will do, anything is justifiable. Simplistic notions projecting specious conjectures easily explains mysterious complexities. In grips of the stupidity virus, after a brief incubation time following the transmittal of the pathogen, emotional reactivity and dismissive condescension replace reason and rationality. Facts are replaced by the overwhelming reliance on feelings instead of hardcore evidentiary substantiation. From a macabre perspective, perhaps cynical consideration, maladaptive thinking at a primeval level is probably good for a rapaciously out of control consumer culture. For the many who are not prone to in-depth critical analysis, prefer simplistic thinking and immediate gratification, limited perspectives are more compatible with complacency. According to some commentary on contemporary social issues, the environment in western societies depicts the illusion that hope springs eternal for utopic ascension. A diverse range of conditions demonstrates to the contrary and suggests a devolution of the human species. Accusations address issues related to the state of education, as well as political processes, in which it appears people are increasingly deficient in areas of critical thinking. Allegedly, a few researchers are inclined to infer that the population in general exhibits a kind of “mindlessness” that makes social problem solving more difficult. The stupidity virus is spreading. With a “zombified” population, socio-political and economic interactivity grows more and more difficult and contentious in terms of advancing the human species. Currently, across the broad spectrum of the mainstream, the stupidity factor reflects tense and temperamental over-reaction to the slightest hint of disagreement. Confrontations culminate in tense close encounters every kind in which violence may erupt to ensure someone’s immediate gratification. Any reference to “close encounters of the third kind”, as historically suggested in science fiction movie genre, is a passing reference to divisive condescension infecting social media. So often, the philosophical battles enter the picture that eventually fatigue good intentions to the contrary. A few get weary in the never-ending process of wondering if there is such a thing as common sense. As such, to exercise a profound sense of selflessness in devotion to mature and enlightened perspective demands the due diligence of hard work. Matureness, growing up, acting like an adult who accepts the accountability of responsibility, invokes a special kind of courage. Unfortunately, quickly gratifying the whims of juvenile narcissism, and insisting upon the superficiality of subjective validation, gets in the way of being an authentic individual. To seize daring opportunities to transform and be a better version than the original imperfection requires exceptional valor, as well as lifelong commitment. By contrast, to presumptions of maturation, in a “crybaby” culture with a “snowflake” society, speculation suggests the stupidity virus undergoes mutations. In a journal article several years ago, a social theorist wrote of the “sore loser” inclination rampant in modern American society. Instead of pulling together as loyal opposition when one side loses an election, the trend is riot and destroy property. Rather than foster cohesiveness for the promotion of the general welfare, ranting, fuming and sowing discord is preferable. In furtherance of the inane nature of the viral infectiousness, from anti-thinking to “racial victimology”, human regression continues. In the process, often is heard some use of a convenient excusatory precursor to illicit behaviors. This includes things like “snapped”, “lost it”, or “triggered”, as well as other simplistic descriptors. Several others used are broken, cracked, shattered, and sparked. While at it, might as well throw in bit, or bitten, like the zombie virus, very similar to the alien viral infection. However, do not stop there. Include demonic possession too. Use every possible inauthentic mitigation, pretense, apology or alibi. Similarly, rationalize intentional aberrations with a mental diagnosis. Forget scientific validity or evidentiary substantiation. Crybaby culture demands apologies. For the secret alien agenda, the spread of the stupidity virus, metaphorically speaking, is a parody for the anti-thinking emotionalism of a collapsing culture. To satiate selfish rationalizations, ignorance is an inner caricature of personal mockery. With all the potential for extraordinary self-actualization, or even higher in enlightened transformation, many squander their creative ascension. Refusing to grow up, to remain the perpetual child, and insist on the echo of reflective imagery of oneself, are central features of a society edging toward collapse. The advancement of the human species requires brilliant innovations in collaborative constructive problem solving. Pro-social enterprises to enhance the commonwealth of everyone, by way of equitable, selfless and mutually beneficial contributions, persevere to avert disastrous consequences. Yet, for humanity, in all probability, time is running out. Gluttonous conspicuous consumption beyond the capacity to repair and replenish succeeded in reaching a point of no return. Meanwhile, stupidity finds refuge in bigotry, inequity of every kind, exploitation of the environment, and the arrogance of ignorance. Condescending babble spews negativism throughout social media and mainstream alleged news outlets. In lieu of driven by facts, fictitious claims masquerade as “proof” in support of specious fallacies of inference. A devolving milieu increasingly shows symptoms of the secret alien agenda and spread of the stupidity virus."
2,What can we learn from the the Jan 6 Capitol Riot?,news-society," As I watched the Trump supporters and rioters wave their flags and break windows and climb the walls of the Capitol building on Jan 6, I wasn’t surprised at all. I have suspected that a certain segment of Trump supporters were fully capable of such behavior for many different reasons. If you study the footage inside the Capitol you will see one person carrying a huge Confederate flag and many others carrying printed signs saying, ”Stop the Steal”. One huge homemade banner says, ”Jesus is my Savior, Trump is my President”. Smaller signs, symbols and pieces of clothing display Qanon, MAGA, and Militia symbols. Many men are in military garb with backpacks and helmets. Many are using their Trump and US flag poles as weapons against the small force of Capitol Police who are NOT in riot gear and have tiny cans of pepper spray or mace. They seem afraid to draw their weapons because they are outnumbered by at least 100 rioters for each policeman. It is clear that a man tattooed and painted from head to toe and wearing a Viking helmet with sharp bull horns and carrying a huge spear, is screaming and chanting. This man has since been arrested so we know that he claims to be a Qanon Shaman who now has a lawyer who claims that his client is mentally ill. The FBI will continue to arrest people who are easily identified by the video footage and cell phone pictures which are numerous and have date, exact time and location printed on them. Rioters tried to beat up journalists and steal cameras but many people, including the rioters, also took pictures. Some people may have looked like thugs but they were proud of what they were doing. They obviously came from many different backgrounds and places.  They were all there because of one man: Donald Trump, who had given the order to get to the Capitol and fight, just before the crowd rushed toward this very building. We may never fully understand what motivated EACH one of these people to come to Washington DC  prepared for a riot or revolution, but it is already clear that many have said that they were,” Taking their country Back” by keeping Donald Trump in power. People said that the election was fraudulent and they believe Trump won, because that was declared by him repeatedly.  Some screamed, “ Kill Mike Pence”, who at that very moment was being rushed to safety by the Secret Service and Capitol Police. Others were looking for Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders who were also evacuated moments before rioters broke into the House and Senate Chambers and several offices of key Democrats to steal things and photograph documents. Since WWII, we have never seen a riot like this on US soil. We have seen individuals (like Timothy McVeigh) bomb or attempt to bomb government buildings. We have seen criminals commit arson and kill policemen. We have seen many mass shootings at schools and public spaces. Each time we have been shocked, but at the same time somewhat relieved to discover that these people appeared to be insane and usually acting alone. KKK violence and more recently the Charlottesville events are revealing that more organized hate groups are forming more frequently.  We have failed to realize that crowds of people could be incited to not only riot, but to attempt to kill elected officials and their security personnel. There have been many more killings of US citizens carried out by white male Americans than by foreign born individuals.  How do we end this increase in domestic terror and its threat to the “unalienable…rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness” for all Americans? We need to arrest these rioters, but are they the only ones that we must hold accountable? If most of them are mentally ill and delusional, we must ask ourselves why and how did they all gather at the Capitol steps on Jan 6 ? Why were police and security officials and journalists threatened and beaten by so MANY different people? What was motivating these people?  As people are arrested and interviewed, we will gather more information and we must analyze it carefully to understand the answers. Would any if this riotous and criminal behavior have happened if Trump himself and other Republican leaders had admitted that Trump lost the Election and Biden had won fairly by over seven million real votes cast by real US citizens? We need all forms of media to report the actual statements of rioters. We need to demand facts about the actions of their leaders. We  need to demand honesty and integrity from all our government officials.  Every citizen must think about how to prevent more violence, so  here are a few suggestions: First - Two recounts done by Republican officials in Georgia showed NO voter fraud and only minor differences of a few hundred votes. Also more than 55 court cases were filed by Trump and his lawyers and these cases found ONLY small numbers of voters who cast ballots fraudulently. There were NO instances of poll workers making errors in counting or reporting or shredding the votes in any states that Biden won.  We need transparency and truth in government AND in any media that is charged with reporting these facts, so we can know the truth and not be confused by misinformation. This is how democratic governments retain their legitimacy. Second -  State republican officials repeatedly refused to change  the vote count in GA after 2 recounts and officially certifying the vote for that state. Weeks later Trump tried to convince these officials in a taped phone call, to “add 11,000 votes” for him and to “change the official vote count”. We need to hold Trump accountable and anyone else who commits any attempt to commit massive election fraud accountable. This is how we establish faith in our voting system and faith in the certification of election results at all levels of government. Otherwise the media and losers who refuse to concede, can confuse the public and take power away from the citizens who vote. Democracy starts to die when this happens. Third -  Trump and Republicans used voter fraud claims in order to raise money for their future campaigns. Campaign finance laws allow Trump (and the Republican Party) to keep much of this money for personal use. We need campaign finance laws that encourage candidates who want to be public servants and discourage candidates who desire wealth, power, and fame and who listen only to their wealthiest donors. Fourth -  Trump and several other Republicans repeatedly asked their supporters to come to the Capitol and “stop the steal”. Anyone who uses their position and power to stop the peaceful transition of power over to a newly elected government official, must be held accountable for this undemocratic act. If this is allowed to happen, the will of the Majority of voters is Thwarted and democracy ends. Fifth -  So far at least one Jan 6 rioter has been arrested and his lawyer has stated that he is mentally ill. What if a large majority of the people arrested and charged with criminal trespass or more violent behaviors on Jan 6, plead not guilty due to mental disabilities? Service men and women who have suffered head trauma and other  injuries during combat must be given more effective healthcare and immediate access to ongoing and effective therapies and supervision if they exhibit violent tendencies. People who apply for security jobs or gun permits must be given thorough background checks before they are hired or trained. (In most states, substitute teachers must get background checks to make sure they are not going to do harm.) These types of security checks ought to be expanded so that jobs that require individuals to have fast and effective reactions in violent or emergency situations, are mentally fit for their jobs and able to be trained to carry out effective non-violent responses. Sixth -  Every year Innocent people are killed by gunfire and are severely injured. Anyone who thinks that carrying a gun is the best way to be safe from harm needs to be frequently reminded that a gun that you own or carry can easily be used to kill you. If we do not sensibly restrict the ownership and purchase of rapid fire weapons, we will continue to have the largest number of gun deaths per capita of any nation in the “civilized” world. We will have more violent crime, not less, because security officers and innocent bystanders will be killed more often. Gun ownership does not promote safety and the freedom to carry guns takes away the ability to have peaceful protests and other public activities. FACT: US states with the most restrictive gun laws have the least shootings. Seventh – Those rioters who go to prison for less than 25 years must receive rehabilitation so that they learn how to be workers and healers, not haters and fighters. Many of them are so confused by falsehoods and trauma that they view Democrats and people of color as enemies and evil.  They need programs that enable them to rebuild their lives.  There are many model prison programs such as the Bard College program run in New York State.  Some programs help prisoners overcome addictions and mental disabilities by meditating, growing and preparing their food and doing community service work.  We must fund these programs, carefully oversee and train prison guards, and measure recidivism and success, so we can tweak or expand programs that heal anger and hate and give purpose to prisoners so that they can return to society successfully. Eighth - The documentary film “Healing From Hate” demonstrates very well the type of help that is needed.  When I viewed this documentary, I realized that it is possible to change the hearts and minds of men and women who have been radicalized by trauma, obuse, anger, hate, and lies. View this film if you know someone who is falling prey to lies told for power and profit and you may discover ways to help that person. It is my hope that we will study and consider some of these solutions over the coming months. Sometimes we trick each other and the media into only fretting and worrying about the future, instead of becoming effective and knowledgeable citizens. Let’s spend less time debating or reading about conspiracy theories.  It is not OK to think people are inherently evil or to assume that nothing can help them change. We all can strengthen democracy, root out corruption, and focus on solving our most serious problems: climate chaos and social and economic injustice, by becoming aware and active citizens."
3,Myopia for Dystopia in the Illusion of Utopia,news-society," Postmodern times offer an array of multifaceted displays for the observation of disingenuous and hypocritical behaviors at varying levels of social interaction. In this presentation, myopia suggests the stupefying yet intentional behaviors characterized by exceptional narrowmindedness. The word used here is not in reference to a physiological problem. Instead, the expression relates to the context of human stupidity. To make an accusation of stupid behaviors globally rampant among the human species, offers a reference to the intentional, purposeful and premeditated acts of irresponsibility. Across society, may escape responsibility in being held accountable. Applying a myopic depiction for the social mainstream asserts the narrow-minded, bigoted and intolerant actions of individual and groups toward others. Underlying that is the contention here that humans are not and have not changed very much over time. Using the term dystopia further assigns an additional descriptor that people will intentionally destroy civilization. Human devolution is a very real prospect at some future point. That is of course unless drastic transformations occur. There does not appear to be the reality at the present juncture of human existence. Some will differ and offer arguments to the contrary as hope springs eternal. To continue, dystopia is characterized by an environment that is hostile, counterproductive, dangerous, scary, and all around frightening. Furthermore, such a setting is that which regressively deteriorating in terms of human devolution. An atmosphere of human misery, squalor, poverty, oppression and intolerable overcrowding add to the debasing environmental conditions. Such a world also exhibits grotesque forms of burgeoning consumption.  In addition, the surrounding resources, both natural and human, become objects of detrimental exploitation. Likewise, human slavery takes on many forms that hide the true nature of oppression. In online blog by an intelligence analyst, the proclamation is made that the warning signs of future collapse are out there. Indicators are all too human in their perpetrations. Maybe partly in reflection about television where government agents chase alien conspiracies, the “truth is out there”. The admonition is that the enemy is within us. From illegal aliens, to sanctuary cities, along with insistence upon “tolerance” for everything, the devolution is upon us. The illusion of utopia represents a child-like reversion to an infancy of simplistic thinking. The disingenuous disguise of political correctness provides a smoke screen for bitter acrimony against those who might offer opposing views. In that, the illusion masquerades as so-called “social warriors” who seek to self-validation of their interests over that of others. Seemingly grown up adults act like children in their narcissistic displays of selfish infantilism as though they possess special insight or secret knowledge. As an excuse to inflict abuse, in one form or another, psychological or physically, some will bring harm to others by arrogant self-righteousness. In the post-modern realm that invites the onset of the dystopic future, the term “post-modern” has taken on a variety of interpretations. While some will argue, discourage or otherwise miss the points of emphasis, or pretend a deeper insight, the emphasis here concerns the more superficial infantile views of how cultural aspects should change. Deference contends the smug piety of shallow magical thinking, from a perspective of historical ignorance, for younger generations to feign special knowledge to change human nature. Bygone becomes reinvention. A viral infection has arisen brought on by an alien secret alien agenda. Of course this is a metaphorical allusion to subsequent generations that act in ways indicative of intellectual regression. To avoid saying many are stupid and socially inept, other means of description might be used. Hence, a sci-fi illustration, the “secret alien agenda” to spread the stupidity virus among the human population. Once infected, like a zombie apocalypse, the virus spreads among the population. As a result, idiotic assertions about anything become mainstream assumptions. In what one writer calls a threat to free speech, “political correctness” for example, encourages a profane style of discourse that foments dissentions that curtails productive discussion. Due to ignorance of global historical relevancies, lacking basic understanding of cause and effect, and failing to self-educate or self-evolve, the “viral” infection becomes ominously mentally and physically debilitating. Of snowflakes, cupcakes and cream puffs, the effects of the covert “alien invasion” results in a shallow “selfie” oriented selfishness. Cerebral alacrity falters in such a way that deep thought, creative imaginings, and exceptional criticality of thought, regress to the two dimensional framework of emotional reactivity. Logic loses in the end. Meanwhile, as history annoyingly repeats poor choices humans make, a few make strides to ascend to more ascended realms of maturity. However, other than a small group of tireless hard working self-evolving individuals, most do not change. A high school mentality permeates the mainstream. Mundane fixation of status quo consensus remains largely persistent in little or no progress to an evolved range of enlightenment. As to the greater numbers, condescension of selfish entitlement and immediate gratification are more urgent than collectively advancing human civilization. Regressive behaviors seem commonplace. An air of child-like selfishness seems to permeate the crowded spaces of the social mainstream. From online alternative magazine, a researcher cites the parallels between society today, and the fictional narrative of the 1984 novel. An Orwellian tragedy, the modern enclaves are constructed around constant gizmo distractions and mass consumption. The personal quest for higher transcendence and enlightenment, that which promotes a more advanced species, is replaced by the comfort of pharmaceutical satiation. As some would ascribe a loss of common sense and emotional reactivity, rather than rigorous insistence upon intellectual vitality, transformative innovation of a personal nature devolves. Although one might be tempted to revisit the allegation of a conspiracy upon the human race, such is fanciful notion fueled by feeble attempts at entertainment. Metaphorical assertions abound from Hollywood to the nation’s capital, along with misguided and often superficial public policy masquerading as a panacea to fix some perceived “crisis”. Yes, fix it with nebulous legislation designed to quell the fears of the public so the “epidemic” never ever happens again. However, whatever the scary notion was as in a so-called “mass shooting”, it will happen again. Typically, the more simplistic the definition a problem is, the more often the issue is not a problem at all. Allusions to the maladaptive notions of a “major problem”, “epidemic”, “out of control”, or “health crisis”, are things more properly placed in proper perspective and proportionality. This would infer common sense application of data driven investigation. However, as to the concept of proportionality with an historical backdrop, an interesting finding might turn up. That is, in all probability, there would be a difference in comparable data between that promoted in social media and alleged news reporting, and that driven by factual authenticity. A sprinkling of anecdotes here and there, subsequently translated into a hastily drawn generalization does not substantiate viable credibility. Fallacies of inference are rampant. For the most part of social engagement, the atmosphere is one of insulated, pampered and defensive against the ravishes of reason and rationality. A few, however, utilize their free will, yes, their essential freedom to resist the impositions of feel good mediocrity. Liberation in individuation struggles against many enemies of personal freedom. Of these, the valiant warriors of self-reliance, a Spartan mindset, battle the ruthless socio-politico-psycho-babble opposition. Freedom fighters persist in the diligence of self-evolution for higher states of differentiation. This comes at a heavy cost, a price of psychic labor coupled with physical energy that only a small number are willing to do. Overcoming the onslaught of divisive myths, misconceptions and myopic preconceptions, modern rebels resist imperial condescension. To turn the tide against the myopia of foolish behaviors, and stifle the descent to dystopic collapse, a few work creatively to bring about a modest degree of change. However, it may be too late and not enough. For all too frequently, the pretentious “social warriors”, and the so-called “anti-fascist” factions, inept, incompetent and ignorant in their efforts, only make things worse. As a tiny nexus of humanity insists upon their right to ascend, the vast majority descend to the primal depths of ancient tribal devolution. Animosity, as well as jealously, in the envy of a twisted hope that does not spring eternal, provokes regression instead of progression. The superficiality of the modern era in the collective collusion of contrived consensus undermines at every opportunity to elevation of intellectual ascendancy. Unfortunately, as one commentator points out in video presentation, the “American Empire” is ending. Many pretend to be knowledgeable so long as such pretense serves to satiate their self-centered gratifications. Conflict within fails or wins. To aspire, but go higher, or wherever a metaphor might suffice, demands the constant vigilance of self-development in non-egoistic persistence. Much interpersonal conflict collides over necessary issues related to willful freedom. The liberation to act as oneself, making the right choices, through logic and reason, requires courage. A struggle to persevere in spite of those who despair and condescend, out of their own weaknesses, and stupidity, is an ongoing rebellion. To become better than the original basic version of oneself, requires strenuous efforts to overcome the forces of conformity. The smugly pious and arrogantly self-serving will always find ways to bully, harass and otherwise stifle the creative genius of self-liberation within the individual. Individuation makes foolish the bullies, and mean spirited haters who would trample upon the tenets of inalienable self-determinations. Thinking differently, being deviant, avoiding stupidity whenever possible, and striving for differentiation requires an intense focus on self-evolution. Transformation of intellectual capacity, fully expanding conscious instigation and insisting upon the individuation of uniqueness, demands time and energy to psychically ascend to different realms of thoughts. While many, especially pundits, politicians and preachers of academia or religiosity pretend exceptionality, most are steeped in the reassurance of superficiality. Fakes, fools and frauds abound. To pull off the mask and reveal oneself is a dangerous act of rebellion. Some do rebel, cross the line of civility and anarchy, and delve in those tings perceived by others as abnormal. Authenticity is seldom applauded or admired. As others feel threatened by blunt raw honesty, brazen truth or straightforward unabashed reality.  What should be and what ought to be dematerialize into the degrading subterfuge of disingenuous interactivity. For the vast majority, simplistic notions serve the interests of benign commonality. The less cumbersome modes of personal existence do not demand a serious sense of creativity. In the post-modern sense of commonality, “social correctness” pretends to be fair, just and equitable, and yet insults human intelligence. Transformation into a well-rounded more perfect version than the original self, labors diligently to shun the recriminations of myopic regressions. Meanwhile, cover-ups of personal masquerades foster one illusion after another. By a primal basis of juvenile immaturity, social engagements devolve to less productive processes. In politics for instance, numerous examples in political campaigns claim the smug piety of prideful arrogance. Hypocrisy is commonplace and corruption ever-present, as party lines banter the usual shallow blather. Season after season, with nothing notable or really new, the “cult-like” parroting of hollow slogans and phony memes degrade any semblance to statesmanship. All of which is symptomatic of what might be called “myopia for dystopia”. Intolerance, narrowmindedness and divisive biases, might serve to underscore myopic uneasiness. As to the dystopic deterioration, the erosion of civility takes place as a gradual process. The illusion of utopia falls within the boundaries of that which pertains to the myth of the American Dream. Materiality over morality, or ethical precepts, with a focus on obsessive and gluttonous gain, additionally underscores the descent into regressive interactions. A burgeoning realm of anti-intellectualism, coupled with emotional reactivity, arrogantly embraces the condescension of facts in favor of fictions. Intentional imposition of status quo constraints condemns and confines public discourse to the narrow spectrum of immaturity. Myopia, or shortsightedness, whatever the descriptors, for dystopia suggests the growing prospects for eventual social collapse. Things taken for granted will no longer exist. The commonplace, the safe place, and the comfortable space will be replaced by the terrors of survival. While the theoretical spheres of the “social studies” arena bashes and banters the utopic scheme of “hope springs eternal”, human motivations devolve to malevolent darkness. For a moment, one might imagine a nightmare, a dream world, where the real and surreal collide. Sucked into a vortex of movie science fiction, the alternate reality is that of a debasing rule by the monsters of the Id. Imagine a large-scale collapse of everything people assume will always be there. No gas, no housing, no government, no resources, no cell phones and so on. Failing to be good students of history, many miss the historic warnings of advanced societies crumpling. For the world of the real scientists, not the pseudoscientists of the social studies realm, a sizeable number remain gloomy about the future of the human species. Some will lament this point in time as a crossroads, a juncture for serious decision making. In spite of the scientific assessment relative to the perpetuation of the human species, or devolution and extinction, most do not listen to the warning signs. From an internet science magazine, researchers recently provoked the idea that social collapse is common throughout human history. Investigators point out that the rise and fall of societies is likely more frequent than the exception. According to the aforementioned inquiry, the government-funded research cites the significant influence of a couple major factors. These, they say, play a key role in the ascent and eventual collapse of social “empires”. One is the exploitation of the natural environment, and the other is the unequal distribution of wealth. All of which might be summoned up by calling it stupid behavior by selfish human beings. Mistreatment and degradation of earth’s resources, not to forget the associated corruption and mismanagement, are not the most intelligent things to do. Aside from the greedy and gluttonous self-interests, the gross consumption, the imbalance of wealth versus impoverishment, further deteriorates the infrastructures of human interactivity. In connection to those regressive factors, assuming technology will miraculously save the day is considered similarly foolhardy. Historical reference points offer a counter view to any notions of techno-invincibility. Large-scale societies have come and gone throughout history. Likewise, superpowers are fragile and potentially teeter on the delicate balance of long-term viability. The arrogance of stupidity changes all that. Perhaps a third element in the equation might be the overwhelming arrogance of anti-thinking. Ongoing studies are pointing out the debasing state of intellectual capacity rapidly developing across the social mainstream. A demeaning trend of stupidity pretending to be cute and clever stifles creativity and innovation. As to the cowardice of post-modern divisiveness, positive, proactive and productive actions warrant the persistence of rigorous efforts for self-evolution. Rising above the commonality of magical thinking, foolish arrogance and regressive “adult adolescence”, demands intellectual courage. Rather than wallow in self-victimization, or pretended juvenile helplessness, the individuality of personal valor requires energetic rigors of creative action. Faltering ideations or the inability to engage in responsible and logical dialogue seems to be waning. In a nationally broadcast interview, a college professor assesses a younger generation as being not very intelligent. Actually, the word used was “dumbest”. Other comments include not bright, the “dumbest generation”, idiots, and so on. This of course can be viewed as another opinionated positon of one generation looking at another. Then again, it could be analyzed from a scary point of view. That is, the younger generation, which lacks significant scope and depth of intellectual analysis, eventually inherits the future. Complaints range from insufficient literary attentiveness, such as book reading, to an inability to understand or comprehend history. The unsettling aspects, as well as future consequences, lend credence to critical thought focus on problem-solving capacity relative to politics, economics and law. Likewise, the critical scientific fields of biology, chemistry, physics and others need real scientists. With diminishing ranks in public service occupations, the police and fire services, the military, medical and cyber fields, wonderment ponders the reality. As such, who will enlist in those career fields? Why is there a shortage in law enforcement, the armed forces, and related public services? To answer that, the reaction can be quite negative. A few commentators have cited the ongoing “pussification” of subsequent generations. Some critics of modern culture go further. They admonish younger generations as wuses, pussies, brats and crybabies. Selfish and self-absorbed people are a threat to democratic processes. Little will be accomplished when a majority shuns science and embraces anti-intellectual attitudes. Given the social preoccupation with minor issues on a simplistic superficial basis, major societal problems receive minimal debate. Myopia for dystopia may be the preemptive stages for the eventual extinction of the human population. Distracted by grotesque levels of consumerism, consumption plagues and exhausts environmental resources. In a culture of crybabies, whiny sniveling malcontents, little will be accomplished to ensure a more advanced and enlightened society for the betterment of humankind."
4,Boko Haram: Nigeria’s biggest security problem,news-society," Time and time again, Nigeria’s security forces have proved that they are incapable of protecting the country’s national security from acts of terror. Over the last 11 years since Boko Haram’s founder Mohammed Yusuf was killed by the Nigerian police, the terrorist organisation has grown stronger in the Northern parts of Nigeria and other neighbouring countries. This blog looks at how Nigeria’s security forces have addressed the Boko Haram problem, if they have at all. In 2009 the Nigerian military apprehended Mohammed Yusuf, the then leader of the terrorist group called Boko Haram, which was founded in 2002. At this point they had the opportunity to collect intel on the organisation which could have led to the end of Boko Haram or at least seriously damaged their hierarchy. The Nigerian military captured Mohammed Yusuf at his parents-in-law's house. He was then transferred to the custody of the Nigerian police force before being taken to the police headquarters in Maiduguri. It was then reported by human rights campaigners that the Nigerian police executed Yusuf in public view. The Police  denied this claim and stated either that Yusuf was shot while trying to escape, or he died of wounds he sustained during a gun battle with the military. Over the last 11 years, Boko Haram have been responsible for the deaths of more than 30,000 people in Nigeria and displaced more than 3 million people. Most of these people have fled to neighbouring countries like Cameroon. They kill, kidnapped and rape women, while the Nigerian government claims to get dismantled them. The Nigerian military know that this terrorist group hides in the Sambisa forest of Borno state, yet they have done nothing. On April 2014 Boko Haram kidnapped 276 school girls from Chibok. These girls were raped and forced into marriage. Some even gave birth to their rapist‘s kids. The Nigerian government was never ever of retrieve these girls although some of the girls returned, other are still missing to date. In 2018 CNN reported that a breakaway faction of Boko Haram known as ISWAP kidnapped more than 100 girls in Dapchi. All but one was released weeks later, after negotiations. UNICEF recently stated that Boko Haram has abducted more than a 1,000 children since 2013, according to UNICEF. Most recently, 337 students are still unaccounted for after gunmen attacked a school in northern Nigeria, a government official told CNN. A man claiming to be the leader of Boko Haram claimed responsibility for the kidnapping, according to a short audio message shared with the Nigerian media and reviewed by CNN. The Nigerian president has refuted claims by Katsina Governor Bello Masari that more than 300 children are still held in captivity by bandits. The presidency said only 10 boys were still missing, according to reports monitored by a local newspaper The Punch. Boko Haram needs to be stopped before they become a problem too big to handle. The economic climate of Nigeria bodes well for them in terms of recruitment. As the saying goes, an idle mind is the devil’s workshop. With a 27% unemployment rate in Nigeria and the fact that majority of the unemployed are youths who are gullible. The Nigerian government has made itself a fertile ground for Boko Haram to recruit young, jobless, bored zealots to their cause, with a promise of monetary benefits. We recommend the Nigerian government tackles the Boko Haram problem as follows: First ensure the safety of civilians - They need to beef up military presence in Boko Haram hot zones and ensure institutions such as schools, Mosques and Churches are protected around the clock. Security forces must be proactive not reactive to the threat posed by Boko Haram. Find Boko Haram’s base of operation and shut it down- Sounds simple so what’s the delay? The Nigerian government  should constantly be searching for Boko Haram‘s locations. Public knowledge is that they hide out mostly in Sambisa forest which is located in Borno State, Nigeria. The Nigerian government should also accept help from western nations and neighbouring countries. Shut out their supply of ammunition-  If the Nigerian government truly have control of all their borders, how have Boko Haram been smuggling in guns? Nigeria is not America where they sell guns like candy. Over the last 11 years these terrorists have used weapons which were smuggled into the country or sold in black markets. The government needs to shut these avenues down. Fight the ideal not just the people- Terrorist organisations are known to thrive because of their ideals and the internet age makes it easier to spread their poison to gullible youths. History has shown that eliminating the head of terrorist organisations doesn’t stop these ideals from spreading. For example, killing Bin Laden didn’t stop Alqaeda from spreading their ideals, in short it made him a martyr that inspired other terrorists. The Nigerian government needs to invest in education campaigns to counter these ideaologies, both online and on ground. Create jobs for the Nigerian youth, especially in Northern Nigeria - Jobless youths will always be easy targets for radicalisation and an ideal mind will always be the devil’s workshop. It is confusing how the country with Africa’s largest economy are unable to create sustainable jobs. There are so much problems in Nigeria to solve and more problems means more jobs. Nigeria’s has problems with intermittent power supply, none existent water supply network, dependency on crude oil, importation of used cars which cause pollution, importation of bad fuel, poor road infrastructure, poor credit system, poor healthcare  infrastructure, hunger, poverty and to sum it up, unemployment. These are problems the government can solve if they invest into the economy, infrastructure and boost their manufacturing capability."
5,The Phenomenal Growth of ESG Investing,news-society," Over a decades ago, the debate about ESG investing had been discussed by many industrial experts and NGO organizations. The criticism and protests have increased everywhere due to environmental pollution, social injustice, and deviant administration. To overcome the bias and unethical conducts, the authorities had imposed several rules and policies to protect the environment, social justice and transparency in governance. ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance. How ESG Investing is Implemented? When conducting business activities, the companies do ESG investing by evaluating and considering all risks and benefits before making any decision. The companies will have no doubt to strictly comply with all rules and policies to minimize the negative impacts on the environment. These include to provide a safety working environment, worker health protection, fair treatment to people, non-profit contribution and other social responsibility. In providing good corporate governance, the companies also will be transparent in all management and financial activities. Year 2020 – The Upward Trends in ESG Investing Most of the companies are being serious in ESG investing after their heavy loss during Covid-19 lockdown. During this period, ESG stocks show its sustainability and outperform all asset prices in the market. This makes companies and external investors realize the importance of ESG factors. It paid off the companies for long-term by strengthening their financial stability and becoming better in quality over its competitors. As for external investors, outstanding ESG present in a company’s portfolio gives better confidence for them to invest in that company. Research has shown that ESG factors are preferred during the investing process by 76 percent of younger generations in the UK. Major Challenges in ESG Investing In ESG investing, environmental factors are qualitative and difficult to be measured by the companies. Besides, in providing good social contribution, human decision and action in the companies naturally involves emotion and tends to bias. Whereas for governance, it is difficult to ensure transparency in management and financial activities all the time. For external investors, analyzing companies’ data and information requires a lot of time and will make them miss golden opportunities to invest at the right time. How AI benefits ESG Investing? Artificial Intelligence (AI) helps companies by collecting, analyzing, processing and filtering essential data from agencies, organization, institution and public reports in determining the level of risks and risks control toward environmental protection. To ensure ESG investing success, AI also helps companies to improve their social judgment and contribution by using quantitative data, reports and results as the metrics to give fair rewards, fair treatment and excellent working safety. AI also improves corporate governance in companies by using software and systems like Trello and cloud based accounting software. It will make upper management easily monitor daily business activities. AI helps external investors to get enough important data and information quickly before making any long-term sustainable investing. To summarize, ESG investing is the highest priority for all companies to ensure a nightmare like Covid-19 will never happen again and Artificial Intelligence (AI) makes it easier."
6,Independence remains an unattainable Lithuanian dream,news-society," Lithuanian political activist Žilvinas Razminas in his article “HOPE - MOTHER OF POLITICAL FOOLS …” admits that Lithuania steps on a rake again. He and his supporters called to boycott the elections and predicted the results of this electoral farce. “Our so-called “anti-system” parties have been stepping the same rake for 30 years and will do the same in the future instead of stopping and thinking calmly about the causes of electoral failure,” he writes about the current Lithuanian opposition. He thinks that “there is no “real ""anti-systemic"" opposition in Lithuania. There are only dilapidated, divided and system-influenced party groups whose leaders, as a rule, are selfish political impotents. They are dissatisfied with immigrants and, on parades of perverts, they do not like the arbitrariness of officials and the rages of judges and prosecutors, as well as they are against deforestation, vaccinations, chips and so on. But all this is only a consequence, and they do not even dare to mention the CAUSE of all these evils - the US - NATO - EU occupation and the LIBERAL CAPITALISTIC system imposed on us by them at their rallies or in election programs. Moreover, they sacredly believe in the liberal-capitalist guarantor of tomorrow's and NATO as Lithuania's security guarantee…” He does not believe that all “the pseudo-oppositionists” who take care of the well-being of the Lithuanian nation and citizens, really worth” while “we live in an EU concentration camp, which is hosted by the USA, and the NATO overseers, where, without the permission of the hosts,” almost everything is forbidden. He is absolutely sure that only “free and independent nations can afford to plan and implement their plans and build their future. These pseudo-oppositionists are afraid to dream about the freedom of the Lithuanian nation Their biggest goal is to get a permit to repair the barracks of the EU concentration camp and secure a permanent place at the table of US - NATO - EU occupiers.” He insists that even if these parties entered the Seimas and formed a majority, the lives of Lithuanian citizens would not change in practice. It would only extend the yoke, exploitation and genocide and slow down the development of the nation’s liberation struggle. He makes a conclusion that under the conditions of occupation, participation in elections and voting for ""anti-systemists"" is not only political idiocy, but also a crime. Therefore, an election boycott under the conditions of occupation is the best means of protest until a serious and powerful organization is formed that can actually join the fight against the US - NATO - EU collaborators who have taken over Lithuania. He underlines: “As I have said many times, it is possible to participate in this election, realizing that you will not be elected, only if you use the election campaign as a platform for publicizing and Lithuania's liberation from US - NATO - EU COLONIALISM. It is a pity, but there was no party in the election that would have done so…” In Lithuania, the electoral farce has always been so cheap and so predictable that you had no longer to be a prophet to easily guess the election results in 2014, 2016 and in 2020. I said that the “anti-systemic” party had already lost the election, that there was no chance for any opposition party to enter the Seimas unless there would be: ONE CLEAR IDEA uniting the nation and all anti-systemic parties; ASSOCIATING ORGANIZATIONS; FINANCING. An adaptive, opportunistic path was chosen instead of my proposed liberation of Lithuania from the US - NATO - EU occupation and the creation of a new independent, neutral, national, socialist Lithuania and the reformist path of easing the slavery of the NATO - EU occupation regime, the “anti-systemic” parties failed to generate strategic, unifying ideas for one goal. As a result, the electoral programs of all parties (both systemic and ""anti-systemic"") have become essentially equally dim and unattractive to the average voter, and some have even been completely inadequate. The electoral programs of all parties are almost the same, and no one knows the names of the newly elected ""anti-systemic"" parties, they have no funding, no attractive and well-known leaders and no obvious political work, while the big systemic parties are bathing in money, their leaders are seen every day. The TV screens, the media are in their hands, the electoral falsification mechanism is in their favor, and the repressive apparatus cover them… Who wins the elections, I think, it was clear to the fool, but only not to our ""non-systematic"" parties. He also mentions that people who had something to say were not even admitted to the election. Those admitted were practically empty as drums or spoke only about things, which were dear to the ears of the electorate and aroused unreasonable hopes. Broken hopes are even worse than the rubber bullets of 2009 … It could be clearly seen that party leaders had taken appropriate sums from candidates during election campaigns for a place on a party's electoral list. The author of the article heard that prices have even been set (perhaps still) for the seat of a Member of the Seimas or a Minister… He writes: “The election game is over! The Lithuanian people once again saw the obvious gross violations of the system and cases of falsification of results They will continue, like nowhere else, to work as POLITICAL TRAPPERS or useful idiots playing their roles.” Žilvinas Razminas calls to create an independent, neutral, national-social (humanistic) Lithuanian state. He also underlines that Lithuania should withdraw the US - NATO colonial army from Lithuania; eliminate all foreign and criminal organizations financed by them and harmful to the Lithuanian nation and state; restore friendly diplomatic, trade and cultural relations with all neighboring countries; restore the supremacy of the Constitution and laws of the Republic of Lithuania in relation to foreign states; invalidate EU membership; achieve national, religious reconciliation and the elimination of all forms of human exploitation; restore traditional family values and the right and duty of citizens to defend their country's sovereignty; return Lithuanian natural resources to the state. This article is not only a text or somebody’s point of view. It is a cry of a citizen who is not indifferent to his country and his nation. Though Žilvinas Razminas was very emotional describing the situation in Lithuania, his political predictions were right. The political situation and the state’s future is still indefinite while dependence on such organization as NATO, EU will remain strong. Independence is still an unattainable Lithuanian dream."
7,Dr. Richard Konteh: A Courageous Transformational Leader Amid The Unknown,news-society," It is asserted that leaders are made, not born. Additionally, the makings of a transformational leader are defined, in part, by the leader’s willingness to venture into the unknown. This, of course, takes great courage — lots of gut. Courage is not the absence of fear. Courage is acting consistent with your stand in the face of fear — fear of failure, fear of looking bad, fear of being ostracized, mistreated, falsely accused and hated. In his leadership journey, Dr. Richard Konteh has encountered insurmountable obstacles, trials and difficulties that will break any faint-hearted person. His vision and focus for transforming his native country Sierra Leone impressed former President Ernest Bai Koroma to appoint him as Chief of Staff in 2013. As the Chief Minister, Dr. Richard Konteh coordinated the successful implementation of the President’s Agenda for Change and the Agenda for Prosperity. A top enviable position and a row of previous successes in public service attracted the envy of some of his peers, who tried to destroy him by falsely accusing him of corruption (the allegations were later thrown out of court for lack of evidence). He was ostracized and abandoned by the APC Party. It was a moment when everyone thought he would give up, retreat and accept defeat. But for Dr. Richard Konteh, courage means moving forward in the face of such adversity and uncertainty, sticking with his faith and commitment in that moment of truth. He knows as a transformational leader that he will not have all of the answers to why people will envy and mistreat him for being a courageous visionary leader. He decided to put faith forward, never to allow these phony incidents to distract his belief and trust in people. He never abandoned his APC Party. He never abandoned the agenda for change and prosperity in Sierra Leone — a vision he personally championed. Dr. Richard Konteh is running for the APC Party’s Presidential Candidate (Flag Bearer) in 2023. Much of what motivates and compels his actions comes down to his vision for a united and prosperous nation of Sierra Leone, his love for people, and gut, — which means he bet on possibilities, not on the proof of past incidents or results. The distinguishing trait that transformational leaders exhibit is the ability to talk about that which does not yet exist and make it real through conversations. The concept or idea that compels him — this transformation that he seeks to bring about — is not an extension of the past filtered through the present in order to arrive at the future. That’s predictable, and the transformational leader in Dr. Richard Konteh is not motivated by the predictable. Dr. Richard Konteh is creating and designing a future for Sierra Leone that is often thought to be a pipedream by skeptics. But Sierra Leoneans are seeing two aspects of Dr. Richard Konteh’s transformational leadership that separates him from others. First, Dr. Richard Konteh sees a pathway to the future of a united and prosperous country (perhaps a little blurry and obscured right now), and he is willing to stand for that future. Second, knowing that others will have to be inspired to extraordinary action, Dr. Richard Konteh is able to paint the picture of that future in a way that gets others to take on this vision as their own, and this is why he is dubbed “D-UNIFIER”. Dr. Richard Konteh’s vision of a united and prosperous Sierra Leone, and the way it is communicated, is compelling — something that others want to be a part of, participate in, and contribute to building. Instead of something that he can show you, Dr. Richard Konteh is intent on taking people, results, organizations, The APC Party and Sierra Leone to a place no one can see, touch, smell, or taste. This ability marks Dr. Richard Konteh as extraordinary in a field of other leaders. A future that is seemingly out of reach for both the APC Party and Sierra Leone requires that others enroll in the vision championed by this transformational leader, Dr. Richard Konteh."
8,Political News Accountable For Country Image,news-society," America is a nation with a huge population so there are always things happening around the nations in which one becomes to know about with help of news. USA governmental issues, sports, natural disasters, entertainment, and many different events are the main focus of news in the USA. Numerous magazines give away information about the entity of the system of Politics which creates curiosity among people. Many newspapers have their front page bearing the latest political news. Worldwide and national news always have some element of political news in it. Be that as it may, every country has a different political background and history. Thus, the political issue shows variations depending on the different pieces of land. Political news in America is just a medium for delivering the political views of different people in the country. The news gives away information about the society, state, country, sports, and even entertainment. The news about financial matters like budget, policy, and bills, and so forth are also delivered by the USA news. When the budget is announced the news channels make an effort to spread the message about the government's actions towards society and make society well aware of it. The political news also makes people aware of the economic growth of various other nations and also their position in the market. The latest news in America sometimes is of very interest and so makeup to the headlines of the world news. Whenever a foreign delegate comes to the USA in order to improve their relations with the country the news is covered by the agencies and it is passed on to the general public. Individuals consistently feel the need to be updated with the daily happenings around them. The latest news around the world encourages them to think about political activities going around the world. The political activities that go around in our country always make it to the world news. Numerous people prefer to know about the world's political news instead of just being aware of the political happenings in the country. This political news in the USA creates a picture of the country in the minds of others. It could be positive it negatives depending on the political news that is telecasted. Building up a positive picture is very important as that chooses the reputation of the country."
9,Criminology and Plausible Conjecture,news-society," In a typical academic text for an introduction to criminology class, a particular case study introduces each chapter. In doing so, the author appears to demonstrate a probable correlation between the relevance of criminology and the criminal behavior demonstrated by the case at hand. Yet the incident portrayed is of a high social profile nature. That is, in terms of occurrence, the criminality has drawn national attention do to media fascination. Of which the reader should probe further in more detail to address all possible evidentiary aspects. A further point from the academic reference is the notion of defining in a general sense what criminology represents. In brief, the field in the broadest scope possible allegedly, according to many in academia, is the so-called “scientific study” of the causes, environment, magnitude and control of criminal behavior. This is where the controversy becomes controversial. Encampments line up on both sides of the great divide in relation to causality. Before any speculations, about criminology or criminality come in to focus, discussion should consider what a science is. What does scientific study actually mean? Is that simplistic conjecture supposedly inferring that somehow an area of “social studies” is exactly similar to physics or biology? What about astronomy, quantum physics, chemistry, etc. are they the same as criminology? This is absolutely a serious notion to consider, otherwise serious investigative effort at any level of analysis become highly tainted by egregious fallacies of inference. Unsubstantiated facetious claims regarding the cause and effect of illicit anti-social behaviors devolve to a realm of ignorance. As such, a science is often defined as that which proceeds from a naturalistic basis, the structure of nature, to pursue the investigation of real matter, or tangible materiality. This is likewise combined with objectively measurable and provable evidence driven data. From a logical process of deduction, the scientific method follows rational inquiry. In other words, can you put it, whatever it is, under a microscope and be relatively certain it’s provable. You might ask, what is the “blood test”, or x-ray for that? Can you do a DNA analysis and show where that particular things exists? Is there scientific validation to substantiate the investigative process? The life and death seriousness of every day criminality requires real scientific authenticity. Substantial reliability in the consistent affirmation of evidentiary substantiation remains vital to the multifaceted criminal justice systems. From the classical school perspective, or the rational choice viewpoint, such notions translate into the essential viability of real-world experience. This infers the necessity of the knowledge and experience the practitioner achieves dealing with the reality of human nature. It evolves from the intuitive attribution learned from a diversity of human interactivity, whereby some of that exposure is dangerous and life threatening. Insight is critical in the real world of crime fighting. That part of criminology applies to the practitioner’s worldliness of actual exposure to “dark side” of human behavior. In addition, scientific methodology becomes a more poignant reality. It is one thing to study criminals from a safe distance, as in the classroom, and theorize about motivational factors. Yet, it is quite another thing to be involved up close and personal in actual confrontation with the perpetrator. Working an actual crime scene in the aftermath of a horrendous criminal incident is especially distinctive. Such interactivity is more divergent than reading about the case from a textbook. Real-world investigative processes hunt for the hardcore seriousness of scientific validation. By application of from the realm of the “forensic sciences”, that would include not only such areas as physics, chemistry, biology, but also botany, entomology, physiology and pathology. In these “ologies”, one finds the necessity for exceptional confirmation of the truth. In this sphere, intentions are directed toward foolproof provability. By contrast, in the non-practitioner spectrum of the theoretician, the safety of the classroom insulates from the harness of realty. From afar, aloof, philosophically sufficient, politically sanitized, peer review insulated, and subjectively self-validated, one can easily speculate an array of nebulous notions. Perpetrating a so-called scholarly discipline as criminology as a “real science”, may invite some critical investigators to prefer using the term pseudoscience. Likewise, the same should apply to other philosophies that clamor to be a “science with scientists”. This pertains to but is not limited to the associated fields of psychology and sociology. For the sake of an adult grown up conversation, to call the schools of thought a pseudoscience ought not to be taken as condescending or dismissive. On the contrary, one ought to be predisposed to giving and receiving alternative perspectives in the diverse realm of “social studies”. In terms of criminology, the diversity of thought is rampant, especially in mainstream society, where personal views tend to be more emotional than factional. Within the supposed hallowed halls of academia, where theoreticians are more prevalent than practitioners, it appears everyone has some sort of opinion. From student to faculty, many ideas verbalize and theorize a broad spectrum of personal viewpoint. Meanwhile, in the typical criminal justice department, or criminology program, theories of one sort or another claim an assortment of causal factors. Another standard criminal justice text attempts to contrast the two main antagonists, the classical school versus the positivistic school. Where classicists hold the criminal responsible for his or her exhibition and execution of individual free will, positivists tend to look at external causality. This might include demonic possession, in which case, a priest might be the primary investigator. The textbook in question here offers a summary of about one page on the classical view, and three pages on the positivistic perspective. A critical slant. A review of several texts offering consideration of criminological studies presents the same kind of inclination. Not presented in the same manner as competing theoretical constructs, classical criminology is mentioned quickly in favor of assertions that are more contemporary. Choice in criminal decision making by way of free will is countered by a variety of other philosophical views. The latter often bias their claims in the direction of mitigations such as biology, traits, social ecology, environmental conditions, the prevalence of instruments of death, and so on. Arising out of 18th century philosophy, the classical school of criminal behavior might be considered an older assessment of criminal behavior during the age of enlightenment. It at least predates the advent of so-called positivism, which gave way to other fields of study. Today, “ration choice theory” is offered as the modern version of classical theory. Again, it is all about theory and which one an investigator wishes to follow. In this writing, the advocacy for this particular framework of pseudoscience is in favor of the rational choice perspective. Accordingly, the classical view or rational choice assessment pertains to decision-making on the part of the individual. Premeditating, willfully contriving, and planning from malice aforethought, the criminal undertakes his or her criminality from the standpoint of gain versus risk. One chooses his or her criminal perpetration with regard to a “cost-benefit” analysis. From the classics, as well as the transformation into rational choice constructs, to the trait theory speculations, the quest for definitive answers transcends generations. In 100 years or so of debate, the not much has changed concerning explanations about human behavior. For those delving into the physiological recesses of the human body, in particular the brain, “trait” specialization claims criminality is a function of bio-chemical or mental processes inside the individual. Abnormalities in the physical or the alleged psychological sphere are precursors to maladaptive behaviors. Individualities of this nature, usually allude to criminal tendencies that are inherited or others the culmination of “natural selection”. From there, some would argue that biological factors emanate from a set of “genetic conditions”. Seemingly, when “social studies” researchers incline toward the “DNA” factor, they assert that behavior is the result of genetic transmission. In a real world frightening sense, such might suggest the scary prospects of the 19th theories regarding the “natural born criminal”. While these speculations were discredited, they are still around. The so-called “crime gene”, as mentioned in contemporary discussions, has never gone away. Some claimants refer to the “sleeper cell” some mythic hidden darkness inside the human anatomy waiting to wreak havoc in illicit activities. Likewise, as people believe what they want to believe, even absent scientific validation, the genetic specificity is elusive. Whether assertions of “brain damage”, chromosomal deformity, or “psychic syndrome”, scientific evidence for any of these possibilities remains inconclusive. You, hope springs eternal in subject validation. Quite a few members of the criminology community, as well as other branches of the diverse family tree in “social studies’, continue to promote a simplistic and unsubstantiated conclusions. Unfortunately, an unsettled or otherwise unproved theory reaches into the public area and influences public policy. It might be legislation, which becomes a law, or the speculative concept could enter the courtroom as a defense argument. As such, correlation is not causation, an opinion is not evidence in most instances, and convenient anecdotes are not necessarily proof. With all theories regarding human nature and human behaviors, caution is warranted as to any alleged explanation that seeks physiological or psychological singular finality. For the good intentions of non-scientist researchers, the flaw in philosophical concepts revolves around the inability to substantially prove a direct link between a tumor or glandular abnormality and subsequent criminal behavior. Behavior is extremely complicated. In the pseudosciences, or the various areas of “social studies” like criminology, a wide assortment of philosophical inquires attempt to understand why people do bad things. Often, in efforts to debunk or otherwise malign the “old school”, as in classical criminology, some will claim allegiance to something called “trait theory”. For example, in another sampling from a standard “introduction to criminal justice” text, the authors try to counter rational choice perspectives by using the trait approach. While the rational choice adherent considers all behavior, including criminal behaviors, as choices, the “traitists” poses the question, what if it is irrational. For such a simplistic attribution, the explanation is that rational is rational no matter what someone else thinks. Regardless of ideology, background, history, etc., willful decision-making is exactly that. Even if another investigator suggests being irrational offers opportunities for excuses, denials of responsibility, and so on, the rational theorist stands by rationality. Trait theories claim that certain, albeit mysterious, biological and psychological traits predispose them to mischief. With those alleged tendencies, researchers contend internal factors incline an individual in the direction of maladaptive behaviors. While specificity remains elusive, even though a few investigators are intrigued by “brain science”, the ability to look inside the “criminal mind” is largely open to fascinating speculation. Imagine for instance the mechanistic ability to read another person’s thoughts and know precisely what they are thinking. Mind reading sometimes referred to as mind-to-mind, is frequently treated cast into the sphere of pseudoscience. This is fascinating from the standpoint of ongoing research. In the “social studies” arena, those trying the hardest to be “scientists”, claiming philosophies as “science”, strive ruthlessly to debunk other investigative endeavors who likewise apply “scientific methodology”. One might conclude such behaviors on the part of the “social studies” establishment as that which constitutes hypocrisy. Ideological differences abound in the realm of behavioral conjecture. Regardless, in a recent documentary concerning a 2011-shooting incident in Norway, several criminologists offered insight. Naturally, given the nature of the case study, the attempt was to reach inside the “criminal mind” once again. Trying to get into something that does not exist in the first place, the “mind”, is always challenging. Obviously, the symbolic application applies with regard to the mysterious nature of human thinking. In this instance, criminal thinking after the fact in case specific circumstances is a speculative exercise that addresses a wide range of criminological factors. Overall, there is no single theory that explains everything. Regardless, in an effect to substantiate a correlation between a suspect’s personal history and subsequent criminal deviations, theory-laden conjecture abounds. Speculation conjures a number of possibilities with associated elemental factors that might explain almost anything. Unfortunately, as to the thinking processes involved in an investigative inquiry, bias influences conclusions. Additionally, the observer or inquisitor brings to bear on the situation at hand his her observations inclinations. Preconceived notions taint the rush to hasty generalization. Fallacies of inference, lacking the sufficiency of evidence, reinforce “magical thinking”. Therefore, bias influences the conclusion, the observer influences the observation, the design of the inquiry influences the outcome, and anecdote does not necessarily substantiate evidentiary authenticity. Likewise, opinions and rumors are not evidence other than opinion and rumor. Broad encompassing assertions offering extraordinary claims, where evidence is scarce in terms of scientific validation, do not ensure the efficacy the contentions. Masquerading a personal belief system, a school of thought, or philosophical perspective, in the cloak of “scientific language” does not ensure scientific validity. Misuse of terminology is rampant in “social studies”. In the aforementioned documentary, inquiries make an effort to explain what many want to believe is unbelievable. A killer on a killing spree sets off a bomb and then proceeds to shoot a number of people. Explaining the rational, premeditated and methodical basis by which perpetrators carry out their criminality is complex. Yet, seemingly, many people prefer simplistic one-size fits all conclusions. As theorists make claims of “getting inside the killer’s mind”, whatever that is, tentative conjecture about the mass shooting takes on a familiar narrative. As to the 2011 Norway shooting documentary, the academic assessment begins with the typical phraseology. That is, the killer was narcissistic, paranoid, desperately seeking attention, and seriously wanting notoriety. In the wake of the victimization, asserting such descriptors does little to ensure a clearer understanding of the totality of the events. Nor, does such conjecture aid future investigative processes. Further, it is questionable as to whether or not such verbiage are applicable from a scientific perspective. Regardless, the opinions are made in such a manner as to suggest the certainty of the speculation. Nevertheless, how does one know beyond any reasonable doubt that such inclinations are true? Is there a blood test for that? What is the “crime lab”, microscopic, forensic analysis that proves such proclamations? There are no definitive tests. An inquiry is left with guesswork whereby generic templates are offered to support various claims. Post tragic event, the guessing game swings into high gear. The simplicity of easy conjecture flows from the anecdotal speculation of the usual social studies doctrines. Out of the theory worn halls of academia, the non-practitioner “experts” eagerly scamper to the 24/7 “news” networks. Allegedly, they scramble to conjure opinions about the why the crime happened. Through around words like “forensic analysis”, “criminal profiling”, or “psychological profile”, and before you known, like magic, the whole incident is reduced to a few key phrases. One reaction might be, well there you go, it all comes down to a handful of insidious precursors. Seemingly, this post-event “diagnosis” is too convenient and misses extraordinary aspects of self-willed inflictions. After the fact attempts at explaining the motivational factors appears all too simple. Yet, the complexity of human behavior and the associated thinking processes defies such easy reductionist templates. Why did the perpetrator commit the crime? At higher levels of speculation, who knows? The killer will take the real intentional proclivities beyond the grave. Meanwhile, the practitioners in the field, the first responders, carry on the practical side of criminology. Survivors remain haunted by the traumatic impressions of the horrific nature of the criminality. As hope springs eternal in the never-ending hunt for quick answers, the reality is increasingly darker. From a rationalized approach of practicality, a plausible speculation arises from the classical school of thought. However, in the post-modern framework of social mainstream, as well as social media, the pathway to excusatory deterministic mitigations rushes to the usual scapegoating. Rather than focus on the criminal culpability of the perpetrator, ensuring a higher perspective of blameworthiness, the typical externalities are generally assumed. These typically include but not limited to bad parenting, poverty, poor neighborhoods, the fault of others, a pretentiously crafted “psychic” diagnosis, and so on. Such oversimplifications miss the more dangerous issues. Preconceived notions as to causality become deviously exploited by the incessant regurgitation anecdotally opinion laden generalizations. Speculations as to cause and effect overlook the complexity of human thinking that is a multidimensional intricacy. Definitive and reliable constructs as to criminal perpetration are elusive. Nonetheless, diverse schools of thought in the “social studies” arena, particularly those in the “mental illness” sphere, often project “explanations” as though such are without question. Such claims are removed from the reality of criminal behavior. There are no simple determinants, single theory, or “magic bullet”, which sufficiently explains the criminological nature of cause and effect."
10,Travelling Through the Timeline,news-society," Blast from the Past: 1970s Article The 1970s has been marked in history for being one of the grooviest time periods known to man. Best known for Bell bottoms and the rise of disco, but during this time there was also a rise of cultural change, different social norms, economic and political struggles, and the innovation of new technology. The 70s decade was very much a continuation of the late 1960s. The crusade for social justice prevailed. Activist were fighting to gain equality for African Americans, women, the LGBT community, and other marginalized groups. Many of the protest during this time were peaceful, it was only after Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968 people began to riot. Many people would best describe the 70s as  A time to be alive . These were simpler times when kids played in the streets all day, the neighborhood were like a big family, and people interacted and spent time face to face. Without the advanced technology we have today, people had no choice, but to talk and spend time together. During this time, Baby Boomers unquestionably tested the waters not only with fighting for equality and social justice but normalized latest trends such as men wearing platform shoes, tight shirts, and short shorts without it being thought of as unmasculine. Women were able to wear what they pleased without being sexualized. The 70s also marked the start of this first economic crisis since the Great Depression.

Unemployment also began to rise, and the people went into a period of stagflation. President Nixon tried to resolve this issue by decreasing the value of a US dollar, and declared wage and price freezes. When President Nixon came into office in 1968, he immediately dismantling the welfare of the states. He opposed mandatory desegregation of schools, and diminished many parts of former president, Lyndon Johnson s, war on poverty. Although, Nixon did have some positive reforms such as government assistance for families, it was overlooked. He undermined the faith Americans had in a good honest government."
11,The 20 Season Legend (Biography of Kobe Bryant),news-society," Kobe Bryant was a basketball legend. Playing for the Los Angeles Lakers he inspired tons of young kids to chase their dreams no matter the obstacle. Bryant dominated the court. He used the Mamba Mentality to keep his game on point. He made over twenty-six thousand shots in his career. With over one thousand three-pointers and over ten thousand free throws. Kobe managed to win five championships. Bryant's average was 25.5 points per game. Kobe was the youngest of three boys. He started playing basketball at age three. His father and uncle were both professional basketball players. When he was six his father quit the NBA and moved his family to Italy, where Kobe learned to speak fluent Italian. At thirteen years old his family moved back to the United States. Kobe went to Lower Merion High School, where he became the first freshman in decades to play the varsity team. In his junior year of high school, he averaged 31.1 points, 10.4 rebounds, and 5.2 assists. He was also named Pennsylvania Player of the Year. In June 1996 Kobe was selected thirteenth overall in the NBA draft.  Kobe was the youngest NBA player starting at just eighteen. Bryant won the slam dunk competition at the NBA All-Star Weekend in 1997. In sixteen seasons Kobe pulled down 5 NBA titles. With a four-line jumper against the Sacramento Kings, Kobe passed Chamberlain for fourth on the NBA all-time scoring list. In Kobe's seventeenth year he scored more points than any other player. In July 2003 Kobe Bryant was arrested in Eagle, Colorado, as part of a sexual assault investigation filed by a nineteen-year-old hotel employee. The charges were dropped fourteen months later. On January 22, 2006, he scored eighty-one points. Which was the second-most points scored in NBA history. In November 1999 Kobe met Vanessa at a shoot for Tha Eastsidaz music video “G’d up”. At the time Bryant was twenty years old and Vanessa was seventeen. They started dating and when Vanessa turned eighteen Kobe proposed. They later got married on April 18, 2001. A few years later on January 19, 2003, they had their first daughter Natalia Diamante Bryant. She is now seventeen years old and a volleyball player. On May 1, 2006, they had their second daughter Gianna Bryant. She was thirteen and a basketball player. Then some ten years later on December 5, 2016, they had their third daughter Bianka Bella Bryant. She is now three years old. A little less than a year before Kobe passed, his fourth daughter Capri Kobe Bryant was born June 21, 2019. She is now one year old. April 13, 2016, in his final game Kobe scored sixty points against the Jazz in a 101-96 the lakers won. Bryant finished his career with 33,643 points. Which was third until LeBron James beat his record on January 25, 2020. That was one day before Kobe's accident. During his career, Kobe had a huge list of injuries. With several sprained ankles and surgeries. Bryant played most of his games with an injured index finger. It was the middle knuckle on Bryant's shooting hand that was so debilitated with arthritis over many seasons of misuse and overuse. Kobe's parents actually named him after the famous beef of Kobe, Japan, which they saw on a restaurant menu. Bryant's full name was Kobe Bean Bryant. Kobe got his nickname from the code name for a deadly assassin in Quentin Tarantino's movie ""Kill Bill,"" Bryant used the name “Black Mamba” to separate his life on and off the court. The Mamba Mentality is a mindset for constant self-improvement in pursuit of your highest potential in life. January 26, 2020, Kobe and eight others including his daughter Gianna died in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California. The cause of the crash is still unknown but there are theories of how it could have occurred. Investigators have one theory about the weather conditions affecting the pilot's ability to see. When they left Orange County, California it was all blue skies but the weather changed to thick fog in a matter of minutes. One eye-witness said they were on a bike trail when they heard the chopper and at first it sounded normal. Then they said it started to get louder when it came out of the thick clouds. According to the witness, the helicopter was moving very quickly in a downward direction. The helicopter began to tilt left until it finally hit the terrain of a hill. Vanessa Bryant filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the Island Express Helicopters in February a month after Kobe and Gianna passed. At the memorial for Kobe and Gianna Bryant Vanessa gave a tearful speech about her husband and daughter. She talked about how Gianna was “an amazingly sweet and gentle soul.” She went on to talk about Kobe and how “He was my sweet husband and the beautiful father of my children. He was mine. He was my everything.” A couple of weeks before they passed, Kobe sent Vanessa a text saying he wanted to spend time with her, just her, without the kids. Because she was his best friend. Vanessa's speech was twenty-one minutes and thirty-five seconds. Kobe and Gianna's funeral lasted two weeks. Kobe, Gianna, and the other six passengers on that helicopter will be missed. Kobe was a legend in the game. He had taught Gianna the same mentality he had. She would have been a great player. He was a loving father to his children and a caring husband to his wife. His and Giannas lives were cut too short. Gianna will never get a chance to go to high school or play professionally. Kobe will never get to see his kids graduate or get married. Kobe’s life was tragically lost. Yet, his legacy will live on forever."
12,European defence still matters but not for Lithuania,news-society," European countries have different points of view on the issue of the EU collective defence and security. These views divide the European Union and continue to weaken the organization. Some of the EU member states realize the need to turn the EU into a real global military power. European experts believe, that in order for European countries to be able to defend themselves and choose their own course independently, a consolidation of national defence industries is urgently needed. For this, the EU needs to create a real European Defence Technological and Industrial Base, which can only take shape through the incentives and projects conducted within the European Union. The EU nations must have defence industries that are capable to allow EU to reduce its dependence on American or Chinese technologies. Researchers found out that by doing so, member states would avoid losing between €25 billion and €100 billion every year due to their lack of cooperation, and could save 30% of their annual defence expenditure by pooling procurement. Defence budgets had already been severely impacted by the 2008 crisis, as well as COVID-19, making EU countries more dependent on NATO to ensure their security. As a consequence, safeguarding the investments made in the EU defence and industry sector appears to be a matter of real urgency and a vital issue in terms of the sovereignty of European nations. Other European countries such as Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia which are not ready to make their own sufficient investment in the European defence, prefer to completely rely on NATO and the U.S. The Baltic states cannot imagine their security without the United States’ involvement, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda says. “All Baltic states are very clear that the United States’ involvement in our collective defense system is a critical factor and we can hardly imagine our 100 percent security without the United States’ involvement,” the president told journalists in Rukla. In his words, Lithuania does not see the aspiration for Europe’s strategic autonomy as “some sort of competition with the US’s involvement in NATO activity”. “Lithuania sees it as NATO capability’s complementary factor, and in no way there can be any opposition or competition between these two things as, otherwise, NATO’s ability to properly do its mission would be affected,” he said. The Lithuanian leader also said he told that to French President Emmanuel Macron visiting Lithuania. Taking part in a discussion with students of Vilnius University earlier, in his turn, Macron said Europe should be more sovereign and invest more into technology, defense to reduce its dependence on the United States and China. “European defense is a phrase one could not utter five or ten years ago. We imagined that we can put our defense into the hands of NATO, but now we have already established a fund for the implementation of joint programs and we have structural cooperation on defense,” Macron said. “We cannot always rely on the power that is on the other side of the Atlantic, which is probably focusing more on China and cannot give us so much attention. Therefore, it’s very important for us to be able to protect ourselves,” the French leader said. The opposite positions could lead to a greater gap between European countries and dissatisfaction with existing frame of the organization."
13,U.S. pleased Iraq doing more to protect U.S. embassy: Pompeo | Apadana Media,news-society," WASHINGTON (Reuters) – U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday the United States was pleased that the Iraqi government was doing more to protect the U.S. embassy in Baghdad from Iran-backed Shiite Muslim militias but declined to provide an update on whether Washington was still considering to shut down its embassy. “We are happy that the Iraqis are doing more to provide increased security for our team on the ground there,” Pompeo told a State Department news conference. Washington, which is slowly reducing its 5,000 troops in Iraq, threatened last month to shut its embassy unless the Iraqi government reins in Iran-aligned militias that have attacked U.S. interests with rockets and roadside bombs. A spokesman for Kataib Hezbollah, one of the most powerful Iran-backed militia groups in Iraq, on Sunday said it has suspended rocket attacks on U.S. forces on condition that Iraq’s government present a timetable for the withdrawal of American troops. Asked if the United States saw the announcement as progress and whether it would still follow through on its threat to shut down the embassy, Pompeo did not specifically answer but sounded doubtful about the militia’s ceasefire declaration. “We have a rogue set of militias who have now promised not to violate the Iraqi people’s sovereignty and to take aim at the U.S. diplomats serving there that are designed to help the Iraqi people,” he said. The U.S. warning caused alarm in Iraq, where it was seen as a step toward air strikes, potentially turning Iraq into a battleground in a proxy war between the United States and Iran. A broad array of politicians called on the militia to stop provoking the Americans.

14,Politicians Totally Ignore the Only Free Market Solution to America's Economic Crisis!,news-society," Consider the following FACTS. On average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4,000,000,000,000 (yes that’s 4 trillion dollars) annually. That translates into about $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. But generally speaking, the beneficiaries of this annual growth are currently limited to those people who can afford to buy the stocks, bonds, real estate, and technological developments that account for this growth. 90% Lack the Opportunity More specifically we’re talking about less than 10% of Americans who have the means to take advantage of this relatively predictable growth, and 90% who lack the opportunity to participate.  Thus, we now have a 21st century wealth gap that is wider and more toxic than any time since the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed in its wake. To make matters worse, this was the case long before the current pandemic oriented economic crisis raised its ugly head. In response to millions of workers losing their incomes and healthcare due to the virus, the Federal government has increased unemployment benefits for several months, and issued so called “stimulus checks ($1,200)” to millions of people in an effort to artificially jump-start demand and to prevent the ship of state from sinking into oblivion. Unpalatable But Necessary Steps In taking these unpalatable but necessary steps the government has significantly increased the already massive debt load, which means it’s a short-term not a long-term solution. The hope of course is to artificially resuscitate demand, which in turn should recreate jobs and get we the people back to work and lead us all back to where we were before the virus struck. The problem is that, even before the virus struck, we the people were not in a very good place. Even before the virus erupted over half of all Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, unable to afford a $500 bump in the road without having to borrow money in order to pay for it. Things are dramatically worse than they were several months ago before the virus. But the place we were is still not the place to which we the people are longing to return. So, what can we do? The $4 Trillion Dollar Idea That Creates No Debt! In that light let’s recall that on average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4 trillion dollars annually. Once again, that translates into about $12,000 annually for every man, woman, and child in America. But the beneficiaries of this annual growth are those who can afford to buy stocks, bonds real estate, and new technology. This generally excludes we the people. The question I want to raise here is, how can we make sure the average American has systematic access to the ownership side of the economy, where MOST OF THE WEALTH IS BEING GENERATED? How can the average Joe gain access to that $4 trillion dollars of predictable growth in order to generate a second stream of investment income, while eliminating the fear and instability that so many Americans suffer from in today’s incredibly imbalanced economy? Consider the Following Possibility… •	What if the Federal Reserve, through local banks •	issued $12,000 of FULLY INSURED CAPITAL CREDIT LOANS •	to every American citizen (man, woman, and child) annually •	at 0% interest, and… •	allowed the loan to be repaid via future, pre-tax earnings/dividends (not from savings) •	along with a stipulation that these funds could only be used to purchase shares of new and transferred capital assets that were predicted to generate enough future profits to pay for their purchase and to create predictable, stabilizing, residual incomes for their owners? This strategy, known as “Capital Homesteading,” would cost American taxpayers NOTHING. It creates NO GEVERNMENT DEBT! It creates NO CONSUMER DEBT! And, rather than government debt-backed currency, the purchase would be backed (collateralized) by real, productive, private-sector assets And it WOULD NOT BE INFLATIONARY. All money created would be instantly backed (collateralized) by the full value of private sector assets that citizens would receive insured loans in order to purchase. Citizens would actually be purchasing newly issued, full dividend payout, voting shares of companies that need new capital assets in order to grow. What Capital Homesteading Will Do Is… •	Give every American systematic access to the ownership side of the American economy, where most of our nations’ wealth is being generated. •	Create a residual stream of income for all Americans thru ownership - not thru labor •	END AMERICAN POVERTY, •	Stabilize family life, •	Minimize the mental illness known as GREED that so poisons American culture •	In the long run it will help to democratize the free market, •	Create millions of new taxpayers, thereby DILUTING and REDUCING the TAX BURDEN on those who actually pay taxes •	Minimize the growing threat of artificial intelligence in Americas’ job market •	Balance the national budget, •	And pay off our massive and ever-growing national debt, etc. One Simple Example Here’s simple one example of how Capital Homesteading would benefit the next generation of Americans. If implemented, by age10 every child would have had $120,000 (10 times $12,000) invested on their behalf and paying dividends. By age 18 well over $200,000 would have been invested and be generating dividends that would easily pay for a debt-free college education along with all the benefits that would follow in its wake. Absolutely a win/win for everyone! In this moment of political division and strife Capital Homesteading literally pays all Americans to pull together, at the same time, in the same direction, towards the same goals! It translates mere political talk (such as…we’re all in this together) into real live, results driven action! It Systematically Counteracts Concentrated Wealth/Greed! Over time, each American citizen will accumulate more equity, more residual income, and benefit from their investment income in a way that only the wealthy can today. As the result, the need for federally backed social safety net programs (i.e. social security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps) will gradually fade into the sunset. More people will be able to pay taxes, which in turn decreases the burden on those among us who still pay taxes. It systematically counteracts concentrated wealth/greed as it gradually democratizes America’s free-market economy! Yet This Free Market, Non-Socialistic Solution is Being Totally Ignored!!! If the Obama administration (or any of its predecessors) had implemented Capital Homesteading, today’s COVOD 19/Unemployment crisis would not be a crisis. We the people could afford stay at home and still have sufficient income to weather a much less severe storm. Yet we’re less than 100 days from the next Presidential election and Capital Homesteading has been totally ignored by Trump, Biden, Sanders, Warren, Booker, Harris, Klobuchar, Mayor Pete, etc. WHY? Capital Homesteading In Detail I confess, this commentary has been a generalized portrait in dire need of more detail. So, for a full and detailed explanation of how this strategy could be implemented, go to CESJ.ORG and check out the concept that Dr. Norman Kurland calls the CAPITAL HOMESTEADING ACT. It’s an ingenious idea whose time is long overdue. And it’s one very good thing that could actually come to fruition as the result of this horrific, COVID 19 crisis. Addendum… UBI vs. Capital Homesteading Comparison Stimulus checks are effectively a short-term form of Universal Basic Income (UBI), an idea which has been advocated by among others, former presidential hopeful and serial entrepreneur Andrew Yang, as well as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Elon Musk of Tesla. Although the suggested annual amount of money issued ($12,000 annually) is the same as Capital Homesteading, that’s where the similarity ends. Check out the differences. Since it issues insured capital credit loans that are paid back via pre-tax future earnings, and can only be used to buy wealth producing capital assets, Capital Homesteading creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT and NO COMSUMER DEBT! UBI and stimulus checks create government debt that will eventually be paid back by we the people (not the 1% who are spectacular at avoiding taxes) in the form of higher taxes. Capital Homesteading systematically creates universal capital ownership opportunity and access to the means of acquiring wealth producing capital assets. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically finances predictable and sustainable growth of the economy. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically enables individual citizens to become economically empowered and liberated through capital ownership. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically enables citizens to become economically independent of the government. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically generates mass purchasing power through ever-broadening citizen ownership of income producing capital. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically creates new owners of advanced technologies and green growth assets UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically creates a growing tax base to pay the costs of government, thereby eliminating deficit spending and eventually paying off the currently massive government debt. UBI does not. UBI/Stimulus checks are simple and immediate. That’s their strength. Capital Homesteading requires some time (usually a number of years) in order for benefits to accumulate. That’s why UBI should start immediately and be phased out over time in favor of Capital Homesteading."

16,Arrogance in Ignorance – The Republic is in Danger - Censorship,news-society," In the rampant rage of wide-spread devolution of humanity, particularly on the shores of the U.S., the arrogance of ignorance spews its contagion in diverse ways. By contentious condescension of intentional malevolence, the spurting of non-stop stupidity intentionally contrives to wreck the democratic processes. To save the republic, higher reaches of purposeful wisdom with extraordinary ascensions of enlightenment requires a mature intelligent population. Among this extrapolation of astonishing willful insight, knowledge insists upon the development of exceptional personal individuation. Acute inner analysis is crucial. With a list of adversarial disputations, opposing forces to the right, freedom and reason of free speech endeavor to restrict essential constitutional safeguards. In particular, aside from illicit and dimwitted admonitions from the realms of academia, supernatural ideologies attack and defame essential necessity of personal expression. Among the antithesis of human liberation comes the terroristic psychological and physical pillaging of freedom by extremist fundamental occultic obsession. Led by the weak, the cowardly and the ignorant, selfishness abounds. Politics is but one arena where “anti-thinking” foments the specious terrors of ignorance so grievous, that the viability of the American republic hangs in the balance. For some, perhaps even a majority, indulged in wonderment to consider the probably of eventual human extinction. To that apocalyptic end, the political processes are but elemental factor in an iceberg of societal selfishness. Closely aligned is the cult of celebrity worship. The contemporary idiocy, from Hollywood elitist to Washington politicians, promotes a dumber American society. Most often, actors, like so many across mainstream society, spew the superficiality of their ignorance. Undereducated in so many aspects of the real-world, their fictional fantasies blur the distinction between the real and the surreal. All to often, such actions breach the viability of free speech in such condemning ways, as to rebuke the tenants of civility.  Their divisive hate mongering tears at the basic foundations of the revolutionary spirit of freedom. Given the gluttonous satiation for selfishness, money, power, and control, prefers ignorance. A few years, a British publication asserted the lunacy of the “leftist elitist”. Building a case for the extremes of smug self-righteousness is a trail of clues related to education versus indoctrination. With controversial engagements across the mainstream of society, some analyst ponder the perceived notions regarding a decline in educational ascendency. By contrast, a few agree that the American culture is declining with consequences that indicate an eventual collapse. As opposed to an enlightened constituency of well-educated, exceptionally competent and mature people, a devolution seems more realistic. Regardless of social strata, most of the population appears and acts in very immature and child-like ways. Being ignorant became more comfortable. In accordance with the aforementioned sense of intellectual dysfunction, one psychologist recently echoed a similar theme, by what might be called “American dysfunction of anti-intellectualism”. Asserting a kind of pathology of ignorance, the writer offered an argument regarding the degradation of society by wide spread idiocy. By absurd, foolish and immature behaviors, including stupid commentary by elected officials, a deep sense of disappointment echoes among those seeking solutions to serious social issues. By neither social status nor college degree is there any guarantee of extraordinary enlightenment. Likewise, regardless of educational institution, graduation does not infer the capacity for saving the planet, profound civil discourse or insistence upon the greater good. In an earlier time, philosophical admonitions favored the necessity for higher intellectual achievement beyond in formal system or communal process. Creativity was an important element in pursuing the pioneering spirit of innovation. Today, ingenuity finds few adherents. In a post-modern context, disingenuous behaviors increasingly and negatively exhibit a host of adversarial interactions. Divisive examples are ever-present in news shows, as well as political forums. Emotional reactivity is frequently the choice of actions rather than serious analytic investigations. To insist upon a problem-solving venture by way of critical thinking and logical analysis is not typically the path chosen. A regressive tendency toward immature emotional responses animates an inclination toward promoting conflict rather than compromise. While one person criticizes another for a posting in social media that may violate “community standards”, another vicious torments others for their political leanings. Intolerance for tolerance often depends on whether or not the other person agrees with another’s opinion. In prior times, open debate on controversial issues embraced the free spirit of candid commentary. Now, the opposite seems more likely. Sensitivity to everything shuts down the free exercise of alternative perspectives. At the same time, emotional reactivity threatens factual authenticity. For the purposes herein, the issues surrounding the conceptualization of censorship relates to actions intended to suppress, restrict or otherwise prohibit the dissemination of an artistic expression. Primarily, the focus is toward social media, but not exclusively. As such, the prohibitions, or attempted prohibitions, referred to include restrictions on presentation or publication of various forms of authorship. Writings of various kinds, articles, stories, books, novels and so forth are examples. Additionally, consideration of creative works likewise pertain to movies, films, photos, drawings and other related works of art. Whether an article on a controversial topic or an explicit depiction of photographic art, the matter at hand is the intentional prohibition of the art form. As an ongoing process of social and legal debate, censorship in contemporary social media, including news media, suggests an increasing antagonism toward innovative artistic endeavors. While the First Amendment (U.S. Constitution) is the fundamental expression of free speech, censoring an imaginative arty expression conjures debatable implications in terms of legality, equity, and liberty. Aside from legal ramifications, the implications of censorship are manifold. Indirectly, one aspect entertained here is the notion that censoring an online artistic genre speaks to an era of ignorance. As intellectual capacity, along with a maturity for enlightened thinking, diminishes over time, increased infantile reactivity is more likely. In post-modern consideration, contemporary efforts by social media to curtail selected expressions represent oppression. A “tyranny” of intolerance pretending to be tolerant pervades social interactivity. Another aspect suggests a devolving process of thinking that is detrimental to human civilization. If, for instance, there is a supposition that the human species is advancing, a counter argument might infer the contrary. Contemporary sensitivity appears at an all-time low in terms of overreaction to just about anything. As controversy arises over criticism of an individual, an ideology, or a flag, or baseball cap, a posting occurs on the net to demonstrate outrage. Extraordinary simplification, excessive rationalization and contentious divisiveness degrade any semblance of a civilized society. As such, there is a sense of arrogance in the ignorance. In an article for a national newspaper, the online admonition of American society focused on the commonplace “embracing of ignorance”. Accordingly, the claim points to the current trend of glorifying ignorance and disdaining intellectualism. While believing in something without facts or evidence is one thing. It is quite another to make public policy based on belief. Someone might question which is worse, not having evidentiary substantiation, or denying the reality of factual relevance and doing something stupid. This is where a serious regard for rationality searches carefully among the volumes of psychobabble to question the nature of proof. Solvability of an issue invites the various aspects of efforts directed toward provability. For most issues, many rely on gossip, hearsay, opinion and superficial conjecture that says nothing and does nothing. Frequently, this satiates an inner desire to make idiotic notions valid. Another headline from a different informational perspective asserted a study that suggested people do not like their strongly held beliefs questioned. Based on a limited research configuration form a major private college, researchers sought to assess the knowledge base of the average voter. As related to things like climate change, for instance, overuse of information dissemination may case deeper controversies to arise. Too much information leads to confusion among diverse parties to a public debate, especially if the basis for knowing something is limited. A debasing conjecture might suggest that an entity or external mechanism causes people to do one thing or another, but that is dangerously misleading. Not only that, but also such specious notions perpetuate an atmosphere of ignorance. Such things become a vicious cycle of regressive tendencies for the sake of foolish excuses. As to that, the commentary is often heard about how the “internet makes people stupid”, or how “technology” or “social media” contributes to violence, etc. Briefly, inanimate objects cannot make people do things. Lifeless inert “entities” do not possess the power for such influence. People intentionally and willfully make their own choices and there are no excuses for their bad decisions. However, to ensure the lofty status of ignorance, many will concoct all manner of mitigation. By malice aforethought, premeditation and intention infliction, people do all kinds of perpetrations. Once the blame went to demons, ghosts and goblins. Today, it is just about anything external to the person that receives blame for maladaptive behaviors. Not much difference than demonic possession. Regardless, such human antics do not elevate the species to an advanced civilization by any stretch of the imagination. Grotesque and undignified fallacies of inference permeate talk shows, talking head news outlets, schoolrooms, legislative sessions, social media and the list goes on. Subjective validation for the sake of cognitive bias, absent facts and evidence, supplants in-depth critical analysis based on vigorous inquiry. Instead, the modern malady of social discourse tends to rely heavily on opinion in an appeal to inauthentic “authority”. Such an appeal to the pretention of some source, or someone, possessing the exceptionality of an authoritative perspective, is potentially dangerous. The guru, the shaman, the spiritualist, or the metaphysician, are likely to perpetrate grievous errors of self-centered thinking. As alluded to earlier, in a stardom-fixated culture, the incessant adoration surrenders to the opinion, gossip or rumors fomented by popularity. Using fame and fortune as a benchmark for knowledge and wisdom encourages a larger framework of social stupidity. Because someone can play a part in a movie, perform on stage, or nominated for an award, does not confer enlightenment. Yet, repeatedly, “intellectual capacity” is erroneously ascribed to a star personality, whether movie luminary or talk show host. Similarly, as 24/7 cable network news sources slant toward personal opinion, the greater the probability of shallow thinking. In reality, these could actually be some of the most notoriously uninformed people on the planet. A careful analysis of the contemporary rhetoric reveals a serious failure of fact driven analysis. Evidence seems to have lost its value and necessity in favor of personal opinion. Repeatedly, feelings are valued more. Continuing the commission of the decline of intellectual honesty, a collegiate talk show interview of one researcher expressed disappointment in politicians. Reminiscing the sage commentary of one of the founding fathers, the republic is in danger when ignorance has an expectation of freedom. To paraphrase, as stupid culture cannot hope for a free society. In a frightening reflection on modern society, a researcher points to the foolish discourse found in American politics. Politicians often say the stupidest things. One point of view on this matter of egregious ignorance in political commentary, relates to how such fallacies mirror society. Whether by partisan bias, political expediency, or contrived selfishness for power and control, the lack of intellectual curiosity and analytic reasoning undermine the principles of a democratic republic. Worrisome is the notion as to the trend toward anti-rationality, or the ability to ensure constructive reason in logical analysis. That coupled with the arrogance of embracing ignorance ought to be the warning signs of a collapsing culture. A few would argue the disastrous consequences for the human species. Others aligned with the fear of eventual human extinction would accept the idea that this is the dawn of the “zombie apocalypse”. The debasing nature of stupid thinking, or as some would prefer, “magical thinking”, portrays an era of conceited preference for being uninformed. To exploit that with emotional reactivity and cultural advancement devolves to regressive depths. Meanwhile in academia, the bastion of knowledge and wisdom, a presupposition asserts the posture that high levels of intelligence mount the precipice of human advancement. When the laughter dies down, some argue there is no guarantee of vast realms of enlightenment within the hallowed halls of ivy towers. According to some educators, just the opposite is the reality. One college professor offers an assessment of the “dumbest generation”. By way of little or no mature leadership, trendy vulgarity, simplistic thinking and a host of other intellectual maladies, younger generations insist upon a devolving mediocrity of infantile narcissism. In addition, the contentions, as to a devolving state of arrogant ignorance, falls upon lazy self-righteousness smugly neglecting the rigors of human advancement. A failure to ascend beyond adolescence and insist upon a mature grown world condemns society to eventual collapse. According to some, a small niche of serious minded mature individuals, the “dumbest generation” or generations, do possess sufficient capacity to deal with future societal problems. A fundamental deficit of critical knowledge in areas of commerce, industry, government and educational institutions hastens the regressive deterioration of a democratic republic. One may or may not want to transpose “knowledge deficit” with stupidity. Applying a stupidity factor might hurt the sensitivities of those desiring to remain adolescent into adulthood. Nonetheless, a serious shortfall in socio-economic and political astuteness traversing rampant throughout mainstream society is dangerous. Added to that burdensome responsibility of being generally smarter than average, are the woefully scarce levels of historical ignorance. As earlier writers warned, failing to learn from history is the vital lesson of history. Coupled with educational narrowmindedness, particularly in collegiate settings, along with ideological agendas, the perpetration of “dumbing down” continues to erode the higher prospects of intellectualism. Assuming an exceptionality principle from the realms of real science, there are always noteworthy exemptions from sweeping generalities. However, when it comes to humankind and the maladaptive intentions of foolish behaviors exceptions few. With the political arena for instance, there are very few exceptions of extraordinary intellect, with wise and mature exhibitions of serious leadership ability. As younger generations run for public office, let us say those under 40 years old, where most millennials reside, the prospects get scary. The arrogance in ignorance expands astronomically among the younglings attempting to manage governmental organizations. At the national level, stupidity in spite of alleged college education is frightening. In pursuit of the warn paths of least resistance, asserting the nebulous notions of pretentious offense, the ignorance of the many fixate on the “selfieness” of selfish promotion. Once the unimaginative protest proclaims self-defeat, the unlabored ignorance relishes in the satiation of less strenuous mediocrity. Criticisms rage the hallow failures of critical thinking for the amative excitement of myth, magic and metaphor. Refuge finds company in the shallow fluff of forsaking reality for immediate gratification. Blustering blather endangers the republic. For the gushing eroticism of quick release, the fatted bellows bemoaning the logic and reason of serious thought spew impotent conjecture. As to the perpetration of tired ideologies, reinvented by venal strains of limp minded arrogance, fear of evidentiary substantiation perpetrates the replacement of facts with fictions. Haughtiness of unintelligent, uninformed and uneducated self-imposed offensiveness, breed the illicit dangers that threaten cultural ascendency. Within that framework, the absence of profound creativity stifles the advance of enlightenment. Acting “anti-social”, a word used too frequently in an ill-informed society, portrays an easily chosen means to get what one wants at the expense of others. Given the options, people will always act in their self-interests, which could beneficial or not. Excuses for stupid behaviors have run the deceptive and manipulative gambits philosophies as “science”, to political commentary as fact. Fictions promulgate the deceptive intentions of ill-intentioned adherents, presupposing their ignorance remain unchallenged. As to a majority that follow the superstitions of misguided dogma, the doctrines of illicit ideologies forsake the viability of social advancement. For some, there are UFOs in every mysterious movement in the sky. Others delve into the phantoms of phantasm, where ghosts, goblins and gremlins lurk. From there, the adventure skirts the outer regions of mindful ideations to chase the mysterious manifestations of social dysfunction. In that, the instigators provoke the terror of monsters from the Id. From illusions thought real, which fail the proof of real scientific validation. As gullibility runs amuck, the believability leaps to faithful allegiance to chemical therapies for hidden demonic forces. To perpetuate an industry of “mind-body-illness-wellness” forsakes the liberation of individuality to promote the feeble excuses of the many. From invisible “addictions” to superstitious flirtations, inflictions unfold that oppress and enslave as many as possible. In part, such antics promote the anti-intellectualism rising in contemporary context. As a result, some fear the arrogance of ignorance is one of the most deadly threats to modern society."
17,A Failure to Lead,news-society," A Failure to Lead On the anniversary of the birth of this nation, July 4th 2020, the Columbus statue was torn down by violent protesters & thrown into the Baltimore's harbor.  While some are glad it's gone, many are outraged,. Since this act occurred on Independence Day, I thought of Frederick Douglass & wondered how a man of the 19th Century, a former slave, might have responded.  In a speech he gave in New York on July 5th, 1852, Douglass spoke on the topic, ""What to a slave is the Fourth of July?"" At the time he spoke, slave states were an ugly, sinful fact in the southern United States.  African-Americans were not free in 1776; none could vote, many were enslaved.  Douglass understood that our emotional feeling toward ""independence"" was very likely a reflection of how one's ancestors were treated at the time America gained its freedom.  Some regard the discovery of this country and the astounding advancements that would come over the next 500 years with pride; others could only note that the path to liberty did not end in 1776, 1865, or even with the passage of the Civil Rights Acts in the mid-1960s. Baltimore officials should have known Columbus would be a target and taken steps before the protest took place.  It's failure to do so (indeed, its entire failure to keep the peace) was an epic failure in leadership. Some had called upon Governor Hogan to protect this statue because of the recent heightened tensions. Others had & some have asked for its removal before now. Mayor Young did nothing to address these requests.  City Council President Brandon Scott, now a mayoral candidate, said he supports the Italian-American community but can't support Columbus.  He didn't explain how allowing a violent mob to enter Little Italy to destroy a landmark of Italian heritage ""supported"" the Italian-America community. These reckless acts of omission by elected leaders...of not even bothering to show up...of giving the streets up to violence... are unacceptable.  They show a disregard not only for all the citizens of Baltimore but for the rule of law.  This city of ours is afflicted by corrupt one-party rule. Instead of showing maturity and judgment, our elected ""leaders"" took the easy road and allowed the mob to rule the day.  They were afflicted by how Douglass felt in his day instead of being public officials with power to prevent such things occuring today, they acted powerless. With leadership like this, Baltimore can expect to be home to the next CHAZ zone, something this city cannot afford on top of its already historic crime rate. It's time we elect new leadership in Baltimore that will govern by the people & for all the people. There are positive things we can do about inequality when you govern properly & it's not by giving power away or not leading at all."
18,The Dangerous Nature of Human Trafficking,news-society," As a modern form of slavery, human trafficking represents a type of criminology in which victims are forced into an illegal form of involuntary servitude. The range of illicit activities, by force or fraud, include sex trafficking, debt enslavement or forced labor. A multibillion-dollar industry in human beings, human trafficking ranks second to drug trafficking. One source cites between 600,000 and 800,000 men, women and children are trafficked across international borders every year. Up to 80% of those are women and girls, with over 50% under legal age, or children, in terms of a global perspective. Domestically, within the U.S., it is estimated that the level of criminal activity for human exploitation ranges between 240,000 and 300,000 youths each year. Many are at risk for sexual exploitation, while others are involved in forced labor situations or other criminal activities. As such, given the dangerous potentiality of the associated criminal activities, as well as other threat possibilities, a personal strategy for safety and security is essential. Part of the planning individual safeguards, includes raising one’s level of awareness to a more heightened state of informed vigilance. Another aspect includes the realization and recognition that deadly possibilities exist everywhere. Regardless of where you are or where you go, a threat potential could erupt when least expected. As a seemingly vulnerable target of opportunity, a criminal event could happen in the most unlikely places. Unfortunately, most people remain willfully distracted by technology, or other preoccupations, to maintain a state of deliberate readiness. Planning personal safety countermeasures is a full-time effort for savvy urban vigilance, both within the U.S., and especially during foreign travel. Under “Gonzo Theory”, the rule of “5-P’s” apply. This refers to “proper planning prevents poor performance”. The concept includes both formal and informal risk analysis, defensive preparations, and contingency plans. Naturally, within this scheme, a good safety protocol begins at home with a thorough security assessment of the home environment. From living room to classroom, boardroom or workroom, personal safety is a primary concern. In between, there are traveling considerations. Whether going to the school campus or the workplace, defensive driving demands full presence of mind and body during the trip. Vehicular operations require exceptional attentiveness. Both illicit sex trafficking and forced labor conscription involve a variety of tactics and trickery. From fraud to force, whereby the victim becomes trapped in dangerous scenarios, sometimes involving torture and death, criminals use various means. A swindle could come from nearly anyone, like an intimate partner, or a co-worker, and the offer of a “good deal” is “too good to pass up”, or simply “too good to be true”. It could involve international intrigue, a foreign adventure and easy money for “get rich quick” scheme. Concerning foreign travel, the traveler should ensure a well-researched travel plan. This includes following U.S. Department of State foreign country guidelines. For now, on the domestic front, personal security countermeasures require daily vigilance. Developing a “tactical mindset” means preparing oneself each day for the harsh reality that seriously dangerous predators hunt for targets of opportunity. Trusting “intuitive thinking”, that is to say, feeling uncomfortable about people, places and things, is an early warning system that warrants attentiveness. Being naïve, gullible and uninformed as to the dangerousness of human behavior in the real world, is reflective of immaturity that risks personal safety and the security of others. Self-education in the personal self-evolving process is essential to social survival in post-modern times. Among professionals in the field of law enforcement, most agree that making serious judgmental assessments is vital to personal wellbeing. Not surprisingly, many people today do not practice the ability to assert rationally logical critical assessments of much of anything. In actuality, a growing body of credible research points to an increasing state of social stupidity widespread throughout the U.S. mainstream. The inability to think and react becomes challenging. Using one’s full sensory abilities to assess, appraise, and otherwise plan protective contingencies begins early as one emerges into adulthood. Obviously, there are no guarantees to ensure an absolute state of individual security. Likewise, there are no foolproof assurances that everyone can be trusted, or any particular environment is perfectly safe and insulated from dangers. Given the world of the internet, social media networking and associated societal interactions, distractions loom everywhere. Mass marking in particular is hideously provocative in every medium of information exchange. Gross distractions flirt with seductive contrivances to entice more consumerism to foster gluttonous consumption. Opportunistic predation finds sinister ways to victimize others. In American society, in contrast to other countries, the average person has very little conception of self-defense tactical skills. Other than public safety-first responders and the military, most people are ill equipped to ensure a defensive state of readiness. A basic framework necessitates building a “tactical mindset”, which infers a sense of self-reliance in personal intuitive abilities. Of this, judicious discretion, or real-world threat assessment, is vital to a profound sense of situational awareness. At a very basic level, such capacity for analysis of people and places requires attentiveness to surroundings. However, since most people function day to day in a seemingly safe environment, but not absolutely safe, a false sense of security reinforces a lack of proper preparation. In addition, having a limited set of experiences in “up close in your face” confrontations, a perspective of adolescent naiveté allows faulty reactivity. That is, in response to potential dangers of human interaction, many would not expect a horrendous calamity to occur. Nonetheless, any place at any time, a horrific event can unfold quickly. In one survey, conducted by a national security firm, 80% of respondents reported they were unprepared to deal with a terroristic attack within their working environment. With less than 1% to 3% of the population actively engaged in public safety services, or national defense, the other nearly 97% to 99% rely on 1% to 3% “protect them”. From another analysis of perhaps what might be called “societal capacity for self-reliance”, a major international business magazine reports on what is being call a “nation of sissies”. In the subsequent reporting, the assertion is made that 75% of the younger generation is characterized as being “spoiled, soft and not self-sustaining as adults”. Inexperienced in matters of self-reliance and readiness to deal with an emergency is very visible. Granted, the forgoing addresses American cultural issues that express a bloated feel-good, relatively safe and excessively consumer-oriented society. There are always exceptions to every claim or assertion. Usually upon closer examination, a small percentage of the grouping does not fit the generalization. Regardless, where studies and analysis support the argument, the majority can be said to suggest a post-adolescent immaturity in adulthood. Overly indulged, pampered, prone to magical thinking and given to emotional reactivity rather than logical rationality, many are easy pickings for vicious predators throughout society on and off the World Wide Web. Not only that, but a false sense of safety and security where many are oblivious to social dangers. In terms of targets of opportunity, criminals look for weaknesses. Targeting hardening is an age-old necessity of increasing the risk of the criminal. Criminals make choices given their skill set in the selectivity of their victimization. Predators are everywhere and willing to take advantage of vulnerabilities. In the modern age, with a diversity of varying types of slavery, abduction as well as seduction lurks closer than what one might think. Whether incoming or outgoing, immigration to foreign vacation, personal safety is extremely important. Developing a personal safety strategy is vital. Once upon a time, at least two generations ago, social maturation included a conceptual framework of self-reliance, individuation in social survival training, and a sense of competence in growing up. Civil defense awareness was a customary reminder. Yet, over the decades, subsequent generation of young Americans appear less understanding of the dangers that surround them. Potential threats exist are a real possibility. With the advent of the millennials, and the subsequent z-generation, victimization on and off the World Wide Web is a real and present danger, where many naively travel. According to one online magazine that contributes to the corporate environment, many young people today are ill equipped to deal with the dangers of a volatile world. Cocooned in a seemingly never-ending array of overprotection, a generation of “sissies” have been described as badly prepared to ascended toward anything that might be considered adulthood. Immature and poorly trained in “social survival tactics”, many are oblivious to the probabilities for threatening situations and human deceptions. Being alert to situational vulnerabilities requires sensory attentiveness. Vigilance is demanding. Yet, the younglings are not the only group to get the most the criticisms. Older members of society, in particular those who never served in public safety services or the military, are typically not prepared either. For most people, daily travel and interaction with others is mostly safe and otherwise secure, as contacts tend to be in seemingly controlled environments. From home to the world of academia, or the workplace, driving, sitting, shopping, consuming and working, things are primarily routine and mundane. From texting, to posting selfies and interacting in social media, a surreal sense of superficiality overshadows the reality of human nature. Nonetheless, dangers lurk everywhere and happen with a sudden burst of violence that is nearly unpredictable. Many people are in a state of perpetual “greyness”, a foggy sense of the world around them. Dealing with the criminality of human trafficking is multifaceted and multilayered. Combating the terrorism of criminals who traffic in people crosses boundaries of national sovereignty. While citizen awareness and civic actions are one aspect, another interrelated component are commercial and institutional responsibilities. Likewise, significant in terms of interdictions are the critical resources of law enforcement at the local, state and national levels. As with all public safety endeavors, resources, funding, and personnel are vital. And, with a scarcity of resources, such as personnel, priorities are competitive. Nonetheless, contingencies are required at the local level as well as nationally. Awareness is essential across all generations, and particularly among the younger ones. As related to targets of victimization and enforcement options, the complexity extends from locale to international borders. Modern day slavery comes in diverse forms of criminality, some overtly conspiratorial by criminal collusions. Other forms manifest by intentional actions of commercial and political contrivances to ensure cheap labor costs, as well as market profitability. Naïve citizens, special interest social groups and career politicians foster an atmosphere of disingenuous discourse that aids and abets criminality. Relevance of facts in the face of national security threats often goes ignored until the next horrific catastrophe. Whether by foolish juvenile ignorance, or intentional political agenda, serious criminological issues typically miss the mainstream headlines. In place of serious interest and determined problem solving implementations, criminogenic factors are left to underfunded and understaffed limited resources. Modern day human slavery is a matter of national security concern. In particular, an inquisitive investigator might wonder why special interests contrive to interfere with immigration enforcement efforts. Where credible evidence and substantial data demonstrate the terroristic and illegal trafficking collusions, with regard to immigration activities, question arise as to the complicity of corporate and political agendas. On the dark side of economic globalism, the utilization of cheap labor, low wages and substandard living conditions, reflects business and corporate interest in “cost effective labor” resources. With more than 50% of human trafficking involving forced labor, one might conclude the “benefits” of modern-day slavery to the labor market. In addition, the dangerous nature of human trafficking contains many areas of human exploitation. An assessment of solvability factors reaches to the upper echelons of society, as well as the political processes of society. In a massive consumer-oriented society, where fixation is on consumption, the ongoing process of raising awareness among many competitive public and private interests remains challenging. While celebrity gossip and political collusions blabber about the superficial and the simplistic, the real hardcore societal issues remain in the background. In the distractions of an array of techno obsessiveness, as well as the mean-spirited nature of political agendas, critical social priorities seldom get much attention. At the bottom line, an essential consideration for some aspects of the human trafficking connivance is the question as to who stands to gain from illicit operations. Reports from several sources indicate that human trafficking is extremely profitable. One international group suggests that 36 million people are in bondage to some form of modern-day slavery. Of that number, 26% are reported to be children. Complicity lurks in the shadows. Extremely lucrative, the dangerous and sinister nature of human trafficking makes it a highly attractive business operation for criminal entrepreneurs. According to at least one investigative reporter, and there are many others, the gluttony of consumer consumption is fed in part from the labor of illegal immigrants. As suggested earlier, some would call this the equivalent of modern-day human slavery. From an economic standpoint, slavery generates a couple hundred billion dollars a year. Low cost labor forces save companies’ money on personnel costs. Ignoring the degradation and exploitation, a significant cost-benefit formula arises. From enslavement to the marketplace, human beings remain an illicit commodity to be sold on the world market. Enforcement of law is critical. Apprehension, prosecution, conviction and imprisonment of criminals are vital. Accordingly, as one research foundation points out, the supply and demand for human slaves is highly profitable in the globalization of transnational commerce throughout the world community. Issues of impoverishment, barriers to enforcement, governmental instability, warfare, environmental exploitation, political corruption, profit continuity, agricultural production, cheap wages, and so forth, interfere with efforts to ensure human safety and security. On top that, nation-state geographic boundaries of sovereignty, in terms of jurisdictional enforcement, add to the difficulties of interdicting the supply side of the problem. Interdiction suggests international cooperation, and full enforcement of laws. Enforcement infers resources, material, funding, personnel and legal support components. From all this, a more enlightened, mature and relentless proactive collaboration of public education and politically strong supportive efforts for law enforcement operations are essential. Law enforcement at every level requires serious backing in terms of personnel, technical materials, and resources. Likewise, politicians, pundits, and powerful people, especially the elite wealthy, need to honestly appraise the reality of modern-day slavery, and their role in the world society. From the decadent corridors of academia, to fawning of adulation of celebrity self-importance, relevant action is required. In one insightful analysis from an online publication, the researchers point out that profitmaking operations like “labor contracting services”, across the border enticements for jobs and benefits, and other recruitment solicitations, require serious investigative scrutiny. Every aspect of modern-day immigration should be assessed critically in terms of the real implications of what actually happens. Some would suggest that “immigration reform” is a cover phrase for redefining slavery. Or, “cheap labor”, “immigrant worker” is synonymous with the word slave. Companies that employ them, “slave holders”. Serious questions arise every day. As such, where do the policy makers, the politicians and influence peddlers, draw the line? Which corporate empires, global entrepreneurs and wealthy oligarchs further their complicities in support of human trafficking in varied forms? From Europe to Asia, from Africa to the Middle East, and so on, which countries continue to be involved in human trafficking? As the international markets expand, what are the major sociopolitical and economic factors that should be addressed on a global scale? For serious violations, who enforces international law? From agriculture to construction project, nationally and internationally, profit sometimes ignores the abuse of workers. Consumption, likewise, overlooks the indirect consequences of forced and indebted enslavement. In countries where slavery is part of the production processes, the resulting products, or additives to consumer goods, are bought and sold in the U.S. marketplace. Since Americans are enormous, sometimes gluttonous, consumers, it is important to know which companies and products are the result of human exploitation. When politicians and business organizations clamor about the need for an “immigrant worker program”, what does that really mean? When a city or even a state illegally declares a “sanctuary” status, are they really condoning human exploitation? In addition, what about an immigrant caravan? Are they potential future slaves?"
19,Major types of surface disinfectants and their action mechanism,news-society," The tornado of COVID-19 pandemic has changed everyone’s life upside down. It has brought major changes in our lifestyle. Now, people are more cautious about personal hygiene, cleaning of their surroundings which they took casually earlier. Now, disinfectants and sanitizers are necessary essentials of individual’s lives. Disinfection or sanitization of the surfaces we get in touch with on regular basis is much more important than sanitizing or cleaning of ourselves. Surface disinfectants play a vital role to effectively serve the purpose disinfection by eliminating the presence of microbial agents exists almost everywhere in the surrounding. There are varieties of surface disinfectants available having different antimicrobial properties based on their action mechanism, and particularly effective on distinct microbes. Basis on the mode of action mechanism, the disinfectants are classified in to two categories: Oxidizing Disinfectants: These oxidizing agents attack the cellular material by oxidizing the cell membrane of the microorganism, which results in loss of structure and leads to cell-lysis and death. Peracetic Acid, Hydrogen Peroxide and Sodium Hypochlorite are examples of oxidizing disinfectants. Non-oxidizing disinfectants: These disinfecting agents penetrate the cell wall of the microorganisms and disturb the phospho-lipid molecules which make up the cell membrane; thereby blocking the metabolic pathways needed for the organism to survive and /or cause it to leak vital chemicals. Quaternary ammonium compounds (quats), such as benzalkonium chloride and alcohols are examples of non-oxidizing disinfectants. Different types of disinfectants and their mode of action Alcohols: Usually, ethanol and propanol are two water-soluble alcohols which are used for the disinfection purpose. Absolute alcohols are not very effective against microbes; however their efficiency increases when mixed with water. The maximum bactericidal concentration for ethanol and isopropanol is in the range of 60% to 90% by volume. On diluting below 50% concentration, their cidal activity sharply drops. These are highly effective against wide spectrum of bacteria including mycobacteria and vegetative bacteria, viruses and fungi, but they do not eliminate bacterial spores. Ethanol in water at a concentration range of 60-80%, acts a potential virucidal agent in destroying lipophilic viruses such as vaccinia, herpes and influenza virus and hydrophilic viruses, including rhinovirus, adenovirus, enterovirus, and rotaviruses. Isopropanol is more effective on lipid viruses. The most feasible modes of action of alcohol are disruption of cellular membranes, solubilisation of lipids and denaturation of proteins by attacking directly on S-H functional groups present in cellular structure of microbes. They are majorly used in hand disinfection; [1]to disinfect oral and rectal thermometers, hospital pagers, scissors, and stethoscopes; [2]wipe down interior of Biological Safety Cabinets and bottles, and other equipments to be put into Biological Safety Cabinets etc. Quaternary ammonium compounds: Alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride, alkyl didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, and dialkyl dimethyl ammonium chloride are some mostly commonly used quaternary ammonium compounds. They are effective against gram positive and gram negative bacteria, fungi, lipophilc (enveloped) viruses. But, they possess poor microbicidal activity against bacteria spores, mycobacterium tuberculosis and hydrophilic (non-enveloped) viruses. The bactericidal action of the quats has been associated to the inactivation of energy-producing enzymes, denaturation of essential cell proteins, and disruption of the cell membrane. The quaternary ammonium compounds based disinfectants are generally used for sanitation of noncritical surfaces, such as floors, furniture, and walls. However, EPA registered quaternaries such as benzalkonium chlorides (BACs) for sanitizing medical equipments. BACs are the most frequently used active ingredients in disinfectants for varied applications including residential (walls, floors, toilets, water storage tanks, swimming pools, decorative ponds and fountains etc.), industrial (hospitals, food industry and consumer products), agricultural tools and vehicles and clinical settings ( medical equipments). Peroxides: Peracetic: Peracetic, or peroxyacetic, acid is generally known for rapid action against all kinds of bacteria, fungi and yeasts. These are majorly used in the beverage and brewing industries since they are low foaming, can be used in small concentrations at low temperatures. The special advantages of peracetic based disinfectants are that enhances removal of organic material, do not break down into decomposition harmful products (such as, acetic acid, water, oxygen, hydrogen peroxide) and leaves no residue. The action mechanism of peracetic acid is like oxidizing agents through destruction of cellular materials. This is done by denaturing the proteins, disrupting the cell wall permeability and oxidizing sulfhydryl and sulphur bonds in proteins, enzymes, and other metabolites. The major disadvantage of peracetic based disinfectants is their corrosive nature. They can potentially corrode the surface of metals and alloys such as plain steel, galvanized iron, copper, brass and bronze. They are also unstable, particularly on dilution, since the strength of their active materials reduces within short period of time due to hydrolysis. Hydrogen peroxide: It is an effective germicidal agent against a wide range of microbes such as bacteria, viruses, yeasts, fungi and spores. A 0.5% hydrogen peroxide is effective to kill various bacteria and viruses in 1 minute and mycobacteria and fungi in 5 minutes. Alfa et al. also demonstrated that a 0.5% hydrogen peroxide antimicrobial is highly efficient at disinfecting medical devices. Hydrogen peroxide attacks by producing destructive hydroxyl free radicals that can attack membrane lipids of microbial agents, DNA, and other essential cell components. Generally, 3% to 10% hydrogen peroxide solution is commercially available for household use. The typical 3% hydrogen peroxide concentration found in stores can be used as a disinfectant, it is recommended to dilute it to a 0.5% concentration, which still has some effectiveness, using a mixture of 2.5 parts water and 0.5 parts 3% hydrogen peroxide. [1]3% to 6% of hydrogen peroxide solution has been used for disinfecting soft contact lenses for about 2–3 hrs. It is also used in hospitals for disinfecting medical equipments such as ventilators, endoscopes, tonometer and fabrics in patients’ room. Hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid: The combination of hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid can effectively inactivate all the microbes except bacterial spores within a time span of 20 minutes. The action mechanism of this combination is similar as demonstrated above as peracetic and both hydrogen oxide are strong oxidizing agents. These hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid based disinfectants are majorly used for disinfecting medical devices. Halogen compounds Sodium Hypochlorites: The sodium hypochlorite is the most widely used chlorine disinfectant. It is very effective to destroy and prevent the growth of all types of microorganisms including spores. Sodium hypochlorite is also used as household bleach in the concentration range of 5.25 to 6.15%. The mechanism of action causes biosynthetic alterations in cellular metabolism and phospholipid destruction, formation of chloramines that interfere in cellular metabolism, oxidative action with irreversible enzymatic inactivation in bacteria, and lipid and fatty acid degradation. The effectiveness of sodium hypochlorite in the cleaning and disinfection processes depends on the concentration of available chlorine and the pH of the solution. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is a weak acid and dissociates to the hypochlorite ion (-OCl) and proton (H+) depending on the solution pH. Generally, it is believed that HOCl is the active species in the germicidal action, whereas the concentration of -OCl is a key factor determining the cleaning efficiency. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is a versatile disinfectant used in the [8]food industry, health care facilities include as an irrigating agent in endodontic treatment  and as a disinfectant for manikins, laundry, dental appliances, hydrotherapy tanks, regulated medical waste before disposal, and the water distribution system in hemodialysis centers and hemodialysis machines  water irrigating system, for spot-disinfection of countertops, floors, doors and building walls. Iodophors:  It is a combination of iodine and a solubilizing agent or carrier, thereby the resulting complex provides a sustained-release reservoir of iodine and releases small amounts of free iodine in aqueous solution. Iodophors are expensive but incredibly effective disinfectants having the ability to kill a wide range of organisms such as bacteria, mycobacteria and viruses at low temperatures, short contact time. But, it requires long contact time to kill bacterial spores and fungi. The action mechanism of iodophors has been attributed as iodine penetrates the cellular wall of microorganisms rapidly, thereby disrupting the protein and nucleic acid structure of microorganisms. The applications of iodophors include disinfection of blood culture bottles and medical equipment, including hydrotherapy tanks, thermometers, and endoscopes; and noncritical surfaces such as farm gate foot baths and drive-over disinfectant blankets etc. Phenolics: The phenolics are bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal and tuberculocidal in nature and effective against [2]enveloped viruses, rickettsiae, fungi and vegetative bacteria. Ortho-phenylphenol (OPP), Chloroxylenol, Para-tert-amylphenol and Ortho-benzyl-para-chlorophenol are some examples of active ingredients of phenol based disinfectants. Phenols have different mode of actions at different concentration levels. Generally, Low concentrations of phenol and higher molecular-weight phenol derivatives cause bacterial death by inactivation of essential enzyme systems and leakage of essential metabolites from the cell wall. But, it acts as a protoplasmic poison, penetrating and disrupting the cellular wall and precipitating the cell proteins, at high concentrations. Various phenolic germicides are EPA-registered disinfectants for disinfection purpose of environmental surfaces (e.g., bedside tables, bedrails, and laboratory surfaces) and noncritical medical devices. The major disadvantage of phenolic compounds based disinfectants is that they are toxic and corrosive substances in nature. Aldehydes: Formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde are two commonly known active ingredients in aldehyde based disinfectants and sterilants. They have broad spectrum of activity against bacteria, fungi, and viruses. The general action mechanism of aldehydes is alkylating the cellular proteins of microorganism. For instance, Formaldehyde inactivates microorganisms by alkylating the amino and sulfhydral groups of proteins and ring nitrogen atoms of purine bases. Glutaraldehyde alters the RNA, DNA and protein synthesis through alkylation of sulfhydryl, hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amino groups of microorganisms. Aldehyde based disinfectants are majorly used for sterilising medical devices such as catheters. Glutaraldehyde based solutions used as high-level disinfectant for medical equipment such as endoscopes, dialyzers, transducers, thermometers, spirometry tubing, anesthesia and respiratory therapy equipment, hemodialysis proportioning and dialysate delivery systems etc. The major advantages of glutaraldehyde-based solutions includes excellent biocidal properties; activity in the presence of organic matter and noncorrosive action to rubber, or plastic equipment. The disadvantages of aldehydes are highly toxic nature and a long contact time is required to kill microbial agents. Formaldehyde releases irritating fumes and pungent odor even at low level (< 1ppm). The kinds of disinfectants discussed in this article are the major surface disinfectants known. The effectiveness of a disinfectant depends on two vital factors that are contact time and concentration of active ingredients in the disinfection solution. However, few disinfectants are effective within minutes whereas many take at least 15-20 minutes of contact time. Less contact time and contact time could result in an ineffective reduction of microbes on the sanitized or disinfected surface. The increasing awareness about the hygiene and cleanliness among individuals is predominantly drives the global surface disinfectant market in last few years. According to reports, the global surface disinfectant market is expected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 11.70% during the period 2017-2021. Surface disinfectants manufacturers are endorsing new technologies to produce innovative product and enhance the efficiency of the developed products, in order to differentiate them from the existing ones in the market."
20,Advantages & Disadvantages of Commonly used Chemicals for Surface Disinfection,news-society," Disinfectants are chemical agents designed to inactivate or destroy microorganisms on non-critical, semi-critical inert surfaces such as hospitals, buildings, walls, water pools, doors, household appliances, agricultural tools, medical devices and equipments. Different disinfectants have distinct characteristics and effective against microorganisms depending on their chemical nature, concentration and contact time. Consequently, these chemical disinfectants possess many advantages and disadvantages over others. The characteristics of few commonly used chemical disinfectants are discussed in this article. Alcohol based disinfectants: Generally, Ethyl alcohol (Ethanol) and Isopropyl alcohol (Propanol) are two common alcohols used as active agents in surface disinfectants. They are always used after dilution with water, since absolute alcohols are less effective on microorganisms. The microbicidal activity of alcohols is achieved at the concentration range of 60-90%. The effectiveness of alcohol also increases as the molecular weight increases. That’s why isopropyl alcohol (IPA) is more efficient disinfectant than ethanol. The pros & cons of alcohol based surface disinfectants are illustrated briefly: Advantages: Alcohols are effective bactericides, fungicides, tuberculocidal and virucidal agents. They rapidly kill most of the microbes within seconds. However, the efficient action time depends on the type of organisms and the concentration range of alcohols used in the disinfectant solution. For instance, the gram-positive organisms Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes can be killed in 10 seconds by ethyl alcohol concentrations of 60%–95%. Alcohols inherit pleasant and characteristic odour and even remain stable if stored properly. They are generally non-toxic, non- irritant, non-allergic in nature. Alcohols are inexpensive, easily accessible and useable materials. They evaporate quickly without leaving any residues on the treated surface. That’s why no further need to rinse the surface. Disadvantages: Alcohols are not effective against bacteria spores and hydrophilic viruses. They are volatile and inflammable. They are less compatible with plastic and rubber surfaces. Quaternary Ammonium Compounds QACs are broadly known disinfectant used for sanitization in hospitals and noncritical surfaces such as floors, furniture, and walls, agricultural tools and vehicles and clinical settings (medical equipments). Advantages: Quaternary Ammonium Compounds are effective against gram positive and gram negative bacteria, fungi, lipophilc (enveloped) viruses. They also possess detergent and surfactant properties. QACs exhibits pleasant aromatic smell. They are generally non-toxic and non-allergic in nature. QACs are inexpensive, easy to prepare and use. QACs are EPA registered as disinfectants. Disadvantages: QACs are less effective against gram negative bacteria, tuberculosis bacteria, bacterial spores and hydrophilic viruses. The quaternaries are good cleaning agents but become less effective biocides with high water hardness and materials such as cotton and gauze pads because these materials absorb the active ingredients. Development of gram-negative bacteria has been found in the preparations of these QAC based disinfectants. Prolonged exposure to QAC can cause skin irritation and even cause dermatitis. Quaternary ammonium based disinfectants can be neutralized by soaps. Phenolics compounds: Phenol has occupied a prominent place in the field of hospital disinfection for past few decades. Ortho-phenylphenol and ortho-benzyl-para-chlorophenol are two commonly found phenol derivatives in hospital disinfectants. Advantages: Effective on wide spectrum of microbes, including bacteria (especially gram positive bacteria), enveloped viruses and fungi. They are stable during storage. Phenols are readily miscible with additives such as soaps or detergents and acts as good cleaning agents. Many phenolic germicides are EPA registered as disinfectants for sanitization of environmental surfaces (e.g., bedside tables, bedrails, and laboratory surfaces) and noncritical medical devices. Disadvantages: Poorly effective against bacteria spores and hydrophilic or non-enveloped viruses. Their activity or effectiveness against microbial agents decreases in the presence of organic matter. Residual disinfectant remains on porous materials may cause tissue irritation even when rinsed thoroughly. Prolonged exposure may irritate the skin. They are toxic and corrosive in nature. The use of phenolics in nurseries is questioned because of toxicity to infants. [4]Phenol is no longer used as a disinfectant due to its toxicity and carcinogenicity. Some phenolic disinfectants possess unpleasant odour. Peroxides: Hydrogen peroxide: It is a strong oxidizing disinfectant. Hydrogen peroxide is one of the safest types of disinfectants, both for human health and environment. Advantages: Hydrogen peroxide is extremely effective against a wide range of microorganisms, including enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, vegetative bacteria, fungi and bacterial spores. Hydrogen peroxide breaks down into environmentally-friendly compounds that are water and oxygen. To use as high-level disinfectant, hydrogen peroxide is also blended with paracetic acid. Hydrogen peroxide has quick activity time against microbes, even at small concentrations. A 0.5% accelerated hydrogen peroxide can kill bacteria and viruses in 1 minute and mycobacteria and fungi in 5 minutes. It is also demonstrated in a study that a 0.5% hydrogen peroxide antimicrobial is highly efficient at disinfecting medical devices. They do not irritate the skin at recommended concentrations (3 to 5%). Also, hydrogen peroxide is poorly absorbed by skin. 3% Hydrogen peroxide solution is easily available. As per the WHO, the concentration of hydrogen peroxide recommended is 0.125% (v/v) can be used in the formulation of handrub or hand sanitizer. Disadvantages It is corrosive and reacts with oxidizable materials aluminium, copper, brass, zinc, iron, bronze, manganese, chromium, lead and silver. Hydrogen peroxide disinfectants can be toxic to human, if inhaled or ingested and may cause gastrointestinal and respiratory issues such as gas embolism, gastric irritation, gastric distension, and upper airway irritation, inflammation of the nose, hoarseness, shortness of breath, and a sensation of burning or tightness in the chest. At high concentrations (>10%), hydrogen peroxide is corrosive to skin, eyes, and mucous membranes, even lower concentrations may cause irritation. Peracetic acid: It is used in widely used disinfectant for sanitizing automated machines to chemically sterilize medical, surgical, and dental instruments (e.g., endoscopes, arthroscopes). Advantages: Like hydrogen peroxide, peracetic or peroxyacetic acid acts rapidly against all the organisms. Percetic acid also decomposes in to safer products acetic acid, water, oxygen, hydrogen peroxide. It does not leave any residue on the treated surface. Peracetic acid remains effective in the presence of organic matter. Disadvantages: Peracetic acid can corrode copper, brass, bronze, plain steel, and galvanized iron. It is considered unstable, particularly when diluted. For instance, a 1% solution loses half its strength through hydrolysis in 6 days, whereas 40% peracetic acid loses 1 to 2% of its active ingredients per month. Hypochlorites: Sodium hypochlorites and calcium hypochlorites are broadly known hypochlorite solutions as disinfectants and household bleaches in the concentration range of 5.25 to 6.15%. Sodium Hypochlorite (NaOCl) is the most frequently used hypochlorite based disinfectant, used in the form of spraying or mist solutions. [3]Hypochlorite containing household bleach is typically diluted with water in the mixing ratio of 1:50 (1000ppm) for surface disinfection. These solutions have been recommended for use in both hospitals and the community as disinfecting solutions. Advantages: Hypochlorites are very effective to destroy and prevent the growth of all types of microorganisms including spores. They have rapid microbicidal activity, depending on the concentration and contact time. Hypochlorites exhibit deodorizing and sanitizing properties. They are low cost disinfectants. They are non-staining colourless disinfectants. Disadvantages: Both Sodium hypochlorites and calcium hypochlorites are toxic substances due to the presence of harmful hypochlorite moiety. They can be harmful for both human and environment. Human exposure of hypochlorites vapours and the gases such as chlorine or chloramine liberated from hypochlorite disinfectant solution can be very harmful via any mode of contact i.e., dermal, inhalation and ingestion. It can cause burning of the eyes, nose, and throat; redness, blisters, coughing, diarrhea, vomiting, liquefaction necrosis and damage to lungs. Hypochlorites are toxic in nature. Sodium hypochlorite is very toxic to aquatic organisms. Sodium hypochlorite leaves residues after disinfection. Hypochlorites are corrosive to metals. After dilution, shelf life of hypochorite solutions shortens (1:9 parts water) Hypochlorites inactivate in the presence of organic matter. This article has been prepared from various on-line references to create a public awareness on major surface disinfectants particularly to deal with COVID 19 pandemic situation"

1,No Time for a Wartime President Wannabe,news-society," No Time for a Wartime President Wannabe It's been confusing; this country's (the UNITED States) acceptance of a president with no empathy, morals, honesty, international intellect (or any intellect for that matter), honor; nor any actual sense of “other”. The GOP has shamelessly abandoned any notion of such attributes mentioned above; instead settling for the continued (and now hoped for) source of political power Donald Trump has provided to date. They were happy to represent only half of this country's citizenry (Trumplodytes), so long as they could use the machinations of our electoral system (Electoral College, gerrymandering) to maintain their status quo as Senate Majority – again, to represent only half the country. It's been bobbing around in my mind for two years now. Not who, but when? The military leadership (former and current) of this country is finally pushed to its limits of tolerance in seeing the Constitution they hold so dear tossed aside time and again by their “Commander-in-Chief” and his politically (AND morally) wayward Party of Choice. (Remember, the GOP didn't choose Donald Trump. He chose them. Search for GOP Senators' quotes AGAINST Trump's 2016 campaign, who now follow his lead like lemmings migrating to their cliffs.) He was smart enough to detect the GOP's weaknesses in their lack of true convictions in the name of election victories. He has (quite effectively) manipulated their consciences to the point of near total adherence to his every whim, fancy, tweet and, yes crime (see impeachment / Senate vote). A narcissist so engaged in himself he openly vied for the moniker of “wartime president” when the pandemic arose. Having failed at that opportunity, he now seeks a second chance. His problem resides squarely on the reliance of military action and persona. Two major issues jump out in this regard: Persona. The president avoided military service at all costs; even to the point of, as General Jim Mattis noted, “I earned my spurs on the battlefield. He (Trump) earned his spurs with a letter from a doctor”. Military Action. These military leaders are loathe to defy the true essence of their promises to protect the Constitution AND protect the people of the United States (not do battle with them). Trump claimed he “knew more than the Generals” about ISIS and the Taliban. But these leaders are not like GOP political tadpoles – who simply follow their leaders to the next vote, campaign endorsement, or supportive Tweet in whatever local political battle they may be incurring. (“LIBERATE!”) The key irony here is Trump did in fact have a second chance at some “Wartime-level glory” here. The tragic and world-awakening death of George Floyd presented the Narcissist-in-Chief the opportunity to show another side of his – I'm at a loss here. I could say his “character”. There doesn't seem to be any such credo in his mind that references to character in the positive sense. But a citizen's death at the hands (knee) of a police officer on the streets of Minneapolis BEGGED for a leader to step forward and take the reins to an international movement that seemed preordained for historical proportions. This cruel event went global in less than a month, with riots and protests worldwide. The moment was there – to spread humanity and compassion and peace to a world audience created DESPITE Trump's indifference to any humane guideposts. He chose “law and order” and “dominate” as his situational campaign slogans, rather than “peace”, “love” or “understanding” as appeals to a national AND international calls for unification in seeking enlightened paths to a “new world”. It's time for Trump to go. And not so ironically, let the military leaders lead in bringing peace to the world. June 12, 2020 By Christopher Szumilas ©"
2,Hollywood’s Henry Wilson lived a far more tragic life compared to his Netflix Character,news-society," In Ryan Murphy's Netflix strategy Hollywood, Jim Parsons plays the character of detectable expert Henry Wilson, yet to what degree is Hollywood's framework truly plainly obvious? A superior than normal proportion of it, genuinely, in the event that we glance back at the credible Wilson's life as an overseer to the stars-especially Rock Hudson. The described character Wilson is a hasty, closeted gay man who clearly bases on new entertainers. He discovers Hudson-when he's still Roy Fitzgerald – and changes his name, his teeth and his need to set him up to be a section in Hollywood. Mindful of Hudson being in the storeroom, he even sets down with him. Regardless, in the show, Wilson loses demand over Hudson when the on-screen character chooses to continue with his screenwriter darling. In the wake of treating his customer like decline and driving him away, after a year he returns tumbling down back and saying he's changed and has in a predictable relationship with a colleague, is making changes, has quit drinking, and looking a film on a gay pair. Till Hudson's coming out plot line, Wilson's delineation is on point to how the authentic Wilson proceeded with his life in Hollywood. Wilson started his Hollywood employment as an essayist going before changing into an executive. He then ""make"" Rock Hudson, by modifying his name, invigorating him and fixing his teeth. He did this with different bosses additionally, including, Yale Summers, Guy Madison, and Tab Hunter. Notwithstanding how, his activity was somewhat modest, as appeared by Mark Griffin-maker of All That Heaven Allows: A Biography of Rock Hudson. In 2018, Griffin told NPR, ""I think it was extremely momentous that on the off chance that you were a Henry Willson customer, as Tony Curtis once passed on it, you without a doubt expected to explicitly bestow to Henry."" However, it was concurred among the Hollywood phenomenal that Wilson the man to cause gay entertainers to appear, apparently, to be straight. Wilson went far to help Hudson – who remained clearly closeted for his lifetime – show up straight that he sifted through a marriage of his existence class customer and his secretary Phyllis Gates in 1955. Gateways selected for division following three years, and Wilson was reliably unfit to ask Hudson into another marriage. Hudson and Wilson continued taking an interest for a broad time length until Hudson's star ascended higher than Wilson. As guaranteed by Vanity Fair, Willson's mind boggling drinking drove him to be unrefined for Hudson and the entertainer wound up acquitting him in 1966. In this way, Wilson strolled around a slipping contorting more than 10 years, losing all that he had on account of his drinking issue lastly kicked the jar of cirrhosis of the liver in 1978. He kicked the compartment bankrupt, alone, and was peddled in an unnoted grave. His genuine decision with Hudson had some basic help for Hollywood. In Murphy's show, following Wilson apologizes to Hudson for everything that he made him face, Hudson says that he can't pardon him. Regardless of that, Hudson opens up about his fantasy about creation a film dependent on a gay love plot for Hudson to star in as a request for his horrendous practices, probably fixing things between the two. None of this happened, as a general rule, Hudson imparted a kind of need for agreement almost an astounding finish: he gave him $20,000 to help him in the wake of losing everything and conveyed, ""That is it. I don't owe Henry anything any more."" Read More News Here: https://www.worldmarketupdates.com/"
3,Phony Appeals to Fallacies of Pretentious Squeals,news-society," In the aftermath of a horrendous human tragedy, such as a murderous event, fascination and even puzzlement finds curiosity with regard to fearful emotional reactivity. The living find refuge in fearful and debasing emotional reactivity. Sad, horrific and destructive are such actions of human debauchery, and yet many of vicarious detachment run screaming to the protective enclaves of amatively sensitive satiation. Of pundits, politicians and celebrity proselytes, those least qualified in the reality of human experience, muster the dysfunctional retributions of foolish fallacies for hasty generalizations. Panicked, scared and cowardly entrenched, those who were never there seek to spread their share of sanctimonious despair. While human cruelty knows no boundaries, nor does the foolhardy invocations of stupidly contrived conjecture for the immediate satiation of cognitive bias. But for the bravery of the few, the tiny number of valiant crew, the warriors who always knew, humans do evil and some defend the many in dangerous retrieval. And so, we witness the cavalier personal promotion by incessant internet postings of “selfies”, fakes stories, unscientific theories, and constant texting of personal updates. Regressively oversimplified, cowardly reactive and emotionally dysfunctional, the simpleton of uncomplicated conjecture, exposes the shallow realms of infantile states of magical thinking. For the foolishness that hope springs eternal, the oversimplifications of a society bent on collapse relishes in the degradations of human atrocities. Carnage and mayhem go beyond the actual physical killing of a so-called “spree killer”, or alleged “mass murderer”. The juvenile antics of a self-absorbed social consensus find more subtle ways to denigrate the general populace. In time, a tragedy is forgotten. As the 24-7 infotainment venues speculate for about a week or so, and pontificate the superficiality of opinion, the “deadliest killing in U.S. history” is replaced by some other “news” story. At the same time, most politicians do what politicians do best, pander to the emotional vulnerabilities of the moment. The phony conjecture becomes more pervasive by the myriad “con-artists” jumping on board the contrivances of faulty conclusions to promote personal agendas. Quick to capitalize on the horrors of a heartrending event, from academia to celebrity stardom, everyone suddenly expounds upon their “exceptional expertise”. Unfortunately, most of it is the squeal of phony pretentiousness. In an age of excess, appeals to pretended authority, celebrity status, mythical dogma, and so on, regresses to the satiations of primordial realms. Not much changes as the devolution continues in a downward spiral. For the supernatural, the mystical and the magical, thinking devolves to the safe mediocrity of simplistic reassurances. Many will prefer the lowest standard of conduct, or the common practice of so-called minimum standards of performance. The mundane is called exciting while the superficial is hailed as politically correct, as symbolism of substance prevails. Hypocrisy reigns across the social networks as inexperience devolves into allegations of “expertise”. For the most part, the handful of corporate giants that own 90% of the alleged news media spend the bulk of their air time selling products and services. Regardless, everyone has an opinion. With the allure of pompousness to “civilization”, if given the occasion, the majority would quickly degenerate to the most basic singularity of survival selfishness. Certain institutional deterrents, as in the power of the state to enforce laws, encourage a tenuous state of pompous piety that masks a sense of mutual selfishness. Pretentiousness claims the incompetence of arrogance in shortsighted protestations of unsubstantiated claims. Large swaths of society enjoy their stupidity, as they embrace “celebrity authority”. The phony hallmarks of a failing culture includes that which relishes a lack of knowledge and smug reliance on the fake authority of others. Smoke screens of psycho-socio-babble, steeped in multifarious forms of illusion, conceitedly proclaim the two-facedness of foolhardy self-gratifications. In the glitz, glamor and gore of the entertainment world, two-dimensional characters become “scientists, diplomats and philosophers”. For a price, and the promotion of their fame, they will act for any cause, whether right or wrong, as cover and concealment loom larger than ever in narcissistic fallacies. According to some researchers, in this case those from the pseudoscience of psychology, several offered the disturbing portrait of more and more people displaying psychopathic tendencies. For those frightened or otherwise disturbed by the use of the term “pseudoscience”, the application is to that which is not a hard science, as in physics, astronomy or chemistry. In other words, the inference is toward the various schools of philosophy, in which the purveyors, mainly from academia, cannot claim absolute certainty of scientific validation for their particular point of view. This would include realms of theoretical inference from criminology, sociology and psychology. Societal conjecture, as in mainstream media, many part of academia and political processes, vacate the truth of a proposition in favor a phony appeals to fallacies of pretentious inference. It has become routine, commonplace and standardized in a detachment from reality that circumvents the burden of evidence. Absurd possibilities for witless attempts to substantiate nonsense go many times without question, critical analysis or demands for sufficiency of evidentiary artifacts to prove or disprove an issue. In the emotional aftermath of a nationally televised critical incident, logic often fails as overly sensitive reactivity instantly replaces the necessity of critical thinking. The burdensome nature of logical deduction and rational objectivity falls upon duly authorized investigative personnel. Law enforcement typically are the key participants in the official process to ensure and safeguard critical thinking and ultimate case solution. Because of oversimplification and faulty rationalizations in the simplicity of quick answers to complex behaviors, stupidity finds expression in diverse ways. For the comfort and ease of safe mediocrity, simplistic “answers” are self-assuring. This allows frightening potentialities to unfold particularly where national public policy is concerned. Worse yet, is the appeal to “authority status”. In a celebrity worship culture, as in the U.S., seemingly but superficial, “intelligent” claims as to a significant social or political matter gain instant attention from pundits and politicians. The clamor for attention is hideous. If the claimant of an issue, say gun control for instance, happens to be a Hollywood actor, then certain sectors of the public may conclude the viewpoints are valid. With the need by many people to satiate their own dysfunctional needs for attention, glamour and glitz of some magnitude, the vicarious means to achieve some connectivity is to revere another dysfunctional person. Everyone experiences maturation issues, as most people seem to never get beyond their manifestations of infantile narcissism. In a recent article, from an international online newspaper, the reporter claims that America is obsessed with the “celebrity concept”. Supposedly, this suggests a means to venerate the status of celebrity to a stature of “authority” on a range of social and political issues. Such notions go beyond simply having an opinion. Instead, the inference is that a person of presumed fame and fortune is qualified as an expert in areas outside their primary domain of talent. Skilled in one area does not infer competence in another. Again, a flash back occurs to the various fields of pseudoscience, often accepted without question. In a “celebrity worship” culture, and the inference slants to those with little or no real world experiences, such a notion can suggest a number of aspects relative to the gainful acceptance of those biased in a particular direction. Being famous, desiring notice and seeking validation for the amative inclination of “being seen”, involves a variety of venues. Not only that, with varying levels of self-evolution, or not, people are invariably gullible and naive. From academia to entertainment, to mass marketing consumption, politics and preaching an ideology, salesmanship of personal dysfunction finds many outlets. Bias generally instigates conclusions drawn for the satiation of subjective validation. Everyone brings that with them. Personal feelings, ideological beliefs, and mythic inclinations are just the beginning of the slippery slide into “magical thinking”. Poof, it’s “true” because someone said so. In addition, the fallacy of preconception further colludes intimately with observational self-interests. Alleged “experts”, particularly those who spent decades in safe and secure environments, like academia or movie studios, find all kinds of ways to make commentary about things for which knowledge is limited. In response to those who think they found the answers to ultimately explain human behavior, relative to thinking processes that lead to actions, extreme caution is warranted. Likewise, a healthy sense of skepticism is necessary, along with seasoned cynicism. In some cases, particularly on lecture circuits or “talking head” shows, a guest speaker or panel discussion, should be treated with suspicion. The arrogance of subjectivity surfaces in attitudes that devolve to the flaunting and taunting of simplistic generalizations. Human behavior is complicated and the regurgitation of unsubstantiated conjecture without scientific evidence fails to answer many question. In the aftermath, where anecdote, rumor and gossip masquerade as confirmation, phony appeals to pretended rationality lead to perpetration of misinformation and potential disaster. From other sources, one might encounter the “born again” proselyte whose bias on a particular topic is influenced by a “supernatural mindset” reinforced by dogmatic doctrine. Subjective validation assumes one’s position on an issue is credible given the claim they believe in the mysticism of this or that. In addition, the claimant wants confirmation they are correct in the questionable assumptions, which support the fallacy of inference. Soon or later, in trying to convince a listener, the assertion in cognitive bias stumbles into the nebulous regions of hasty generalizations where correlation is confused with causation. In one major study of devolving processes of reliance on factually substantiated data driven dialogue, the researchers assert the prevailing social atmosphere as one characterized by declining intellectual capacity. Some real scientists, those in the realm of the “hard sciences”, suggest data that shows a degrading or declining rate of I.Q. levels. Additionally, some claim there is a sense of socially deteriorating respect for the value in seeking the truth via the facts in evidence. This in turn translates into the perception that critical thinking erodes with each subsequent generation. As a result, what might be considered as “human devolution” in a devolving culture offers the prospects of a dismal future for humankind. For this writing, it is presupposed that American culture is in regression, with the human species slanted toward an eventual extinction. Part of the criticality of such consequences, is the oppressive nature of status quo conformity that encourages the less imaginative to cope at a primal level. A simple all-encompassing explanation for complex social issues is easier and less demanding. Embracing the non-reality of safe mediocrity by emotional reactivity, further devalues the necessity of intellectual achievement. Critical analysis and rigorous inquiry are frequently avoid in favor of simplistic thinking. To allow fuzziness in the boundaries between opinion and truth worsens the efficacy of valid conclusions. Investigators from diverse backgrounds in collaboration in the previously mentioned research, offered concern about the debasing nature of public discourse. Through commercial, educational and political processes that rely less and less on facts dangerous consequences lurk in the shadows. For the sake of hedonistic perpetration of egoistic motivations, by willful intentions, many forsake transformative efforts for the advancement of enlightened inquiry. Rather than think for themselves, to satiate their whims, wishes and wants, they chase the mystical notions of clever gurus. For immediate gratification, regardless of systematic and logical validation, any notion of “pop psychology” will suffice to most people. A focus on the facts for many is tedious, time consuming and requires a sense of unabashed authenticity. That which sounds good, feels comfortable and seems tolerant of everything, yet intolerant of anything that disagrees with whatever went before it, is the superficial ideology of the moment. Easily accepted unsubstantiated and cowardly rhetoric passes of shallow intellectual stimulation. Most will swiftly rally around a simpleton’s limited world view of safe mediocrity. An abomination to those who attempting to be creative, innovative and enlightened, the herded bellow of the mainstream is to flock around anyone who appears, sounds and acts as though they have “special knowledge” or discovered “hidden secrets”. In a celebrity worship culture, that could be anyone who is media friendly, know the art of the sound bite, and looks good on camera. Young and old alike, millennial or boomer, the art of the con is not restricted to any particular age group. A selfie moment is essential. For those constricted by their self-conceit, their moment of glory, and the fame of the instant blog, time spent in the spotlight is worth the deceit of the conceit projected. The con artist in promotion of an array of “pyramid schemes” is adept at clever deceptions. Postmodern advertising, 24/7 “news media” and consumer marketing capitalize on consumptive gullibility of the naïve and the uninitiated. Actors, sports figures, politicians, are practiced in the art of trickery. So are teenagers enamored by their puberty. Always playing to the audience, pretentious conjecture often overwhelms attempts to disprove mere speculation by weight of evidence to the contrary. Sleight of hand, if done well, or seems simplistically convincing, will get top billing because others think they might be smart. Many times, off camera, there is someone pulling the strings with a hidden agenda or a myriad array of self-interests. Meanwhile, serious social problems remain unaddressed, ignored or glazed over by phony appeals to egregious fallacies. For a few seconds of sound bites, an ability to read a teleprompter, or memorize a few lines of commentary, instant “experts” blather an array of opinions. In a culture that created a deified pantheon of wannabe “authorities” on just about everything, an eventual dystopia looms closer that one might think. With primal subservience, or primitively ancient submissiveness, a majority dwell in realms of anti-intellectualism and unscientific medieval thinking. The unevolved status of many cling to adolescent states of poorly constructed ideological processes. Subjective validation overrides reality. Social strata transference of individual responsibility, and accountability for actions, is freely abrogated to other presumed authorities, institutions or communal entities. Historic warnings to beware of false prophets have long gone unheeded. In the meantime, just about everything has become profitable in a gluttonously consumptive society. Usually, that reflects the wishful thinking that everything will be okay, so long as one remains happy with the status quo, eats more, buys more and gets more. Habitual primeval functionality ensures easy expectation for the laziness of critical thought devoid of logical analysis. Such “devolutional” antics further hasten symbiotic relationships that foster social deterioration and the degradation of cultural interactions. Where pseudoscience overshadows real science, superstition surpasses evidentiary authenticity, and ignorance is more popular than knowledge, extinction looms closer. Once upon a time, serious educational endeavors were part of a pioneering spirit of a developing nation. With that, there was a powerful sense of public service commitment. In addition, a drive of devotion and dedication to the “greater good” meant an obligation not only to personal development, but that of others as well. Yet, the present atmosphere of selfishness is not only debasing to the culture, it is also counterproductive and mean spirited. Demeaning conjecture in social media, news reporting and political engagements punctuate an era of divisiveness that characterizes a devolving society. As such, phony appeals to fallacies of pretentious squeals the devolving aspect of human stupidity. To the debasing scale of alleged social progress, such inclinations toward “cultic” or “occultic” beliefs is more important to the vast majority than a maturing sense of wisdom. Whereby the maturation to an altered, or more profound, in depth analysis, is stifled by a particular dogmatic doctrine unsubstantiated by scientific validation. As a result, the suggestion here is that belief systems, ideological perceptions, or mysticism, etc., become foundational biases that influence thinking processes. From ideation, or the imagery that precedes thought activity, to formulation of thinking processes and subsequently communicated to others, is cognitively prejudicial in favor of the individual. Viewed further along these fragmented lines of social dysfunction, fake “experts” and phony “advocates” of one trendy thing after another, seldom promote more than themselves. Likewise, “celebrity worship”, or constant appeals to “authority”, seldom produce well-founded evidentiary substance that reveal the totality of human nature.  From psychics to religious zealots, to pandering politicians and celebrities, the interrelationship of “dominance and submission” to spurious conjecture, works the contrivances of myriad human misunderstandings about cause-effect reality. According to a recent national poll, at least 75% of the public believe in some aspect of the supernatural, the occult or some version of the paranormal, and often in connection with a religious ideology. That number, according to other surveys, may range from 80% to 90%. Phony appeals to pretended loftier articulations frequently result in specious conjecture that end up saying nothing and doing little. Greedy and self-indulgent, observation of contemporary “infotainment culture”, also called the “pop culture”, sees a symbiosis of intentional malevolence for selfish reasons. With devolving consequences, arrogant and condescending behaviors span a diverse spectrum. In a flashback to the 18th century, an American poet and philosopher admonished each to awaken. To wake up and know the manipulations of premediated, purposeful, and deliberate deceptions, is to recognize malevolent predation through society. In addition, at the time, it is a necessity to understand there are no excuses for uncivil and illegal actions people commit toward others. Torturous and murderous behaviors are serious examples of a species approaching the end of its existence. Corporate and governmental corruption, along with celebrity and pundit stupidity, further exemplify behavioral regression. In what some call a civilized world, and this one is definitely not one of those, such behaviors descend in opposition to any semblance of a cultured and enlightened populace. In spite of a couple hundred thousand years to get it right, humanity proves in many ways it doesn’t want to change. Yes, of course, to those who would argue the “basic goodness” of a “civilization” that is changing for the better, others would counter with skepticism. Although on an individual basis, there are exceptions. Yet, too few and too late. For the most part, in a society that relishes in gossip, sitcoms and celebrity adulation, social discourse is kept light, fluffy, feel good simplistic and smugly self-righteous. In spite of the devolving process of regressive societal disintegration, a few, probably no more than 25% of any given population group, work to improve themselves. For this effort, among this diverse grouping, self-evolution is critical. This means an extraordinary capacity for personal development in relation to self-education, independence, ideological freedom and liberated actions to become a better version than the original personality. Such is a quest to insist upon a disciplined non-materialistically focused life, and a mature process of rejuvenated mental-physical health. Differentiation of the wholeness within, invites the strength of healthy skepticism, tinctured by a modicum of cynical insightfulness to advance one’s sense of creativity. That’s of the utmost necessity. Hesitation to free oneself from all the gluttonous proclivities of crowd consensus, from assumption to consumption, breeds the bleeding discontent of defeat. Contemporary so called “trendy pop culture”, filled with the greedy hedonistic mindlessness of self-promotion and “selfie absorption”, so much for many observers of behavioral issues, the selfish indigenous nature endangers the future species to extinction. In a closer look at the current reality, many gifted scientists have speculated that human civilization faces a major collapse in the next 100 years. Some analysts shorten that time span to roughly about 25 to 30 years. Meanwhile, as debates continue, the social spectrum, from alleged news reporters, the infotainment industry, and social media pundits, continue to dabble in plenty of mundane and mostly irrelevant societal tripe. History, for those who pay attention, is rife with lessons to be learned. Yet, generally those are learning processes most fail to heed. For all human history’s warnings, the species ignores and forgets the essentiality of the prologues to subsequent generations. For the few who are of a rebellious nature, self-evolution is a solitary act of differentiation, and at the same time, an act of defiance against mainstream stupidity. That is, a lack of self-evolution, a grown-up mature outlook, and ongoing commitment to personal creativity. To be alone, to be a rebel, but an advanced and wiser one, requires action in certain ways that adversely goes against the toleration of the oppressive consensus that “sheep herds” the many. As such, no American institution is safe from the ravages of self-interests that hinder the forward momentum of an evolved human species. Currently, there is more a preoccupation with pseudoscience and pretentious claims of knowledge, as opposed to real science and hardcore evidentiary substantiation. For that, the brave few who look to the real expert veteran, the seasoned practitioner of real life experiences, the learned mentor of hard earned expertise, one is cautious as to the admonitions of conventional consensus and mainstream media. Instead logical deduction is replaced by feelings. The darkness of human nature, that which foments evil intentions and horrific inflictions, will speak differently from public to private self-interests.  Diverse forms of illicit motivations willfully contrive all manner of deception. When wants and desires are not satiated, anything imaginable is possible. Yet, the fear of recognizing one’s own dysfunction often finds clever but phony appeals to fallacious assertions and shallow self-serving interests. For serious minded, and the few who ascend to higher levels, the quest is to go beyond the mere satisfaction of limited inquiry. Facts, data, evidence, etc., where bias and subjective validation are controlled, seek higher planes of understanding."
4,Why Addiction To Fame And Celebrity,news-society," Are Narcissists addicted to being famous? Answer: You bet. This, by far, is their predominant drive. Being famous encompasses a few important functions: it endows the narcissist with power, provides him with a constant Source of Narcissistic Supply (admiration, adoration, approval, awe), and fulfills important Ego functions. The image that the narcissist projects is hurled back at him, reflected by those exposed to his celebrity or fame. This way he feels alive, his very existence is affirmed and he acquires a sensation of clear boundaries (where the narcissist ends and the world begins). There is a set of narcissistic behaviors typical to the pursuit of celebrity. There is almost nothing that the narcissist refrains from doing, almost no borders that he hesitates to cross to achieve renown. To him, there is no such thing as ""bad publicity"" – what matters is to be in the public eye. Because the narcissist equally enjoys all types of attention and likes as much to be feared as to be loved, for instance – he doesn’t mind if what is published about him is wrong (""as long as they spell my name correctly""). The narcissist’s only bad emotional stretches are during periods of lack of attention, publicity, or exposure. The narcissist then feels empty, hollowed out, negligible, humiliated, wrathful, discriminated against, deprived, neglected, treated unjustly, and so on. At first, he tries to obtain attention from ever narrowing groups of reference (""supply scale down""). But the feeling that he is compromising gnaws at his anyhow fragile self-esteem. Sooner or later, the spring bursts. The narcissist plots, contrives, plans, conspires, thinks, analyses, synthesizes, and does whatever else is necessary to regain the lost exposure in the public eye. The more he fails to secure the attention of the target group (always the largest) – the more daring, eccentric, and outlandish he becomes. Firm decision to become known is transformed into resolute action and then to a panicky pattern of attention-seeking behaviors. The narcissist is not really interested in publicity per se. Narcissists are misleading. The narcissist appears to love himself – and, really, he abhors himself. Similarly, he appears to be interested in becoming a celebrity – and, in reality, he is concerned with the REACTIONS to his fame: people watch him, notice him, talk about him, debate his actions – therefore he exists. The narcissist goes around ""hunting and collecting"" the way the expressions on people’s faces change when they notice him. He places himself at the center of attention, or even as a figure of controversy. He constantly and recurrently pesters those nearest and dearest to him in a bid to reassure himself that he is not losing his fame, his magic touch, the attention of his social milieu. Truly, the narcissist is not choosy. If he can become famous as a writer – he writes, if as a businessman – he conducts business. He switches from one field to the other with ease and without remorse because in all of them he is present without conviction, bar the conviction that he must (and deserves to) get famous. He grades activities, hobbies, and people not according to the pleasure that they give him – but according to their utility: can they or can’t they make him known and, if so, to what extent. The narcissist is one-track minded (not to say obsessive). His is a world of black (being unknown and deprived of attention) and white (being famous and celebrated)."
5,Rally 'Round The Flag? We The People,news-society," February 2020 With the impending political and military activity due to the actions surrounding the US Embassy in Iraq, now is a good time for citizens to sharpen their ""observatory lenses"" when assessing the United States politicians' actions and behaviors. Yes indeed, President Donald Trump is a key player and we should regularly zoom our focuses on him. Just as important, though, we as citizens, have a duty to also remind ourselves to regularly switch to a panoramic view and note those politicians who march in lockstep agreement with Trump on the international stage. It's one thing to put your past moralistic and altruistic notions in your idealistic pockets in a blind effort to protect your party's leader during a politically-engendered impeachment process – it's entirely different, and much more grave an act, to do so when American policy effects U.S. citizens abroad due to the negative spotlight being shone upon them as appendages of our politicians' cowardice in the face of true avarice demonstrated by the blatant, impetuously childlike actions of our politically impulsive president. For those who reside on the political left and now feel that the allegorical morally-righteous needle has swung to their favor in light of the impeachment process and the facts revealed during the process (presidential tweets, White House staff emails), a more vital and telling test is sure to come: Will they back the president on military actions based on the traditionally fantastical (if only that were an oxymoron) notion that the nation must be united in times of war and blindly adhere to the concept known as the ""Rally 'round the flag effect"" (or syndrome). Two schools of thought derive from this effect – patriotic inclinations in the citizenry to support the president unconditionally in military actions; and political impotency of the opposition party – in this case the Democrats – evidenced by that party's unwillingness to question a commander-in-chief's war wagering. As former CIA director (of the Clinton administration) Michael Morell told ""CBS This Morning"" the drone strike on Iranian General Qassim Soleimani will lead to ""dead civilian Americans."" On ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos"" Matthew Dowd pointedly noted that the attack on Soleimani was a direct attack on a military leader ""of a foreign sovereign nation"", and added that countries around the world will indeed take note. What this means is that people the world over will absolutely be keenly aware of how our president conducts U.S. Military operations abroad. But be assured citizens of the United States, with the timing of this attack and its chronological relationship with the upcoming elections, you, the electorate, the people of this country who will be selecting the next commander-in-chief, will be under an observational scope never before available to a world audience with such easy access to information; which will provide a 'brutal' level of scrutiny. Previous degrees of the natural cloaking of our electoral process provided by both geographical distance and general disinterest will be unmasked. Those nations with pervasive anti-American bias will experience an enhanced version of such sentiment if we re-elect a leader whose definition of military protocol for such an invasive military action is to inform a party-friendly sitting Senator of such an act on a golf course. (Any consultation with domestic or foreign intelligence agencies/entities?) Nations with an underlying resentment of America's seemingly presumed station of superiority will nationally disrobe of any such aesthetic restraint. If political preservation trumps national security (no pun intended, but unavoidable here) and even international security, America's spotlight as operating as the ""leader of the free world"" will diminish our standing to that of a dimly lit station - just another nation ""in the mix"". Or maybe... a shinier object - a target of resentment for our arrogantly self-appointed role atop of the world's moral hierarchy. This is not a call for anti-Republicanism – it's an appeal for the end of the current hyper-partisan state of our national political psyche. This president has 'skillfully' guided this nation, using his maniacal tendencies, into a partisan divide we haven't seen since... the Civil War? Okay, I'll cease and desist of my own hyperbolic transgressions and return to a normalcy of straightforward talk: Just keep your eyes open, people, forget about the politics, and vote for the person you believe to be best to move this country forward and is able to do so without allowing their own personal interests and inflated ego to obstruct their view of what is in the best interest of our nation. Don't fall victim to the comfort zone you so cherish in your political party's rhetorically soothing environs. Maybe I can simplify this even further with the opening line of a document you might be familiar with – the United States Constitution. It is: ""We the People of the United States""... NOT ""We the Party""."
6,Pathology of the decadent Few,news-society," Several hundred years ""B.C."" or ""B.C.E."", warnings emanated from Grecian culture about the necessity for wiser instigations to enhance civilization. Yet, that is only one point of reference, as there have been many for which the heed of such continues to go unnoticed for the sake of the greed, corruption and selfishness. For the mean spirited slant, there are many adherents. In a recent article appearing in a major publication on the western coast of the U.S., an author asserts the regressive tendencies of a culture bent on its own ""victimization"" and eventual destruction. Another has called this era the final phase, the ""circus"", which alludes to the collapse of a civilization. Seemingly, many prefer abuse, pity and pampering, rather than maturity, growth and knowledge. Counterproductive in the process of self-evolution is the willful weakness non-competitiveness in any sphere of social interactivity. For the sake of ""political correctness"", or other illicit attempts at enforcing ""level playing fields"", by means of intolerance for tolerance, hastens communal deterioration. A determined sense of individual liberation, by disciplined determination, is often confronted by pretentious emotionalism and maladaptive condescending confrontations.  That hastens extinction. Enlightened transformation is not considered a lofty and noble goal for evolving transitions of individual self-reliance to higher states of ascendency. Smarter, competent, skilled and self-evolving excellence is not widely rewarded, as more and more information sources appear ""dumbed down"" to baser levels. In its place instead, most interactions tend toward a disingenuous ""victimhood"" of pretentious helplessness. One writer described many people in contemporary American culture as sissies. Pampered, spoiled and irresponsible, many, including the wealthy few, seek personal enrichment. In the process of criticizing post-modern society, several writers have questioned whether or not most people, by lazy general consensus and apathy, have allowed U.S. society to become a nation of wimps, crybabies, and weaklings. While a part of such accusations are associated with a person’s overall physicality, the focus is more on the intellectual, ethical and maturity side of acting like a grownup. Instead, some researchers have suggested intellectual and morals capacity is regressing. An indication, or at least an implication, is the emotional reactivity or exceptional sensitivity to any perceived slight, insult or insufficient recognition for needy validation. The instant ""selfie"" or inability to accept criticism reflects overly sensitive immaturity in reaction to a perceived ""insult"". Rather than pursue the moral high ground of differentiated self-reliance, juvenile antics devolve to a state of abject reactivity. Overall, due to purposeful maladaptive choices, to satiate escalating degrees of selfishness, meaningful change in human behavior stagnates. Increasing numbers of the population desire greater emotional subsistence provided by others to satisfy their self-centeredness. It seems to some who study social processes and by extension societal deterioration, more ""children"" than ever are living in adult bodies. For which, they require more attention for someone to take placate their neediness. Given the intentional persistence of biases, prejudices and assorted animosities, regardless of socio-economic or political placement, many easily provoke their own deception and thereby potentially bring harm to others. The lack of serious creativity, innovation and productively motivated individuality appears less and less a socially positive aspect. More want attention rather than invention. Additionally, with hate speech disguised as ""social justice"", and intolerance for differing opinions with vicious physical attacks as ""free speech"" resistance, child-like behaviors on the part of adults are increasingly degrading. And, once you are insulated from the reality of the real world, you can ignore the factuality of cause and effect in terms of rational explanations. Feelings will prevail over facts. As subjective validation for the unimaginative expression of personal bias replaces logic and reason, the resulting stagnation of thought debases meaningful commentary, as gross fallacies of inference foment hideous hastily drawn conclusions. Along with that, there is the never-ending collective of herd-minded assumptions based on little or no factuality. Since most people are selfishly fixated on their own self-righteous superficiality, the evolving essence of enlightened discourse is problematic. Choosing the less cumbersome travels of in-depth investigative research, in order to prove the viability of an issue at hand, most interactivity defaults to the simplistic and emotional conjecture of self-validation. As such for instance, the mythology of the ""American Dream"" embraces the destruction of the human species by way of gluttonous consumption and exploitation of global eco-systems. To perpetuate the associated frauds speaks to the decadence of the few. While there are sets of ""law"", procedures, rules, regulations or guideline parameters for a select group, the so-called 1%, there is also another set of legal frameworks for the other 99%. By means of what might be called the ""legerdemain of the corporate state"", as described in at least one novel, the ""American Oligarchy"" ensures its safe and secure insulation. Upper reaches of society do not play by the same rules as the majority of socio-economically challenged lower realm. But, the majority goes along with the mass marketing appeals for a ""herd mentality"" of bloated consumer schemes, in order to satiate desires for an endless array of consumptive commodities. In a once proud culture of pioneers, adventurers and creative entrepreneurs, as cited by one researcher, society has descended into a ""nation of wimps"". A collectivist collusion of ill-informed, lazy, obese and fearful ""sheeple"" hastens the devolution of an entire country. Such references are not about well-built bodies, food fitness or bulging biceps. Instead, it is about the courage of convictions, ethical enlightenment and fortitude of character to insist upon justice over emotional justification. A sissified population is one that relishes in the smug piety of its stupidity, disdain of intellectualism and creative laziness. Self-righteousness in emotional reactivity, intolerance for the opposing views of others and naïve notions of cause and effect, likewise express a growing self-perpetuating pathology of infantile narcissism. Fiction trumps facts, with revulsion for thought provoking rational insight and advocacy of enlightened perspectives. The quest for wisdom in higher states of learned pursuits gradually transitions to illusions of fakes, frauds and facsimiles of human expression. Behind the scenes, the decadent few encourage the abject foolishness and adherence to the never-ending saga of unlimited resources. Flourishing across a devolving landscape, with incessant appeals to the rich and famous for words of no so profound ""authority"", or pretentious ""expertise"", speeds up the eventual demise of the human species.  In one way or another, decadent few collude to the acquiescence of collective primal subservience for the incessant satiation of predatory arrogance. Voluntary servitude enters the mix with myriad excuses to promote excess and hastens the regressive escalation of diverse forms of modern enslavement. Discourteous, haughtily condescending and mean spirited, immediate gratification presses the persecutions for all manner of selfish deception. With antagonistic persistence, the landed gentry, the robber barons, and the heirs of aristocracy threaten the republic. With smug disdain for those at the bottom of the socio-economic pyramid, the modern aristocrats condescendingly flaunt their presumed entitlement. If one were to stop, look and listen intently, the pitch and tone of decadent contempt comes through loudly. The extravagance of greediness to acquire worldly possessions underscores a society of bloated consumption. At the same time, predation in one form or another panders the seduction of primal subservience, as modern day slavery become more pervasive. For which, the promotion of gluttonous consumption seeks to pacify the many for the sake of the few, who remain well insulated in their materiality. The hypocrisy is limitless. Much like the ruling class of ancient Rome or Greece, according to one source from an online investment advisory, the decadence of the ruling classes exploits materiality not for the greater good, but greater greed. As institutions decline, political and social interactions devolve, and people act out their hatreds, prejudices and multiplicity of self-interests, the collective pathology willfully shares eventual societal collapse. Meanwhile, as the ""devolution cliffhanger"" is uncertain, another worldwide study offers the inequitable tipping of the global socio-economic scale in the direction of the few. Over two years ago, a British news agency published a report that indicates what some already knew. To add to a dismal perspective regarding the decadence, or perhaps social debauchery, a small percentage of ""oligarchs"" governor a large amount of wealth. That is, a small concentrated group of wealthy people controls a significant amount of planetary prosperity and affluence. As such, the divide between rich and poor continues to expand. By regressive capacity in maladaptive ways, the rift is demeaning, oppressive and destructive. For 1% of the population to exercise dominion over more than 50% of the wealth, creates an extraordinary inequity for the other 99%. Nearly 100 billionaires, in reflection upon the aforementioned study, enjoyed a 50% increase in wealth over a 4-year period. During the same time, more than 50% of poorest on the planet experienced a loss of nearly a trillion in wealth. The disparity of such decadence of the few, or call it corruption, depravity and self-indulgence, degrades any prospects for long-term survival of the human species. Further, of the reaming 48% of the earth’s wealth, that falls to the richest 20% of the population. Which could be interpreted that one fifth of the people on the planet now owns all the planetary riches. And the majority, 80% of the population, has limited ability to access such wealth. With the disparate divide between arrogant wealth and abject poverty, closing the gap for greater opportunity, for the greater good, appears a dismal prospect. An oligarchic class, which fails to ensure the nobility of equitable distribution of resources, and otherwise use the power of influence to affect productive change, aids and abets the demise of the human species. Smugly self-righteous and piously ""entitled"" to their ""inheritance"" of corporate-political aristocracy, the decadent few perpetuate a devolving complicity of a ""ruling class"". Neither by intelligence, accomplishment or competence, the collective pathology of the decadent few promote the safe mediocrity of a greedy status quo. Then again, what’s new? Not much. A small percentage of very smart people invent various means by which to ensure the comfort of a leisure class. An even smaller wealthier group that uses influential means, some by support of the American taxpayer, to create multi-national corporations, in turn conscripts them for expansion of ""corporate cartels"". In the process, the ""power elite"", an echo of warnings from nearly 75 years ago, ensures riches remain consolidated within a narrow societal spectrum. Yet, in the short span of finite existence, what really matters in terms of personal transformation. For the reassurance of acceptance as time passes, where youthful passions dissipate, primitive thinking and eventual conformity stagnate, and materiality through greed replaces personal transformation. Subjective validation for nearly anything stimulates the urges for selfishness in the performance of maladaptive behaviors. By the greediness of constant accumulation of material goods and services, counterproductive ideations plot and scheme the neediness of worldly acquisitions. For the most part, it is not for the greater good for the greatest number, but for the few who pillage and plunder. For the want of excessive materiality, in the pleasures of exceptional self-interests, the mainstream satiates its illusions in obedience to the perpetrations of the upper streams. As opposed to the frugal sharing of the training, education and discipline for imaginative dreams, a unity to advance civilization, oppressive behaviors invite the final inflictions. Creativity fragments into disuse and over-consumption that drains environmental capacities. A few strive to transform in wise rebellion for a union in personal ascendency. Coming out of nowhere, a void, and then in the end, going back there, to the nowhere to be forgotten, terrorizes into masses into protective submission. Ignorant of history, the majority embrace the failures repeated endlessly to self-destruction. Lacking the innovative forces of energies untapped, accepting stupidity instead of rationality, in lieu evidentiary substantiation, aids the eventual death of the human species. Many malicious factors participate in the contrived demise of the American society. Undercurrents that undercut the viability of creative enterprises for the advancement of human civilization are intricate. Interwoven in a complexity of deceit, manipulation and greedy subversion, the decadence remains pervasively malevolent. Self-caged to primal and immature emotions, steeped in the hypocrisy of supernatural fixations, and imprisoned by amative unimaginative proclivities, the degradations continue in divisive criminalities. For the perceived necessities of illicit gain with little effort, greedy self-righteous ignorance for unmerited entitlement, and consumption without limits, fosters a collective devolving social ""mindset"". As one generation after another perpetrates the nihilism of devolution, the human species follows others that vanished. With various calamities occurring globally, from hurricanes to tsunamis, as one example, many opportunities to observe aspects of human behavior. For most, self-centered, selfish and foolishly arrogant overrides humility, self-evolution and service for the greater good. While there are noble acts of heroism, there are degenerate acts of criminality at every level of socio-economic strata. Without question or opposition in any form, with nominal exceptions, the majority eventually embrace the conformity of non-resistance. The oligarchs continue to deceive and exploit the many for the greater gain of the decadent few, the so called 1%. In time, for the brevity of each life, liberation diminishes, as diverse forms of slavery binds and confines the masses. Meanwhile, communal educative and restorative resources stumble and creative enterprises falter, as the oppressed fixate and spur the demise. In an academic study by a major western university, the wealthiest top one fifth of the U.S. population controlled or otherwise manipulated 90% of the wealth. With the riches concentrated in the hands of a few, one wonders how much can be done to rectify major societal problems. But for the valiant efforts of the few at different rungs of the societal ladder, the vast majority remain mesmerized by the deceptive manifestations from the top down. The status quo is perpetuated by any way possible. As generations come and go, and easily slip beyond the possibilities of species advancement, normal becomes degenerative and decadent. As a result, the probability of species extinction grows nearer. Of ghosts, goblins and gremlins, the illicit nature of magical thinking perpetrates the short-term gain over devotion to a long history of tireless enlightenment and mature self-evolution. For that, among those interested, it becomes essential for the few brave ones to break the bondages of modern day slavery. To think more deeply, passionately committed to rationality, less emotionally distracted and more imaginatively creative, the quest is long and cumbersome. Transforming selflessly, as opposed to regressing selfishly, escapes the imaginings of many. However, for there are resistance fighters, they struggle against the seduction of their basic essence to succumb to devolving primal subservience. Hedonistic tendencies for immediate gratification, reinforced by the greediness of cognitive prejudices, retaliate and demean in ways that stifle personal liberation. Fame and fortune, in metaphorical glory, sell the ""American Dream"" as though the social systems are not rigged or otherwise manipulated. Yet, for the pathology of the decadent few, who control the majority of wealth and resources, as though human value is cheap, replaceable and easily restocked, that fantasy remains. Illusions of the status quo are kept in place and out of reach for most people, as the contrivances are persistent. Self-indulgent inclinations, or proclivities, whatever the designation still reside within the power and control of the individual to freely choose subsequent actions. Of an earlier comment, based on many years of professional observation, investigative application and contemporary research, analytic capacity for profound mindfulness, critical thinking by way of logical analysis, appears elusive across the broad expanse of society. On this point, a number of studies indicate regressive processes by which the populace is devolving intellectually. Prone to increasing emotional reactivity, reasoning in reality transitions to a lesser capacity for more insightful assessment based on evidence. On the part of many people, the inability to apply serious and enlightened introspection, by well-reasoned logic and mature analysis as applied to current social issues continues to be woefully inadequate. In close proximity by ideation and formulation, most refuse the strenuous exertion of laborious self-revolution. For one to look with passionate forthright authenticity in constant examination of the self, the effort expended pales in competition with the tumultuous onslaught of self-exaltation. Immediate gratification takes precedence. Although the complexity defies simplistic delineation or easy solvability, the dismal perspective of it all yields little prospects for productive change. Probably of sadder degree than disappointment, or even regrettable disenchantment, is the permissiveness of selfish behaviors. These of course come in many forms and forums, from intolerance of free speech, to the con artistry of commerce and industry, as well as associated political processes.  The divisive self-interests of the few perpetrate illogical misguidance and distrust among the many by multiple societal processes. This of course does not mean a person cannot resist by purposeful assertion of individuation through exercise of willful liberation. On the contrary, resistance is not futile. One can oppose the foolish juvenile behaviors of those who feel entitled to their self-appointed lofty status within the social layers of society. To do so means profoundly determined efforts to assure personal differentiation from the nonsense. Innovations and creativity of thought and action are essential to self-evolution. In contrast, stupidity in selfishly pursuing the constraints of the many, for the assurance of conformity, under the illicit power and control of others, reflects intentional choices. Fraudulent contrivances ought to be exposed for the bogus conjectures that emanate from that. Aside from the ""pandemic of the stupidity virus"", which crosses all socio-economic and political spectrums, those of greater means have the advantage over those of lesser influence, power and sustainability. As such, the smug piety of the oligarchic pinnacle is such that insulation becomes protective in the negation of greatest good for the greatest number. The blatant pathology of the few, with linkages to the willful perpetration of selfish maladaptive and anti-societal intentions, expresses a sense of social disparagement against those of lesser means. In this regard, to ""form a more perfect union"", ""establish justice"", or ""promote the general welfare"", no longer seems relevant. The idea of ""domestic tranquility"" appears to apply to the safe, stale and secure enclaves of ""gated"" entitlements, rather than purposeful actions to ensure broader equality. With all the wealth concentrated in an increasingly smaller niche, the reach of inequality burrows deeper. In one study of ""wealth oriented behavior"", from a major west coast university, those in the higher realms of materiality tend to disregard the interests of those at the lower social levels. Seemingly, less generous, not as prosocial, seeking to safeguard the status quo, and minimal empathy for those who have not ""made it"", characterizes the growing divide between upper and lower echelons of society. With all the affluent power, control of the majority of resources, at least economic disparity should have vanished."
7,The Wiener Theory – Human Devolution Query,news-society," Meanwhile, in the adventures of the pseudosciences, an interesting proposition rises with stiffened resolve to take notice of post-modern maladaptive behaviors. With a turgid state of insistence, the unrelenting willfulness for actors in the social mainstream to act in stupid ways invites the speculation of the Wiener Theory. What is a wiener? More than a frankfurter or a Vienna sausage? Simply a hot dog? Actually much more than that, as the Wiener Theory is summoned to confront the rapid spread of social stupidity. Metaphorically speaking of course, will due deference to the few who persevere toward self-evolution, the social descriptor applies to the devolving state of human affairs. In particular, the insidious antics of cultural regression is prime for the symbolic reference of the ‘weeny"". So many fun and fascinating applications come to bear on the condescending proclivities rampant juvenile narcissism. While opinions may vary, and they will, any typology or description is arguable. As such, the concept of ""narcissism"" raises the possibilities of a number of critiques. For the Wiener Theory, this distinction most likely applies more than several other descriptors, which may or may not be considered so called ""personality disorders"". As to that, briefly stated, philosophical perspectives, absent scientific validation, fall short of technical authenticity. In the pseudosciences, or ""social studies"" arena, as in criminology, psychology, sociology and theology, opinion driven conjecture is always subject to critical analysis. With the Wiener speculation, the suggestion is that a person behaves with intentional and premeditated purposes. To this, the classical school of criminology enters the discourse and particularly with regard to the broader scheme of the Gonzo Theory. Behavior is a matter of free will based on rational thinking and subsequent cost-benefit analysis by the perpetrator. A utilitarian doctrine, the conceptualization is one in which a lucent process of thinking renders freely made choices. Aside from the howling, screaming and yelling of dissenters, rational decision making for maladaptive actions is neither abnormal nor suggestive of a ""personality disorder"". In the viewpoint of one author of a college criminology text, perpetrators of an offensive act, select targets of opportunity, based on gain minus risk, to maximize their advantage of others. As a metaphorical subset to the overall framework of Gonzo Theory, the Wiener concept identifies several substrata of ""antisocial"" members of the human species. To digress for the moment, as used here, the so-called ""antisocial"", ""psychopathic or sociopathic"" and ""narcissist"" personality types merge into a mental matrix of profound selfishness. For the incessant self-centeredness of exaggerated personal worthiness, a more consolidated perspective warrants a unitary configuration. This of course will no doubt provoke some in the pseudoscience arena to gasp, feel agitated and experience an altered state of consciousness. Regardless though, the issue is not about defining behavioral inclinations with extraordinary specificity or clinical sufficiency. Instead, the intention is to call notice to purposeful illicit behaviors that intentionally inflict harm on others. In this context, probably more relevant than other descriptors, the common feature of condescending attitudes reflects in the conceptualization of ""narcissism"". Using the narcissistic reference, the ""wiener idea"" conjures an intentional motivation on the part of perpetrators to act in selfish ways. As to this speculation, there is a broad spectrum of premeditated inflictions evident in modern society. Accordingly, in one online archive, depicting definitional criteria from the primary reference material of the psychiatric industry, a possible label or construct might be useful. This relates to the theoretical configuration of something called ""narcissism"". Acting, being and otherwise exhibiting oneself as a wiener could be ascribed this speculative notion. A grandiose intention for self-aggrandizement, purposeful application of subjective validation for self-importance, and selfish inclinations come into play. On a smaller scale, outside the ""fixation fantasies"" of politicians in general, reduce the comparison to modern academia. To that, take the typical faulty meeting. Observe carefully the mixture of pretentious portrayals of credentials. Note the chasm between the real hardcore scientists (biology, chemistry, physics and physiology, etc.), and the softcore or pseudoscientists (criminology, psychology, sociology and theology). The former are scientists, the latter are philosophers. This of course, produces instant emotional reactivity among the nonscientists. Regardless, there are wieners in both groups. Yet, upon closer inspection, it appears the pseudoscientists, some of whom are serious wannabes, are quite indignant if their school of thought is not treated as a ""real science"". After all, they assume they have all the answers to the mysterious questions of human behavior. This brief illustration goes to the point in part that being a wiener also reflects ideological perversities. As to the cause and effect notation, ""wienerism"" fluctuates along a human continuum of self-indulgence and presumed entitlement. Next faculty, as a side note, observe who needs to ask the most questions, or raise irrelevant issues, especially when it is time to end the meeting. Now compare ""wienerism"" to the neediness of unwarranted admiration or self-validation. Being a ""dick"" can be complicated to explain to the totality of the intricate components. Politicians so easily fall into the realm of the wiener. So prevalent during election season is the grandiose sense of self-importance. With the advent of millennials entering politics, it gets comical. Not in every case or situation, as there are always exceptions to generalizations, but the egoistic fixations of ""beauty and brilliance"" shines through. Their political role-play fantasies pervade the prime time news with their pretense to entitled ascendency. Exaggerated claims of ""open borders"", ""immigration reform"", free college education, or easing student debt, and so on, reflect the narcissistic condescension of smug disregard for the voting public. The overwhelming desire to be seen as the one who knows everything, the person to connect with, and the extraordinary fixer of complex problems, speaks volumes of insatiable self-promotion. Deeper the probing query delves to the far reaches of dogged idyllic sense of entitlement. For the American political aristocracy, assumption of privileged anointing passes from one generation to the next. Offspring sometimes assume they are next to enter the political realm. It is their turn now to ""feel the call"" to public service. It is something they felt they had to do for the betterment of humankind. Yet, only elected office will do, absent of course, any prior real-world education, experience, training or rough and tumble exposure to reality. Conceit tries to hide deceit. As entitled nobility, superficiality knows few limits. Likewise, accountability for things said and done, no matter how illicit, ought to be excused because the American people need them.  Conventional laws, rules, codes of conduct, and so forth may or may not apply, as these things could get in the way of ""getting things done"". Outlandish and lavish displays of personal relevance portrays the dynamics of someone who needs a lot of personal attention. Although politics is a good source of entertainment for the many dicks clamoring for validation, other walks of like have plenty of dicks. From Hollywood celebrities, to Wall Street financiers, the hot dog stand is alive and well cooked. In particular, movie stars and movie wannabes have ample representation among the film industry’s elite. There is a walking talking wiener everywhere. Talk shows, radio and television news sources present a cast of characters, in which some of them provide active portrayals of wienership. Nothing is completely safe. Incongruous rhetorical hyperbole flaunts fraudulent conjecture in place of rationally meaningful discourse. Exaggeration, overstatement, and embellishment beyond reason permeates the news and social media to the extreme. For those who indulge in such babbling, it is yet another characteristic of being a wiener. Exposed to someone being a dick seems to be a frequent encounter. In every venue of public experience, whether working, shopping, recreating, or movie going, there is a high probability of an occurrence of the wiener theory. With so many people playing the role of the ""offended"", just being a dick, exposure is very likely. As to an informed and logical interactive discourse, it is as though I.Q.’s have slumped like a downturn in the stock market. Probably more significant than intelligence quotients is the perceived maturity level. As one writer put it, American society appears characterized by increasing expressions of ""infantile narcissism"". With adult children, sometimes it is extremely challenging to engage in a profoundly intellectual conversation. For that matter, simply to expect a grownup level of mature civil behavior on the part of those who appear to be adults. Concerning one writer’s perspective in observing mainstream culture, a kind of ""regression to infantile"" behavior appears widespread. Such is the expression of some, particularly in the college environment to be hypersensitive and emotional in child-like ways. To have safe places, insulated from harsh realities of the real world, devolves to self-indulgent regression. Likewise, an exaggerated sense of self, especially at a juvenile level, underlies the intentional contrivances to promote and advance one’s personal agenda. As a perpetual selfie of self-promotion, attention-getting antics look for opportunities to exploit on personal ""victimization"". Whatever gambit they are playing, the wiener, or the dick, sometimes standout. He or she will be the person most likely the loudest, outlandish or provocative in a crowd. In a sense, on a very base level of expression, the ""hot dog"" needs validation. From a variety of sizes, shapes and backgrounds, for the satiation of personal insecurity, validation is important. From a simplistic and unimaginative perspective, they want to be noticed in ways very similar to most politicians in general. Within the scheme of thinking, often contriving deception of themselves, there are the mystical notions of intense cognitive bias. With perseverance, there is the frequent flirtation with self-centered adoration of one’s imagery. For the public official the photo-op is vital, along with superficial facial expressions, shallow smile and insincere handshake. With the deceptive affect, the disingenuous flare for rhetorical hyperbole and the fixation on self-importance, the modern politician expresses a regression to infantile vanity. Like the kid who never quite got over high school graduation into the real world, the self-admiring absorption avoids the maturity of wiser differentiation. In the commentary of one online politically oriented magazine, for instance, the writer proposes the observation that modern politics is rife with examples of narcissistic behaviors. For contemporary politicians, the writer asserts the very word itself, politician, defines narcissism. Vain, conceited, and selfish, applies widely. As to that perspective, a more caustic descriptor is the symbolic reference to the wiener. Used as a condescending primal identifier, the hot-dog, the stuffed sausage, the weenie, and given the phallic shape, the dick. Alternatively, applied with a little more disdain, simply being a ""prick"".  This further suggests the calculated villainy of individuals who think they somehow are the answer to all the social and political ills of society. For them, they alone are the ones who can solve all the problems. It is their time or their turn to change the planet. Because they are so special, at least from their perspective, their ancestry, social status, political ""aristocracy"", etc., grants them certain privileges of public office ""ownership"". Admiration of self is boundless. However, the self-aggrandizement does not stop there. Subjective validation for an excessive interest in one’s political arrogance also includes speaking stupidly. Factual reality becomes overwhelmed by specious conjecture based on emotional reactivity. Objectively validated evidence is relegated a subservient role, replaced by unsubstantiated self-serving opinions. Modern politicians say idiotic things on a regular basis. More often than not, they escape accountability. Whether or not they actually believe the foolishness they regurgitate is arguable. Nonetheless, the stupidity spewed in public is nauseatingly insulting. Grotesque fallacies of inference degenerate into inconsistent hasty generalizations that defy logical explanation. In addition to the intentional ignoring of facts, with a preference for magical thinking, human wieners insist they know what is best for everyone. Even though found predominantly in politics, wieners are found in all places across the social spectrum. Where ever there a people, wieners are readily available to interfere at any given moment. They are more than willing to offer their unsolicited opinions, and promote any gossip that satisfies their advantage over others. The human hotdog relishes in the divisiveness they create by pandering to whatever advances their interests. Unfortunately, human selfishness is part of the devolving consequences for human extinction. Aside from the socio-political ramifications, the Wiener Theory has an additional sinister and debilitating aspect. According to many reference sources, but one in particular, the ""wussification of the U.S."" is the condescending and degrading vector of overly sensitive and emotionally reactive people.  Such an atmosphere is destructive and dangerous. Little social advancement is possible. As such, wussification portends toward several humanistic inclinations signaling multiple characteristics of intentional human frailty. Various descriptors come to the forefront. These include, but are not limited to, words like coward, sissy, and wimp. Yet, the underlying framework of wiener theory encompasses the diversity of individual and group shortcomings. Hidden within the recesses of a crybaby mindset is potential for horrific interpersonal inflictions. Mean-spirited, condescending and divisive, hateful and hypercritical, the social mainstream if filled with egregious displays of animosity. As to wussification, additional depictions comprise things like crybaby, pushover, wimpy, weakling, pansy and so forth. Nonetheless, the protestation against ""wimpiness"" argues that by various complicities many accept assumptions of exceptional inadequacy. Instead, a gluttonous decadence proclaims the cowardice of intentional maladaptation. The malevolence of infantile narcissism extends adolescence will into adulthood, as the Peter Pansy refuse to grow, change and mature. Applying the Wiener Theory, emasculated personalities succumb to the seductive wimpiness of anti-intellectualism in favor of emotional insecurity. Likewise, preferring a ""dumber downed"" framework of simplistic thinking, facts are replaced by fictions, as specious conjecture replaces scientific validation. Intentional gullibility persuades an indifference to logical data in the evidentiary necessity of proof, while foolish fallacies of inference pretend to be reality. Wussy politicians, political supporters, academicians and pundits, to name a few, pontificate one false narrative after another. Rather than assert a rational basis for logical discourse, many would rather rant condescending invectives toward those with whom they disagree. Cowards come in a sizes and shapes. Fraidy-cats fear the chickens they see in the reflections of themselves. Meanwhile, the regressive notions of anti-social inclinations hasten the drift toward the final exit of an infantile species. To be insulated from reality, the pains and pleasures of life, the suffering and successes, perpetuates cowardly antics that personify child-like behaviors. By protracted adolescence well into adulthood, unhealthy states of non-evolving people persist in adhering to unending states of limited intellectual capacity. The cowardly are everywhere. In a 1993 treatise on ""national cowardice"", an author ponders the erosion of self-respect and personal individuality. Instead, in contemporary America, the mere mention of something akin to ""cowardice"" finds replacement by such things as ""self-esteem"", or feeling good about oneself. Individualism, particularly as related to self-reliance, competence and perseverance, appear permanently damaged. Regressing with each decade, the foolhardy decadence of ""sheep-like"" behaviors amplifies the neglect of social responsibility to ensure cultural advancement. As such, the Wiener Theory includes the accusations of a cowardly society and the subsequent betrayal of personal integrity. With that comes the debasing ingredient of purposeful stupidity. Unwise, senseless and imprudent thoughts that become voluntary actions provoking the basis for asinine actions. Acting stupid is a cheap way of evading personal responsibility and hiding from subsequent accountability. Cowards enjoy such infantile narcissism and go to great lengths to avoid growing up as mature adults. It is about being a perpetual phallic symbol. Avoiding pain and suffering, to relish in comfort and ease, absent any aspect of sacrifice, is what cowards do. Learning from good, bad and horrible experiences are parts of enlightenment as self-evolving life forms. From one source that studies human behavior, people develop by way of a diversity of exposure to sordid harsh realities. Discovery by real-world encounters assists in the development of strategies to cope with varied challenges. In today’s world, some have criticized the excessive sensitivities of many who fear being offended, threatened or otherwise challenged in any manner. In a regressive risk-avoidance culture, eventual collapse looms closer. For the weenie, under the umbrella of Wiener Theory, cowardice, stupidity and loser thinking degrades social structure. In addition, weak, timid and fearful in transforming life skills into prosocial endeavors, invites the downfall of community, society and nation. For some, America devolved into a ""nation of wimps"". Naturally, there are exceptions to wimpiness. For example, a small percentage of the population chose a different course of action. By contrast, roughly 5% of the population dared the bravery in serving community and country. This includes men and women who became first responders and joined the military. Another small percentage, say another 5%, serve valiantly in allied fields of public service. That suggests about 10%, maybe more, pursued ""anti-weenie"" exceptionality. Regardless of numbers or percentages, a sizeable majority linger in the shadowy collusions of the Wiener Theory."
8,Mera Jism Meri Merzi--Negative Feminism,news-society," Mera Jism Meri Merzi--Negative Feminism by Shahid Ali Abbasi The all-pervasive notion of Mera Jism Meri Merzi in Pakistan needs a deep and careful analysis. On the surface. it looks simple and gives an easy opportunity to anyone to give an opinionated comment. But in reality it’s deep and old, as old as human race itself. And I would not perhaps be fully wrong to say that it was one of the most fundamental, and strongest, arguments put forward by Satan in paradise while poisoning Eve's mind. Did Eve not practice Mera Jism Meri Merzi ideology when she ate of the fruit, against the Divine Decree? It demands a deep thinking. In this short article, I would endeavour to present to you the arguments in this regard from religious and social perspectives. To start with the religious perspective, I would briefly say that in Islam our body (jism) is not ours: it's Allah’s; it’s a sacred trust given to us by Allah that is why why we are not allowed to self harm ourselves (suicide), or even modify our body (tattoos, etc). So from Islamic perspective neither our body nor our merzi (will) is fully ours. Rather we have to use our will to understand The Divine Will and then dissolve our will into the Will of God; that’s the optimum level of will or free will (merzi) we have. Is it not outrageously blasphemous that we say it's ‘my body’ when Allah categorically says everything on the Earth, in the Heavens and in-between belongs to Him?: ""And blessed is He to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them and with whom is knowledge of the Hour and to whom you will be returned."" Quran (Surah Zukhruf, 84-85) ""To Him Belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth, and all that is between them, and all that is under the soil."" Quran (Surah Taha, 6) ""And to Him belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth; and those who are with Him are not proud to worship Him, nor do they get weary."" Quran (Surah Al Ambiya, 19) These are just a few but there are numerous other occasions in the Quran where Allah clearly and categorically claims the ownership of everything in the universe and beyond. Please beware of those who twist the interpretation to serve their purpose. It's as evident as it is. Everything, every single particle in the whole cosmic order, is Allah's Ownership, and whosoever else ""has"" anything, it is given for a certain time and thus has associated roles and responsibilities which have to be fulfilled as long as one keeps that sacred trust. This interpretation can also guide us towards the essential purpose behind creation, because the purpose can only be assigned by the owner. You change the owner, the purpose changes. If I own something then why would I let someone else allocate the purpose to it? It's like I build a beautiful house and then ask my neighbour if I should make it an orphanage, a shop, a school, a hospital or a pub! Verily, as long as the house belongs to me, it’s ‘I’ who will give it the purpose and none else. Now here comes the trick. The moment we claim the ownership of our body, we actually take the ownership of its purpose as well, and that purpose may or may not be Divine. In fact, in that case there may or may not be any intervention or inclusion of Divine whatsoever because it's ‘my’ body. This will completely displace us from the path and purpose assigned to us by our actual Creator and Owner. So the claim Mera Jism Meri Merzi is outrageously blasphemous in Islam. Let’s not confine the argument to Islam only. The relationship between the Creator and the creation is more or less similar in all religions around the globe. You name any religion, the most fundamental belief system that you will find there is that of the creation and the Creator and the subsequent relationship between the two, which then defines the roles and responsibilities of the creation towards the Creator. Now when we claim our bodies to be solely and wholly ours, we in fact split apart the whole Cosmic Order (caps mine). We separate the actual Creator and Owner from the creation and with that the creation from  the purpose of the creation. It's deep isn't it? According to all religions, the Creator created the creation to serve His Divine Purpose. I would say even the social purpose coincides with and correlates to the Divine Purpose. In other words, all the social purposes, roles and responsibilities given to us and things are there so that we could more conveniently accomplish the Divine Purpose allocated to us. As for Islam is concerned, Allah made it clear at numerous occasions in the Quran and the Hdith. Allah says, ""I created the jinn and humankind only that they might worship Me."" Surah ad-Dhariyaat, verse 56. Now those who say the body is fully there's are actually revolting against the Creator and are deviating from the purpose of the creation. So from religious perspective, Mera Jism Meri Merzi is the most Satanic belief of negating the Creator and claiming the ownership of something that is not ours. It was absolutely this very ideology preached to Eve by Satan in Paradise, causing our fall. The campaigners of this notion might give various explanations saying it's not like that but it is what it is and it is what it explicitly says on the surface and in the deep. Now the second aspect of Mera Jism Meri Merzi is sociological one. As human beings, we live together in societies, so there must be certain rules and regulations to be followed so as to peacefully coexist. But this social existence does not have any purpose exclusively of its own; it actually correlates with and facilitates the fulfillment of the very same Divine Purpose of creation. In other words, the Creator created us to fulfill a Purpose and in order to fulfill that purpose collectively and individually there has to be a certain code of life, regulations, norms, traditions, morals, ethics, etc. all of which come under the same broad principle of peaceful coexistence. The moment we shatter the Cosmic Order of the relationship between the Creator and the creation, we compromise the terms of the individual and collective behaviour. If I own my body then I will give it my personalised purpose, and that purpose can be anything. If I'm poor, I will give my body a purpose to be rich; if I am powerless, I will give my body the purpose of gaining more and more power, so on and so forth. I will in that case follow my instincts. And that will determine my overall behaviour and dealing with the people and things around me. To put it simple, suppose I buy a gun. Once I paid for the gun and bullets, it's mine and I own it, and there's no doubt about it legally, socially and religiously. But does this ownership give me the entitlement to start shooting others? After all, it's my gun so ‘I’ will give it a purpose as per my will (merzi), and why not!? No society will allow me, will it? You see how personal motif clashes with the collective one!? Now because, according to this notion, I own my body and I have the purpose to it, I will use every available resource/part/capability in it ,my hands, my legs, my mind to achieve that purpose. Where is human morality gone then? So, the ideology of Mera Jism Meri Merzi is not only Satanic and blasphemous but also socially impracticable and detrimental to a society. Somehow Mera Jism Meri Merzi is often (and wrongly) associated with women, and more particularly a very very few in Pakistan. Why is that such slogans are usually raised by a few, and ironically privileged, women only? Even the most liberal societies will put a check on individual freedom and will not allow indecency. Even the societies which are secular will say yes it is your body and your resources but there are others as well and we cannot allow you to use your personal belongings (Jism) in such a way that they cause harm, disruption, indecency or moral perversion to others (Arabic word عَوْرَة is related with things to cover). Call it Law or Common Decency. If any champion of Mera Jism Meri Merzi, campaigns were living in a cave, completely and absolutely isolated from other things and humans, it could perhaps be possible to practice Mera Jism Meri Merzi philosophy there, but NOT in a society (and by society I do not mean humans only but other animals, birds, plants, the whole environment, everything). But it was told to us by Islam 1400 years ago. So I would say to all these campaigners of Mera Jism Meri Merzi that you could be right but you are at least 1400 years late because the issues that you raise have been comprehensively and once for all addressed by Islam 1400 years ago.  The slogan of equal rights is irrelevant not only in Islamic society but any society in the world. You can only give equal rights when there are two things equal, whereas there are no two things equal in the whole universe. So instead of ‘equal’ they should say ‘just’ and that is what Islam is founded on: not ‘equal’ but ‘just’, hence justice. Here the subtle difference between rights and privileges should be kept in mind (briefly, a privilege is much higher than a right). Islam gives more privileges to women than men so I do not understand why the so-called women rights campaigners do not understand that if they get ‘equal’ rights to men, they will actually lose many they already have. Also, they confuse rights with social status. A child will have more rights if weighed against his parents’ rights but that doesn't give the child a status higher than parents. The child will still be under parents’ control. Similarly, a woman has more rights than a man but she has a status subservient to man: Allah says, ""Men are in charge of women, as Allah has made one of them superior to the other, and because men spend their wealth for the women; so virtuous women are the reverent ones, guarding behind their husbands the way Allah has decreed guarding; and the women from whom you fear disobedience, (at first) advise them and (then) do not cohabit with them, and (lastly) beat them; then if they obey you, do not seek to do injustice to them; indeed Allah is Supreme, Great."" (Surah Nisa, verse 34). Also, please explore women and Satan, auret aur sheitan…. So, such women should deeply read the status of women in Islam. Islam not only gives rights to women but rather gives privileges to them. The idea of equality is the most absurd one (not today’s topic though). Nature does not run on the principle of equality but on the principle of justice because there are no two thing equal in the whole cosmos. And that justice can only be assessed and then dispensed according to the purpose of the Creation. You name anything under the sun that does not fit in the Cosmic Divine Order dictated by Allah. Everything has a purpose and all things collectively have one Purpose, and that is what Allah the Creator has set, not us. So even sociologically, the philosophy of Mera Jism Meri Merzi  threatens and undermines the very existence of life on this planet. So, to conclude, I would humbly suggest you all to think deep and relate the creation with the Creator according to whatever religion or philosophy you follow. That will clarify your understanding of the purpose of creation of the things, and their roles and responsibilities thereafter. Once we have that clear understanding, we will then be able to interpret an combat this Satanic philosophy and many others like this.

9,The Town That Was Washed Away: 8 Years After The Great Tohoku Earthquake (a photo essay),news-society," In the North-Eastern part of Honshu (Japan’s largest main island) lies Miyagi, a prefecture that was devastated by the Great Tohoku Earthquake of March, 2011. March 11th, 2011 2:46 pm JST I was in the office. In the afternoon, the earthquake hit us and it was the strongest I’d ever felt in my life. We didn’t know if we should go outside or stay inside, but we ended up taking shelter under our desks. I was scared and a co-worker of mine had a sister in Miyagi. I remember about eight of us were all on our cellphones trying to call her sister to make sure she was ok. None of our calls went through. – Satoko Tsuruta, Tokyo, Japan I was talking with my friend after school. We were about to head home when my friend received a text message from her sister, ‘There was a big earthquake. I mean a really crazy one!’ In Shiga prefecture, we didn’t feel so much as a tremor. We laughed it off and thought that her sister must’ve been exaggerating. When I got home, my parents were watching the news on TV. I remember seeing a mass of black water consume an entire town. – Anonymous, Shiga, Japan Eight Years Later I stand with a tour group in front of Okawa Elementary School in Ishinomaki, Miyagi. Rather, I stand in front of what used to be Okawa Elementary School. It lies in ruins with an eerie and heartbreaking memorial Statue of Hope erected in front of it. Flowers are periodically left in memory of the children and staff that lost their lives. A man stands in front of our group. He’s our tour guide and he’s also a father who lost his son in the tsunami. He points to an empty field behind us with a single unpaved road running through it. There used to be houses over there, he says. An entire neighbourhood. After the earthquake happened the teachers made a mistake and told the children to go home. They told them to walk to those same houses that used to stand in the fields behind you. He points to a mountain just fifty feet behind the school grounds. What they should have done was climb this mountain. We follow him behind the school and up the mountain. It only takes about 8 minutes from the school’s entrance to get to a platform about halfway up the mountain. We stare at the ruins of the school and it’s almost unbelievable how high up we were able to climb in such a short time. Just a short three-minute walk and a five-minute climb and the students would’ve been untouched by the tsunami. Some students even questioned the teachers’ decision and said that they should go to the mountain, our tour guide says. But they didn’t. They followed the teachers’ instructions. My son was one of them. I expect the man to stumble over his words or to tear up, but he doesn’t. He speaks plainly, almost like a newscaster explaining what had happened. Obviously, none of us can understand how he feels, but the thought that just a five-minute climb would’ve saved his son’s life must weigh on him every day. The man brings us into the school and it’s like a scene from an apocalypse film. We ascend the stairs and a torn page from a textbook lies on one of the steps. The walls are cracked or missing completely. The floors in the classrooms bulge like an overinflated ball. Don’t worry, he comforts us. It’s safe to walk on these floors. They rose and cracked like this because of the water pressure from when the tsunami entered the first floor. He takes us through a couple of the classrooms and a thought immediately hits me, Why are the shelves and furniture all in an upright position? Why are their books and tools in closed shelves? English practice cards ""Yes I can"" remain on the blackboard. Before I can ask the question, he gives us the answer. The desks, shelves, and chairs were put back into place by the GSDF (Ground Self Defense Force). They came here and cleared the wreckage. As a sort of memorial to the students who passed away, they cleaned all the mud off the books, supplies, and furniture and put them back into place. They wanted to preserve this place to make it look like it did before the tsunami. It’s incredibly eerie and almost unbelievable. Chairs and desks sit upright facing the blackboard, but behind them the wall of the windows are missing and we can see the mountain behind the school grounds. On the wall, a clock was returned to its original place, forever frozen at 3:37 pm. The guide tells us that numerous parents are currently pursuing a lawsuit against the school for the loss of their children. All throughout Miyagi prefecture in North-Eastern Japan, numerous coastal cities are building levees and incredibly high walls along the coast. This is of course to prevent any further damage from future tsunamis. However, one city refused to do that, and it’s the city that was completely swept away. Onagawa: The City that was Washed Away and Reborn I sit at the town’s information center with the tour group just a couple hundred feet from the coast of Onagawa Bay which spills into the Pacific Ocean. The information guide stands in front of our group and explains how the entire city was destroyed by the tsunami. Everything we see around us had been built or rebuilt within the past eight years. Almost every other city or town in the area voted to erect a large wall along the coastline to protect against future tsunamis, the guide explains. We didn’t do that. Instead, every building in the city, as well as the roads, are built five to eight meters higher than they were previously. Near the coast, the only buildings are businesses and commercial buildings. There are no residences. All the houses are built much further away at a higher elevation. Therefore, if a tsunami happens during the night, everyone will be in their homes already at a safe elevation. The guide points toward the windows at the red-bricked road in front of the information center. Additionally, the entire city was built with this red-bricked path at the center and leads all the way up to the new train station. Beyond that lies the mountain. This path was built as the city’s escape route to higher ground. So if a major earthquake were to occur during the daytime, everyone would simply exit their buildings and follow this path to safety. Their decision against building a wall surprised me, but looking out at the beautiful view of the mountains and the sea, I thought about what a pity it would be if all this were covered by a wall of stone. Their decision seemed almost defiant or rebellious, as if they refused to hide behind a wall. Instead, they found a way to preserve the beauty of their city while intelligently designing it in a way to keep everyone as safe as possible. Bouncing Back What amazed me most about Miyagi was its people and their ability to persevere through rough times. Most people would pick up and move to a safer area and never turn back again. However, that is not the case for numerous Miyagi residents. Numerous cities and small towns are working hard to rebuild, repopulate, and increase their tourism economy. Onagawa Aside from new construction policies and designing the town with safety as a first priority, the citizens are trying their best to return Onagawa to its former glory. The government is trying to promote their town and its newly built residential areas to bring more residents back to the area. Due to the severity of the damage from the tsunami, many survivors have never returned and others are hesitant to live anywhere near the coasts of Japan. No matter the amount of donations and government funds the city receives, there is only one thing that can truly revive Onagawa: people. Whether it be former residents returning to once again live in their hometown or new residents looking to find an affordable home in rural Japan, Onagawa needs people to populate it. The same could be said for all of the areas in Miyagi that were devastated by the earthquake. Seapal Pier Due bring attention to the area and boost the city’s economy, a brand new shopping area was built, as well as other tourist attractions. The Seapal Pier is a beautiful outlet shopping center only a 2-minute walk from the train station which has a beautiful view of the ocean and surrounding mountains. Numerous souvenir shops, clothing stores, and shops featuring handmade goods give the shopping center a nice and unique variety. Hama Terrace The Hama Terrace within the Seapal Pier functions as a town market. Visitors can often witness the process of drying nori (seaweed) and fish outside the shops. Inside Hama Terrace, visitors can grab a bite from one of the many restaurants and izakayas within the food court area. Those looking for unique souvenirs can choose from an abundance of nori, dried fish, pickled fish, and other seafood products exclusive to the area. An Onsen in a Train Station Onagawa Onsen Yupopo is quite possible the only onsen in Japan that is located within a train station. The first floor of Onagawa Station is a regular train station, the second floor holds the onsen and the third floor is an observatory. Onagwa Onsen Yupopo advertises that its bathwater which is hypotonic alkaline hot spring water with a pH of 8.8 has beneficial moisturizing effects for your skin. Ishinomaki From Okawa Elementary School, a total of 74 students and 10 school staff members lost their lives on that tragic day. While nothing could ever replace those that lost their lives in the tsunami, 23 families of the victims are currently in the middle of a lawsuit against the school board and local authorities. The lawsuit was originally filed in 2014 and the city of Ishinomaki was ordered to pay around 1.4 billion yen (roughly 13 million USD) in damages. In 2018 the city decided to appeal the high court ruling. Despite that tragedy, the city has been rebuilding and the remaining citizens have been trying their best to heal. Levees and large walls are being built around the coast to protect against future tsunamis. Ishinomaki is also trying to boost tourism in the area. While the area is secluded, it is also one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever been to. From the lush mountains, cool, fresh air, and breathtaking views of the sea, Miyagi is one of the most beautiful places in Japan. There are many mountains to hike and beaches to relax or swim in. As part of a tourism focus group, we were shown the Japanese version of Southern Hospitality. The people of Miyagi were some of the kindest people I’ve ever met. Of course, outside of Tokyo, English speaking Japanese people are few. However, in Miyagi I was shown how kindness and hospitality can overcome language barriers. Many of the people in the group could speak no Japanese at all. However, observing them interact with the locals and Ryokan (traditional Japanese inn) staff taught me that you don’t need to know the words coming out of someone’s mouth to communicate things like gratitude and even simple requests. In Ishinomaki, we were taken on a boat tour to catch uni (sea urchin) with local fishermen. Not only did we catch the uni ourselves with long hooks and fishnets, the fishermen cracked them open for us and urged us to try eating uni fresh out of the shell. To be honest, the idea of eating raw seafood freshly caught didn’t exactly appeal to me, especially at 10 o’clock in the morning. However, I knew this was a chance I’d likely never get again. I took the slimy uni meat out of the fisherman’s likely dirty hands and shoved the luscious orange delicacy in my mouth, trying not to think about it. While the presentation of the meal was admittedly poor, the uni itself was incredibly delicious. The rich taste is hard to explain, but it is like a cross between fish and cheese. The ryokan we stayed at was clean with modern amenities like Western-style toilets and in-room air conditioning, but at the same time, it felt incredibly traditional. We were treated to fresh seafood and other delicious Japanese foods for breakfast and dinner, which we ate in a traditional Japanese tatami room. As well, one big plus side of staying in Ishinomaki is that it is a short, 30-minute or so drive to Matsushima. The islands of Matsushima are one of the most popular sightseeing spots in Japan. The boat tours are affordable and definitely worth it. Matsushima has its own shrine and numerous local delicacies to enjoy. How You Can Help It was truly inspiring to see how these communities were not wallowing in despair or trying to run away to a safer place. The people of Miyagi are resilient and kind-hearted despite what they’ve been through. When people hear about disasters like The Great Tohoku Earthquake, often the first reaction is to send donations. However, sometimes the best way to help these areas recover is not to send your money. One of the best ways to help is to enjoy yourself by visiting the area, staying in their hotels, and enjoying their food and sightseeing spots. Instead of donating your money to the local government or NPO groups, spend your money by visiting these areas and boost their tourist economy. Sometimes the best advertising is word-of-mouth, and helping these areas appeal to tourists is a great way to help them create a sustainable source of income and rebuild."
10,Nicolle Stinson is called to Ministry,news-society," I recently published ""Girl Let's Read Your Bible Notes"" which is for sale on Amazon.  Many people were shocked when this was published and when the sales sky rocketed. I, Nicolle Stinson, have been questioned, how could this have happened.  My answer? God.  Although I continue to hear doubt from many, I decided that sharing my testimony and my calling may encourage and explain and possibly benefit another. So here goes. My Spiritual Journey: Hello, my name is Nicolle Stinson, and here is the story of my spiritual journey. I live in upstate New York and have lived there all my life.I am a wife to a wonderful man. I am a mom of four grown daughters and one 5 year-old daughter. I currently work in web development from home.  My husband works full time and we enjoy camping together in the summer and are very active in our local church and in our community. My Youth: I grew up in a home that didn’t speak of church.  I was introduced to Jesus through a church group in school and accepted Him as my savior.  My childhood was troubled from the age of 11, however, as my parents divorced and my mother worked most of the time.  One day, at one of the church groups at school, a church worker had told me I hadn’t colored my picture well enough.  That was the beginning of me believing the lies of the enemy.  I began to be very insecure and believe I wasn’t good enough.  As my teen years came, I covered my insecurities with partying and boys. Finding Jesus Again : Into adulthood: I had four children, 3 failed marriages and thought a successful career would prove to the world that I wasn’t a mess.  Still, I felt empty.  One day, while I was working an overtime shift, my babysitter took my children to a church youth group and they came home excited. Over a few weeks their excitement became contagious and I ventured into the church.  That was it.  Jesus grabbed me by the heart and my prodigal journey ended. Another prodigal journey: I soon learned that sin can sometimes have a very firm grip on you.  I gave in to the enemy again and did not fully surrender to Jesus.  Another decade came of abusing alcohol, drugs, my family.  I even hurt members at church.  I was hurting people because there was so much pain in me and I couldn’t make it go away.  Rock bottom came.  I agreed to unethical decisions in my career in exchange for a large monetary bonus.  I told myself it was ok since no one was getting hurt.  The end result?  An arrest.  Public shame.  Guilt.  Days of crying out to God because I had no where left to go. God called me : One day, I had been up all night and had decided to walk with my 3-year-old to the convenience store around the block to get her breakfast and myself a coffee.  The store was right past the church.  As I was walking past the church, something made me stop and I clearly heard ""Go inside"".  I was so tired from not sleeping I simply shook my head and tried to keep walking.  I took another step and again heard the voice as clearly as the last time, ""Go inside"".  I said out loud.  ""I can’t.  And again, I heard ""Go inside"".  I then told my daughter ""We have to go in the church"".  She just happily agreed.  I went in and felt so welcome and peaceful.  I made amends with each person I hurt and my prodigal journey ended that day. Since then I have had an undeniable hunger for God’s Word.  I have a new found understanding of His Word and my walk with Him is new and I am finally free. On Christmas Eve, I was called to ministry.  I was not sure at first the type of ministry as I was just given ""return"".  After much prayer and contemplation, I am now aware that I am called to exhortation, the strong encouragement of women to return to God’s Word and return to their walk with God. I have since, started a women’s ministry to read and study God’s Word together over a year and encourage each other along the way. This ministry grew to 1700 members in under 2 months time! Praise God!  I also published a Bible journal that prompts you to journal your thoughts each day while reading your Bible. This is not something I would have ever imagined doing. God has been moving in my life each day since I surrendered to Him! My Spiritual Journey Leads to a Pursuing Life Coach Certificate at CLI : I find myself more and more joyful each day, waking with a desire and hunger for God.  I also have a new found love for encouragement.  I now have words for others that I have never had before.  A Life Coach Certificate from CLI will be beneficial to me as it will further help me in my dream and hope for others to be ever uplifted in their walk with the Lord. Reflecting God in My Life: pray each day for God to open my heart and open my eyes to His will for me.  I am living my life for today and with great hope for the future.  I know God will provide all that I need and CLI will be part of my path."
11,"The Least Worse Presidential Candidate? Trump, Biden, Sanders, Warren, Yang, Buttitieg, Bloomberg?",news-society," It is widely known the upcoming 2020 Presidential election will be the most important election in our generation. President Trump, isn't exactly earning the approval of the majority of Americans and the Democratic Party does not have a front-running Presidential candidate. As a result, the next president will NOT be a candidate with the majority of American votes. There will be more Americans who did not vote for the next President than Americans who did. Yet, we Americans must pick one candidate to fill the open job position of POTUS. Sadly, our goal will be to vote for a candidate who is the least worse of the bunch. Below are our options. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP - Trump is the most polarizing president in our lifetime. We know what has happened to the country since his election -- hatred towards immigrants, promotion of racism, justification of white nationalists, and sports teams refusing to go to the White House. Trump isn't responsible for all these dark things, but he sure is an influential figure. You just have to look at his rallies to realize 99% of those in attendance look like each other. Trump is the American version of Hitler. JOE BIDEN - The real reason why Biden is running for president is to get Trump out of office. His main skillset on his resume is that he once knew Barack Obama. If Biden becomes president, our whole society takes a step back to the year 2008. Biden even said it himself, ""Nothing will change"" if he becomes president. So, if Biden becomes president, he's going to take naps and slack off and our country will too. He'll need the extra naps because he can't form a complete sentence anymore. Biden should have retired the same time Obama did. BERNIE SANDERS - Anyone who wants to use the Wealth Tax to fund his or her promises, should automatically be disqualified from being a President. Even an idiot can Google, ""Does Wealth Tax Work?"" to find out this wealth tax doesn't work. You can forget about FREE College. You can forget about the Single-Payer Healthcare because no one in Congress wants to work with this guy and no American wants to pay extra taxes for it. Sanders want Billionaires to be the ""Bad"" guys. This is a political move because 99.9% of you American voters are poor suckers who are not billionaires. Sanders is loud and obnoxious and a lot of his supporters are of the same mold. Sanders supporters are as toxic as Trump supporters. If Sanders become president, he will become the Democratic version of Trump. ELIZABETH WARREN - Her idiotic plan to pay for ""Medicare for All"" pretty much ruined her chances to be President. We know she can't come up with good solutions but we do know she's a good liar. From claiming she is Native American to get perks, to saying she was fired from her job for being pregnant (when in reality she wasn't qualified to be a full-time teacher), to claiming Sanders said a women can't be president, to using the victim-card... we absolutely can't trust this woman to be president. Although it would be nice to have a women as US President, Warren should not be the one, she will just make all women look bad. ANDREW YANG - Why would anyone trust an Asian man who wants to give us all $1000/month? That seems to be too good to be true. This Yang guy looks like someone who should be our enemy, a Communist Chinaman. Yang claims the government can fund this by taxing tech companies with the VAT tax. I have done the MATH and realistically, Yang can only get the funding to give us about $750/month. That's less than what Yang promises. But hey, that's still $750 more than what any other politician is willing to give us. PETE BUTTITIEG - Mayor Pete is a smooth talker with witty comebacks and lots of wine to drink. He says he can bring the country together. But he can't even bring his little city in Indiana together. It's troublesome when black protestors show up at your rallies. It's just as troublesome when white people also protest at your rallies because you take money from billionaires. When your support group is mainly rich white folks, you're going to be hated on bad. He's not even President yet and he's got the same protestors like Trump. Pete is the candidate who is least likely to unite the country. MICHAEL BLOOMBERG - If you're sick and tired of seeing Bloomberg on TV you're not the only one. When a billionaire has enough money to make himself look good on TV commercials, he's going to stuff it down your throat. What is his reason to run for President? It's not for you, it's for his ego. It's to fight against the billionaire-hating politicians like Sanders and Warren. Bloomberg does a good job of hiding behind his commercials because if he attends a debate, his bad track record as mayor will be exposed. You will see another one of his ads during the Super Bowl - this will be a good time to go for a potty break. Who should I vote for? Or should I even vote at all?"
12,BookMARKlove Charity program by a group of  international exchange students from University of Malaysia (UKM),news-society," Eleven international exchange students in Bachelor of Business Management were involved in the program at the UKM's Faculty of Economics and Management. It is a new experience for international exchange students to learn about corporate social ethics in a business that is not just about the customer or the paper, but also involved in environmental conservation. Head of the Program, Muhammad Fakhrullah Nor Azmin, said the program was part of a project for the subject of Ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility.The program was also assisted by our lecturer, Dr Shifa Binti Mohd Nor. The US, Japan and the Britain are the three biggest plastic waste exporters to Malaysia, accounting for 53% of the 754,000 tonnes of plastic waste the country imported from January to July 2018. ""Malaysia has become the world's rubbish bin,"" Greenpeace Malaysia public and engagement campaigner Heng Kiah Chun said during the launch of the report on Tuesday (Nov 27). Working with Kuala Langat Environmental Protection Association (KLEPA), Greenpeace Malaysia's investigation of plastic recycling factories in Kuala Langat found plastic waste from over 19 countries. The report found that between January to July, Malaysia imported 754,000 tonnes of plastic, equivalent to approximately 100,000 large elephants. It said based on global data, the remaining 12% of plastic waste are incinerated and 79% end up in landfills or dumped in natural environment. Housing and Local Government Minister Zuraida Kamaruddin had said in Parliament that plastic waste processing business is a RM30bil industry that cannot be ignored. KLEPA president Tan Ching Hin said the illegal plastic recycling factories are producing solid waste, and its water pollution has forced fish and prawn farms to stop operations. Tan said villagers are developing chronic respiratory diseases from the open burning of unrecyclable waste. He said these factories, mostly illegal facilities owned by Chinese companies, mainly hire foreign workers. In its report, Greenpeace Malaysia welcomes the government's decision to permanently ban the import of plastic waste but urge for stronger policies to also control the import of clean plastic waste. ""This is not a Malaysian problem, it is a global problem,"" Heng said. Greenpeace Malaysia recommends that instead of fixing the plastic waste imports regulations, the government should encourage domestic recycling industry and promote circular economy. On a global scale, Greenpeace Malaysia said all countries should legislate policies to end the use of single-use plastics. So, what we decided to create to be able to address this issue of recycling while also making something useful was bookmarks. Bookmarks partly made out of recycled materials which were found in anywhere. The pamphlets, leftover pieces of fabric and single use plastics that would otherwise be thrown in the trash without being reused is now getting to good use. The bookmarks we created together were then sold on the Faculty of Economics and Management (FEP) at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM)  with its students as the target customer at the. cost of RM1-RM5. There is a good reason for choosing bookmarks as our object to sell for this project as it, besides from the recycling, also promotes reading to the students of UKM. Our group planned to utilize the earned profit from the bookmark to help the Faculty of Economics and Management(FEP) in University kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) staff by buying and giving a free food for them. Giving free food to cleaner staff who working at UKM is never a bad idea. Everyone needs food, otherwise how are we meant to survive? If we don't have food to keep us moving and staying healthy its not possible to work and make a living for ourselves and our families. Everyone should have the right to live a healthy life . Cleaner staff in FEP take care of  facilities and carry out cleaning and maintenance duties. The goal is to keep FEP building in a clean and orderly condition. A clean study enviroment has far-reaching effects both on the teachers and learners.The most important benefit of a clean study enviroment is the fact that it maximizes the learning experience of the students."
13,Europe suffers from excessive care on the part of the U.S.,news-society," Historically, the U.S. perceives the EU as a developing organization which needs guidance and advice. Though just a few years ago Europe seemed more united and found consensus more easily, the United States managed to influence the European politics easier. Everything has changed. Europe ""has grown out of children’s clothing"" and has become a serious organization capable of making informed decisions by itself. As soon as France, Germany or any other European country starts to oppose the U.S. and express alternative opinion, Washington doesn’t tolerate this. It uses all available means to keep control over Europe, thus making tensions in Europe even harder. One of such tools to manipulate the European states is ""give something to get what you need later."" Washington gives support (financial, political or military) some European countries consider very precious, usually in exchange of their loyalty to all U.S. decisions. This gained loyalty allows the U.S. to defend its interests not only in Europe, but in other world regions either. Let’s make some examples. U.S. lawmakers announced an agreement on Monday on a $738-billion bill setting policy for the Department of Defense, including new measures for competing with Russia. In particular, it included sanctions on companies helping Russia’s gas giant Gazprom to complete the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project in the National Defense Authorization Act for the U.S. defense in 2020. Russia is building the pipelines to bolster supply to Europe while bypassing Ukraine, and members of Congress have been pushing the Trump administration to do more to stop the projects. Serious political tension is rising among the European countries relating this issue. Some European Union member states, including Germany do not sacrifice national economic interests from realization the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project to please the U.S. and strictly oppose the U.S. sanctions. The route will traverse the territorial waters through the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of five countries including Russia, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Germany. Chairman of the Bundestag Committee on Economics and Energy Klaus Ernst even called the US sanctions against the Nord Stream 2 AG project ""contrary to international law."" Ernst emphasized that the United States should not be bothered by the way in which Germany ""shapes its energy policy."" At the same time, Ukraine, Poland, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania oppose the construction. Latvia and Lithuania call it political. In reality, they just support the U.S. in exchange of its military help. The matter is these countries highly depend on Washington in defense issues and consider the U.S. and NATO (where the U.S. is the leader) the only guarantee of their security in case of war with Russia. Europe is forced to be obliged to the U.S. And Washington strengthens its military presence in Europe to consolidate the status of defender. A massive military exercise in Europe DEFENDER-Europe 20 involving 20,000 U.S.-based troops will take place soon in Europe. Even the name of the exercise speaks for itself. It is the largest deployment of U.S.-based forces to Europe for an exercise in the last 25 years. The U.S. military unit, which employs more than 500 land force troops with heavy equipment – about 30 Abrams tanks, more than 20 infantry combat vehicles and other equipment have already arrived to Lithuania. The more so, it is well known that the U.S. demonstrates in every way its commitment to the Baltic States’ defence and provides these countries with military equipment and arms. Thus the Baltics have no other choice but to support any US decisions. Such behavior, in its turn, makes tension among the EU member states stronger and does not strengthen relations, but leads to a further split in the EU. Europe suffers from excessive care on the part of the U.S., but the ""log-rolling"" model is in action. Europe became a bargaining chip in the confrontation between Russia and the U.S."
14,"How to Properly Insult a Democrat- Voters Guide for GenXYZ, Millennials and some Boomers too.",news-society," If you have an overwhelming desire to control our climate, vote Democrat. But can you really predict the climate when our planet is spinning at 1000 MPH, revolving around the sun at 67,000 MPH, moving through our galaxy at 515,000 MPH and our galaxy moving through space at 1,300,000 MPH? And you want to tell us anything we should take seriously about the climate decades from now? We're busy hanging on for dear life as it is. Google it. If you love Donkeys, vote Democrat, but as the Democrat party falls apart after the 2020 sweep, now even more bad news arrives.""Half the world's donkey population could be killed amid surge in demand for Chinese medicine"". I have an idea. Every Democrat in the country should adopt a Donkey. Since you voted for a BUTT you should be perfectly comfortable living with one. Since global warming causes global cooling which causes global warming which causes global cooling, vote Democrat. With the unprecedented cold headed this way that's exactly what you are going to hear from the MSM. Now, try and convince yourself that you understand what they're saying, and even more importantly that they understand what they're saying. You don't. They don't. Oh yeah. Let's get rid of fossil fuels so you feel what frostbite feels like. OMG, Venice Italy is underwater. It's sinking. Know what else is sinking? The DNC, Impeachment, Democrat Fundraising, Adam Schiff's poll numbers, and Top Brass in the Interagency Group {NSA, CIA, FBI... }. Venice was built on a Swamp. Sound Familiar? So vote Democrat, then get the first flight out to Venice. The Democrat Party better get themselves a new Swamp to live in 'cause this one's gonna be 'Closed for Repairs'. Since you believe in global warming, vote Democrat, but here's some really disappointing news. The science, that's right, science and mathematics of prediction proclaim that all predictions are unreliable 3-5 years out and thus global warming predictions are by definition unusable, useless, misleading and dangerous. Climate predictions being the equivalent of a monkey throwing darts; no offense to monkeys. If you're a victim, vote Democrat. But here's the truth. Minority status does not = Victim. Majority status does not = Predator. Democrat-inspired Paranoia and lack of historical perspective drive most people to the Democrat Party. I guarantee should you change party affiliation, your paranoia will immediately disappear because you will be part of the Silent Majority. See how easy that was?"
15,U.S and World News Headlines,news-society," There's a mole on Mars that's making NASA engineers tear their hair out. No, they haven't discovered a small, insectivorous mammal on the red planet. The mole vexing engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena is a scientific instrument known as the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, or HP3 — or just ""the mole"" — carried on NASA's InSight probe that landed on Mars a year ago. ""The mole is designed to measure heat flow coming out of the interior of Mars,"" says Troy Hudson, InSight's instrument system engineer. Scientists are interested to know how much heat is still being generated inside the core of the once geologically active Mars. To do that, the mole has to bury itself about 16 feet below the Martian surface so it won't be affected by daily temperature fluctuations. The mole is basically a tube about 16 inches long and an inch in diameter. It has a pointy tip and an internal hammer that works like a kind of pile driver to pound the instrument into the ground. The frustrations began last February when the digging started. Instead of going down to 16 feet, it got stuck after just 14 inches. Hudson says he and his team decided the problem was related to bouncing. Just like a gun recoils when you fire it, the mole recoiled ever so slightly every time the hammer tried to drive it into the ground. So instead of going down, it bounced in place. Some of the problem may be caused by uncertainty about the size of the grains of Martian sand. It turns out that pushing a probe into something like flour is very different than pushing it into a bowl of granulated sugar. The low pressure on Mars also changes the way the dirt behaves compared to soil on Earth.Engineers thought they might be able to prevent the bouncing if they used the scoop on InSight's robotic arm to press against the mole as it hammered. They tried that a few weeks ago — and it worked. ""For the first time in 8 months we have definite forward progress,"" Hudson told NPR at the time. But Hudson knew there was another looming problem. Eventually, the top of the mole would be flush with the Martian surface, and there would be nothing for the scoop to press against. So they came up with a new plan. ""We moved the scoop over to a different position nearby, and pushed hard on the soil, hoping that would transfer force to the mole through the soil rather than directly,"" he says.They sent instructions for the scoop to press, the mole to hammer, and for Insight's camera to record what happened. Hudson says he was horrified when he saw the pictures. ""I was very distraught,"" he recalls. The mole had backed almost half-way out of the hole, inadvertently undoing much of their progress. Hudson is pretty sure he knows what happened. Without the scoop pressing on the mole, it started bouncing again. ""When it does that, loose soil in front of the mole can infiltrate in front of the tip, filling up the space that occurs whenever it bounces,"" Hudson says. ""Then it's just bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, and more material fills in and it ends up backing out of the ground."" Hudson says he and his team are confident they can use the scoop press technique to get the mole back down to where it was. They've already made an inch and a half of progress. Once the top of the Mole is again flush with the surface, he says ""we're going to have to come up with a new way to get it underground fully and we haven't figured out exactly what we're going to do there, yet."""
16,U.S and World News Headlines,news-society," The Hollywood Park stables were quiet that night. Gail Ruffu had planned it that way. It was around midnight on Christmas Eve, 2004, days before the winter racing season would start at Santa Anita Park, about 30 miles away in the Los Angeles suburb of Arcadia. It would be easy for Ruffu, a horse trainer, to slip into the Hollywood Park stables without anyone noticing. It would be easy to find the horse she once trained, Urgent Envoy. He was in a barn just across the road from her own. She could lead him into a trailer, talk her way past a guard and drive away. And that's exactly what she did. ""I figured, whatever it takes, even if I go to jail, I have to save this horse's life,"" Ruffu said. Gail Ruffu photographed at a horse boarding barn near her home in Los Angeles in 2007. Brian Vander Brug / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images Ruffu had trained a handful of horses before, but Urgent Envoy was special. Over the previous year, she helped transform him from a dangerous rebel into a gentle athlete. It seemed he was her one shot to train a winner. If Ruffu's recollections were true, it would mean my dad had been part of a grave problem with horse racing. Since last December, 37 horses have died at Santa Anita during racing or training. The latest death came earlier this month at one of horse racing's most prestigious events, the Breeders' Cup, held this year at Santa Anita. Before a prime-time television audience, Mongolian Groom suffered a devastating leg fracture during the event's marquee race, the $6 million Breeders' Cup Classic. He was loaded onto an equine ambulance, driven away and euthanized. The spate of deaths at Santa Anita, while not out of the ordinary relative to past years at the track, has drawn renewed attention to a broader racing culture that has been decried by critics for putting profits ahead of equine health. Painkillers and performance enhancers are regularly administered to horses, critics charge, which can mask injuries and clear the way for horses that are already at risk to compete. In the case of Santa Anita, a strenuous racing schedule and the effect of unusually wet weather on the track itself may also have played a role. Last year, the sport saw 493 deaths in the United States and Canada, according to the Jockey Club's Equine Injury Database. But that number does not include deaths from injuries sustained during training. The problem is one that Ruffu has agonized over for most of her career. She says horses are raced too young, too often, too medicated and all for the prestige and payout that comes with victory. ""A million-dollar purse for one race? People are willing to throw away several dead horses trying to get that,"" Ruffu told me. ""Horse whisperer"" Ruffu and my dad weren't always enemies. They met in 1999 when Ruffu needed a lawyer. My father took her case. Ruffu had filed suit against several California horse racing entities. She had been banned from the Santa Anita, Del Mar and Hollywood Park tracks for nine months, the San Gabriel Valley Tribune reported. Her unorthodox training methods and habit of distributing flyers at the track got her in trouble. The fliers said two-year-olds were too young to race in the Breeders' Cup. A judge sided with Ruffu and she was reinstated. At the time, my dad called Ruffu a ""horse whisperer."" ""The people who are in control of the horse racing establishment don't know how to do things Gail's way,"" he told the Tribune. They parted ways amicably, and he mentioned maybe owning a horse with her someday. In 2003, an opportunity came up when Ruffu found a horse that had already injured two stablehands. ""I heard of a horse that nobody wanted because he was a bit of an outlaw,"" she laughed. ""Of course, that'd be the one for me. That's my specialty."" She called my father, Steve Haney. He brought in three other investors and together they bought the horse for $5,000. That July, they made a deal with Ruffu. They would bankroll the horse, and in return for her labor Ruffu would get a 20% stake. They renamed the horse Urgent Envoy, after his sire, Urgent Request."
17,Who really defends the Baltic States?,news-society," About 500 U.S. troops arrived in Lithuania in October. This news is widely discussed all over the Baltic States and Europe. The issue of permanent NATO presence in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia has been discussed for a decade. There is still no legal basis for this step, but NATO and Baltic authorities found the possibility to deploy troops on a long-term basis. The justification for such long deployment becomes participating in military exercises that take place almost continuously on the territory of the Baltic countries. The U.S. armed forces are among the most powerful in the world. American soldiers participated in numerous wars, operations, missions and exercises. In the U.S. military persons have a lot of preferences and substantial allowances. The occupation of a military person attracts a lot of young men, even those who have criminal records. Unfortunately, the need of military personnel enforces the authorities to turn a blind eye to the criminal history of applicants. Though some types of criminal activity are clearly disqualifying; other cases require a waiver, wherein the each service examines the circumstances surrounding the violation and makes a determination on qualification. Applicants require a waiver for enlistment. Applicants with six or more minor traffic offenses, where the fine was $100 or more per offense are required to obtain a waiver. Applicants who have three or more civil conviction or other adverse dispositions for minor non-traffic offenses are required to obtain a waiver. Felonies are the most arguable of recruitment offenses. The problem is the U.S. Armed Forces utilize their own definitions of what constitutes, for example, a felony. Examples of felony offenses include aggravated assault, arson, burglary, manslaughter, robbery, and narcotics possession. Many states allow a felony conviction to be expunged and reduced to a misdemeanor. All military branches consider felony as a disqualification, but they do make some exceptions. In recent years, it appears that the US Army has issued more waivers when we talk about percentages. Bad conduct and drug waivers in the US Army accounted for 19% of waivers issued in 2016, 25% in 2017, and over 30% in the first half of 2018. Thus, if a person receives a waiver for such cases of antisocial behavior he could be enlisted regardless of his or her criminal records. When the authorities of the Baltic States allow U.S. troops to deploy on the national territory, they even cannot imagine the possible consequences. Locals can face alcoholics, traffic offenders, brawlers and other criminals in the U.S. uniform, who even cannot be judged by national courts. And it’s a very complicated question if foreign criminals are worthy of being called defenders of the Baltic States."
18,Newsweek USA,news-society," Newsweek is an American weekly news magazine founded in 1933. Newsweek was a widely distributed newsweekly through the 20th century, with many notable editors-in-chief throughout the years. Newsweek was acquired by The Washington Post Company in 1961, under whose ownership it remained until 2010. Between 2008 and 2012, Newsweek experienced financial difficulties, leading to the cessation of print publication and a transition to all-digital format at the end of 2012. The print edition then relaunched in March 2014. Revenue declines prompted an August 2010 sale by owner The Washington Post Company to audio pioneer Sidney Harman—for a purchase price of one dollar and an assumption of the magazine's liabilities. Later that year, Newsweek merged with the news and opinion website The Daily Beast, forming The Newsweek Daily Beast Company. Newsweek was jointly owned by the estate of Harman and the diversified American media and Internet company IAC. In 2013, IBT Media announced it had acquired Newsweek from IAC; the acquisition included the Newsweek brand and its online publication, but did not include The Daily Beast. IBT Media rebranded itself as Newsweek Media Group in 2017, but returned to IBT Media in 2018 after making Newsweek independent. Founding and early years (1933–1961) News-Week was launched in 1933 by Thomas J. C. Martyn, a former foreign-news editor for Time. He obtained financial backing from a group of U.S. stockholders ""which included Ward Cheney, of the Cheney silk family, John Hay Whitney, and Paul Mellon, son of Andrew W. Mellon"". Paul Mellon's ownership in Newsweek apparently represented ""the first attempt of the Mellon family to function journalistically on a national scale."" The group of original owners invested around $2.5 million. Other large stockholders prior to 1946 were public utilities investment banker Stanley Childs and Wall Street corporate lawyer Wilton Lloyd-Smith. Under Post ownership (1961–2010) The magazine was purchased by The Washington Post Company in 1961. Osborn Elliott was named editor of Newsweek in 1961 and became the editor in chief in 1969. In 1970, Eleanor Holmes Norton represented sixty female employees of Newsweek who had filed a claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that Newsweek had a policy of only allowing men to be reporters. The women won, and Newsweek agreed to allow women to be reporters. The day the claim was filed, Newsweek's cover article was ""Women in Revolt"", covering the feminist movement; the article was written by a woman who had been hired on a freelance basis since there were no female reporters at the magazine. Edward Kosner became editor from 1975 to 1979 after directing the magazine's extensive coverage of the Watergate scandal that led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon in 1974. Richard M. Smith became chairman in 1998, the year that the magazine inaugurated its ""Best High Schools in America"" list, a ranking of public secondary schools based on the Challenge Index, which measures the ratio of Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate exams taken by students to the number of graduating students that year, regardless of the scores earned by students or the difficulty in graduating. Schools with average SAT scores above 1300 or average ACT scores above 27 are excluded from the list; these are categorized instead as ""Public Elite"" High Schools. In 2008, there were 17 Public Elites.[14] Restructuring and new owner (2008–2010) During 2008–2009, Newsweek undertook a dramatic business restructuring. Citing difficulties in competing with online news sources to provide unique news in a weekly publication, the magazine refocused its content on opinion and commentary beginning with its May 24, 2009, issue. It shrank its subscriber rate base, from 3.1 million to 2.6 million in early 2008, to 1.9 million in July 2009 and then to 1.5 million in January 2010—a decline of 50% in one year. Meacham described his strategy as ""counterintuitive"" as it involved discouraging renewals and nearly doubling subscription prices as it sought a more affluent subscriber base for its advertisers. During this period, the magazine also laid off staff. While advertising revenues were down almost 50% compared to the prior year, expenses were also diminished, whereby the publishers hoped Newsweek would return to profitability. The financial results for 2009 as reported by The Washington Post Company showed that advertising revenue for Newsweek was down 37% in 2009 and the magazine division reported an operating loss for 2009 of $29.3 million compared to a loss of $16 million in 2008. During the first quarter of 2010, the magazine lost nearly $11 million. By May 2010, Newsweek had been losing money for the past two years and was put up for sale. The sale attracted international bidders. One bidder was Syrian entrepreneur Abdulsalam Haykal, CEO of Syrian publishing company Haykal Media, who brought together a coalition of Middle Eastern investors with his company. Haykal later claimed his bid was ignored by Newsweek's bankers, Allen & Co. The magazine was sold to audio pioneer Sidney Harman on August 2, 2010, for $1 in exchange for assuming the magazine's financial liabilities. Harman's bid was accepted over three competitors. Meacham left the magazine upon completion of the sale. Sidney Harman was the husband of Jane Harman, at that time a member of Congress from California. Cessation of print format (2012) The cover of Newsweek's final print issue under The Newsweek Daily Beast Company ownership On July 25, 2012, the company operating Newsweek indicated the publication was likely to go digital to cover its losses and could undergo other changes by the next year. Barry Diller, chairman of the conglomerate IAC/InterActiveCorp, said his firm was looking at options since its partner in the Newsweek/Daily Beast operation had pulled out. On October 18, 2012, the company announced that the American print edition would be discontinued at the end of 2012 after 80 years of publication, citing the increasing difficulty of maintaining a paper weekly magazine in the face of declining advertising and subscription revenues and increasing costs for print production and distribution. The online edition is named ""Newsweek Global"". Spin-off to IBT Media, return to print and profitability (2013–2018) In April 2013, IAC chairman and founder Barry Diller stated at the Milken Global Conference that he ""wished he hadn't bought"" Newsweek because his company had lost money on the magazine and called the purchase a ""mistake"" and a ""fool's errand"". On August 3, 2013, IBT Media acquired Newsweek from IAC on terms that were not disclosed; the acquisition included the Newsweek brand and its online publication, but did not include The Daily Beast. On March 7, 2014, IBT Media relaunched a print edition of Newsweek with a cover story on the alleged creator of Bitcoin, which was widely criticized for its lack of substantive evidence. The magazine stood by its story. IBT Media returned the publication to profitability on October 8, 2014. In February 2017, IBT Media appointed Matt McAllester, then Editor of Newsweek International, as Global Editor-in-chief of Newsweek. In 2018, Newsweek journalists began reporting on their own management, after a raid by the Manhattan D.A. and the removal of servers from company offices. Columbia Journalism Review noted the probe ""focused on loans the company took out to purchase the computer equipment,"" and several reporters were fired after reporting on the issue. Spin-off to independent (2018–present) In September 14, 2018, after completing the strategic structural changes initially announced in March of the same year, Newsweek spun-off from IBT Media."

And although Angela Kelly's upbringing could not be more different from her boss's - the pair's friendship spanning decades is like no other within the Royal Family. Ms Kelly's official title is personal assistant, adviser, and curator (jewelry, insignias, and wardrobe), but behind closed doors, she is more importantly a trusted confidante, friend and almost like a sister to the Queen. The pair love nothing more than having a natter over a cup of Darjeeling tea at Ms Kelly's cosy grace-and-favour Windsor home, gifted to her by the Monarch. And it is said that when the Queen tells staff she is ""stepping out for a bit"" it is actually royal code for her popping to see Ms Kelly. When together, they can be heard down the corridors roaring with laughter. They discuss ""everything and anything"" from treasured grandchildren and great-grandchildren to new ranges of make-up. ""We are two typical women,"" Ms Kelly told The Telegraph in a rare interview in 2007. ""We discuss clothes, make-up, jewellery. We say, 'Would this piece of jewellery look nice with that outfit?', and things like that."" She added: ""I don't know why the Queen seems fond of me - because I don't give her an easy time!"" But so strong is their bond, a book about their friendship is now on the horizon after the Queen, 93, gave the 66-year-old ""extraordinary permission"" to spill private details. In the past, Ms Kelly has only given a handful of interviews but when she has spoken out publicly, she has gushed about her unwavering affection for her boss. She has described how much she ""adores"" and is ""so proud of her"". She also divulged the Queen's surprising hidden talent - doing all sorts of accents, including Ms Kelly's Scouse twang. Although Ms Kelly insists she is not a replacement for the Queen's sister Princess Margaret, who died aged 71 in 2002, they are thought to have grown closer as a result. Speaking of their friendship, Ms Kelly said: ""I am not there to replace her mother and her sister. ""I do worry about her and care about her. But we also have a lot of fun together. The Queen has a wicked sense of humour and is a great mimic. She can do all accents - including mine."" Ms Kelly also previously revealed she reminds herself ""she is not 'my' Queen, she is everyone's and so I have to share her."" She added: ""I love seeing the faces of the public when they meet the Queen, and when she gives them that special smile."" Ms Kelly, who is one of the few people - other than her family - who can lay hands on the Monarch, addresses the Queen as ‘Your Majesty’ or ‘Ma’am’, while the Queen calls her ‘Angela’."
20,Two-faced Lithuanian politics,news-society," Lithuania continues attempts to support the image of a democratic state and at the same time not to lose foreign military support. On September 26, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda made his first address at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. In his speech he said that threat to Russia's neighbouring countries remains strong and Moscow is attempting to further destabilise neighbouring states. Such statement can be regarded as a call for further support in developing Lithuania's military capabilities to oppose Russia in the Baltic Region. In order to look ""nice"" in the eyes of the world community, Gitanas Nausėda added that Russia could change and inspire confidence. As we know, it could be done only by political means and only through negotiations. The Lithuanian president underlined also that ""determination to adhere to international law is often the last barrier separating our countries from unpredictable and therefore dangerous disorder"". From the very beginning it sounded as if Lithuania would like Russia to change its position on the international arena. But later Lithuanian president contradicted himself. He called not to create any international platforms with Russia's participation designed to resolve existing political and military problems. Thus, he strongly rejected the idea of some political leaders to create a new geopolitical space from the Atlantic Ocean to Vladivostok, drawing Russia in. It turns out that Lithuania is not interested in changing Russia's position. The recent events in Lithuania illustrated such two-faced position on contemporary politics. Lithuanian authorities are not going to change their plans. According to Ministry of National Defence Rotational U.S. force, a battalion-sized unit of over 500 U.S. Army soldiers, will deploy in Lithuania to ensure deterrence and train in exercises shortly in October. The unit is part of the U.S. Army Europe Operation Atlantic Resolve. ""We have sought for a larger long-term U.S. military involvement in Lithuania and the region consistently and patiently. Therefore the deployment of the U.S. Army battalion for a longer period of time is good and awaited news and a result of our efforts and investment,"" Minister of National Defence Raimundas Karoblis said. He also underscores that Lithuania has already hosted many U.S. battalions, however, that used to be in the framework of concrete exercises. This time the U.S. forces are arriving for a long-term deployment, not for an international exercise. The troops will bring heavy equipment 30 Abrams tanks, 25 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles, 70 wheeled vehicles and will deploy at Gen S.Žukauskas Training Area in Pabradė. The U.S. battalion is planned to stay in Lithuania until spring 2020. The more so, on September 26 the Lithuanian Armed Forces accepted 110 Unimog U5000 trucks of 5t payload manufactured by Germany's Daimler AG as it is updating its truck fleet with vehicles of the same make as there already are in the fleet. The trucks are delivered on the basis of a contract signed back in 2015 though continuing successful cooperation of the Ministry of National Defence and the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA). 88 such trucks have already been delivered to the Lithuanian Armed Forces; the contract covers acquisition of the total of 340 new Unimog trucks. The 110 have been delivered to the Lithuanian Armed Forces on the basis of the contract on the Unimog truck acquisition between the Defence Materiel Agency under the MoD and the NATO Support and Procurement Agency updated in 2018. Daimler AG is committed to delivering the remaining 142 trucks in 2020-2021. In other words, Lithuania does not really want Russia to change its position and behaviour. it is profitable for Lithuania to show its political concern, arm itself and get help. Lithuanian authorities do not care of escalating tension in Europe and it ignores attempts to resolve crisis of political confidence in Europe by political means."

1,The Sun News,news-society," The Sun is a tabloid newspaper published in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. As a broadsheet, it was founded in 1964 as a successor to the Daily Herald; it became a tabloid in 1969 after it was purchased by its current owner. It is published by the News Group Newspapers division of News UK, itself a wholly owned subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Since The Sun on Sunday was launched in February 2012, the paper has been a seven-day operation. The Sun previously had the largest circulation of any daily newspaper in the United Kingdom, but it was overtaken by rival Metro in March 2018. In 2012, The Sun on Sunday was launched to replace the closed News of the World, employing some of its former journalists. The average circulation for The Sun on Sunday in January 2019 was 1,178,687. In January 2019, it had an average daily circulation of 1.4 million. The Sun has been involved in many controversies in its history, including its coverage of the 1989 Hillsborough football stadium disaster. Regional editions of the newspaper for Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland are published in Glasgow (The Scottish Sun), Belfast (The Sun) and Dublin (The Irish Sun) respectively. There is currently no separate Welsh edition of The Sun; readers in Wales get the same edition as readers in England. On 12 and 13 June 2014, to tie in with the beginning of the 2014 World Cup football tournament, a free special issue of The Sun was distributed by the Royal Mail to 22 million homes in England. The boycott in Merseyside following the newspaper's coverage of the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 meant that copies were not dispatched to areas with a Liverpool postcode. Royal Mail employees in Merseyside and surrounding areas were given special dispensation by their managers to allow them not to handle the publication ""on a case by case basis"". The main party leaders, David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband, were all depicted holding a copy of the special issue in publicity material.[151] Miliband's decision to pose with a copy of The Sun received a strong response. Organisations representing the relatives of Hillsborough victims described Miliband's action as an ""absolute disgrace"" and he faced criticism too from Liverpool Labour MPs and the city's Labour Mayor, Joe Anderson. A statement was issued on 13 June explaining that Miliband ""was promoting England's bid to win the World Cup"", although ""he understands the anger that is felt towards the Sun over Hillsborough by many people in Merseyside and he is sorry to those who feel offended."" Promoted as ""an unapologetic celebration of England"", the special issue of The Sun ran to 24 pages. The Sun has dominated the circulation figures for daily newspapers in the United Kingdom since the late 1970s, at times easily outpacing its nearest rivals, the Daily Mirror and the Daily Mail. For a brief period in the late 1990s and early 2000s, this lead was more than a million copies per day. Sustained decline began in 2004, in line with print journalism as a whole, and it lost more than a million copies from its daily figures in the six-year period from 2012–18. The Sun's long run at the top was finally broken in February 2018 when it was announced that the circulation of the free Metro newspaper had overtaken it for the first time. However it remains the biggest-selling newspaper in the UK."
2,The latest US and World News,news-society," Sam Montgomery lives in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, with her wealthy widowed father Hal, who runs a popular sports-themed diner. Feeling Sam needs a mother, Hal marries a vain gold digger named Fiona, who has socially-awkward fraternal twin daughters, Brianna and Gabriella. During the 1994 Northridge earthquake, Hal is killed when he runs to save Fiona. Due to him having supposedly left no will, Fiona receives all of his belongings, including the house, the diner, and to her dismay, Sam. Eight years later, Sam is employed as a waitress at the diner to save money to attend Princeton University, but she is regularly tormented by her step-family, who frequently insult her and treat her as if they were popular, despite being regarded as obnoxious. Even worse, Fiona, in her vanity, uses the inheritance to live as if they were insanely rich, including spending on minor facial surgeries, and even refuses to save water during the ongoing drought. She has also transformed Hal's beloved diner into something befitting of her own image, demands that salmon be served and included in over half the dishes and takes Sam's earnings. Sam struggles to cope socially at North Valley High School, where queen bee cheerleader Shelby Cummings also torments her and calls her ""Diner Girl"", along with other members of the popular clique. Sam confides in her online pen pal ""Nomad"" about her dream to attend Princeton, a dream which he also shares. However, Nomad's true identity is Austin Ames, the popular, yet disenchanted, quarterback of the school's football team and Shelby's ex-boyfriend, although she refuses to accept that he has broken up with her. He is disappointed because his father planned for him to go to the University of Southern California with a football scholarship rather than going to Princeton. Nomad proposes that they meet in person at the school's Halloween-themed homecoming dance. On the night of the dance, Fiona orders Sam to work the night shift at the diner, then leaves to drive Brianna and Gabriella to the dance. Initially reluctant, Sam is convinced by her best friend, Carter Farrell, to go to the dance and meet her mysterious online friend. Rhonda, the diner's head waitress who has looked after Sam, and the rest of the diner staff also convince her to disobey Fiona and go to the dance anyway. Sam, wearing a mask and Rhonda's old wedding dress, meets Nomad at the dance, and is surprised to learn that he is Austin, who had become smitten with her upon her entrance. The two decide to leave the party to walk alone and get to know each other a little better. While sharing a romantic dance, Sam and Austin begin to fall in love. But just as Austin is about to unmask her, Sam's cell phone alarm goes off, warning her to return to the diner before Fiona at midnight. She leaves without revealing her identity to Austin, and drops her phone on the way out. Austin picks up her phone and begins a desperate search to figure out who his ""Cinderella"" really is, but every girl at school claims to be the mysterious owner of the phone. Sam is reluctant to reveal her identity to Austin, feeling that he will not accept her due to their different social circles. When Austin comes into the diner one day, Sam is forced to help him and, after a talk, she attempts to reveal her identity to him, but is cut off by Fiona. Sam's stepsisters end up discovering Sam and Austin's email relationship, and, after failing to convince Austin that one of them is the owner of the phone, convince Shelby that Sam tried to steal Austin from her. During a pep rally, they and the other cheerleaders humiliate Sam in front of the entire school and expose her identity, as well as naming her an impostor, horrifying the school staff, Carter and Sam. Austin, hurt by Sam's secrecy, is unable to step up to defend her, and Sam leaves the pep rally in tears. Like Austin, Sam is revealed to have been accepted to Princeton, only to be duped by Fiona into believing that she was rejected by having a fake rejection letter made in order to keep Sam working at the diner and as her slave. Sam then decides to give up on her dreams and resigns herself to a lifetime of working at the diner, but Rhonda gives Sam a pep talk on not losing hope. When her stepsisters come into the diner, they slam the door, causing a guitar clock to fall off the wall, tearing the wallpaper down with it, and quickly blame it on Sam. However, the torn section reveals an inspirational quote Hal often said, ""Never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game"" (in real life, this quote came from Babe Ruth) and fills Sam with hope. She stands up to Fiona and her stepsisters, stating that she will no longer put up with their emotional abuse, quits her job at the diner, and moves in with Rhonda, who also quits along with the entire diner staff, all of whom had put up with Fiona's abuse for so many years after Hal's death only for Sam's sake, with Rhonda even threatening to beat up Fiona now that she was no longer bound to her job before Sam talks her out of it. The customers, who witness the entire scene, promptly leave in disgust as well. Before the school's homecoming football game, Sam confronts Austin about his cowardice and not defending her at the pep rally, as well as for his seeming reluctance to show his true self. Before the final play of the game, he sees Sam making her way out of the stands, and finally stands up to his father, saying he wants to attend Princeton rather than simply play football all his life. He chases after Sam and apologizes. She accepts his apology, and they share their first kiss as rain falls over the drought-plagued valley; at the same time, the North Valley High Fighting Frogs win the football game. Soon after while finishing packing after moving in with Rhonda, Sam finds Hal's will hidden in her childhood fairy-tale book, stating that all of his money and possessions actually belong to her. Since this leaves her as the rightful and legal owner, Sam sells her step-family's fancy cars so that she can pay for college, and Fiona, who claims to have never seen the will before despite the fact she clearly signed it as a witness, is arrested by the L.A. District Attorney and L.A.P.D. for financial fraud and violating California's child labor laws for all the times she made Sam work long hours at the diner in spite of her being a minor. Sam finds that she was in fact accepted to Princeton; the acceptance letter is retrieved from the garbage by her stepsisters, who knew where Fiona had ""filed"" it. As an alternative to going to prison, Fiona, Brianna, and Gabriella are made by the District Attorney to work off the money they stole from Sam at the diner, which is restored to its former glory by its new owners, Sam and Rhonda, who is made the new general manager of the restaurant. Also, Austin's father comes to accept his son's decision to attend Princeton. Things even work out in the end for Carter as he makes a commercial for a new acne medication. Shelby, having previously cheated off of Carter's school work and rejecting him for being an outcast, even after he was a proper gentleman to her at the Halloween dance, aims to pursue him since he is now popular, but after finally seeing her true colors at the pep rally, he turns her down for Astrid, the high school's goth DJ and announcer. The film ends with Sam and Austin, now officially a couple, driving off to Princeton together after Sam gets her phone back from Austin."
3,3 Important Principles for Notary Translation,news-society," A notary is a kind of officially assured fraud-deterrent document showing that the target certificate or documentation is authentic. Anyone who has a notary shall be publicly trusted in certain aspects. However, it is working only domestically. According to Chinese law, foreign notarizations have to be translated and re-notarized here before proper use. notary translation into Chinese Over the past 10 years, we have been working on increasing demands for notary translation and have gathered rich experience in it. When translating a notarial document, we are holding our 3 major principles. Principle 1: Loyal to Original Text This principle is simple: A translation must be as faithful as possible to its original, otherwise, the entire job will be totally ruined. Specifically speaking, when translating a notarization, particular attention shall be addressed on identity confirmation, key details of the notarization, and most importantly, the facts are being certified. notary translation into Chinese - original Some of the content to be certified can be identifications, and some are company profiles, while some are assets certifications. We have put great efforts on understanding those files of different users, in order to make great choices for words conversion, or detail representation. As a time-honored service provider, we made large numbers of queries for special terms and built up our database. Here are some example fields of it: Secretary of State of the State(s) of Virginia California Corporations Code Judicial Sergeant Chief Assistant Authentication Officer Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Notarial Act Deputy Clerk Some of the above terms are seemingly normal, but their Chinese translation needs to think over. Principle 2: Double Check Numbers notary translation into Chinese - numbers We know it's a cliche or even fussing to talk about the numbers. But the fact is: there is a great chance that translators make mistake on numerical data, which are often fatal to the following procedures as well as to translators' fame. Generally, those numbers can be found on: Date (the inconsistent expressions can be misleading, e.g. 4-5-2019) Address (room or street numbers, postal codes) Contact (phone numbers or fax numbers) File Numbers Identifications (passport numbers, company register numbers) Statistic or Computed Numbers (revenue, capital, financing amount) Thanks to our smart transfer system, most of the numbers can be converted automatically. Meanwhile, we have set redundant inspection procedures to make sure every detail about those numbers is true. Principle 3: Pay Attention to Typesetting notary translation into Chinese - layout As for the typesetting or layout of the translation works, it can obviously improve the beauty and thus comprehensive influence. For notarizations, we can easily find scattered stamps, irregular alignments, italic or bold fonts, or mixed figures or tables. It's not an easy job to reorganize the format according to its original style, but we have gained some experience in it: just follow the font and text-align patterns, and make some compromise on figures, signatures or background colors. This is corresponding to industry standard, too."
4,Do Something,news-society," I have been waiting for many years for the Republicans in Congress to act to  make our country safer from mass shootings  I thought they would do something when 20 children and 6 adults were killed at Sandy Hook--a shooting which shocked the whole nation. I thought they would act after The high school shooting in Parkland, (17 deaths), the Orlando night club (50 deaths), the Las Vegas music festival, (59 deaths) the El paso Walmart (22 deaths), Sutherland Springs church (25 deaths), Odessa and Midland,  (7 deaths), San Bernardino (14 deaths) Virginia Beach (12 deaths), Thousand Oaks (12 deaths), Pittsburgh synagogue (11deaths). and Santa Fe High School (8 deaths) Since Sandy Hook there have been 2219 mass shootings with 2406 people killed and 9280 wounded.The CDC reports that in 2016 there were 39,000 gun deaths from homicides and suicides. 14,000 homicide and 23,000 suicides. We have been told that guns don't kill people, people kill people. What is a truer fact is that people with guns kill people  We have been told that people need guns for self-defense. According to Harvard University analysis of figures from the National Crime Victimization survey, people defended themselves in 0,9 percent of crimes from 2007 to 2011 The survey shows that guns are used very rarely for self-defense. The following statistics compare all the mass shootings in the world in 2019 by country. 18 countries had 0 mass shootings, New Zealand—1, Netherlands-1, Canada-1, Mexico-3, United States 249 All of these countries have the same problems that we have. They have mental health issues. They have differences of political opinion. They have crime, but they also have sensible gun laws which keep their citizens safer. When the citizens of El Paso gathered for the memorial for their dead children and husbands and wives and friends and shouted at their Governor to DO SOMETHING, they issued a cry of pain that echos in the hearts of every caring person in this country. If our government has done nothing all of these years when they first saw the dead children at Sandy Hook and have continued to do nothing to deal with all of the successive violence that happens every year, then we can assume that the present administration and senate for their own selfish goals will continue to do nothing. It is now the responsibility of every parent, every husband, every wife, every voter in this country to take on this responsibility and finally do something at the ballot box.--vote out every Republican and every Democrat who will not take action to remedy this danger to our families. If we don't do this in 2020 then we will be the ones that are ultimately responsible for the next mass shooting. If we vote in a new president and a responsive house and senate who will DO SOMETHING then we will have finally given a fitting memorial to all of the babies and children and men and women who have tragically died as a result of the inaction of our legislators. The responsibility now is ours!

5,UNRWA Under Fire,news-society," UNRWA, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, has been building the Palestinian human capital and equipping boys and girls with education, vocational training and improved livelihoods for years. For some time now, the entity has been under a fierce attack.  On the surface, allegations of corruption and abuse of power by senior UNRWA staff members have suddenly manifested. Looking beyond, corruption can very well hide under the guise of adopting anti-corruption measures. Demographically speaking, UNRWA provides aid to more than five million Palestinian refugees in the diaspora. That is, in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, the West Bank and Gaza. In other words, more than five million refugees who have been force-migrated are on hold to be returned to their homeland once the prolonged Palestinian-Israeli conflict is resolved. While the hope remains the light at the end of the tunnel, it has never suited the Israeli palette. One administration after another, the Americans were pro-Israel. With the cherry on the top, President Trump seems to have all the Harry Potter wands at the disposal of the Israelis. ""The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into smaller manageable tasks, and then starting on the first one"". The American Initiative aka the Deal of the Century is stumbling. Here comes the shutdown of UNRWA, thus, blurring the line between humanitarianism and politics, where the unknown people pay the price every day.  For Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, UNRWA must be shut once and for all, for the very existence of the entity promotes the right of return of the Palestinian refugees, which to Netanyahu eliminates the state of Israel. How to shut UNRWA down? Corruption allegations of course. Only by the logic of the naive is discrediting UNRWA at this particular timing a coincidence. End of the day, the entity has been meeting its budget, its projects are manifest on the ground, it has benefitted millions of people and gained the support of uncountable number of renowned volunteers from all over the world. Volunteers and civil society members turn to support Palestine the minute their feet touch the Palestinian soil for they can see injustice in action. This, however, ends up costing them their life and if they survive, their reputation. Mads Gilbert is labelled an anti-Semitic. Vittorio Arrigoni and Rachel Currie, to mention but a very few, ended up being murdered. UNRWA spokesperson Chris Gunness, who witnessed the bombardment of a school on Gaza and couldn’t help cry on air, was labelled crazy. No one can get away with criticizing the Israelis, except for the free of course. Call it an ""Ethics Report"" and voila! You got what it takes! In July, a ""confidential internal"" report was issued by the UNRWA ""ethics office"". Its confidentiality allows no one to verify its content. However, its media summary-leak goes far to attack the senior staff of UNRWA by descriptions rather than incidents and actions. The report accumulates all the words in the dictionary to demonize UNRWA. ""A culture of low morale, fear of retaliation, distrust, secrecy, bullying, marginalization, concentration of power, beyond the professional relationship/sexual misconduct [between senior staff members], funding crisis, irregular recruitment etc."" were among the media coverage of the report. Common sensically, the accusations alleged do not take place overnight. It takes years to build a culture of low morale and the rest of it. It is known to the world that recruitment measures of the UN in general and the UNRWA in particular are very strict. Only creme de la creme make it to an entry position, let alone senior positions. The sudden exposure of long practiced misconduct is a red flag by itself.  While the alleged conduct is said to present ""an enormous risk to the reputation of the UN"", the report itself seems to be what pauses a huge risk to the reputation of the UN. Supposing the alleged misconduct is true, the UN would have massively failed to implement monitoring and evaluation procedures, in which case, it would be liable for any misconduct practiced on any micro level. In fact, with such a report, the UN could have facilitated such misconduct to channel funds here and there, a matter which would subject the UN in whole to stand accountable and open to external investigations. The report findings, unknown to the public save by descriptions, are under investigation. The accused may not make any comment till the investigation is concluded. Confidentiality might come across as a measure to ensure impartiality. However, the leaks to the media defy the presumption of innocence until proven guilty. Those accused have been fed to the media to tear them apart without a chance to respond. An entity as established and so called professional as the UN would have not leaked any of it until the investigation is finalized. However, with the miscalculation and in the event those accused are proven innocent, the UN would again be liable for the defamation of the persons concerned. One interesting accusation stood out. A senior staff member named Maria Mohammadi is implicitly accused of having intimate relationship with Commissioner-General Pierre Krahenbuhl. Maria Mohammedi is an Algerian activist who has been working in the West Bank and Gaza for years. To the western reader, for such relationship to pave the way for work privileges is corrupt and it ends there. However, for an Arab, such accusation would actually threaten the life of the woman in the name of honor. The support of Algeria to Palestine has always been exceptional. As an Algerian, Mohammedi could lose her life on grounds of betraying the Palestinian-Algerian cause, that is, freedom of Palestine. Any way perceived, a woman could very well be sacrificed at the altar by the very entity which promotes women’s rights and equal opportunity. Again, the UN stands liable for any ramifications of a situation that seems nothing but mismanaged in favor of shutting the UNRWA down one way or another. Conveniently, Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands cut and/or froze their funding to the UNRWA. As financiers, these countries and whatever representations they have, preserve every right to monitor and evaluate the progress of the projects implemented on the ground. Have they also failed to do their job for the past years? or has their sense of justice been compromised? the questions remain unanswered. Timing is of the essence but let’s not forget Netanyahu’s speech on Iraq ""if you take out Saddam’s regime, I guarantee you that it will have enormous positive reverberations on the region"". The world knows better how that turned out. Gideon Levy puts it better, ""Israel is occupation- addicted. The drug addict who is your friend, if you give him money, he will really care about you. But are you really caring about him?"""
6,Breaking News & Top Stories,news-society," Lightning frequently triggers fires in the region but this year they have been worsened by summer temperatures that are higher than average because of climate change. Plumes of smoke from the fires can be seen from space. Mark Parrington, a wildfires expert at the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (Cams), described them as ""unprecedented"". How bad is it? There are hundreds of fires covering mostly uninhabited regions across eastern Russia, northern Scandinavia, Greenland and Alaska. But smoke is affecting wider surrounding areas, engulfing some places completely. Cities in eastern Russia have noted a significant decrease in air quality since the fires started. Skip Twitter post by @katelikekirlia Report End of Twitter post by @katelikekirlia The smoke has reportedly reached Russia's Tyumen region in western Siberia, six time zones away from the fires on the east coast. How wildfires start and how to stop them Why wildfires are breaking out in the 'wrong' countries New tactics in battle against wildfires In June, the fires released an estimated 50 megatonnes of carbon dioxide - the equivalent of Sweden's annual carbon output, according to Cams. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Fires have hit the famous taiga of Siberia How unusual is this? Arctic fires are common between May and October and wildfires are a natural part of an ecosystem, offering some benefits for the environment, according to the Alaska Centers website. But the intensity of these fires, as well as the large area they have taken up, make these unusual. ""It is unusual to see fires of this scale and duration at such high latitudes in June,"" said Mr Parrington. ""But temperatures in the Arctic have been increasing at a much faster rate than the global average, and warmer conditions encourage fires to grow and persist once they have been ignited."" Extremely dry ground and hotter than average temperatures, combined with heat lightning and strong winds, have caused the fires to spread aggressively. The burning has been sustained by the forest ground, which consists of exposed, thawed, dried peat - a substance with high carbon content. Dangerous amplification Global satellites are now tracking a swathe of new and ongoing wildfires within the Arctic Circle. The conditions were laid in June, the hottest June for the planet yet observed in the instrumented era. The fires are releasing copious volumes of previously stored carbon dioxide and methane - carbon stocks that have in some cases been held in the ground for thousands of years. Scientists say what we're seeing is evidence of the kind of feedbacks we should expect in a warmer world, where increased concentrations of greenhouse gases drive more warming, which then begets the conditions that release yet more carbon into the atmosphere. A lot of the particulate matter from these fires will eventually come to settle on ice surfaces further north, darkening them and thus accelerating melting. It's all part of a process of amplification. What is being done to tackle the fires? Russian authorities are not tackling the majority of the fires as they argue the cost would be bigger than the damage caused by the flames. ""They do not threaten any settlements or the economy,"" the press service of the Krasnoyarsk Region forestry ministry told a Siberian news website. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The fires are extremely difficult for authorities to put out The hashtags #putouttheSiberianfires and #saveSiberianforests are currently trending on Twitter as Russians complain the government is not doing enough to tackle the crisis. Some argue that the Notre Dame fire in Paris received far more media attention than the forest fires. ""Remember how far the news about the Notre Dame fire spread? Now is the time to do the same about the Siberian forest fires,"" said one tweet. Another said: ""Let's not forget that nature is no less important than history. Numerous animals have lost their homes, and many of them are probably dead. Just thinking about this is painful."" Alaska Centers agree that ""fire-suppression efforts sometimes are more damaging than the wildfire"
7,Breaking News & Top Stories,news-society," Congress must launch impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump — immediately. Former special counsel Robert Mueller’s testimony to the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees Wednesday has left us with no other rational course of action. Doing so isn’t about partisan advantage in 2020; it’s not even about Trump. Impeaching him is about protecting America. Here is why: We heard — in Mueller’s own voice, without the president’s and attorney general’s distortions — that the special counsel’s investigation uncovered Russia’s ""sweeping and systematic"" interference in the 2016 election, and the Trump campaign’s embrace of this help and the president’s obstruction of justice during the investigation of it. It’s clear that Russia interfered in our election. It’s clear that it did so to help Trump win, and it’s clear that Trump benefited from Russia’s help and asked them to help further. ""Over the course of my career, I’ve seen a number of challenges to our democracy. The Russian government’s effort to interfere in our election is among the most serious,"" Mueller told the Judiciary Committee. Hours later, asked in the Intelligence Committee hearing whether future political campaigns could accept foreign interference, he replied, ""I hope this is not the new normal, but I fear it is."" Related Opinion Were the Mueller hearings a disaster for Democrats? Only if you weren't listening Yet this president has refused to fully acknowledge Russia’s interference and preference for him in the election, has refused to take action to protect against future foreign interference and has explicitly invited future interference by saying he might accept damaging information about rivals from foreign agents without reporting it to the FBI. Furthermore, six Trump associates have been convicted of or charged with lying about Russia-related contacts, and Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort ordered his deputy, Rick Gates, to delete messages related to such contacts. Mueller agreed under questioning Wednesday that if a witness or suspect lies or destroys evidence, such actions can be used in court to demonstrate consciousness of guilt. Mueller gave the president plenty of opportunity to clear the air and his name by testifying under oath about his actions during the campaign and after he discovered the existence of the investigation. It’s clear that the president refused — and that he met, called or corresponded with Russian President Vladimir Putin 20 times after taking office but never once met with Mueller. It’s clear that Mueller found multiple instances where Trump’s actions met all three of the required elements for charging criminal obstruction of justice — including firing FBI Director James Comey, trying to fire Mueller, trying to have people lie and cover up for him, trying to impede the investigation and trying to tamper with witnesses who were cooperating with investigators. And it’s clear that anyone who is not a sitting president but had acted in such a way would face criminal prosecution immediately: More than 1,000 former prosecutors have signed onto a letter saying so. These are violations of law and a gross betrayal of America. Mueller told us in no uncertain terms that Trump has not been exonerated of obstruction of justice: He found evidence of abuses of power by the president, and said the president could be indicted for obstruction after he leaves office. Recommended Opinion Were the Mueller hearings a disaster for Democrats? Only if Americans weren't really listening politics NBC’s Pete Williams: ‘This is not the same Robert Mueller’ from previous hearings Trump nonetheless trumpets his baseless claims that he has been exonerated. I would offer that, if he’s so innocent, he should lift his own Justice Department’s ban on indicting a sitting president. I’ve tried hard not just to investigate the president's actions but also to legislate to protect against future interference in other campaigns. I’ve introduced the Duty to Report Act, requiring federal candidates and campaigns to notify law enforcement if they are offered assistance by agents of another government. Doing so has long been a matter of the ""honor code"" among campaigns — but obviously that is not enough in the case of a candidate or campaign that is utterly lacking in honor. When foreign adversaries seek to meddle in our elections, silence cannot be an option. And I’ve coauthored the No President Is Above the Law Act, which would pause the statute of limitations for any federal offense committed by a sitting president, whether it was committed before or during the president’s term of office. This would ensure that presidents can be held accountable for criminal conduct — just like every other American — and not use the presidency to avoid legal consequences. Related Opinion We want to hear what you THINK. Please submit a letter to the editor. But legislation alone won’t cut it — especially with the Senate majority leader standing ready to obstruct any and all efforts to hold this president accountable. Despite my Republican colleagues’ blatant attempts to derail the hearings and distract from the truth Wednesday, Mueller’s testimony laid bare this president’s disdain for the rule of law. It’s time for Congress to step up and exercise its constitutional duty."
8,A Vision of Utopia,news-society," Utopia--- a place in which human society, natural conditions, etc., are so ideally perfect that there is complete contentment Before we can hope to shape the future, we must first examine the past, because we have arrived at this point in history as a result of the past actions of many of our ancestors from many diverse cultures. Up to this point in our history, especially before the rule of law, many societies simply took what they desired from others. The strongest survived and the weaker societies perished. The misery and the carnage that resulted was viewed by our ancestors to be their only way of surviving in a dangerous world. What was fair or right didn’t really matter. Survival and prospering has always been the ""way of the world"" regardless of the cost in suffering to others. We have seen this in the constant conquest which all countries have practiced. We have seen this in the business practices which still exist today that take cruel advantage of those who are less able to protect themselves. We still see this attitude in many of our current societies. The strong prey on the weak and use them without compassion to achieve their objectives. A world which has the goal of using others for personal advantage will never become a world in which all individuals can live with dignity. Before we can achieve the more loving vision that we all desire, we must first begin by defining the vision of the world that we want to create. For a long time we have been taught to value great wealth and many still think that it is the path to happiness. Wealth of itself does not create happiness, as we see if we have known people who have been very wealthy. They suffer the same problems of health or difficult relationships or loneliness or anxiety as the rest of us. Wealth does not solve all problems. Adequate financial stability certainly is necessary to a happy life, but extreme wealth is not. When our personal goals change, then our society will also begin to change. Vision 1--One of the important visions for a better world is adequate financial stability for all. Vision 2--Healthy people are happier and better functioning so that our second vision is for adequate health opportunities for all. Vision 3--Educated people do better in their lives and contribute much to their communities. Opportunities for career education and education that also teaches people personal responsibility should certainly be part of a new vision for the future. Vision 4--Governments that reflect the desires of the people and can be changed regularly by law. Vision 5--Freedom in our personal lives--which includes political, religious, sexual, and diversity of thought as long as we remain non-violent in our choices. Vision 6--Adequate help for those in need whether financially, physically or emotionally. None of us knows what the future will be like, but if all people have most of their needs met and all people respect each other in their search for happiness and fulfillment, and try to make the world a better, more well- functioning and beautiful place, I have great hope that this vision of Utopia, through the efforts of caring people everywhere, can someday become a living reality."
9,An Open Letter to People in Power,news-society," ""Any man’s death diminishes me                                     because I am involved in Mankind."" John Donne From the beginning of time when the first group of humans walked on the earth so many millions of years ago, the strongest tribe conquered their weaker neighbors and showed them no mercy. They took all their possessions and subsequently killed or enslaved everyone in the group. Even in more civilized times, landowners or factory owners of all countries used their workers and slaves without regard to their welfare. As more people became educated, they became aware of the inequity between the different classes and began to demand better conditions for those individuals who had no rights. The earth is now at an important crossroad in it’s history. In a nuclear age, we must think carefully which philosophy we want to follow. Will we follow the idea that the strong will continue to exploit and subdue the weak, leading to more poverty, continual war and possible complete annihilation, or will we begin to see that all men want to live with security and dignity and begin to devise new ways to make this possible? Already a few powerful men are beginning to try make a difference. Men like Ted Turner, Bill Gates and Sir Richard Branson are sharing their resources to help all people regardless of country, race or religion to live better lives. Let us hope that this will be a signal to other caring powerful individuals and especially to all leaders of powerful countries which will begin to take us in a new direction of less greed and more compassion in the future, and which will give to all children a new chance for happiness and for hope."
10,About Men,news-society," All of us whether we are men or woman have men in our lives that we care about. They are our fathers, our brothers, our sons and our partners and what we hope for them is that they lead happy and fulfilled lives. What is it to be fulfilled as a man in our society? Is it to be a warrior? Is it to become rich? Is it to be a scholar? Is it to be an athlete or a playboy? We all have unspoken expectations for the men in our lives and they also have unspoken expectations for themselves, but unfortunately, they never really tell us what they want for themselves. We do not always know the secrets of their innermost dreams. We do however notice that many of our men are angry at the roles life has given them to play. We see it in the domestic violence that explodes in our homes and on our streets, and in the anger that is often released in the violence of war. When a man views himself as an individual, he doesn’t seem to have a problem knowing what he wants to achieve in his life and how to find his happiness. When he views himself as part of a group, then he must mold himself to the expectations of that group even if it is not a good fit. Many men never question the destiny that life has dealt them, and if ultimately they are not happy with their roles they become angry and don’t really know how to change that destiny. The emerging and changing roles of women and their ability to make more diverse and individual choices will ultimately affect the lives of men and hopefully give them more freedom to make constructive individual choices of their own. What all of us want for the men that we love is that they live happy and fulfilled lives. How will men begin to achieve these goals?  It will take the courage and informed decisions of those individual men who have finally decided to make the conscious changes that will be needed to help them to live more personal, happier and less anxiety- ridden lives."
11,About Women,news-society," For a long time women have been questioning the roles that society imposed on them. We saw it in the novels of Edith Wharton in the early 1900’s about the restricted lives of women.  We saw it in the fight for a woman’s right to vote (1917) which many women fought for and even died for. It has taken women a long time, but finally in the 60’s women were able to break out of the mold that imposed a particular behavior on all women, and this allowed women to have more choices about how they wanted to live their lives. With more choices, of course, have come new problems and new challenges and this has affected the previous more structured styles of domestic life ( such as man- woman relationships, past social expectations etc.) which will certainly take some time to address. Change is always difficult, but it will ultimately be liberating not only for women, but eventually for men and even for the society as a whole. We are now in the process of identifying, one person at a time, what these new changes are going to be and how they are going to affect all of us. Will women choose to work part time and stay home part time? Will some men choose to stay home while woman work? Will well- functioning and low cost day care centers be more prevalent? Will both men and women decide to work part time and live different, less material lifestyles? These questions will only be answered in the future as individuals live their lives and find out what works well and what doesn’t. The ultimate hope for all woman (and for all men) is that their greater range of choices will bring about a greater chance of happiness and a more tranquil and better life. If our men and women are happier then our children too can look forward to a more loving and brighter future."
12,Random Thoughts About War,news-society," War is a complex problem which will not be easy to solve. The reason for this is that war has many underlying causes that are often difficult to identify and change. There are economic imperatives and land issues, There are anger issues, intolerance issues and the inability of leaders to compromise on conflicting goals. There are the masculinity issues about being a warrior and perhaps even many as yet undiscovered factors that propel us toward war. Until all of these underlying issues are identified and the appropriate actions taken, we will never be able to look forward to a world without war, When each of us ultimately becomes more aware and begins to identify these obstacles and then commit ourselves to work toward making the necessary changes, one problem at a time, only then will we will begin to see the beginnings of a more reasonable, a more cooperative and a better functioning world where all people will be able to look forward to a brighter future which will finally allow them to live dignified and peaceful lives. According to scientific thought, our planet is now 4.5 billion years of age. Since the first humans began to roam the earth millions of years ago, their first instinct was to find food and defend themselves-- violently when necessary. We are still functioning in this primitive, violent way these many millions of years later, not taking into account that the world is no longer the same and human beings are no longer cave dwellers. Since the advent of the hydrogen bomb, our way of thinking about war must change. We are on the brink of total annihilation either through the complete destruction of our world or through released radioactivity which will kill or injure everyone on our planet. War is no longer a rational way of solving differences. How will we secure our future without resorting to war? It means that alternative ways must be found to put pressure on rogue states— diplomacy, sanctions, increased dialogue and the ability of the rational world to try to understand the thinking and the motivations of others and the ability of everyone in confrontational circumstances to make compromises. There is no longer any other alternative. The time is now. More and more small unstable countries are getting the bomb, and we can no longer pretend that this danger does not exist. All of us who care about the future must put our energies to this task, or we will be facing a time when this wonderful earth that we love so much will be reduced to a few atoms of radioactive dust."
13,A New View of Crime and Punishment,news-society," Whether we live in poor areas or more affluent environments, we are all affected by the crime around us and the fear it engenders in all of us. Long ago people viewed crime in a more simplistic way. There were good people and bad people and the bad people needed to be punished and crime would then disappear. That has not happened. When criminals are punished they do not ordinarily stop being criminals. New information has taught us about the relationship of cause and effect. There is still a dialogue going on about nurture versus nature, but no authority will deny that poverty, environment or bad parenting play a large role in producing individuals who have lost any hope that they can survive as productive citizens of our society. It is very easy for young people to get caught up in the current drug culture and make serious mistakes that can have lasting consequences in their lives. For various reasons, minorities are at particular risk in our culture. These early mistakes must not be allowed to ruin our young people's entire lives. Our laws must begin to reflect the reality of the lives that young people are exposed to and treat these young offenders with understanding and compassion. According to current statistics, it costs an average of $33,000 a year to keep one prisoner in jail. How much better it would be to spend that money on preventative measures like better counseling, better recreational facilities, better parenting classes and better job training programs for young people who are at risk. For those people who are already in prison and will one day be paroled, wouldn't it be wiser to give them counseling and job training and get them ready to live productively instead of warehousing and punishing them and then throwing them back on the streets to become a danger to us again? We must change our own view of these vulnerable people in our society. They are people who, because of the circumstances of their lives, are not able to make a living, who cannot control their emotions or who feel a sense of hopelessness. Instead of taking revenge, we must begin to find the cure for this disease and treat this like any other chronic illness with tolerance and understanding and wise life-changing programs. By doing these things, we will perhaps begin to make some inroads on the problems of crime, drug addiction, family violence and insure a future of healthier families, safer communities and ultimately more hope for us all."
14,Freedom of Speech in a Diverse World,news-society," Voltaire (1694—1778) said, ""I may not agree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it"". That statement made so long ago is more timely than ever. As our country and our world becomes more diverse as to political, religious, ethnic and racial values, it will be increasingly important that all of us have a high tolerance for differences of opinions, because it is likely that we may differ from our neighbors as to values, clothes, behavior or relationships. It is also important that while we must allow all diverse opinions to freely be expressed. we must not allow any political, religious, ethnic, or racial group to dictate to everyone else their ""truth"". A free society allows every person to follow the dictates of his conscience, but not to impose them on others. This means that we will all need to compromise our ""truths"" when they are in conflict with other people‘s ""truths"". It means that no one is above the secular laws of the land in which they have chosen to live. If the laws are not considered fair, in a free society we all have the power to work to change those laws. As in all good families and societies, communication and compromise are the key to good relationships.  Why is this adjustment of our thinking so difficult for all of us? I like to think of myself as a tolerant person, but I notice that I too have my prejudices and stereotypical ways of thinking. These past erroneous ideas became part of my thinking when I was young because of the prevailing, more intolerant thinking of the times and the community in which I then lived. They came at a time when I was too young to question them. Now however as an adult I do have the strength and the ability to question and change them if those ideas are not longer valid.  It is important then to be aware of where our less tolerant thinking has originated. For most of us new ways of thinking and new ways of living are not always easy for us to understand, accept and change. It does take patience and effort to change our opinions to a more tolerant way of thinking and acting in the new and more modern, diverse world. Our best hope in a diverse country and world, is that we all learn from each other, Just as we have learned to enrich our cuisine with spaghetti, chop-suey , french onion soup, sushi—all the good diverse foods of the world, so too can we enrich our lives with new ways of living by taking the best of each culture and perhaps making them our very own."
15,Greed in our Time,news-society," ""Greed is Good !""--from the movie ""Wall Street"" More than 2000 years ago the wise and famous scholar Hillel wrote "" If I am not for myself who will be for me. If I am only for myself, what am I?"" Recently there have been people and corporations in the news who have been only for themselves with no regard for the damage their greed has done to others. This list includes schemers like Madoff, many bankers, unscrupulous insurance companies, dictators, politicians whose only goal is to accumulate vast amounts of money. For these groups of people it is no longer about being more secure or supporting one’s family. It’s about unlimited accumulation. Greed is rapidly becoming an illness and an addiction as deadly as drugs. If this were an individual addiction we would not need to examine so closely what is happening, but when so many of these individuals and large corporations steal money that rightfully belongs to other people then it becomes legalized theft. We all can see how someone like Madoff stole from others, but it is harder to determine when insurance companies charge higher premiums than they should or bankers higher rates than they should or when politicians take money from corporations to vote for legislation which denies ordinary citizens their lawful rights. These individual and corporate actions are just as much a theft as a criminal robbing a bank. When a dictator or leader steals from his people more money than he will ever be able to use in many lifetimes, than we need to look at what drives these greedy people to do what they do. Why do these enormously rich people continue to steal? There is a subconscious drive that impels them to search for more and more power to enhance their self-esteem and to gain the admirations of others. Often it is the only way that they can feel admired and loved and this neurotic need often originates in an underlying feeling of low self-esteem. Corporate stealing is all about making the most money that’s possible without regard to injuries this may cause to others. Even our own societal values contribute to these neurotic drives of individuals and corporations for more power and money because most of us still admire and pay homage to those who are rich, and we don’t always question or care about how they earned it. So we too become a part of this worldwide illness. How can we begin to curb these greedy people from stealing from us all? We must of course watch them much more carefully and hold those who steal to a higher accountability. We must also build a new value system that does not admire those who become rich at the expense of others. How different the world would be for all of us if the following wise words became the universal mantra for a better and more just society--- "" If I am not for myself who will be for me. If I am only for myself, what am I? If not now, when?"
16,About Media and Influence,news-society," We are fortunate to live in a country and at a time when we have almost unlimited access to information — political, social and personal through many TV and radio outlets, through newspapers and through the internet. What many of us don’t always take the time to realize is that all of these outlets are businesses who have owners and motives and agendas of their own which do not always reflect truth. These businesses also have advertisers who ultimately have their own agenda which can compromise the objectivity of reporting what is true. How then can we decide that the source of our information is truthful and reliable? We probably can’t, unless we know who owns the outlet and understand their motives. The other way to seek the truth is to get our information from as many different sources with diverse opinions as possible and then sift through all the different opinions and make an informed judgment . This may seem like too much of an effort for most of us. Is it really important that we do this? It is one of the most important things that we will ever do . If we don’t make the effort to be thoroughly informed, unscrupulous individuals will be able to bend us through emotional or intellectual manipulation to become their puppets for carrying out their ideals. That is how countries ultimately lose their freedom. It is all the more important now because the current world trend in so many countries including our own is toward limiting challenging ideas and trying to demean and control our media. We must value all of our media and fight for the freedom of all the press to write and speak whatever they feel is their truth even if we don’t agree with them and even when we are concerned about what they say. That is what makes a democracy strong. If any individual or group attacks the freedom to express our ideas no matter how distasteful those ideas may be, then we must suspect that these people and groups want to ultimately enslave us and limit our freedom. No one, of course, must be able to advocate violence, but beyond that one limitation, in a free society we must allow all diverse opinions. No matter how difficult that is. It will take the awareness of all of us that there will always be unscrupulous individuals who will try to manipulate our thinking, if we allow them to do it. A truly informed electorate is the one way that we will always be able to know the truth of any given situation and the only way that we will continue to retain our precious freedom of thought and action in a continuing free society."
17,"The U.S.: Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia cost $125 million",news-society," The U.S. does its best to strengthen its positions in the Baltic States. The U.S. hunts out excuses for being there, having no actual reason and legal grounds to deploy its military contingent in the region. For instance, though its troops are not even a part of the NATO enhanced Forward Presence Battle group in Latvia, the U.S. troops and military equipment are permanently present in the country. The more so, the U.S. always finds a basis for its presence. Thus, it is eager to take part in military exercises, give money to build military infrastructure, participate in different joint military conferences, sell military equipment or just give advices. For such purposes The U.S. initiated Operation Atlantic Resolve as a demonstration of U.S. commitment to collective security in the region. As part of this operation thirteen UH-60 and HH-60 Black Hawk helicopters arrived in Latvia in February. Likewise, 150 soldiers from the 3rd battalion of the 1st Combat Aviation Brigade arrived and are stationed here on a rotational basis. The U.S. contingent is expected to stay in Latvia for nine months. It is said they fulfill operations in the National Armed Forces base in Lielvārde. Another fact of the U.S. active involvement in domestic affairs is the so called advisory assistance which has turned into a guide to action, supported by the U.S. financial help. U.S. defense think-tank the Rand Corporation has produced in April a new report titled Deterring Russian Aggression in the Baltic States (https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2779.html). According to the report, ""a robust technology initiative to enhance military capabilities for all three states would cost about $125 million, could be implemented over several years, and is scalable. The authors discuss the benefits and risks of expanding unconventional and total defense efforts and potential Russian responses and countermeasures. Finally, they outline steps that the Baltic governments, the United States, other NATO allies and partners, and the European Union could take to enhance these efforts. The authors conclude that total defense and unconventional warfare capabilities can complement the existing conventional defense efforts of the Baltic states and NATO, improve warning of an attack, augment initial defenses, and buy time for (and provide support to) national and NATO conventional responses."" For Latvia, in particular, the authors advice to enhance the size and capabilities of its national guard and reserve forces and improve whole-of society resilience efforts. Just after report's release, Latvian Minister of Defence Pubriks announced the planned snap checks of combat readiness. The Defence Ministry also wants to prompt residents' involvement in the comprehensive defense system, so they know what they must do in order to defend their country. A booklet with all the necessary information for residents will be released in the fall, the booklet will also be available online, added Pabriks. These all steps should be considered as the attempts to influence Latvian authorities and population and to force them to grand the U.S. the possibility to do what it thinks is better for Latvia. The U.S. wants to create a condition under which the small Baltic States cannot exist or behave by themselves. The key recommendation given by the authors of the report is ""the United States, other NATO allies and partners, and the European Union could take further concrete steps to support the Baltic countries in developing their total defense and unconventional warfare capabilities."" And they will take these steps even if Latvia is not ready to accept their help."
18,Contrary To The Ethiopian Transport Minister's False & Misleading Statements - ET302 Flight Crew Did Not Follow Procedures,news-society," 'CONTRARY TO THE ETHIOPIAN TRANSPORT MINISTER'S FALSE & MISLEADING STATEMENTS - The ET302 Flight Crew Did Not Follow Procedures (v3.0)' VIRTUALLY EVERY NEWS AGENCY HAS ECHOED THE WORDS OF ETHIOPIAN TRANSPORT MINISTER DAGMAWIT MOGES WHICH WERE THAT THE ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES FLIGHT CREW 'performed all the procedures repeatedly provided by the manufacturer but was not able to control the aircraft.' These words coincident with the April 4, 2019 release of the preliminary report on the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight #302. IS THAT TRUE? DID THE ETHIOPIAN FLIGHT CREW FOLLOW BOEING PROCEDURES? DID BOEING EVEN HAVE A PROCEDURE FOR THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THE ETHIOPIAN FLIGHT CREW WAS ENCOUNTERING? UNFORTUNATELY, THE ANSWER TO THE FIRST QUESTION IS NO! (The proof of which is contained in the very preliminary report that the Ethiopian Transport Minister was referencing and explained more fully in the paragraphs that follow). AND, UNFORTUNATELY, THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION IS ALSO NO! (Boeing has a procedure for 'runaway stabilizer' and it is being passed off by Boeing as a procedure to deal with the MCAS situation that happened to Ethiopian Airline Flight #302; however, in actuality, it is not. That is why the American Airlines pilots and their union representative have stated that the MCAS feature was not documented and they were never told that it existed. The runaway trim procedure has been around forever in the modern jet age. It was part of Boeing flight manuals for virtually the entire line of B-737's dating back to the early 1960s. Boeing is attempting to 'shoehorn' it here as a procedure for MCAS. It is not, related maybe, but it was never intended for the purpose for which it is being used by Boeing at this moment in time). IT SHOULD NOT BE MISTAKEN FOR A PROCEDURE TO DEAL WITH AN MCAS MALFUNCTION BECAUSE IT SIMPLY IS NOT. AT BEST, IT IS A 'WORK-AROUND.' IT IS A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD. [1] This back-door 'technique' to mitigate MCAS actually makes the situation better and worse. It takes away one of the very few TOOLS available to the flight crew to counteract what MCAS has done. In this instance, you are actually taking away/de-powering your electric stab trim (the switches on the Captain & F/O yokes). The very tool that the flight crew needs to counteract what MCAS has done (NOTE: the stab trim cut-out switches do not turn-off or depower MCAS as they merely take away MCAS's ability to control the stabilizer. At the same time, the switches take away the pilot & copilot's ability to control the stabilizer trim). A safe MCAS design would (1) first and foremost have visual and aural warnings/indications that the MCAS system has been activated and is operational/moving the stabilizer trim, (2) have a means for the flight crew to physically override MCAS, (3) have a means for the pilots to de-power MCAS directly without sacrificing their ability to utilize stabilizer pith-trim (absent some distant circuit breaker), (4) would have a specific procedure to deal with unwanted MCAS activation, (5) would have multiple sources of data input & crosscheck capability built-in (dual AOA input & analysis), (6) would have warning lights and pilot warnings when the system malfunctioned or received conflicting data, and (7) it would be fully documented and integrated with focused flight & ground crew training ensuring that all B-737 MAX 8 flight crews were fully aware of how the system/s operate and how to safely manage them when anomalies present themselves. None of these essential safety features exist in the current Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft & systems design at present. IT WAS DESIGNED TO DISABLE STABILIZER TRIM THAT HAD RUNAWAY - UNCONTROLLABLY (continuously & uncontrollably running away, that is). IT HAS SIMILARITIES TO WHAT MCAS WAS DOING, BUT IT IS BY NO MEANS THE SAME THING, NO MATTER WHAT BOEING IS TRYING TO SELL THE GENERAL FLYING PUBLIC IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO REWRITE HISTORY. MCAS WAS NOT DOCUMENTED AND THEREFORE THE FLIGHT OPERATIONS MANUAL (FOM) HAD NO PROCEDURES FOR MCAS EVENTS. PROOF OF THAT FACT THAT THE FLIGHT CREW DID NOT FOLLOW WHAT THE RUNAWAY TRIM PROCEDURE CALLED FOR IS CONTAINED IN THE VERY REPORT FROM WHICH THE ETHIOPIAN TRANSPORT MINISTER MAKES REFERENCE. IT JUST IS NOT INTUITIVELY OBVIOUS. YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR. It is painfully clear that the flight crew did follow the recommended procedure for runaway trim instructing them to 'DISENGAGE THE STAB TRIM SYSTEM and leave it off for the remainder of the flight.' BUT THERE IS MORE TO IT. THE PROCEDURE RECOMMENDS TO 'TURN-IT-OFF AND LEAVE-IT-OFF FOR THE REMAINDER-OF-THE-FLIGHT.' Is that what the ET302 flight crew did? NO, unfortunately, it is not! IT APPEARS THAT THE ETHIOPIAN TRANSPORT MINISTER AND THE PRESS MISSED THAT VERY IMPORTANT FACT. In the transcript of the preliminary report on page 11 of 33 at 05:43:11 it reads, 'about 32-seconds before the end of the recording, at approximately 13,400' [2] two momentary manual electric trim inputs are recorded in the ANU (aircraft nose-up direction). The stabilizer moved in the ANU (aircraft nose-up direction) direction from 2.1 to 2.3 units.' At 05:43:20 approximately 5-seconds after the last manual electric trim input, and AND (aircraft nose down) from 2.3 to 1.0 unit in approximately 5-seconds. The aircraft began pitching nose down. Additional simultaneous aft column force was applied but the nose down pitch continues, eventually reaching 40° nose down. The stabilizer positioned varied between 1.1 and 0.8 units for the remainder of the recording.' WHAT HAVE WE HERE? - THE SMOKING GUN ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON HERE, THE SIMPLE FACT IS THAT, ONE OF THE FLIGHT CREW MEMBERS MUST HAVE RE-ENGAGED THE STAB TRIM BY MOVING THE STAB CUTOUT SWITCHES BACK TO THE 'ON' POSITION. WHY DO YOU ASK? Because shortly after 05:43:20 MANUAL ELECTRIC TRIM INPUT is recorded again. That simply is not possible unless the STAB TRIM CUTOUT switches were re-engaged or moved back to the 'ON POSITION' (contrary to the runaway stabilizer procedure) and one of the pilots activated the trim switches on their control wheel (yoke). MORE IMPORTANTLY, the reference at 05:43:20 to '5-seconds after the last manual electric trim input, an AND (aircraft nose down) automatic trim command occurred and the aircraft trim moved in the AND direction from 2.3 to 1.1 units in 5-seconds (THAT HAS MCAS WRITTEN ALL OVER IT). The aircraft began pitching nose down and the aircraft was heading for the ground at speeds well in excess of the maximum allowable airspeed (VMO) (barber-pole) (red-line) at more than a 40° nose down pitch angle. BINGO! This is the MCAS rearing its ugly head again and sending the aircraft plummeting from the sky at a horrific rate of speed & rate of descent. That is the MCAS signature sequence (reset; ~9-seconds of nose down trim (AND) or approximately 2.0 units nose down; etc.). It was RESET when the combination of turning the STAB TRIM SWITCHES back to the ON POSITION & activation of manual electric trim by the pilots was activated and then ceased. This triggered the MCAS to re-activate and come back with a vengeance. This time, however, MCAS went through its programmed sequence-of-events at barber pole speeds (in excess of VMO) and would have immediately sent the aircraft into a roller-coaster-like pitch-over an immediate high-speed dive into the ground. The failure to follow the directive to place the STAB TRIM SWITCHES TO CUTOUT AND LEAVE THEM THERE FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FLIGHT, SEALED THE FATE OF THE FLIGHT CREW AND EVERYONE ON BOARD ETHIOPIAN FLIGHT 302 THAT DAY. May they rest in peace. [1] Make no mistake about it, the B-737 MAX 8 is a 'flawed design' that manifested itself by attempting to stretch the design limits beyond aerodynamic limits and presumptions that were set-in-stone (constraints) when the first B-737 rolled off the assembly line in Rent on, WA some 50+ years ago. In arriving at the 'make or break' decision to push the limits of what can and cannot be done aerodynamically with the B-737, Boeing chose not to start from scratch and design, build and certify an entirely new aircraft because (1) it takes time (a luxury Boeing didn't have with Airbus offering a competing line of aircraft in the single-aisle arena, and (2) the costs were dramatically greater. 'Work-Around' & 'back-door' are terms for using a set of techniques that come from years of experience. Often they are necessary as the result of a poorly designed aircraft system or 'design flaw.' Sometimes, these are published and sometimes they are not. When they are unpublished, they are often passed-on from flight crew-member to flight crew-member. No matter how they are utilized, they require a certain amount of 'time in the airplane' and/or a pilot with a 'lot of flying experience in the aircraft to which they are being applied.' We are talking about thousands and thousands of hours of experience in what they refer to as 'type.' A published procedure is easy to work with. The steps are contained in the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) and pilots are trained and knowledgeable about its purpose and use. A 'Work-Around' and/or 'back-doors' are utilized when no procedure for the specific anomaly exists or is published. These require much more in-depth systems knowledge, understanding, and experience. What you do to or with one system can have ramifications with another completely different system. Much like using a 'Run Away Stab Trim' procedure to deal with an MCAS anomaly. It is not the correct tool for the job, but it can under limited circumstances, get the job done. All of these factors are something that Ethiopian Airlines was in short very supply of [keep in mind that even though First Officer made the right call as to the source of the problem (MCAS), he had less than 200-300 total flight hours, very little of which was in the B-737 MAX 8. He was fresh out of flight school, accumulating little more than the minimum requirement for a commercial pilot certificate]. [2] The FDR records standard pressure altitude values which are not corrected for airport barometer setting. NOTE 1: The throttles remained at 'max power' after being set for take-off and neither pilot reduced the power by pulling the throttles back at any time during the flight. Even though flight instruments on both sides of the cockpit indicated an over-speed condition and every aural warning known to man (clackers) were screaming at them that they were going TOO FAST (exceeding the design limit airspeed of the airframe), neither pilot had the presence of mind (situational awareness in pilot jargon) to pull the throttles back. NOTE 2: On the picture included here, the STAB TRIM SWITCHES are 'guarded' switches. However, for reasons that are unclear, they may not be 'guarded' switches on the B-737 MAX 8."
19,Changes Being Made To ACS in April 2019,news-society," In September 2018, the Security Industry Authority (SIA) announced they were making a large amount of changes to their Approved Contractor Scheme (ACS), these changes will be implemented on April 1st 2019 and will effect almost all Private Security Companies that are SIA Approved Contractors. The Approved Contractor Scheme has existed for many years, first being introduced in 2006 with the aim to ""protect the public and to maintain and improve standards in the private security industry"", since its inception the ACS has undergone numerous changes, however this latest review has taken a much broader look at the scheme and its faults, which we at Region Security feel is long overdue as many of these flaws have existed for many years prior to this review. Existing as a Security Company for many years, we here at Region Security Guarding have found the scoring of -3 to 1 from ACS to be broken and confusing for both us and customers and the general consensus between security companies seems to be that the system leaves us with an uneven playing field and that the requirements need to be much more clear and transparent. The sector has also stated that clarity is needed in places and that overlap of requirements needs to be removed in order to streamline the scheme. When SIA spoke of the changes that they would make to the scheme they stated that language clarity, additional detail, streamlining, removing negative statement and changing the format and presentation of the scheme were among them. We feel that all of these changes will be a huge benefit to all Security Companies and businesses who require our services, making the system easier to understand and ensuring that only the security companies that meet the requirements are a part of the approved contractor scheme. We also feel that the old method of providing negative scores gave inaccurate results as categories that businesses did poorly in took away from their overall score, we feel that the new system of always providing positive points gives a more accurate and simple overall score and also provides positive reinforcement to the security organisations receiving the score. The new ACS standard will be instated and made mandatory from April 2019 onwards so us at Region as well as all other companies in the industry will need to make sure they are ready to be assessed against the new indicators and requirements in the new self-assessment booklet that is being released via SIA’s website. This revised Self-Assessment Workbook (SAW) contains the new quality indicators that every SIA approved contractor must show has been met in April 2019 in order to be apart of the approved contractor scheme. This is a step in the right direction as the new, clearer indicators make it easier for us at Region to understand the necessary steps we need to take in order to maintain our approved contractor status. It also makes things easier for SIA to decide which companies should be given approved contractor status, in turn making sure that consumers and costumers only receive the highest quality services when choosing an approved contractor. We feel that over the years the amount of SIA Approved Contractors has been increasing far too drastically, causing us to fear that a large number of these businesses may not be credible or sustainable. SIA is attempting to respond to the growing number of approved contractors with it’s revised ""fit and proper"" eligibility criteria, which has the goal of ensuring that only organisations that SIA deems sound, sustainable and credible can join the ACS. This enhanced scrutiny will also reassure clients and partners that they’re working with only the best security businesses within the industry. We’re glad that the SIA has taken this feedback into account and are working to shortlist the number of businesses in the security sector with Approved Contractor Status. All Approved Contractors must now also provide justification and evidence as to how and why their Security Guards are not PAYE. This change is to ensure that approved contractors are employing their guards on the correct basis and are complying with tax and employment laws. Region Security is fully onboard with these changes as it ensures that all employees of approved contractors enjoy proper employment rights and are treated fairly and appropriately. There is also going to be a change in the way that SIA markets the ACS, this new approach provides extra support for businesses, with a resource centre for applicants of the ACS and existing businesses within the scheme, this resource centre will advise security companies on how to meet and exceed the minimum standards and requirements set by the ACS. This approach is excellent news for the security industry as a whole as it assists all security companies with being the best possible organisations they can be and Region Security will be sure to take advantage of the support to improve ourselves over the upcoming months and years. One element of the ACS that the SIA have stated will not be altered is the fees, with them opting not to alter the fee structure at the moment and keeping the existing headcount model in place instead. In the future however fee calculation will be reviewed on its own with other proposed models such as revenue based, or headcount based on full time equivalent. All Security Companies under the SIA Approved Contractor scheme will fully consulted and have full opportunity to feed into the review of these models. All of the changes being made due to the review are being published in a special edition of ACS update. SIA held a number of events throughout October 2018 to explain in great detail the outcomes of the ACS review in locations such as London, Birmingham, Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow. The event showcased an in depth look at the new, streamlined self-assessment workbook, their arrangements to create a level-playing field via the new eligibility criteria and a chance for businesses to find out more about the newly available License Management Service. Stephen McCormick, Director of Operations and Standards at SIA has spoken out on the matter: ""During this review we consulted extensively with approved contractors and the wider private security industry to fundamentally test the integrity of the ACS and its ability to drive improvement. Our evidence tells us that the scheme has achieved this aim and has had a transformational effect in driving up standards within the industry. We are building on a successful quality standard and have made a number of key changes which will strengthen the scheme. We are building on a successful quality standard and have made a number of key changes which will strengthen the scheme. Our aim for the future of the ACS is a growing partnership with private security industry businesses that demonstrates the value and contribution they make to UK PLC.​​​​"" There are currently 852 Security Companies that hold Approved Contractor Status with this number increasing rapidly. We feel that all the changes being made to the scheme, its regulations and its requirements are a smart move by the SIA as it ensures that the scheme only includes quality, trust-worthy Security Companies, giving customers more faith that when they choose an SIA Approved Security Company, they are choosing one of the countries finest and have nothing to worry about when it comes to receiving a professional, well-executed Security Service. Region Security Guarding is excited to see the results of this review and the changes it brings to the security sector. Moving forward we would like to see continual improvements to the scoring of the Approved Contractor Scheme. We feel that currently there are currently too many companies holding the approved contractor status, causing the accreditation to lose a lot of its value as even companies who receive poor customer reviews tend to hold the approved contractor status. To resolve these issues, we here at Region Security would like to see SIA gradually making the requirements for becoming approved more and more strict to cut down on the amount of poorly performing companies retaining approved status. With these changes being apart of the ACS will hold more value and security companies will strive harder to improve their services and the way they function as a business as a whole, benefiting the entire security industry as well as customers and consumers.

20,What should you consider when planning an event?,news-society," Have you been at an event where the WiFi is patchy, slow or non-existent? That’s down to congestion – too many users sapping the bandwidth of a system that can’t cope with the demand. People today expect fast, reliable internet connections at business and trade conferences, with the success of such events depending on it. But while most business venues have WiFi, there is no guarantee it will be strong and reliable enough. Here are some of the main factors to consider when planning on how best to get your event connected. Pump up the Volume – Supply and Demand People are increasingly likely to bring more than one device to an event. In fact, the average works out at two and a half devices per person, so if you’ve got 500 people coming to yours, the WiFi connection might have to cope with 1250 phones, tablets and computers demanding a signal. Different events place different demands on the network, too. At a festival, 10 per cent of the crowd typically go online at a time, but at a party or conference, the entire audience might be invited to log on at the same time. Volume of WiFi traffic is a key consideration at the planning stage. Wall to Wall – Getting Optimum Coverage Great WiFi can make a huge difference to your event but we believe it’s something that should be seen and not heard. When people start talking about the WiFi it’s usually for all the wrong reasons. Trusting to a venue’s technology capability risks letting poor coverage overshadow your event. Forward planning is vital to ensure the venue’s main areas have a good, strong signal. Even then, most venues will have black spots that make it impossible to roam while online. Twice as Good – WiFi Dual Band It’s useful to understand some of the basic technology of WiFi when thinking about an event’s coverage. The WiFi found in most commercial venues runs on the original 2.4 GHz frequency, but this provides a signal that is often weak, susceptible to interference and increasingly congested. The new standard is the superior 5 GHz WiFi which is supported by most new smartphones and is better at passing through walls. Get Me Connected uses dual band technology – both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz – to deliver a more reliable WiFi experience and our technology is also fully compatible with the latest AC standard. Directing Traffic – Shaping WiFi Usage Restricting the amount of WiFi data is standard practice when putting on a conference, so that heavy use by a few individuals – streaming live video for example – doesn’t affect everyone else. A quality WiFi connection will allow you to shape and control the traffic to suit your needs while allowing unrestricted access for you and your event team. Need for Speed – Faster Connections Above all, a successful business conference will have a super-fast WiFi connection that can cope with user demand. 10Mb per 100 users is our recommendation for a high usage crowd, while 2Mb per 100 users is standard for smaller events. You can test the internet speed at a venue with websites such as speedtest.net. When you run a test, you are looking for a ‘ping speed’ of less than 30ms and an ‘internet speed’ of 2Mb per 100 users, so for 1,000 low usage users (checking emails and social media) 20Mb should be fine. A poor Wi-Fi connection is bad for business. Together we can ensure your WiFi connection is a fast and seamless experience for everyone. Get yourself connected today. Never Skip a Beat – Bonded Connections To provide the resilient connections that people require, don’t just use one, use many. Using software-defined WANs you can have faster, unbreakable connections that allow you to provide seamless WiFi for your event. This is perfect for Broadcasts, Streams and other connection-dependent events that benefit from uninterrupted internet. Using this technology multiple different connections from MPLS, Fibre, DSL and even Cellular can be bonded and utilised in load balancing to make sure that if any device experiences issues such as latency, packet loss or disconnections they would be moved over to another connection."

1,Saving the world with Eco-Powered WiFi for Events,news-society," In the current worldwide climate of pollution and global warming, green technology is a win for all. Not only is it saving our planet, it’s saving money, as renewable energy cuts down the need to pay for electricity created from fossil fuels and other non-renewable sources. That’s why at Get Me Connected we have endeavoured to make our WiFi technology as eco-friendly and sustainable as possible. How Do We Provide Eco-Powered Connectivity? Our main source of eco-power comes from the sun. Back at our offices we use solar power to charge up all of our batteries, small or large, so that we have power ready and prepared ready for any event. Even if the sun isn’t out, as is often the case in the UK, our batteries are pre-charged over time beforehand. Our battery technology can power everything we provide, from Plug and Go kits that provide WiFi for smaller crowds, to the access points, bridges and backhaul kit required for larger scale events. Not only do we provide pre-charged batteries, but we also have the ability to set up solar panels on site, keeping batteries charged constantly. This means that we can simply place down access points around a site and keep them going for as long as the sun shines. An Off-Grid Solution Because of this utilisation of eco-power to provide our super-fast, robust internet connection, we can create a WiFi network anywhere. Our solar charged batteries and use of solar panels mean that no wired power is required on site. This also means that we can get a WiFi infrastructure set up in no time at all as there is no messing about finding plug sockets and trying to get our kit in the perfect places, as we can just place them wherever there is a space. Sustainability For The Future Of Events We really believe that making the events industry green is a step in the right direction. The future of events may very well be aligned with the future of our planet, with the industry adapting to fit into our ever-changing lives. Diesel power generators are a major contributing factor to the emissions of festivals and events, as they are used regularly to power everything from lighting to water pumps. Switching as many of the generators of this 42 billion-pound industry to sustainable energy will help massively towards making our events greener."
2,The Boeing B-737 Max 8 Smoke Screen - Flight Safety Should Never Be 'Optional',news-society," Why you might ask, is Boeing flooding the airwaves about a ‘software update/fix’ and the stated fact that ‘they were working on a fix prior to the most recent crash.’ SOFTWARE UPDATE, SOFTWARE UPDATE, SOFTWARE UPDATE, the B-737 MAX 8 only requires a QUICK FIX, a minor software update/tweak and nothing more. [1] Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg stated that, ‘work is progressing thoroughly and rapidly to learn more about the Ethiopian Airlines accident,’ and that the Company is releasing a software update and ‘related pilot training’ for the 737 MAX.’ Additionally, Muilenburg stated, ‘Boeing has been in the business of aviation safety for more than 100-years, and we’ll continue providing the best products, training, and support to our global airline customers and pilots.’ Boeing has also repeatedly stated that it 'continues to have full confidence in the safety of the 737 Max.' Do you think that is the Boeing engineers that designed the MAX 8 speaking, or the PR & Legal Departments? Do you believe that they are spewing ‘truth’ or attempting to limit Boeing’s liability? Never the less, this is the Boeing party line, the SCRIPT if you will, that has been generated to deflect a thorough investigation, limit financial exposure/risk, and once again do as little as possible to correct serious safety of flight design issues. Everyone at Boeing is reading from the same script and towing the well-orchestrated party line. There is a reason for that. THE SMOKE SCREEN It sounds an awful lot like, look over here – look over here. Pay no attention to the elephant in the room, the one behind that curtain over there. No need to look any further, it just requires a minor software update/fix and nothing more? BOEING PROPOSES A QUICK FIX Boeing proposes a QUICK FIX; one that does not require any aircraft modification (which would effectively ground the B-737 MAX 8 fleets around the world for a protracted period-of-time); or focused pilot flight and ground training (which would render pilots incapable of flying the B-737 MAX 8 unless and until the required training was accomplished). The B-737 MAX 8 problems are not going away with a simple ‘software update/fix.’ Introducing an airplane that dramatically changes the aerodynamic and flight characteristics from those that were embodied in the entire B-737 line of aircraft before it (dating back to 1967), without requiring extensive documentation, ground and flight differences training boggles the mind. This could happen only if (1) the FAA was asleep at the switch, or (2) if the FAA had relinquished critical control and authority over the aircraft design and certification processes directly to aircraft manufacturers. Boeing would then be allowed unfettered design authority to do whatever they pleased, even if choices were made that compromised flight safety. In a nutshell, the manufacturers could choose costs over safety (much like they are doing right now proposing a quick fix software update when much more is required to provide an acceptable level of safety to the flying public). Essentially, Boeing could then include aircraft system (for example MCAS) that departed from long-held safety standards requiring multiple-layers of flight safety (redundancy) and would never have allowed the design or implementation of an aircraft system wherein a single component failure could disable an aircraft or compromise overall flight safety. Will Boeing get away with it? Will the smokescreen work? Only if the flying public and those in the aviation community allow it. Should they? Absolutely not! AIRCRAFT FLIGHT SAFETY OPTIONAL? Since when, and under whose watch, did aircraft flight safety become optional? SERIOUS DESIGN FLAWS (1) Designing an aircraft that lacks redundancy [a flight control system that looks or accepts input from a single source or device (angle of attack indicator) (AOA) conflicts with safety and design standards that have been years in the making; (2) Designing an aircraft that embodies a flight control system that cannot be overridden by the pilot conflicts with safety and design standards that have been years in the making; and (3) Even though systems were available to deal with issues arising from this flight control system - Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System software (MCAS), Boeing did not make them standard equipment and the FAA overseeing the certification process did not override Boeing and instead allowed the protective systems to remain ‘optional.’ [1] [2] A DEVELOPING STORY This story will continue to unfold and Boeing is rapidly losing control of the argument and the ability to ‘frame the issue’ and thereby ‘limit the damage’ caused, as a direct result. Short-cuts to aircraft safety are almost always extremely costly. Unfortunately, those that pay the price are ultimately innocent passengers and the price they pay is with their lives. As you can plainly see, the issues surrounding the similar crashes have deep roots in the aviation industry/community and involve much more than just the pilots and the respective airlines involved. This B-737 MAX 8 mess is mired in greed, mismanagement, inadequate or nonexistent FAA oversight, inadequate and deficient flight & ground training requirements, an incestuous relationship between manufacturers and government oversight agencies (FAA) (including job opportunities/lateral transfers for federal regulators acting in an official capacity that cooperate and gain 'favor' with Boeing) and 346 people's lives that were cut far too short, as a direct result. FOOTNOTES: [1] By the end of January, Boeing had delivered 350 of the Max 8 models. They have been in commercial use since 2017. A small number of Boeing's Max 9s are also operating. The Max 7 and 10 models, not yet delivered, are due for roll-out in the next few years. [2] The New York Times reports that both vehicles lacked an ‘AOA disagree’ light - a warning light that indicates when the aircraft's two AOA sensors provide different readings—and an angle of attack indicator. Since the MCAS system relied only on one of the aircraft's AOA sensors, the disagree light and AOA indicator would have given the flight crew visible evidence of a sensor failure and prompted them to disable the MCAS. But both of these features were sold by Boeing as expensive add-ons. And many discounts and smaller airlines declined to purchase them, as they were not required by FAA regulators (Airline management had no way to know that what they were passing on was critical safety of flight items. Boeing did not tell them and the FAA did not require them. The end result was, that as a cost-saving measure, many airlines simply opted out). [2] The 737 MAX MCAS is a significant change from the avionics of previous Boeing 737s and is required because of the MAX aircrafts' much larger engines and the resultant change in handling. The MCAS includes a feature that determines when the aircraft is pointed upward relative to the flow of air across its surface at an angle that could lead to the loss of sufficient lift to keep the airplane flying—what's known as a stall. To prevent a stall, MCAS (like other anti-stall systems on commercial aircraft) adjusts the aircraft's tail stabilizers to push the nose of the aircraft down, boosting its airspeed. The AOA sensor is what MCAS relies upon to determine whether the aircraft is close to reaching that stall condition. But even though the 737 MAX has multiple AOA sensors for redundancy, MCAS relied on only one of them at a time for input. That's now being changed in the software update. Boeing has been taking other measures to correct its own stall. Boeing's lobbyists made $827,000 in political contributions in February. The donations, which were reflected in a recently filed Federal Election Commission report, were the most that Boeing has ever donated in a single month to political campaigns. The Department of Justice and Department of Transportation are now conducting investigations into Boeing's original safety certification process. Engineers who worked at Boeing reported that the company's analysis of the safety impact of the MCAS system misled Federal Aviation Administration officials about the actual risk associated with the system, and Boeing oversaw most of the aircraft's safety certification itself."
3,The Faltering State of Creativity,news-society," The faltering state of creativity is suggestive of the current condition of societal interaction that lacks a profound sense of originality, imagination and vision. That is only the starting point of the perspective that points in the direction of society’s failure to ascend to higher levels of intellectual awakening. Creativeness transcends all that has gone before and provokes a different way of looking at the reality of human actions. The quest is to transform and rise above through a myriad pathways to a loftier level of thought and subsequent achievement. Visionary resourcefulness is the formulation and implementation, from ideation to discovery, the fighting spirit to journey into forgotten realms of self-evolution. For the quest to unfold the mysteries of discovery in the adventure of the personal journey, it should not take a psychologist, or anyone else from the assorted fields of pseudoscience to tell us what is or is not creativity. That is the essential task of human individuality to embrace the journey. Yet, by cowardly resistance, many forsake the sacred nature of the hunt, for the safe consensus of ease and comfort. Faltering, failing and fading into the abysmal eventuality of extinction by boredom, as well as other devolving degradations, the human species presently suffers a degrading lack of creativity. From academia to the political arena, including commerce and news reporting, the bland and uninspiring communal nexus daily demonstrates a slant toward implosive stupidity. While nothing new under the sun stirs a probability of dissent as to an ideological lamentation, to suggest creativity as an absolute would not be the claim in this writing. Instead, the perspective is multifaceted. To be resourcefulness infers activity which is intricate and includes physical and mental actions engaged in a synchronized process of purposeful instigation. Such inclination, matched by personal proclivity and a bunch of other complex dimensions, exudes and expresses a mindset determined to bring about an intended reality. To what has gone before and do something from a different perspective, using the same foundational basis, strikes at the central nature of creativity. Yet, with that comes a sense of humility. While all human actions reflect choices, to demonstrate by humble essence artful endeavors, self-evolution speaks toward the maturity of the innovator. Controlling the egoistic and prideful arrogance as the artist or inventor, shows an aspect of character that gives special meaning to that which has been presented. Creativity ought to reflect a higher state of vision. To break the habitual way of doing things, bravely questioning the world and continuing inquiry in spite the answers given, the inquisitive ""mind"" ceaselessly torments itself with different ways of thinking. Problem solving engages the hidden and the known to circumvent the boring diversions of daily distractions. Urgency to explore the real and unreal possesses the scary notion of finality at some distant moment. The primacy of thinking is such that it never ceases in the present points of reference. So a different perspective outside the normal is important. Maybe not different in the sense that historical references have already suggested similarities, but inspirationally fine tuning the personal perspective. In order to let play passionate thinking, that otherwise unleash the imaginative forces within, courageous acts of presence dares one to be set free. Yet, overall, maturity raises the criticality of unselfish motivations. Liberation challenges all the sensory mechanisms to get on the fringes of divergence. Bias precludes the pure efficacy of absolute objectivity, yet influences just long enough to provoke maturity. But for the bias of subjective validation, the player brings his or her shortcomings to the arena, to claim some diminutive right of acclaimed validation. To every entry upon a social interaction, everyone bring preconceptions to the self-interests of the venture. Bias unduly influences the conclusion, as the observer makes person the observation as well as the intent of purposeful design. Whether an act of construction, investigative query, or marking strategy, the observer hastens the onset of a biased observation. As such, care ought to be exercised closely, with healthy skeptical inclination toward the experienced inclination of cynical maturation. Over a decade ago, a major collegiate business magazine, presumably a prestigious Ivy League publication, lamented the eroding state of American creativity. Once powerfully the ""land of opportunity"", the sad reality mourns the loss of a competitive edge. While some would argue the threat is of an external nature, others counter such claims by suggesting the danger comes from within American society. In a measure called the ""Creative Class Index"", the U.S. struggles to maintain 11th place among 25 others countries. Innovation slowly devolves over time. Not only is ""stupid thinking"", or alternatively, ""anti-thinking"", in vogue, the perpetual regurgitation of consistent redundancy takes mainstream center stage. Mundane, lackluster, and dull might be negative descriptors that could be applied to the ""infotainment"", or entertainment realm. While this segment of society represents one part of the many faceted aspects of creativity, the potential influence is significant. This includes artists of every kind, writers of various genres, movie and television production, and 24-7 news reporting and social commentary. From the classroom to the boardroom, to commerce and industry, to the crime lab and the sci-fi wizardry of computer technicians, the potential for innovation begins with clever, cunning and calculated ideation. Human ingenuity goes beyond whining and complaining about hurt feelings or the foolish intolerance to tolerate the differences of others. Yet, the majority suffer the subjectivity of self-imposed victimization in their intentional immaturity. Claiming authority, for instance, where no experience and deeply researched factual analysis exists foments the illicit redundancy of repetition in foolhardy ways. As such, in any claim of fame to assert some nebulous notion of authority on anything ought to be greeted by healthy skepticism. A claim of special insight, unique exceptional knowledge or boast of a ""new study"", is matter of intentional arrogance by the claimant, unless validation is invited by the necessity of proof. In short, a matter at hand demonstrates an element of creativity when open-minded debate and analysis is encouraged. For the betterment of individuality, wiser enhancements are afforded through mutually accepted skepticism and rigorous investigation. Uncertainty warrants deeper thinking, suspiciousness figures the probability of error or deception, and cynicism encourages alternatives. With that, the consideration of inventiveness likely comes from the purposeful ideation formulated through the introspection of serious meditative analysis. In a devolving society, bent on self-destruction, the cowardice of conventional conformity, as well as mundane repetition in clichéd or stereotyped characterizations, as in movies and television, hasten the faltering state of creativity. In various media of the vast social networks for ""infotainment"", personal opinion increasingly supersedes reliance upon facts, figures and relevant evidentiary validation. Productive civil engagement for remedial articulation of serious social issues mires in the abundance of uneducated, ill-experienced and otherwise poorly informed claimants of one form of ""authority"" or ""expertise"" in favor of another. Lazy thinking permeates the mainstream replete with countless examples of intellectually barbarous acts of stupidity. A societal shift beyond the efficacy of commentary based on the factuality of data, toward a demeaning and condescending erosion of interactivity debases the prospects of creative individualism. The shallow nature of conjecture is destructive. Nebulous conjecture pretends to be ascended efficacy of intellectual pretentions. With advances in technology comes foolhardy efforts to prefer playing with apps versus investigating critical social issues. In a bland, unimaginative and mundane atmosphere in which creativity is neither inspiring nor motivational, a debasing prospect suggests regressive inclination toward collapse. In an overly pampered, gluttonous, and shallow thinking culture, one in which alleged ""social warriors"" pontificate egregious fallacies of bogus conjecture, the warning signs are evident of an ""empire’s"" eminent collapse. By easy and willful seduction, many allow their senses to be dulled to the extent necessary to their self-validation that overrides the necessity to be artistic. At a rudimentary level of ideation, originality is likely no more than taking the known aspects of reality and reconstructing the elemental materiality in more resourceful ways. Of such proclivities, the primacy of thinking, or provoking imaginative prospects, is essential. According to some who philosophize on these matters, the creative person is a risk taker in a process of maturation. By neither rule nor restraint, creativity is the boundless process of rising above the mainstream. Likewise, moving oneself to become a mature adult, who seeks wisdom at more enlightened and liberated levels, relates to the vitality of inspirational creativity. Self-evolving to become a more differentiated personality requires hard work to become a better version of the original self. Therein resides the spooky and creepy aversion to inventiveness. Relentless self-reliance in rigorous energetic actions to ensure intellectual, experiential and skillful productive development demands arduous labors. With that heavy mindful lifting, diligent dedication is exhausting. For the immediacy of the moment, a potent inner sense of urgency pursues a fanciful notion that demonstrates imaginative workings of willful effort. The thinker dreams in farsighted ways to chase an adventure through the multidimensional intricacy of inventive ideations. Even though fearful, threatening and debasing the animosities might be, the images of dreaming insights beyond the normal realm necessitate ignoring the detractors. Determination in personal differentiation for the wholeness of individuality within, invites the strength of healthy skepticism, tinctured by a modicum of cynical insightfulness. That’s of the utmost necessity to avoid submission to the constraints of normalcy. On that, who decides the delineation between normal and abnormal? For the sake of status quo, the easy way is opposite the well-worn paths of ""playing the game"" and avoiding risks. It’s all too simple to follow the rest of the group and avoid controversy. Such does not require a lot of thought, habits, patterns and redundancy are simplistic. Routine emotional reactivity is not as demanding and doesn’t require deeply researched data or thoroughly substantiated evidence. If abnormal, for instance, is viewed outside the safe space of conformity to ""social rules"", then who makes the distinction? Noted here are the duly constituted ordinances and statutes, as matters of codified law, that officially define ""normality"" in terms of civil and criminal behavior. As to the realm of social interaction, public discourse, goings and comings in various relationships, at play, in school or at work, an unimaginative sense of complacency disturbs the thrills of adventure. Added to that, is the regressive reactivity of economic and political activities that devolve to the level of infantile narcissism in spiraling negativity. In all probability, the lethargy of stagnant, dull, and unoriginal inventiveness kills any semblance of productive abnormality. In the view of some passionately creative people, being abnormal is an act defiance against the mundane, the superficial and fraudulent. Atypical artistry is shunned. Acting outside the cubical of standard societal templates is alarming to those inside cubic limiations. Templates for which the conjecture is that one size fits all remain persistent against the artisans of desirable transforming processes. Yet, normalcy decries the abnormality of being different from the rest. Other than legally defined statutory prohibitions, who or what decides what is normal? Self-differentiation in a self-evolving quest of personal growth and maturity, is all about being different than everyone else. By contrast, mass marketing, global consumerism, educational and political status quo processes, collude to promote sameness. From school yard to workplace, a submissive haze of consensus is better described as acceptance of ""manufactured consent"". Others will readily proclaim that everyone is different, unique and special, yet at some point, below the horizon of creative enterprises, acquiescence gives way to status quo symbiosis. The suggestion here is, the inclination to suggest a healthy sense about interdependence, is misleading and dangerous. Perhaps a better term is parasitic, to describe a lackluster state of affairs in which dull and boring is view as exciting. Unoriginal, unimaginative and unmotivated, additionally describe a social drama that cuts across socio-economic and political boundaries. To paraphrase a famous scientist of the last century, more important than knowledge is imagination. It doesn’t take an academic to come up with a ""startling revelation"" that the U.S. suffers a loss of creativity across the wide spectrum of social endeavors. While some would accuse one generation over another, the loss of inventiveness crosses generational boundaries. As societies devolve, the fearful and ignorant hesitation to free oneself from all the gluttonous proclivities of crowd consensus, from assumption to consumption, from reason to emotion, breeds the bleeding discontent of defeatism. For all human history’s lessons, the species ignores and forgets the essentiality of the prologues to subsequent generational consequences. The descriptions of some describes others as stupid, inept, and incompetent. Serious self-reflection, profound self-transformation and calmness are often vacant upon the isles of wisdom’s serenity. To be alone in persistent and profound introspection is to be a rebel. A few brave ones can do that. The desire to be left alone, to escape and evade the herded busy intersections of social media and communal groupings, is a proclamation of independence. It is a mature and wise insistence of choice and requires action that adversely goes against the toleration of unquestioned consensus. Being a ""social warrior"" does not require either crowd or faction, and neither following nor fans. Instead, such is a state of exceptional creativity that ceaselessly wanders beyond the normal range of imagination. Fantasies come out of the shadows to share in the self-reliance. It is a perpetual dream state, beyond being awake and asleep. Realms of creativity are those mental places that transcend an awakened consciousness and pursues a persistent quest of discovery. For that, the valiant knight, the crusader, or the warrior perseveres in cautious proximity to the admonitions and desecrations of mainstream society. As there are many critics, there are fewer artists, as there are multitudes of detractors but a handful of innovators. In the sensual touch of creative instigation, to the culmination of ""out of the box"" inclination, some would argue the decline of human innovation. Such is a generalization with many aspects. Nonetheless, some researchers would contend that creativity in the U.S. has regressed since the 1990’s. The proactive introduction of that which is a variation on something, and can be described as being creative or imaginative for a moment in time, seems increasingly rare. One study suggests that in the marketplace of competitive commerce, competency relies more and more on being creatively engaged within the organization. To that end, as one business review magazine laments, openness to alternative viewpoints appears constrained by easy acceptance of the status quo. Personal ingenuity is out in front of doing things that might be considered edgy. Creativity lurches in many directions to enhance and expand the reaches of the imagination toward a more ascended transformation. Inventiveness suffers the decline of its relevance in a mechanistic consumption oriented society. Thoughtful innovations in arts and entertainment struggle for the passionate zealousness to fuse feeling and meaning.  A recent assessment from a major business institute challenges the current educational model in America’s K-12 and collegiate school systems. The accusation is made that contemporary education stifles a student’s creativity in condescending and counterproductive ways. By the promotion of a ""one size fits all"" template, or persistent admonitions to avoid risk taking, problem solving, inventiveness and being different. The condescending regression becomes more oppressive with the adherence to outdated and worn out instructional rubrics. Inventiveness has for the most part greatly diminished. Self-imposed stifling of individuality in sacrifice to the deities of mass consumption is a part of personal and group consensus to ensure the perpetuity of material gain. For the majority, status quo reliance on simplistic consistency does not require imaginative processes of serious introspection. To be a good worker, to fit into a slot and to allow pacification into the so called American Dream is the path of least resistance most desire to follow. Production of sameness, replicant and robotic imitation reduces the risks of taking leaps out of the box. As society regresses to the devolution of contrived extinction, the arrogance of shallow perspectives spins comforting tales of pabulum enriched trouble-free mediocrity. From academia to social media, the reaches of magical thinking for the sustenance of banal conformity traverses every aspect of human activity. Insipid dumbed down regurgitations of cinematic remakes comforts the ever burgeoning blather of juvenile multimedia genre. In movies for instance, not much strain of ""acting"" is demanded for American audience to be enthralled by CGI. Neither academic nor political enterprises strive for ascended radical departures from ""standard operating procedures"". Intellectualism is shunned in favor of feelings. Emotional reactivity attempts to use force or abuse in the anti-logic of stifling an alternative viewpoint. By the illogic of immature self-promotion in the neediness of cognitive bias, many will viciously attack another who dares disagree with the former claimant perspective. The social imbalance of negativity permeates daily life from academia to news reporting. As such, innovative mature thinking processes are thwarted in favor of the pleasures to be found in various forms of infantile narcissism. Persistent redundancy in anecdotal sufficiency lazily perpetrates the speciousness of alleged ""scientific"" revelation. Swift and certain actions to quicken the imaginative prospects of change, individuation, and visionary discovery were long since killed by public educational templates. Taxonomies, rubrics, and domain competencies pretentiously masquerade as learning initiatives. Unfortunately data does not support a positive outlook. In the superficial realms of movie making, for example, persistent remakes wallow in the sloppy reliance on technology to entertain, rather than inspire and educate. Acting remains uncomplicated in the classic sense for a matters of seconds and then lots of CGI. At the same time, not expressing much knowledge about much of anything, younger generations prefer the simplistic to the complex. In trouble-fee thinking, the scope and depth of deep thinking remains fixated on the cell phone or the next ""fun"" thing to do. So, mediocre attempts at various contemporary art forms, like movies, television, writing, etc. maintain a ""middle school"" level mentality. Unfortunately, in the diverse realms of ""arts and entertainment"", not to forget the vast reaches of academia and other societal institutions, the devolution of creative enterprises hastens social regression. Even the supposed intellectual bastions of ivory towers, educationally insulated and protected in sacred fiefdoms, alleged academic research perpetrates the redundancy of status quo consensus. In the ""social studies"" area, as in criminology, sociology and psychology, conventional textbook blathering often demonstrate the persistence of nothing new and different. Unproductive replication ensures the unimaginative consistency in unexciting simplicity. Any challenges to the time worn theories of the past generally incur the backlash of those desiring to safeguard the status quo. As one researcher points out, the American culture is filled with people who easily accept the ordinariness of unenthusiastic efforts to become innovative. Little changes over time and place where people are concerned. While American education is fixated on the same old rubrics, so called competencies, purported matrices and taxonomies, the competitive edge continues to slip away. Innovation erodes to boring complacency. Pointedly, the lack of serious talent in creativity reverberates through the many mainstream venues of infotainment. Of recent concern, a large west coast metropolitan newspaper reported the results of a ten-year study of American literacy. By comparison, researchers asserted that reading levels for American adults are significantly lower than for adults in other countries. Literacy levels were cited as below average with the U.S. falling behind Scandinavian countries, Japan, Australia and Korea. Others have offered the critical perspective that Americans have been mostly ""educated"" to become reliable workers as oppose to imaginative and inventive thinkers. In a faltering state of creativity, with the shallow divisive atmosphere of murky conjecture, magical thinking and bitter condescension, the downward trend of negativity actuates the human species driver toward extinction. Some scientist, the real ones, not the fake ones, already concluded time is running out for the human race. For a few, the brave artistic souls, to be creative means freedom. To be free, is to unleash personal liberation for the hallowed sanctity of personal enlightenment. Such is a journey to transform oneself into a better version than original. With a sense of profound of self-evolving maturity, the ascension to higher levels of insight comes through a personal quest to become a well-differentiated individual. Nonetheless, the detractors, the haters, the inept and incompetent, will harass and plague the existence of each moment. Some researchers and analysts of natural biological progressions have suggested humans in general are no longer evolving. In a physical sense, they are instead devolving."
4,A Day in the Life of a Florist,news-society," If you have ever thought about a day in the life of a florist on the Mornington Peninsula you’d probably guess that there’s plenty of coffee involved and a good amount of standing around. But you couldn’t be further from the truth. Of course, there is the usual flowers for the bride or the decorations for a special event, and these might be a lot of the bread and butter but in fact, there is considerably more to it. Understanding your product Like anyone else in business, a florist has to understand exactly what they are dealing with. You have been to the market and bought some flowers only for them not to bloom properly or to die within 24-hours to your ultimate frustration. Imagine that same frustration if this is your bread and butter. A florist needs to buy the stock before it reaches perfection, and then nurse it to the point where on the big day it is at its absolute best. This is not good luck. The florist has to be an expert in all sorts of individual plants and flowers. They have to understand how the flowers will respond, and how to hold them back from perfect for just a little while. There’s more to it than you’d think. Business Generation Like everyone else who runs their own business, a florist has to engage in activities that will develop business. It is not enough to hope someone will walk through your door with a huge order, although sometimes it can happen. Have you noticed the range of things a florist does these days? There are all the traditional activities like flowers for the bride you associate with the business, but they also add workshops into the mix, and team building activities. If you want an event where you do something different you could do worse than try out a workshop led by a florist on the Mornington Peninsula. At the very least it would be really different. Tied into the community It isn’t something you think about on a regular basis but florists are tied into the entertainment and event community at the hip. Any event which needs flowers often has a lot more requirements too. These are people who often work together and know each other well. Some florists have taken the idea to the natural next step and developed an event planning side to their business too. It makes sense, they are used to juggling a hundred things at once, making sure the DJ turns up on time is a minor line item. It turns out a day in the life could be anything. But rest assured that these people have a different weekend than you do. From Thursdays until Saturday night these people are busy, busy. Imagine doing the flowers for not one wedding but perhaps ten or eleven. Deliveries to churches and hotels are only a part of it. If you want to be married under an arch of flowers by the sea, you’d better start consulting with a creative florist sooner rather than later. That way you’ll get something amazing."
5,Social uncertainty weakens Latvia,news-society," The latest data of the Central Statistical Bureau (CSB) show that at the beginning of 2018 population of Latvia accounted for 1 million 934 thousand, which is 15.7 thousand people fewer than a year ago. Another survey conducted in 2018 by the CSB, shows that the share of Latvia’s population exposed to the risk of poverty grew by 1.2 percentage points from a year before to 446,000 people. CSB representatives said that the monthly at-risk-of-poverty threshold went up to EUR 367 per one-person household (EUR 330 monthly in 2016). In households consisting of two adults with two children aged under 14 years the monthly at-risk-of-poverty threshold reached EUR 770 in 2017 (EUR 694 in 2016). Dry statistics hides awful things. One forth of the population that is about 400 thousand can’t enjoy a normal life. According to the survey, the worst situation is in Latgale where 39.2 percent of residents live at-risk-of-poverty. The striking fact is the largest at-risk-of-poverty rate fixed in large families (couples with three or more children) (20.5 percent). Paradoxically how could a European state allow its children to starve and deprive of hope for basic needs, such as food, clothes and good education. The conclusion is disappointing: depriving people of hope for normal life, the state authorities deprive Latvia of future. Thus, there is nothing surprising in population outflow. What does all this mean? It means that Latvians are so poor, that they can’t think about something but food. They can’t be fully engaged in political, cultural or other spheres of life. They are not capable to support their children or parents. They exist, not live. That is probably the main reason for Latvians’ political apathy. Otherwise how to explain the protracted process of government formation, social problems. The only sphere that flourishes is defence. Latvia is one of a handful of NATO countries that spends 2 per cent on defence with more than 20 other members missing that goal. Thus, the government increases the defence spendings but does not pay enough attention to social problems. Is it not a normal state of affairs. The result may be devastating: there will be modern military vehicles and equipment, but will be no one to serve in the armed forces. Poor people have no desire to defend their poverty, they have NOTHING to defend."
6,No one will deter Russia in the Baltic region,news-society," Recently researchers and analysts of the RAND Corporation issued the report ""Exploring Requirements for Effective Deterrence of Interstate Aggression."" The stated aim of this report is ""to provide a fresh look at the subject in this context, with two primary purposes: to review established concepts about deterrence, and to provide a framework for evaluating the strength of deterrent relationships."" Chapter Four of the report is called ""Deterring Russia in the Baltic Region"" and presents analysis of security challenges in the Baltic States. This particular report is interesting by the fact that it acknowledges the minimal likelihood of Russia's military aggression in the Baltics. It is more than strange when take into account the previous report that insisted on high level probability of Russian aggression. This time experts consider the situation to be less dangerous for the Baltic Region. According to the RAND Corporation analysts, Russia does not consider the Baltic States to be a strategically important region for itself. Therefore, despite the Kremlin’s desire to change the balance of forces in Europe in its favor, Russia does not consider ""aggressive actions in the Baltic States as a tool of achieving these goals."" The US specialists have not found evidence of preparing the invasion of Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania, and Russia’s buildup of military power on their borders. They have made a conclusion that a more aggressive behavior of Russia towards the Baltic countries can occur in case of the anti-missile defense systems deployment on their territory. Instead, experts recommend that the US authorities treat Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania with understanding and condescension and even take into account that their eternal anti-Russian fears are associated with difficult common historical past. In other words, they advise to rather provide moral support. The report of the RAND Corporation cannot be treated only as a private opinion of a non-governmental organization. The findings of this center of expertise usually anticipate and justify strategic decisions made by the United States. Thus, two years ago RAND Corporation held a war game, which revealed that the Russian armed forces need only about 60 hours to occupy the Baltic States, and NATO allies would not physically have time to help Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The analysis of the results of the war game was one of the rationales for deploying four multinational battalion-size battle groups on their territory. Today, the RAND Corporation concludes that Russia does not threaten the Baltic States, and military tensions over this region can arise only if the missile defense systems are deployed. It follows logically that the further militarization of the Baltic States is explosive and undesirable. So, the US elites as well as NATO do not want to deal with the Baltic States. They do not want to be distracted by countries that are of no importance for Russia, their main antagonist. The first recommendation made by the analysts of the RAND Corporation in the report is ""to assess the motives of potential aggressors and ease security concerns. In Europe, this could include avoiding deployment of the most provocative U.S. systems in or near Eastern Europe, thinning Russian and Baltic forces, and working on a successor to the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty."" In the case of military provocation in the Baltic Sea, similar to the one that occurred in the Kerch Strait, NATO, the US or the EU will not even provide the Baltic States with active diplomatic assistance, not to mention immediate military support. The RAND Corporation made this more than clear for the Baltic States."
7,New America Media Announces Closure of Organization,news-society," ""Long before terms like civic engagement, youth media, collaborative reporting, and inclusive journalism were in vogue, PNS and NAM were inventing how to implement them,"" noted fellow board member James Bettinger, longtime director (now emeritus) of the John S. Knight Stanford Journalism Fellowship program. Funded by foundation grants and contracts, the news and communications agency launched many successful projects that pushed journalism’s boundaries. ""We’ve always aspired to do more than our resources allowed,"" said NAM Executive Director Sandy Close. ""We grew too fast, and were reluctant to cut off programs after their funding expired. We reached a point where we were not sustainable, as currently constituted."" Of all PNS’ initiatives, none was more ambitious in scope and impact than New America Media. Founded 20 years ago at a Chinese lunch in San Francisco for some 24 ethnic media reporters, it was inspired by PNS’ search for more effective ways to report on an increasingly diverse America. ""How could a mainstream news service like ours do its job when there was no longer a mainstream?"" Close said. ""We decided to seek out partnerships with ethnic media outlets that would allow us to share content about and between the Bay Area’s growing racial and language groups."" The founding lunch opened the door to a parallel universe of journalists and media makers hungry to transcend their cultural silos and expand their coverage. Ethnic media leaders realized that, after years of being ignored by the mainstream media, they could gain visibility and respect by coming together. ""If you add our combined circulations, we’re larger than the mainstream dailies,"" Alex Esclamado, then the publisher of Philippine News, exclaimed. New California Media was born by acclamation at that luncheon. What had begun as a modest impulse to diversify PNS’ local news lens turned PNS over the next decade into New America Media. Ethnic media became our direction-givers, noted Close, inspiring NAM to go beyond journalism to become a quasi-trade association and develop a social marketing arm. NAM organized awards and expos to bring the sector greater visibility, held press briefings with experts and elected officials, coordinated fellowship programs and professional training workshops, facilitated a news exchange, and developed public awareness campaigns that have brought over $10 million to the sector. ""NAM’s ethnic media directory is like a map of America’s new topography,"" said Bettinger. ""Its gatherings brought reporters from Black, Hispanic, Asian, Middle Eastern, Eastern European, African and AfroCaribbean communities together – often for the first time – educating policy makers even as they expanded the sector’s own knowledge base."""
8,To Save Combat Veterans From Committing Suicide: A Diathesis Stress Model for the VA,news-society," Any male or female human adult acting under the stressors generated by violent interactive conflicts, such as war, over which he, or she, has no direct control, is consistently and negatively affected by the adverse control that the conflict's stressors have over the cognitive/affective sensibilities of the individual. The preexisting environmental stressors from previous unanticipated negative life experiences that accompany a person into wartime conflict, such the deaths and serious illnesses of family members, loss of jobs, and drug and alcohol addictions, etc. serve to add greater dimensions of dysfunction to the effects of violent stress. In other words, the measurable cumulative effect of all negative life experiences on a person can greatly influence the degree to which that person suffers the effect of war-induced post traumatic disorder. Let's say, for instance, that John the valiant U.S. Marine has enlisted for three years to serve in Afghanistan as an infantryman to fight Taliban insurgents. Shortly after John arrives in Afghanistan, he receives word that his mother was killed in a fatal car crash in San Diego. John is allowed seven days leave, goes home, attends his mother's funeral, and returns to Afghanistan on the eighth day. In addition to the sum of the daily death and despair that John experiences in combat, he is, therefore, carrying around with him the death of his mother in his mind and psyche. To what deleterious degree does the stress of his mother's death exacerbate the stress that his accumulating because of his combat experiences in Afghanistan? An independent variable in this associative distribution of stressors is the timeframe. Let's say that the death of John's mother occurs six months before he enlists in the military, what negative stressors are still affecting John six months later when he joins the USMC? In most cases, no one ever knows what John is feeling and thinking until he becomes seriously overloaded with negative stress and demonstrates the symptoms of severe anxiety and a neurosis. Other negative life experience stressors may be added cumulatively to what veterans like John assume into their psyches before they are discharged from military service. The effects of these stressors are substantially variable, from benignly stressful to harmfully stressful, depending upon the ability of the normal individual veteran to handle and process them. Nonetheless, the cumulative effects of this vulnerable stress, called diathesis stress, takes a pathogenic toll on every normal combat veteran in one way, or another. Only certified sociopaths, atypical human beings without conscience and the ability to show empathy, have the capacity to experience the morbidity of combat and all other negative life experiences without exhibiting the least bit of negative dysfunction. The actual use of convicted murderers and rapists, who were facing the death penalty in U.S. prisons, to serve as U.S. Marine Corps Raiders during the Second World War to fight the recalcitrantly entrenched Japanese on the Pacific Islands experientially proved this clinical assertion about sociopaths to be unquestionably true. A replicable and reliable cumulative numerical scaling methodology for assessing and predicting the onset and total effect of stressful life experiences on soldiers, marines, airmen, and sailors returning home from combat environments is, therefore, greatly needed as a means of effective assessment of this severe depression inexorably resulting in suicide, and prompt intervention. The etiology and onset of this deleterious crippling depression resulting from diathesis (vulnerability) stress is, therefore, the inability of the normal human being's composite mind/body system to meaningfully and healthily process the overly-burdensome and pathological amount stress from negative life experiences. A mind/body breakdown of minor or severe proportions inevitably occurs at some point in a person's life as a direct result of crippling diathesis stress at the critical moment where the mind/body complex is incapable handling, or constructively and positively processing, the severe weight of the anxiety created by the concurrently acting stressors. The result of this breakdown has been given a clinical name to replace the formerly used terminology, ""shell-shocked,"" which is post-traumatic stress disorder. Cutting to the chase, long-story short, the first measurement of accumulated stress was configured by psychiatrists Thomas Holmes and Richard Rahe in 1967. For adults, the measurement of life event-stress was quantified as the following: Life event Life change units Death of a spouse 100 Divorce 73 Marital separation 65 Imprisonment 63 Death of a close family member 63 Personal injury or illness 53 Marriage 50 Dismissal from work 47 Marital reconciliation 45 Retirement 45 Change in health of family member 44 Pregnancy 40 Sexual difficulties 39 Gain a new family member 39 Business readjustment 39 Change in financial state 38 Death of a close friend 37 Change to different line of work 36 Change in frequency of arguments 35 Major mortgage 32 Foreclosure of mortgage or loan 30 Change in responsibilities at work 29 Child leaving home 29 Trouble with in-laws 29 Outstanding personal achievement 28 Spouse starts or stops work 26 Beginning or end school 26 Change in living conditions 25 Revision of personal habits 24 Trouble with boss 23 Change in working hours or conditions 20 Change in residence 20 Change in schools 20 Change in recreation 19 Change in church activities 19 Change in social activities 18 Minor mortgage or loan 17 Change in sleeping habits 16 Change in number of family reunions 15 Change in eating habits 15 Vacation 13 Major Holiday 12 Minor violation of law 11 Score of 300+: At risk of illness. Score of 150-299: Risk of illness is moderate (reduced by 30% from the above risk). Score"
9,"Poignant Confirmation Questions for a U.S. Supreme Court Nominee, Asked But Not Clearly Answered",news-society," If any formal confirmation dialogue between a U.S. senator and U.S. Supreme Court nominee was poignantly confined to questions regarding judicial activism and the potential power of the U.S. Supreme Court to declare constitutional an issue not enumerated under the specific powers of the federal government under Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, it was the exchange between South Carolina U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham and U.S. Supreme Court Nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh on Thursday, September 6, 2018. Senator Graham had pointedly asked Judge Kavanaugh if the U.S. Supreme Court had the power to declare a previously legislated federal law or a previously confirmed U.S. Supreme Court precedent unconstitutional if the law or practice originally declared constitutional wasn't predicated on a law or case arising under the U.S. Constitution. On Judge Kavanaugh defensively hedging a bit on the question, Senator Graham then cited the precedential case stating the basis for the consideration of the historical context of a matter, such as abortion, being considered by the High Court in order to determine proper federal jurisdiction over the particular matter. In other words, the question was, ""may the Supreme Court claim federal jurisdiction over a matter that was, until 1973, historically left to the individual States to judicially determine as proper or improper?"" Kavanaugh followed by refusing to answer this question, and only stating that he, and the Court intended to follow precedent, embellishing the point that Roe v. Wade, 1973 was established law. Pointedly, Senator Graham pursued the hypothetical question that needed to be asked and answered by Judge Kavanaugh, which was, ""If the Supreme Court can use the amorphous liberty clause of the Preamble to the U.S. Constitution to declare abortion a constitutional right afforded to women, despite the fact that abortion is not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution as a right afforded to women, what social or civil issue can the U.S. Supreme Court not declare power over in order to assert federal jurisdiction?"" In reply, Kavanaugh only stated that precedent would consistently preside in High Court rulings. The fundamentally provocative problem that exists in Judge Kavanaugh's statements about strictly following precedent is that if the U.S. Supreme Court can hear and decide appellate cases that do not originally arise under the U.S. Constitution or the laws of the United States, but, rather, under the whims of five-or-more Supreme Court justices, such as abortion, education, and, especially, civil rights (which was flippantly declared under federal jurisdiction per the power of the Commerce Clause of Article 1, Section 8), over what issues can't the U.S. Supreme Court declare jurisdiction? For instance, could, hypothetically, the U.S. Supreme Court declare federal jurisdiction over the birthing of children in the fifty States, as it has declared jurisdiction over abortion of viable fetuses in the States to ultimately rule that all pregnant women in the USA will only birth their children in federally approved hospitals, or could they, hypothetically, issue an edict that, in order to control the kidnapping of neonates, all new-born infants in those hospitals will have RFID chips implanted into their bodies shortly after they are born? This, of course, would be the height of austere unenforceable judicial legislation, but would it be possible, if not probable, following the precedent of Roe v. Wade, 1973? If the issues of homosexuality and homosexual marriage (historically State judicial matters) can be declared under federal jurisdiction according to the whimsical voting of five-or-more U.S. Supreme Court justices, why couldn't bestiality, fetishism, polygamy, and polyandry also be declared under federal jurisdiction by an equally whimsical vote based upon precedent? During the exchanges between Graham and Kavanaugh, the 10th Amendment of the Bill of Rights was never mentioned. Why it wasn't mentioned, I do not know; but it should have been mentioned and invoked several times, especially by Senator Graham. You see, the 10th Amendment is as important for the liberty of the People of the USA as is the 1st Amendment, if not more important, because it completely and specifically delineates the Constitutional federal-State separation of powers by unequivocally stating that ""the powers not delegated to the United States (federal government) by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the People."" What this means is simply that all issues (social, educational, political, economic, financial, and medical, etc.) not falling under the specifically delegated powers of the federal government in Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, are to be determined and decided by the respective State governments. Historically, this 10th Amendment was tragically spurned by the Republican U.S. representatives and senators of the Northern congress in 1865, before, and after, the North was victorious over the Confederacy during the American Civil War. In despising the Constitutional 10th Amendment right claimed by the States to determine the status of slavery (not subsumed under any federal power), the Northern Congress legislated the 14th Amendment and its Equal Protection Clause to subjugate the irrevocable 10th Amendment of the Bill of Rights, and coerced the Southern States of the defeated Confederacy to ratify it, threatening military reconstruction dictatorship if they refused. Senator Graham should have asked Kavanaugh whether the 10th Amendment currently presides over the determined delineation of the federal-State separation of powers? To this yes, or no, question, Kavanaugh could not have answered anything regarding precedent. Confirmation by the U.S. Senate of a U.S. Supreme Court nominee claiming to be a constructionist, or one honoring the original Constitutional intent of the Framers, should mean asking the questions that will evoke from the nominee answers that will truly reveal whether he, or she, will assert the jurisdiction of the High Court over appellate cases that have ""not"" arisen under the U.S. Constitution or the laws of the United States, though adjudicated originally in federal district courts when those courts had no original jurisdiction over the cases at bar. A U.S. Supreme Court justice's honor and assertive willingness to openly and publicly declare that the U.S. Supreme Court, or any federal court, has no ""right"" to determine a issue over which the federal government has no jurisdictional power is much more profound than his dishonorable conformity to the will of a majority of nine human jurists. For the American republic to be truly ruled by the People through their representatives in Congress and the White House, the voice of the electorate, who vote to place those representatives in Washington, DC, must be heard loudly by those representatives. Every day of every year, every American citizen eligible to vote in national elections should rise from his bed in the morning to question what his representatives are doing in Washington, DC to follow the stated purpose of the U.S. Constitution, which is ""to ensure the blessings of liberty to the posterity of the Framers who created the U.S. Constitution and of People who ratified it in 1789."" As Antony Sutton, D.Sci. has, in paraphrase, stated, ""the liberty of the People of the United States is a fragile substance that can be quickly diminished through the conspiratorial actions of deceitfully powerful men and women who seek to further their corrupt power by economically and governmentally subjugating the less-powerful to their will."" And as Thomas Paine wrote in 1775, in his ""Common Sense,"" ""Awaken to the pains of tyranny and the denial of liberty by the hands of despots."" One must remember that the U.S. Supreme Court, five of nine justices, does not rule the USA. WE are a nation of properly legislated federal laws, legislated under the specific powers delegated to the federal government, and not under the whims of flippant and self-righteous federal politicians."

11,"'Serious flaws' in UK immigration system, Law Society cautions",news-society," 'Serious flaws' in UK immigration law system, Law Society cautions Bad immigration law choices are having a ""devastating"" effect on families and businesses and undermining the rule of law, solicitors have cautioned. In England in Wales, close to 50 percent of decisions were overturned, making the system appeared as ""seriously flawed"", started the law society. And, the team included, it had to be fixed prior to Brexit begins. Appeals are upheld for a number of reasons, often enough because new evidence is provided, started The Home Office. Anine Sutherland, who combated a three-year battle with the Home Office to assert her right to remain in the UK, stated she was ""treated like a criminal"" by officials at her primary tribunal hearing. ' Windrush generation' deportation threat Asylum seekers front appeals 'lottery'. ""They asked me 'how do you know your boyfriend won't leave you?' and that had zero impact on your application did it? Not at all, My application was based upon my mentor qualification, not my private partnership,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Ms Sutherland, who moved to the UK from South Africa as working holidaymaker 16 years ago and afterwards qualified as a teacher, first made an application for uncertain leave to remain in March 2015. Her application was turned down because of a Home Office error but it took two appeals and the risk of a judicial review prior to she was finally granted the immigration standing she was always qualified to. The Home Office acknowledged there had been ""undesirable hold-ups"" in making a decision in her case and were now considering regardless if she was eligible for compensation for lost cash flow, as her right to work was limited during the appeals method. The Law Society, which stands for lawyers in England and Wales, says the variety of appeals being upheld has been boosting for recent three annums, according to Ministry of Justice numbers. ""Virtually 50% of UK immigration and asylum appeals are maintained - obvious proof of serious flaws in the means visa and asylum applications are being actually handled ,"" said the organisation's president Joe Egan.

The UK Visa and Immigration service faces possibly the most significant single increase of applications in its record when EU nationals residing in the UK seek to relax their status post-Brexit making ""the requirement when it comes to a durable, dependable and functional immigration body is more important than ever"", the Law Society said. The Home Office stated it was fulfilling its targets for refining ""straightforward"" visa requests however ""some applications could be sophisticated and need more information before we reach the appropriate judgment"".

It comes as the Migration Observatory think tank cautioned which great numbers of EU nationals entitled to live in the UK might unintentionally end up being unlawful locals after Brexit because they will have a hard time to fill out the paperwork. "" The Home Office is clearly eager to produce a body which is easy and simple to utilize, and most EU residents ought to have the ability to cruise throughout a clarified request process with little difficulty,"" stated Migration Observatory director Madeleine Sumption. ""But for a few of people, the process will certainly be harder. ""A lot of these are currently society's most susceptible - whether it is since they are socially separated, have bitten of exploitation, or face personal barriers such as mental health or poverty."". 'Windrush generation' deportation threat. Brexit: All you need to know. Many people simply won't be aware of they must use, Ms Sumption added. The Home Office is about to introduce an application body for EU nationals looking for to remain in Britain following Brexit later this year. It stated it had already introduced a national awareness campaign and was keeping regular monthly meetings with EU citizens' representatives ""to understand their needs and are planning a range of support for vulnerable groups"". EU nationals who have been in the country for five years due to the end of 2020 may have the ability to apply for settled status - meaning they are free to continue living and doing work in the UK. People who have shown up by December 31, 2020, but do not possess five years' residence will be able to apply to stay until they have gotten to the threshold, whereupon they can seek settled status."
12,The Skewering UK Visa and Immigration Law Cost,news-society," Abiding by the present governmental policies disorder that has besieged the UK, the rates in Immigration Law saw for visas have escalated but frequently since the 6th of April of the existing annum. The upswing known in 2017 was gotten an horrendous omen and regrettably, it really obtained drive as well as became the enhancement of this year (and the upcoming, considering which it appears). This is news and not news all at once, pondering that a few visas have begun to get much more financially demanding once 2012. What Re-structured and What Didn't. When situations go south, it is truly necessary in which we enjoy a glass-half-full mindset, implying which we must take a look at the bright side of matters, as difficult as which might be. Numerous costs have adjusted, sure, but various other did not. The cost for a depending specific demand, such as, has lasted relentless off the past year, consequently it continuously of simply a relatively upwards of ₤ 3,200. Isn't a minor figure, but as we will see coming, the situation could've been a lot more extreme. In the identical form, a requisition for the status of ""refugee reliant relative"" was decreased with a many different elements. Currently speaking, an ask for adaptation will be valued outside ₤ 1,300. The request for an unpredictable switch to remain will require a ₤ 2,300 in your funds. Exactly what you need to take in is that such costs do not consist of the health tax, which-- support yourselves-- will generally be priced at twice as much as it held out in 2017 (i.e. ₤ 200). If you're looking for Immigration Law Courses there are online law courses obtainable . Additional Trouble. As you may now, in most cases are many type of visas. The negative news is similar of all of such are extra cost considered to in 2017. The price for a request for an unconstrained leave to remain, for instance, was intensified possessing ₤ 92 out of ₤ 2,297. The fee with respect to a visit visa for under One Decade increased with ₤ 31. An inquiry for negotiation expenditure by ₤ 1,464 last annum. In 2018, you may have to spend ₤ 1,523. If you need to secure a representative of an overseas company, you'll ought to pay off ₤ 610 from ₤ 587, as it set you back last annum. These amounts are all awful, but they're definitely not the most unfavorable aspect regarding this complete company. The most severe factor is that the Home Office invests a fragment of the amounts it invoices on processing the applications. For mapping out this instance with an example: the spending of the Home Office to get the managing of a citizenship registration is ₤ 264. During 2016 and 2017, individuals were chargeded ₤ 936. That's an astonishing revenue of ₤ 672, an amount that goes legit of the Home Office. Troubles haven't changed in the slightest along with, in the recognition of newest spiking in charges for visas and the adjoining documents, the Home Office is bound to make supplementary return. Be up to date with online Immigration Law Courses today. Components for the Increase. The main incentive visas have obtained so high-priced is the significant climb of immigration activated by evacuees outside of the East. The surge, thus, is implied as a procedure of establishing the fire as considerably as feasible. A further factor-- and a plenty lower pleasant reviewed to the preliminary one-- is effortless earnings. There's not one other about this, for that reason we have to point out it as we view it. There are two methods that the Home Office produces an incomes. The first one is absolutely by means of bolstering the prices of a variety of visas and minimizing the ones for that there's zero interest. The second one is by turning down demands. As discussed formerly, if your application gets denied, you don't acquire a money back. That money goes straight to the Home Office and not one other 3rd parties. These techniques increase the annual profits of the Home Office to up to 800%. This quantity makes certain making the greatest people shiver in tetchiness. There's a 3rd reason that accounts for the growth of the visa fees: it's been ventured that the UK is literally not enthusiastic foreign workers nowadays. The Brexit developed for an intention. While we're never into conspiracy theory, we are instead prepared to think which the rumors and speculations aggress least a substance of real truth. The Thinking of the Home Office. Through the understanding of the Home Office, these new rates are required for future perks that the ones that secure their visas will obtain. Merely puts, they ensure the applicants that they'll gain a multitude from their visas. This couldn't be more distant from the truth, naturally. There's nothing that guarantees a clean British citizen a formidable life since everything add up to the individual's capabilities, experience in addition to-- let's just continue and mention it, luck. Immigration Law Courses are the best way to improve Continuing Professional Development (CPD)."

14,The Ultimate Summary of the UK’s Energy Stats in 2017,news-society," The UK Government’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has published statistics the UK's energy production and consumption. The department released four key publications under the Digest of United Kingdom Energy Statistics 2018: ●	Digest of United Kingdom Energy Statistics 2018 ●	UK Energy in Brief ●	Energy Flow Chart ●	Energy Consumption in the United Kingdom These documents provide a detailed analysis of the UK’s energy production, transformation and consumption in 2017. The key points of the reports are as follows: ●Primary energy production rose by 0.4% between 2016 and 2017. This increase was driven by growth in energy input from solar, wind, hydro, waste and bioenergy. ●Coal output was at a record low. ●Final energy consumption (excluding non-energy use) fell by 0.7% due to a decreased demand for heating. When adjusted for temperature, however, energy consumption rose by 0.9%. ●Electricity from the UK’s renewable energy sources reached a record 29.3% of the UK’s total electricity generation. This is 4.8% higher than the previous year. This is a result of: ○	13.6% rise in renewable generation capacity to 40.6 GW ○	Higher average wind speeds. ●The share of low carbon electricity generation increased from 45.6% to 50.1% - a new record driven  by the increase in renewables generation ●BEIS estimate that overall emissions fell by 12 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (MtCO2) (3.2 per cent) to 366.9 MtCO2 between 2016 and 2017, driven by the changes in electricity generation. The decline of coal Coal output fell to a record low level, down by 27% in 2017 to a low of 3 million tonnes - a third of its 2015 levels. In 2015 coal’s share of the UK’s energy generation was 22%, declining to 9% in 2016, and then to 7% in 2017. This was mostly because one of the biggest surface mines is under maintenance and has not produced coal since April 2017. Also, the higher carbon price for coal meant that gas production was favoured over coal production as coal generation became more expensive than gas. The consumption of coal in the UK decreased by 20% in 2017, with a 28% decrease in coal consumption by the dominant power producers who use 61% of the total coal demand. In 2017, coal accounted for 6.7% of the electricity generated in the UK, down from 9% in 2016. In 2017, domestic users accounted for just 3.8% of total coal consumption. Imported energy Imported energy rose by 1.2% in 2017, but this is down from a record level of 16% in 2013. Crude oil from Norway accounts for 47% of imports. The key source for imported gas is also Norway. All in all, the UK remained a net energy importer of all main fuel types (36%) in 2017, down marginally from 2016. The UK’s main energy consumption statistics UK primary energy consumption continued on its downward trends from the last ten years, falling by 1.2% in 2017, down 0.3% on a temperature-adjusted basis. This decline was due to the UK’s switch in energy generation from coal to renewable energy sources. UK energy consumption by sector ●Industrial sector - 1.6% increase in energy consumption ●Chemicals sub-sector - 7% increase in energy consumption ●Construction - 5.9% increase in energy consumption ●Food, drink, and tobacco - 3.5% increase in energy consumption ●Vehicles sub-sector - 2.9% increase in energy consumption ●Transport sector - 0.9% increase in energy consumption ●Agricultural sector - 3.4% increase in energy consumption ●Private commercial sector - 1% decrease in energy consumption ●Public sector - 1.7% decrease in energy consumption Domestic energy consumption Domestic energy consumption decreased by 3.7%, reflecting warmer average temperatures particularly during the heating season. Temperature-corrected, however, domestic energy consumption saw a 0.3% increase. Since 2000, energy consumption has fallen by 14%. This has occurred even though the number of households has increased by 15% and the population has increased by 12%. This means that, per household, energy consumption has fallen by 26%. Main electricity generation and supply statistics Demand for electricity fell in 2017, leading to a 1% decrease in the total supply of electricity in the UK in 2017. The final consumption of electricity in the UK fell to 300.7 TWh, representing the lowest level since 1995. ●Largest electricity consumer: the domestic sector (105.4 TWh) - although this is 2.4% lower than 2016 ●Industrial sector (92.6 TWh) - an increase of 0.9% ●Service sector consumed (97.8 TW) - 1.5% lower than 2016. The rise of renewable energy Notably, 2017 marked a record high of renewable energy generation, which further displaced fossil fuel generation. Renewable energy generation rose by 19% in 2017 to a record 99.3 TWh. It now comprises 29.3% of the UK’s total energy production in 2017 (up 4.8% from 2016) This was due to: ●	A 14% increase in renewable capacity. ○	Energy from solar sources rose by 11% ○	Energy from hydro sources rose by 10% ○	Onshore wind capacity increased by 18% ○	Together, onshore and offshore wind represent almost half (48%) of the UK’s renewable electrical capacity. ●	Higher average wind speeds than 2016. ○	Onshore wind increased by 39% ○	Offshore wind increased 27% A summary of energy in the UK in 2017 Although final energy consumption decreased in 2017, the temperature-adjusted statistics show a rise of 0.9%. A number of records were set in 2017, with coal output at a record low, and electricity from the UK’s renewable energy sources reaching a record 29.3% of total electricity generation. The share of low carbon electricity generation increased from 45.6% to 50.1%, another new record driven by the increase in renewables generation."
15,"Give people mansions because they can breathe, and because they can count to 10",news-society," I don’t exactly believe in mansions. Mansions are nothing more than the effect of miscalculated management and government. If people were much better at co-ordinating with other people, mansions along with nationalism and skyscrapers wouldn’t come to pass. However, since mansions have come to pass, and since enough mansions have come to pass that the idea of just demolishing all mansions seems somewhat over-the-top, I think I may have come up with a reasonable compromise. More mansions can be built, but are built and are given to people on the purse basis that they can read and write (or better yet, on the pure unadulterated basis that they can count to 10). As far as the status quo goes, people already have mansions (or numerous mansions, knowing some people) because of nothing: I hardly see why movies and tv shows should be why people have mansions, or why politics and boardrooms should be why. Indeed, mansions can be kept, and even more can be built, but people should be allowed to possess and use mansions simply because of their basic ability to comprehend – to add more insult to injury, the endgame of many movies and tv shows is the basic ability to comprehend. In practical terms, I can see why giving mansions to all people is difficult: there isn’t the land mass to enable such a distribution. However, come the point when space travel is more the routine, and the point that people can live on other planets, I honestly don’t see why on earth there should be any contrived and concocted opposition to the argument (of course, I’m aware enough of the depravity and insidious nature of right-wing politics to know to expect bullshit counter-arguments regardless of the logic of the original argument). Nevertheless, I still stand by my point: mansions don’t have to go, but if they are retained then it’s essential that people have mansions for the right reasons – the right reason being nothing more convoluted and complex than they basic ability to think and live. In the meantime, I also think it would be worthwhile that all people in Mexico have their own statue, for no reason other than their basic ability to breathe and live."
16,"The ""Great Recession"" - Ten Years Later",news-society," I thought you might be interested in some thoughts about the investment climate around the time of the ""great recession"". You may find them disturbing, or enlightening, depending on where you think we are today. But two things are fairly certain... not a whole lot has changed, and a look to the past often provides insight about the present. •	Without too much of a stretch, it could be documented that the stock market ""Crash of '87"" was caused by investor focus on company fundamentals, as the best companies on earth led the market on a reckless course to a sudden and painful reversal of fortune for most investors. •	It would be a ""piece of cake"" to prove that the ""irrational exuberance"" of the "".com bubble"", ten years or so later, was caused by blind faith worship of technical analysis, as the ""no value at all sector"" flourished while profitable, high quality, dividend payers significantly underperformed NASDAQ's much more speculative issues. •	More recently, blame for ""The Great Recession"" could well have been laid at the feet of big government, misguided regulators, and Modern Portfolio Theory zealots instead of heaped upon Wall Street banking institutions, complicit as they were in shaping the disaster. There was plenty of guilt to pass around. In an April, 2010 post in Jotwell: Trusts and Estates: ""Time to Rethink Prudent Investor Laws?"", Jeffrey Cooper paraphrases a similarly titled article by Stewart Sterk. •	Sterk, in my opinion, supports the assertion that Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and its computer creation ""The Efficient Capital Market Hypothesis"" were directly, without reasonable doubt, the cause of the recent global financial crisis. By removing the ""prudence"" from the Prudent Man Rule, the federal government had allowed hypothesis and theory to replace profits and regular recurring interest payments. Effectively, probabilities, standard deviations, and correlation coefficients replaced fundamental value analytics, real profit numbers, and income generation capabilities, as determinants of investment acceptability in trusteed portfolios. The Uniform Prudent Investor Act (UPIA), which reflects an MPT and ""total return"" approach to the exercise of fiduciary investment discretion, was adopted by most states by May 2004. The act stated that: •	No category or type of investment is inherently imprudent. Thus, junior lien loans, limited partnerships, derivatives, futures, options, commodities, and similar investment vehicles, were acceptable. At the same time, Congress was: encouraging lenders to make mortgages available to absolutely everyone; allowing federal mortgage providers to package products for Wall Street; preventing the SEC from regulating a burgeoning derivatives industry; and making all regulators stay clear of any involvement with a growing interest in ""credit default swap"" gambling. It's not difficult to surmise just how involved Wall Street lobbyists were in making the once ""sacred ground"" of trusteed investment and pension plans a trillion dollar market place for every conceivable manner of ""Masters of the Universe"" creation/speculation. My assessment is that we remain in an ""artificial portfolio"" bubble as this is being written. Not even Dodd Frank contained a solution to the problems that fostered the recession/ correction (at least not effectively). Both pension and defined contribution plan (401k) trustees are still expected to focus on portfolio market value growth instead of growing the income that plan participants will need at retirement... conservative, income based, portfolios would be fined mercilessly by feckless regulators for ""poor performance"". •	The most popular ""retirement income fund"" on the planet (Vanguard's VTINX) generates less than 2% in spending money, check it out... while hundreds of other securities, safely yielding much more, are unacceptable to the regulators. Without a meaningful correction for over ten years, it seems likely that millions of investors are about to become victims of a ""How Could This Be Happening, Again"" debacle. Blinded By The Math MPT doesn't just ignore all fundamental analytics while playing Frankenstein with the technical variety, it also pays no attention to the reality of market, interest rate, and economic cycles. It has produced an investment environment that has taken diversification to new heights of lunacy by including every possible speculation in the formula, while ignoring fundamental quality and income generation. The only significant ""risk"", it postulates, is ""market risk""... in reality just the always clear and present danger of all securities and markets. The MPT mixologists' concoction: •	combine all market price numbers of all securities irrespective of quality rankings, income, or even profitability numbers •	determine how these numbers varied against one another during various past market scenarios... regardless of cyclical cause •	measure the dispersion of the results as they relate to the average and latest iterations of the actual numbers  (what!) •	 measure the probability of each possible result, assign a ""standard deviation"" market value change risk measurement to each possible result, and finish by correlating the various risk assessments. Add a shot of single malt, and a pinch of Old Bay, bring to a boil, shake a stick over it and SHAZAAM... we know the combined market, liquidity, concentration, credit, inflation, financial, and economic risk of every marketable security. MPT portfolio construction assures that everything owned is negative directionally correlated to nearly everything else, without ever owning an individual stock or bond, or considering the amount of income produced by the portfolio. Thus creating, eh, producing, a passively managed... well, I haven't quite determined what such a portfolio would be. The ""oxymoronic"" passive management (let the formulas and standard deviations steer your retirement bound ship) of  ""Modern Portfolio Theory"" may initially have a sexy ring to it... until you try to figure out exactly what it does to the data it fuels itself on. Aren't we bringing way too much science to a relatively simple system of exchanging dollars for ownership interests in business enterprises... an age old means for taking measured financial risk in the search for increased personal wealth. MPT has spewed forth thousands of derivative products that have changed the equity playing field... •	Should an uptick in a ""triple-short-the-S & P 500"" ETF be considered a positive or a negative? •	Should individual issue numbers be adjusted for the number of derivative entities that hold them, short or long? •	Does share price have anything at all to do with fundamental value or is it just the impact of derivative parlor game activity? S & P p/e ratios are roughly 50% higher than they were five years ago; a sampling of high-dividend-paying ETFs sports an average p/e more than twice that of the S & P... and none of your advisors (myself excluded) seems concerned with the anemic level of income being produced by your retirement-bound portfolios. Déjà Vu all over again? Modern Portfolio Theory would have us believe that the future is, indeed, predictable within a reasonable degree of error. Theorists, research economists, other academics, and Wall Street marketing departments have always gone there --- and they've always been wrong. Any claim to precision; any attempt to time the market; any hope of being at the right place at the right time, most of the time, is just not a reality of investing. And there's the rub for both forms of analysis, and for ""the emperor's new clothes"" risk assessment techniques and ""active asset allocation"" processes so popular in MPT. So long as we live in a world where there are tsunamis and Madoffs; politicians and terrorists; big corporate egos and far more dangerous big government; and imperfect intelligence (both human and artificial) there will be no hope of certainty. Get over it, reality is pretty cool once you've learned to deal with it."
17,What is a Liquid Air Energy Storage System?,news-society," An exciting development in the UK energy industry took place last week - the launch of the world’s first liquid air energy storage (LAES) plant. UK energy storage developer Highview Power opened the 5-megawatt (MW) plant at the Pillsworth landfill gas site in Bury, Manchester. It is the world’s first operational demonstration of LAES technology at grid-scale. This development will be able to power about 5000 homes for about three hours. So, what is a liquid air energy storage system and how does it work? How does liquid air energy storage work? Highview CEO Gareth Brett explains how liquid air energy storage works: ""We use electricity to drive a big industrial refrigerator that takes air –which we clean up in the process — and turns it into a liquid, which we keep it in a tank. When we want the power back, we add a bit of heat, which can be just from the environment, to the cryogenic liquid air that evaporates and expands back into ordinary air. And that expansion drives a generator which turns our stored energy back into electricity."" The LAES plant uses air stored as a liquid. The liquid is converted to gas, involving an expansion process that releases stored energy. Gas drives a turbine and generates electricity. It also converts ‘waste’ heat from the landfill gas engines into power. One of the most exciting characteristics of a liquid air energy storage system is that it’s more environmentally-friendly. The process releases zero carbon emissions, and no harmful chemicals or exotic metals are involved. What’s next for LAES? LAES present the opportunity for utilities to transition to a low-carbon world, and the adoption of this technology is now a reality. The global energy storage market is expected to grow to a cumulative 125 GW/305 GWh by 2030, attracting $103bn in investment over this period. Negotiations are underway to build plants that are ten times bigger than the Manchester plant. Highview estimates that 60% of the global energy storage market comprises long-duration, grid-connected storage. They say that LAES technology is ready to meet almost half of this. Utility-scale storage becomes a practical alternative to new-build generation or network reinforcement. What are the benefits of a liquid air energy storage system? According to Brett, the new plant is ""the only large-scale, true long-duration, locatable energy storage technology available today, at an acceptable cost."" LAES technology can: Enable the broader deployment of renewable energy by helping to smooth peaks and troughs in demand. Help meet rising energy demands. Provide grid-balancing, reserve and regulation services. Respond to the changing patterns of consumption both locally and nationally. Play an essential role in supporting UK growth in low carbon, renewable energy sources and in maintaining the security of the UK’s electricity supply. Ensure that the UK has an affordable, clean and secure energy solution. Scale to hundreds of megawatts to meet the energy demands of small towns, and even large cities. With innovation and sustainability at the heart of the LAES project, this technology could form part of the solution to deliver the long-term energy security that the UK needs."
18,The Weight of Grief,news-society," When Brenda and David, a couple in their late 40’s, signed on for their Skype session, the pressure in my office seemed to change, as if they’d brought a wall of protective silence with them. I smiled and tried making pleasant chit-chat to relax them, but neither gave more than one- or two-word replies. I sensed their grief, and wondered how soon it was that their child had died. Brenda pulled from her purse a photograph of a young girl in a soccer uniform: Cassie, their 12-year-old daughter, who’d died suddenly three years ago. I blinked in surprise. Three years ago? Brenda’s pain was so strong, it felt like she was mourning a passing that had occurred days ago. David’s sorrow did not feel as strong. As I asked my guides for the best way to serve this couple, I began to understand that David had made his peace with Cassie’s passing. Interestingly, I sensed he was grieving more for his wife, who was suffering so intensely, her soul felt as if it was in another room. I wondered if the couple would be better off seeing a grief counselor, rather than working with me. But then I felt a gentle presence enter the room, and in my mind’s eye I saw the girl in Brenda’s photograph standing behind her dad. As I opened my mouth to describe what I was getting, Cassie raised a finger to her lips shhhh! and in my head, she asked to talk to her dad. But your mother and father want to talk with you, I mentally told Cassie. They came because they love you. She shook her head. I don’t want to hurt mom any more. ""I’m having a little trouble linking in. How about if I try sitting with you one at a time?"" I said, disliking telling this little white lie. But if spirit thought it best that I talk with these people separately, then what else could I do? ""I’ll go first,"" Brenda said. David left his wife’s side. I centred myself, and waited for Cassie to touch back in with me. But Cassie didn’t come. Instead, Brenda’s mother, grandmother and two aunts in spirit wanted to talk with her. I provided enough evidence for Brenda to recognize her family members, and each had the same message for her – we support you, we love you, you’re strong enough to get through this. Brenda sat still as stone, her face expressionless, her eyes like dull copper pennies. I knew she wanted to hear from Cassie, but I was not going to make something up just to please her. After twenty minutes, Brenda and David changed places. As soon as he was alone with me, he whispered, ""She sleeps in Cassie’s room, in her bed."" He sadly shook his head, then blew out a breath. ""She tried going back to work six months ago, but couldn’t take it. Most mornings she comes downstairs for coffee, then goes back into Cassie’s room, closes the door, and I don’t see her until I get home from work."" Behind him, Cassie’s spirit emanated sadness, as if she was grieving for her mother. I told David this, and passed on other feelings Cassie was communicating to me – that she was fine, and watching over her little sister, and helping her get through feelings of being abandoned by her mother. David seemed relieved to hear that…"

20,Navy Seal Plummets Into Hell,news-society," Imagine this: you are riding in a helicopter 400’ above the surface of the ocean off the coast of CA. There’s that familiar knot in your stomach tightening up. You’re about to jump out. It's a practice run, all part of prepping for another tour for the real thing in Afghanistan, it is 1987. That was Don ’s reality …3, 2, 1…jump. Instead of free-falling for a few moments, he was startled when he heard the chopper blade cut through his parachute. It was nightmarish. He plummeted through the air like a rock. The rugged Seal, a veteran of two tours in Afghanistan, stoically braced for impact. Wham! He slammed into the water feet first. The impact compressed his spine crushing two disks and it also knocked him unconscious. Severely injured, he sank nearly 100 ‘ to the bottom. Brother Seals jumped seconds after him. They were in the water, racing to the bottom to try to rescue their comrade in a heartbeat. They dragged him to the surface and got him to the shoreline. He was brain-dead for about a minute. Broken, badly injured he came to and was rushed to the hospital. In my opinion, the Navy should have given him a medical discharge. Not just because of the severe back injury and trauma he suffered in the horrific accident. He’d already served two tours of duty and seen heavy action in Afghanistan.  In addition, he had PTSD and on top of that brain damage from the accident. But the Navy invests heavily in their elite corps. If he didn’t push for it and could function they were not about to give him a medical discharge. Anyway, his commander waited the six months, for him to heal from two surgeries until he was released from the hospital. Then he was deployed with his unit back to serve his 3rd tour in Afghanistan. He remained in the Navy for 20 years and was given an honourable discharge. Today, at 61 he is a big bear of a man who has a ready smile. The neighbourhood he lives, south of the border where it is cheap,, is the worst in a city notorious for its high level of homicides. He doesn’t complain about any of it and he seldom mentions his back pains, When he does I figure that they must be severe. Some people say that he’s slow in the head, they have no idea of his past. Brain injuries and PTSD have heavy impacts on mental functioning. But Don is not at all stupid as some folks mistakenly judge him to be, by a few small behaviours. This article was my idea, not his. He is not the kind of guy to cry on anyone’s shoulder or ask for help. So I am doing it for him, he deserves it and I am a writer. Oh, I failed to mention that his father served under Patton in WWII; in addition, all of his 5 brothers served in one elite corps or another as well. True patriotism and selfless service to America are Goshke family traditions. This crowdfunding campaign is to help Don get through this next 12 months until his social security kicks in. It is the least I can do Oh, one last thing. They did not have him do any more copter jumps after the accident. However, they did have him repel thousands of feet down a mountainside overseas"

1,From Burning Trees To a Lighthouse,news-society," Cape Disappointment Lighthouse is located at the north side of the mouth of the Columbia River near Ilwaco, Washington. This is the story of its beginning. The Columbia drains a watershed area of about 259.000 square miles. The force of this great river meets the Pacific Ocean's massive mix of shifting channels, violent seas and high winds making for extremely dangerous navigation. Also, despite its wide mouth, mariners, historically, were often unable to find it. About 1812 a beacon was erected on top of the 700 foot cape by Hudson's Bay Company Employees in order to assist the Beaver ( the company ship) in finding the entrance to the Columbia River. They raised a flag and set trees on fire as a makeshift lighthouse. As time went on the traffic on the northwest coast increased and the U. S. Coast Survey recommended the building of lighthouses at Cape Disappointment at the mouth of the Columbia River and Cape Flattery at the entrance to Puget Sound. This was about 1850. The commander of the U. S. Surveying Schooner Ewing spoke out about the urgency of a light at the mouth of the Columbia River saying, ""The greatly increasing commerce of Oregon demands that these improvements be made immediately …. Within the last eighteen months more vessels have crossed the Columbia river bar than had crossed it, perhaps, in all time past"" Coast Survey Sub-Assistant A. M. Harrison, on November 29 1850, stated that the lighthouse should be located near the southern edge of Cape disappointment. This spot was about 250 feet above the high water mark and in position to avoid the fog bank that frequently covered its peak. This location was chosen because it had three-fourths horizontal view and they would not have to cut down some giant pine trees to the north. It was decided that supplies for building the lighthouse be brought ashore at Baker's Bay which is about 1,000 yards south and below the construction site. A trail already existed from the landing to the top of Cape Disappointment but a new road needed to be constructed in order to transport the supplies to the top. In 1853 a load of supplies for the lighthouse construction was being shipped into Baker's Bay. It grounded and broke up in the rough bar at the foot of Cape Disappointment. Building was finally begun after a second ship carrying supplies arrived in 1854. The 53 foot tower was finished along with the keeper's house which was a few minutes walk away. It was two more years before the lighthouse was ready and operational. The cost of construction was $38,500. The wicks which illuminated the lens were lit by the keeper for the first time on October 15, 1856. A fixed white light was displayed providing enough light for mariners. But the fixed light while voiding the need for the keeper to make frequent trips up to the top to wind the mechanism he still had to carry 170 gallons of oil daily up to the lantern room. A fog bell weighing 1,600 pounds was installed so as to give hearable warning as fog was a frequent visitor to the Columbia River mouth. In foggy weather when mariners could not see the light they could hear the bell. It would strike nine consecutive times every minute. Fort Canby was built nearby during the Civil War. In 1871 during artillery practice the fog bell was shattered. Seafarers complained that they could not hear the replacement bell. Another problem was that ships coming from the north couldn't see the Cape Disappointment light. To support their arguments for a better light they cited the wrecks of the Whistler (1883) and the Grace Roberts (1887). In 1892 a floating lighthouse was established at the mouth of the Columbia River four miles southwest of Cape Disappointment It remained there until 1909 when it was replaced by a 120 foot sail-powered ship which stayed for 30 years. In 1898 the 65-foot North Head Lighthouse was built about two miles north of the Cape Disappointment Lighthouse. Today in 2018 the two lighthouses are still operating. While the waters at the mouth of the Columbia River remain among the most treacherous in the world those two lights have made the navigation much safer than it otherwise would have been."
2,Anonymity or $560 Million,news-society," Is it worth it to play the lottery and win? Maybe not! Wow! What would you do? A woman in New Hampshire won a $559.7 power ball jackpot in January. In order to remain anonymous she is refusing her winnings. According to present New Hampshire law she is required to publicly disclose her name, town and amount won. This according to a Fox news report. In a statement to Fox News lottery Executive Director Charlie McIntyre said ""While we respect this player’s desire to remain anonymous, state statutes and lottery rules clearly dictate protocols"". New Hampshire, though, does allow lottery players to form anonymous trusts in or to hide their identities. Apparently when she signed her ticket she signed away her right to remain anonymous. She is refusing her prize and taking the matter to court. According to her claim she misunderstood the rules and made a ""huge mistake,"" when she wrote down her name. According to her attorney, making her choose between receiving the money and remaining anonymous is ""legally impermissible"". ""She is a longtime resident of New Hampshire and is an engaged community member,"" he wrote. ""She wishes to continue this work and the freedom to walk into a grocery store or attend public events without being known or targeted as the winner of a half-billion dollars."" Many past lottery winners have run into all kinds of troubles from strangers and friend alike wanting a piece of the action. Some have even been looked down upon as those ""lottery people"" Being publically known as a lottery winner draws all sorts of connivers looking for investments and/or handouts. If they hang onto their money they are considered stingy or heartless. One lottery winner was poisoned according to a New York Daily News article. The man's widow and stepdaughter split the winnings. A man by the name of Abraham Shakespeare won $30 million in 2006. He went missing after her turned his winnings over to a friend in order to protect himself from greedy persons wanting a part of the take. It turned out that this ""friend"", Dorice ""Dee Dee"" Moore, had tricked him into believing she was going to help him. Three years after his disappearance she was convicted and sentenced to life without possibility of parole for his murder. The Daily News reported on other winners who became victims of murder or drugs and alcohol. A man by the name of Dampier, who won $20 million was kidnapped by his sister-in-law, Victoria Jackson and her boyfriend. They shot him in the back of his head and he died. This was several years after the lottery win. The killers were sentenced to life. It is suggested by many attorneys that you bury your lottery tickets in one of the six states that allow anonymity. In those states you're not required to go in front of their cameras with a giant check and show your face to the world. Those states are Delaware, Kansas, Maryland, North Dakota, Ohio and South Carolina. It pays to drive across the border if you live nearby because the laws apply to the state you buy it not the state where you live."
3,What influence does print media have on elections?,news-society," As you’ve probably noticed, we’re living in a digital age. Due to this, print media is often overlooked and is seen as a less effective way to spread a message. But what if we told you that over £15m was spent on print during the 2015 General Election in the United Kingdom? Direct Letterbox Marketing (DLM), a specialist in door to door leaflet distribution, has investigated further: Looking back on previous elections To understand how widespread print media was used, we can look at the spending across the big political parties in the UK. During the 2015 General Election, we found that the Conservative party spent the most money during its campaign — totalling £15.6m. Labour closely followed by spending £12.1m, Liberal Democrats with £3.5m, the UK Independence Party with £2.9m, SNP with £1.5m, and lastly the Green Party which spent £1.1m. Of course, some parties had higher marketing budgets than others, but the way they spent was entirely different — each had their own set of priorities that they thought would benefit them in the run up to 10 Downing Street. The success of print Research discovered that Labour spent over half of its entire budget on print (£7.4m). This major investment highlights the importance of print media, and the impact it can have on a large audience, and shows that it is still relevant today. One reason as to why Labour spent this amount of money on print media is because 45% of people get their political news from a newspaper — with The Guardian being most popular at 16%. Was there a reason behind Labour’s lack of focus on digital media? According to YouGov, only 15% of people reported that they received their political news from Facebook and 8% from Twitter — showing that, although the world is going digital, more people trust printed information in comparison to information that is displayed digitally. In 2017, research showed that Britons trusted the television more than any other media outlet (42%) during the 2017 General Election. Print media came in at 32% whilst social media influenced only 26% of people. With algorithms changing constantly, more people become distrustful towards online social media platforms, as they try to enhance the experience with what they think the user wants to see — not necessarily showing the full picture when it comes to who to vote for. Print media has a duty to be impartial, and give political parties equal space to get their points across — evidently, this isn’t the same case for social media platforms. The good thing about flyers and posters is that they can be customised to the individual based on where they live. This can help political parties immensely, especially when they’re trying to win seats and help their representative succeed across different authorities. But what are the common methods that political groups use when advertising in print? Campaigners can create leaflets based on topical local issues. For example, if there was an area in which more schools were facing closure, they would capitalise on this and address it in their flyer, reassuring potential voters about what they would do to fix that issue. Or, if the party is not currently in control of that area, they could blame the problems on another party. Politics is a difficult game, but influencing an audience can be easy. There’s a huge misconception that print media is dying — but it’s not going anywhere and the influence it has on an audience is recognised by anyone working in business."
4,Mass Migration,news-society," The biggest man made mass migration to take place since the Mayan ruins were discovered. What can this be you ask? Cape Town, South Africa..... A population of four million people will have no choice but to migrate to other parts of the world because of no water. It will cause the collapse of financial services, manufacturing industry, medical and education system and leave a city a ghost town. The effects will ripple around the world as a city begins to vacate it's homes. Then public services will sis too exist and mass looting will take over for those who don't leave for better pastures in order to survive. Once the water table has dried up there will be nothing left to sustain a population of four million people. Where are all these people going to go with no money since they can't sell there homes, no jobs, no food, no supplies coming into the city. The Governments from around the world will try to prop the population up by bringing  goods in. But how do you bring in enough water to support the personal daily use of a population of four million people? Not including the water that is needed for manufacturing to sustain the economic base, hospital's, security forces and every other industry that requires water to sustain itself? The World needs to start planning for the mass migration now. The rains are not coming as climate change is about to hit the world like never before. Just think of the infrastructure that is required to house and feed four million people on daily basis. All the refugee camps that exist now can only sustain a population in the thousands and those numbers grew as the war spread slow enough to absorb the mass. And that alone gives a tiny window into what's it's going to look like. This is going to happen in a blink of an eye, the taps run dry with no change on the horizon. Stock markets around the world will be hit as billions of dollars are immediately lost with no hope of recovery. No water, no re settling, millions of square acres a waste land. It will become a no man's land where only the harden will go. There, they will fight for what little water is left and only the strong will survive. Governments will try to save what they can by shipping in water but that's only to keep those that can't leave alive. In two years time it will be like seeing a movie of an entire city void of its population but all its buildings standing. The real questions will be how does this effect the rest of the world. The Stock markets will crash as the debt of a city of four million people has to be absorbed. Fighting will entail as communities try and protect what little natural resources they have as many of the surrounding population is already getting close to there maximum sustain ability. The true reality is the water is not coming back! The world needs to prepare for the human migration of four million people Now! God help us all as humanity shows its true face when the borders start to close to protect the haves against the haves not!"
5,The African-American With Lewis and Clark,news-society," Everyone knows the story of Lewis and Clark and their journey from Camp Wood near St. Louis, Missouri to the Pacific Ocean . The expedition set out in May 14,1804 with Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. But very little is known of one of their very important companions. He was a black man named York. York was a slave owned by Clark's father and passed down to Clark in his father's will. It is believed that York married just before setting out on the famous 28 month trek west. It is not known if he had any children. We know very little of York and that is through the writings of Clark and other members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. As many of the Corps of Discovery members were illiterate, so was York. According to historian, Robert Betts, he was allowed a considerable amount of liberty on the journey. He even was allowed to carry a firearm. York helped the company with peaceful negotiations with the Indians along the way. He was apparently shown some respect by Lewis and Clark as they named a couple of discoveries after him. They were York's Eight Islands and York's Dry Creek. Unlike some of the other men in the group he was able to swim. This may be a reason for some of the respect and freedom he was afforded. After they reached what is now Pacific County, Washington, near the mouth of the Columbia River, his opinion along with that of their Shoshone guide, Sacajawea. was considered as to whether they would camp on the north or the south side of the River. After returning from the Columbia-Pacific most of the members were given honors, double pay and acreage. That is, everyone except York. He remained the property of Clark and kept the one word name of ""York"" as if he were a pet animal ranking him at the bottom of the social ladder. The rest of the story remains in dispute. According to author Washington Irving, Clark said that he eventually gave York his freedom about ten years after they returned from the west. Clark told Irving that York subsequently failed at a business he started and wanted to reunite with him. He said York eventually died of cholera. It is not known if he ever found his wife. Historian Betts suggests that York escaped to freedom after refusing to return to Clark's custody. It was reported that an African American man was found living with the Crow Indians in North Central Wyoming in 1834. This African man told Mr. mcKinney, a trader who met him, that he first came to the area with Lewis and Clark. He returned to south central Wyoming after the expedition and had been there about ten or twelve years. It appeared that he was a chief among the Indians because he had four wives and lived with all of them alternately. A third source claims that York continued with Clark as a slave and that he asked for his freedom and Clark refused. According to this source Clark did send him to Kentucky so that he could be closer to his wife. Then after ten years he was granted his freedom. He worked i the freighting business in Tennessee and Kentucky where he died of cholera in 1832."
6,Get to know about Significant event security tips,news-society," Festival holidays are around the corner, and you must be planning your days and night in full rocking mood. Have you bought the tickets for your favourite pop star’s concert? If not then what are you waiting for? Have you planned the party? These questions have been thrown at you by many people. Organizing an event is not that much easy. If you people are thinking about hosting an event at least for 100 people or more than of it, then let me tell you this one could be quite problematic when security parameters are absolute zero. Yes, it’s essential to take proper safety measurements for protecting all lives who are attending your concert. It doesn’t matter you are arranging concert treat at a low level or higher level for your loved ones or either you belong to concert business; this is your responsibility to deal with all security aspects competently. Take a look below. Determine Security Risks first Majority small events don’t have that much higher security risk as you would see in big concert or at any festival event. This one is important to figure out all the security risks first. It would be better to categorize these risk in different categories from low to high. We are all aware of security situation of the whole world and after knowing everything we can’t put lives of anyone in danger. Outdoor events have many loopholes than the indoor events. We have to deal with every aspect by determining these security risk initially. Festival security can be improved by assessing all the risk factors in advance. Design Emergency Plan If you have already designed emergency plan in advance, then it would help us in mitigating the risk of any disaster. It is understood the fact of various event organisers who use to plan an emergency response in advance. Professional experts would let you know about all do’s and don’ts to deal with any emergency. In this emergency plan, you have first to design evacuation plan early and have to mark out all the sensitive areas first. For outdoor concerts, usually, fans love to gather near the stage for watching their favourite icon performance. If an unfortunate situation will happen then how would you communicate with public and attendees? Hired Security Company will do everything to improve security with their best approaches. Follow Technological approaches Security companies have to pay attention to all the attendees while designing the strategies. Make sure your hired company should be equipped with high-quality technological approaches including CCTV cameras, access controls and metal detectors. With the passage of time, technology revolutions have made everyone stunned, and for every security event, this is quite important to adopt latest technological approaches. You have to keep in mind fire incidents as well that can be disastrous for the not only event but causalities would be much more than imagination. Follow all the technological approaches efficiently. Prominent your security You might have seen in various festivals where security officials are hidden. Although it would be best to some extent it would make situation more panic when people would need the help of officials at the time of distress. If an intruder wants to invade the security then by looking at all the officials and security measurements steps he would hesitate for once and will think that someone is watching him. Also, increase the awareness among people that is much more important to keep an eye on any suspicious activity in their surroundings. It would help in mitigating the security risk to some extent, and you can directly cooperate the security agencies by informing them about suspicious activity. These are all the essential security measurements for event security. By hiring any security agency, you can mitigate all the risks in advance, and people can enjoy a concert or any event without any confusion. Make sure people who are attending the event should have peace of mind from a security point of view. Get the reputed security agency to deal with this dilemma and enjoy the concerts or events to the fullest."
7,Is Having HIV/AIDS Considered a Disability,news-society," Discovering you have HIV/AIDS can be devastating, as this impacts the relationships you have with family, friends and work. One of the hardest things to cope with is the thought of lost income. If your diagnosis affects how much work you can accomplish then knowing if you qualify with Social Security to get disability for HIV/AIDS is imperative. While the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) does explicitly recognize HIV/AIDS as a disability it doesn’t automatically mean the Social Security Administration (SSA) will. Determining Disability with SSA To start the process of getting Social Security for AIDS patients the first step is to know what kind of payments the SSA offers: Social Security disability insurance (SSDI) covers those that have paid into Social Security Social Security Income (SSI) pays those that have few resources, and low income, which may not have paid into Social Security Speaking with a local Social Security field office can provide the necessary application forms and clarify which type of assistance, which may be both, a patient may receive. The completed application is then distributed to a Disability Determination Service (DDS). The DDS will take the information provided by Social Security for an AIDS patient and begin researching to see if the candidate meets the disability requirements. The criteria that must be fulfilled to get Social Security for HIV/AIDS is that the patient is proven to be unable to perform ""substantial gainful work activity."" Along with that, there is the requirement that the inability to work must last for at least 12 months. When the DDS is making their evaluation that is what must be proven by reviewing patient medical records and other examinations they may require. To ensure the decision is fair and complete, medical history information should be thorough in its documentation of the disease. Including lab work, tests, diagnosis and prognosis information from a doctor is critical and any diagnosis for HIV/AIDS without positive test results must be explained thoroughly. After evidence is provided of diagnosis, having a medical report that lists what the patient can and can’t do, so far as work is concerned, will assist in ascertaining if substantial work activity can still be completed. In some instances financial support can be given to needy individuals before the determination is made. Assistance is here for you if you’re facing this challenge, and if you need legal advice to clear any roadblocks, we’re just a phone call away."
8,Social Security Changes You Should Expect in 2018,news-society," The retired worker population in America is growing. Contrary to popular belief, these retired workers are not using Social Security as disposable income. They’re not using it for their trip to Italy or their huge RV to travel the country. For many, social security benefits are a lifeline and crucial source of income. Without them, millions of seniors would be in poverty. As of June 2017, over 40 million retirees received an about $1,300 per month. For more than 60 percent of seniors, this accounts for at least half of their total income. Therefore, it is important for seniors to stay current with changes expected to Social Security in the coming years. Here’s what is coming down the road. Age Eligibility The retirement age keeps increasing, so you have to be older to get your Social Security in 2018. Why? To handle the enormity of the baby boomer generation, that’s why. The largest generation in American history is steadily reaching retirement age. In 2007, the oldest boomers turned 62, so the SSA steadily began increasing the retirement age over time. Retirement age has steadily increased for years, so people have to wait longer to get their social security benefits. However, many are opting for earlier retirement benefits, even though they receive 25 percent less money by doing so. In 2018, full retirement age will increase by two months to age 66 and four months. This affects people born in 1956 and later. The Boomer Effect has a tremendous impact to the already beleaguered Social Security system. The sheer number of boomers retiring creates a financial challenge. Because the boomer generation is so large, there is more burdens on working people to support more and more boomers. Boomers gave birth to fewer babies than their parents and grandparents, so there are fewer people in general of working age. To complicate matters, life expectancies are much greater these days, so we will very soon have a very large aging population. In 1935, when the government created social security, life expectancy was about 77 years old, meaning benefits were paid out at age 65 for only another 12 years. By comparison, life expectancies today are approximately 85 years old, so benefits are needed for significantly longer periods. This creates a situation of a rapidly growing beneficiary population without a corresponding rapid increase in tax revenues. The cost of social security will grow faster than the tax income generated by working people. Tax rates remain steady under current law, so there’s no new increase to help. The SSA determines your full retirement age by birth year, and declares that age as the age of qualification for full monthly social security benefit payout. The amount of the benefit is determined by the amount you earned in three decades of your highest-earning years. Next year’s age increase was enacted into law by Congress decades ago in the 1980s. Congress foresaw the increase in life expectancies and the sheer size of the boomer population, and tried to take measures to make Social Security last. The bottom line is that, as a boomer, the younger of a boomer you are, the longer you’ll have to wait for benefits. Either that or you’ll take a sizably reduced benefit payout if you opt in before age 66. Cost of Living Although the 2018 cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) hasn’t yet been officially announced, seniors could see the biggest adjustment in years. Inflation trends over the last few years are the driver for the expected adjustment. The Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) is the driver for whether to make a COLA increase. The government will use the third-quarter 2017 numbers (July to September) to determine the 2018 COLA. If the CPI-W drops, there will be no COLA, but if there is an increase, which is expected, seniors in effect get a raise. Data from July 2017 suggests there will likely be a 2.2 percent rise in the COLA. General economic inflation is the reason the CPI-W has risen, but moreso higher fuel prices are the major driver. Keep in mind that when the government raises the COLA, they’re just trying to keep steady pace with the inflation rate. So seniors are not going to go to the bank with the raise. While any increase is good, many say seniors are still getting the short end of the stick because the medical care inflation rate has skyrocketed over the last decades, and there is no raise for that. In 2017 alone, seniors have lost 30 percent of their buying power. Nevertheless, the expected 2018 COLA increase is the highest since 2012, so it’s definitely moving in the right direction. Most seniors living on a fixed income say any increase is welcome. Most experts are suggesting the COLA will come in at 1.9 to 2.1 percent in 2018. The experts also say that seniors will never catch up on just COLA increases alone. New legislation will be required. COLA is calculated based on spending patterns of working people, not retirees, who have very different needs and thus spending. For example, COLA doesn’t account for one of the biggest costs seniors have today--that is Medicare Part B premiums, which have increased nearly 200 percent since 2000. Medical costs in general are under-accounted, because younger families in the CPI-W spend much less on medical care than seniors do. Senior advocates say that new legislation to give people a modest benefit boost would be helpful. More Taxes on Wages Social Security payroll tax provides the revenue to pay for social security benefits. In 2017, wage earners who made up to $127,000 were taxed 12.4 percent payroll tax. But most workers split this cost with the employer, with each paying 6.2 percent. The cap is at 12.4 percent, so if you make more than $127,000, you don’t pay more. Most experts think that the government is going to raise the taxable rate to $130,000, which equates to an approximate 3 percent increase in maximum taxable earnings. Conclusion Social Security has been at a surplus since 1983 because more payroll tax has been collected than the system paid out. 2018 is the first year when payroll taxes won’t cover the benefits that were promised to senior citizens. The system will be in a deficit. There is a social security trust fund that some say will cover this shortfall from 2017 until 2042, and that taxpayers have no obligations until 2042. Believers in the system say they’re confident that Social Security will be able to pay all promised benefits until 2042. But there are some who are not so confident, because they say the trust fund is a myth. Supposedly, surpluses since 1983 have gone into the trust fund. As such, the fund should have over $5 trillion in it. It does in theory, but Washington has loaned the money to the U.S. Treasury to spend on defense, education and welfare programs. So the Treasury owes SSA over $5 trillion; they’re supposed to start paying it back starting in 2018. So if everything goes well, the coffers will be replenished by 2042. But the Treasury gets money from taxpayers, and many say the payback plan assumes huge tax increases, massive spending cuts and even possibly borrowing more money to make it all work. After 2042, unless there are drastic changes, 25 percent of social security will not be covered by incoming payroll taxes. It’s not hard to determine what the options are at that point. There would have to be fewer boomers (unlikely), more workers (maybe likely), or Congress would have to increase taxes or cut social security benefits. Maybe they will need both measures. For example, increasing the payroll tax by 1 percent for workers and employers would keep social security going for 75 more years. From 2018 forward, social security will be in a deficit on two fronts. The amount funded by payroll tax will decrease because there are fewer people contributing. The amount needed to pay back the trust fund will have to come from either tax increases or severe cuts to current senior benefits. It’s always hard to predict what the government will do, particularly in the politically charged environment that is 2017. President Trump has said that he will not target the Social Security program for any cost-cutting measures. Instead, he has said he will create economic growth, which increases payroll tax and thus brings more dollars available to pay out social security benefits. Since experts project a $12.5 trillion social security shortfall over the next 75 years, economic growth would be a good thing. In 2018, expect small changes that slightly move the ball in the right direction."
9,"Multicoloured UFO Hovers Over Repentigny, Quebec",news-society," A few days ago, on 14 September, a very strange event was reported in the small town of Repentigny, Québec. According to an anonymous testimony published on Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) online database, a local resident affirmed to have seen ""a flashing, coloured star"" hovering above the town, which is a suburb of the city of Montréal. ""[I was] sitting down on my back porch, [when I] looked North – Northeast and saw a flashing coloured star: red, blue, green, white, flickering like a disco ball"", the unnamed witness reported. ""[I] found it weird because I never recalled seeing that before"", he added. The Quebecer affirmed that the unidentified object reportedly shape shifted several times. ""Sometimes, the dot or star would seem to have four other points around it: one on top, bottom, left and right. But these four points were not always visible"", he said. Additionally, moments later, two airplanes passed near the object, though there was no impact. ""[I] was wondering what it was when I saw two planes following each other going directly towards that object"", he expressed. ""That is when I really began to think that I was probably seeing a UFO"", he continued. ""I was still confused and had doubts, and simply thought that if that star wasn’t there the next evening, it would mean that it was actually a UFO"", he confessed. The Canadian citizen also added that the alleged UFO looked like other objects he had previously seen on the internet. ""I remembered having seen that type of UFO in the past on the web, and after going in my home I looked on the internet to find pictures or videos that would look like what I saw and I found a few of them that were pretty much the same thing"", he commented. Draw your own conclusions… In almost every other way, Toronto FC's 1-0 win over the Montreal Impact at BMO Field on Sunday was theatre of the absurd. Not that it mattered to the 27,866 diehards, since part of the evening was the presentation of Major League Soccer's Supporters' Shield to TFC for finishing first in the regular season. The Reds put the icing on the cake by gaining three points to tie the Repentigny, Province of Québec, Canada Galaxy's record of 68 for most points in the regular season. A tie or better in TFC's finale next weekend in Atlanta will set a mark. The Reds can thank Bono for escaping with the win on a night when they were showing the full effects of the two-week international break. Both teams were a beat off in their timing but it was the Reds who had the benefit of their goalkeeper being the sharpest player on the field. Bono made a few great saves on regular scoring chances, too, including a breakaway by Mancosu. ""I was a little bit screened on the shot across,"" Bono said of the double-post play. ""It was kind of wobbling all over the place and it went off the far post. I just kind of quickly turned around, it was already behind me, and went, 'Oh I hope it doesn't go in.' It hit off the other post and I go, 'Okay this is not in.' I just kind of reached for it. Mancuso was right there."" There were also a few private moments after Vanney sought out Impact veteran Patrice Bernier after the game. This is the final MLS season for the 38-year-old native of Brossard, Que., who has also been a mainstay on the Canadian men's national team. UFO reports have varied widely in reliability, as judged by the number of witnesses, whether the witnesses were independent of each other, the observing conditions (e.g., fog, haze, type of illumination), and the direction of sighting. Typically, witnesses who take the trouble to report a sighting consider the object to be of extraterrestrial origin or possibly a military craft but certainly under intelligent control. This inference is usually based on what is perceived as formation flying by sets of objects, unnatural—often sudden—motions, the lack of sound, changes in brightness or colour, and strange shapes. That the unaided eye plays tricks is well known. A bright light, such as the planet Venus, often appears to move. Astronomical objects can also be disconcerting to drivers, as they seem to ""follow"" the car. Visual impressions of distance and speed of UFOs are also highly unreliable because they are based on an assumed size and are often made against a blank sky with no background object (clouds, mountains, etc.) to set a maximum distance. Reflections from windows and eyeglasses produce superimposed views, and complex optical systems, such as camera lenses, can turn point sources of light into apparently saucer-shaped phenomena. Such optical illusions and the psychological desire to interpret images are known to account for many visual UFO breaking news, and at least some sightings are known to be hoaxes. Radar sightings, while in certain respects more reliable, fail to discriminate between artificial objects and meteor trails, ionized gas, rain, or thermal discontinuities in the atmosphere."
10,Motives for Murder,news-society," The motives for murder range from sometimes shocking to bizarre. let's have a look at what reasons people have to kill. You will notice many times the reason for murder is not clear-cut, and multiple motives can be present. Financial reasons Financial gain - The list of reasons people killed for profit is long and sometimes bizarre too. People have been killed for:  Cars, mobile phones, houses, money in a person’s wallet, jewelry, etc. John George Haigh is the perfect example of a serial killer that murdered for financial gain. Extreme Poverty - Parents would kill their children and themselves because they cannot feed them. Drugs/Alcohol Drugs and alcohol make people do things they normally wouldn’t including murder. There have been cases where the murderer did not even know what they did at the time of being intoxicated/drugged. Personal satisfaction You will find that many serial killers fall into this category. They love to see the life drain from their victims eyes. John Wayne Gacy and Ted Bundy enjoyed killing and torturing their victims. Political With political reasons nothing is sacred and people high up will do anything to stay on top from having someone assassinated to war. Revenge One of the oldest reasons for murder and one that keeps the cycle of death going round and round. Personal Vendetta Some of the vendettas last for years between neighbors over silly things like trees and dogs barking. Sometimes the strain becomes too much for one of them, and murder ensues. Defense Murders Self-defense - Most people believe that self-defense is a justifiable reason for murder. Even though this may be the case, more and more people are opting for non-lethal weapons to protect themselves. There have been incidences where the ""Self-defense"" reason was used to cover up a planned murder. In defense/protection of others - Would you do anything to protect the ones you love? This reason also begs the question, is it O.K.  to murder someone to save another or is it just protection? Class Conflict A perfect example of class conflict as a reason for murder is the French revolution. Religious Differences Would you kill for your religious beliefs? Many do, this is where terrorism and many wars come into play. Mental Anxiety/Instability A lot of the serial killers use medical reasons to explain and avoid the death sentence or life in prison. From momentary insanity to depression and other mental disorders the list is almost endless. Emotional Murders As highly emotional beings it comes as no surprise that emotions motivate many murders. Here is our list of emotional reasons for murder: Jealousy - Jealousy leads to self-doubt and insecurity. People with extreme cases of jealousy would murder a partner suspected of cheating or the person they thought interfered. Here is a great example: David Hotyat murdered a family because of this reason. Anger - How many times have we heard? In the spur of the moment, he murdered his best friend, brother, mother, father, etc. Mark Rogowski murdered out of anger. Hatred - When hatred consumes someone’s heart and mind that person can justify anything even murder. If they could only learn to forgive and carry on many murders could be avoided. Jane Toppan is a perfect example for hatred and jealousy. Lust - Many times people are murdered after rape, and they will do anything to cover their lustful and sinful actions. Sadness - Mercy Killings - When you love someone, the last thing you want to do is see them in pain. Many people have fought for the right to have assisted suicide; do you think it is good or bad? This concludes our list of motives for murder. If you feel we should add more items please send us an email or tells us about it in the comments."
11,UAE sponsors controversial anti-Qatar conference in London,news-society," LCPA, London, UK (09.09.2017) – A controversial UAE conference has been announced late august 2017 in London, UK. The Conference planned to take place on 14th September 2017 seems to be yet another UAE endeavour to damage the flourishing Qatar-UK relations and the wider Qatar-EU unshakable bonds. The conference titled, ""The Qatar, Global Security & Stability Conference"" is part of KSA-UAE-Bahrain campaign which aims at isolating Qatar on international level. LCPA has learnt that this event is being run by US media consultancy company which has contentious history of running similar negative campaigns. London Centre For Public Affairs (LCPA) warn UK MPs, politicians not to fall victims of this conference which apparently has no announced speakers nor working agenda. The conference has not even announced its venue! LCPA is observing cautiously this conference and other UAE negative lobby and pressure efforts in the UK. As an organisation interested in the UK-Europe Public Affairs, our centre vows to stop such activities by reaching out to UK parliamentarians and decision makers to expose this counterfeit event. Our centre will also contact Daniel Kawczynski MP who has been misled by the organisers. ""Indeed, this is a very notorious bogus event that aims at damaging Qatar image and meddling its relations with UK and Europe. Qatar’s investment in the UK has reached a record high of more than £35 billion with £5.3 billion – a remarkable 98% increase in the last 3 years. This is golden relation that must not be affected to satisfy the foreign UAE’s goals."" said LCPA spokesperson. The Centre will conduct an immediate campaign to stop this conference from achieving its misleading goals. We believe in strong UK relations with Qatar and refuse any external efforts to ruin the ever-flourishing bonds with Qatar. Recently, Secretary of State for International Trade, Dr Liam Fox stated,"" And as our countries go from strength to strength, we can be assured that this bond is stronger than ever."" LCPA will reach to the UK Government as well as the Foreign Affairs Committee to expose the goals of the organisers."
12,Three Messages That Astounded Me,news-society," At a recent event, where I was delivering messages from spirit to an audience of several hundred people eagerly looking at me and hoping to hear from a friend or loved one in the afterlife, I had the impression of two peas in a pod. This mental image suddenly changed into two fetuses… and then one melted away, leaving one embryo in the womb. I concentrated a moment, whispered a quick blessing for the departed child, then said, ""I feel the presence of a child who died in utero. He was one of a twin, and I feel his surviving brother is here in the audience. Can anyone take this?"" A deep silence filled the air. Then a hesitant hand went up from a man sitting in the tenth row. ""There are three sets of twins in my family,"" he said quietly. ""I was supposed to be part of the fourth, but my brother didn’t make it."" ""Thank you,"" I said, both to the man and to the spirit coming forward. I gave the man some personal details about his life, which he understood, then finished with, ""Your brother is telling me that he walks with you all the time. And when it’s time for you to go home – and that won’t be for quite awhile – he’ll meet you on the other side."" I took a deep breath to clear myself, then asked spirit to come through again. Suddenly, I felt a weight of sorrow on my shoulders, and a sharp chest pain. I looked at the people and spoke to the impressions I was now getting. ""A man is talking to me about a gunshot wound,"" I said. ""He’s telling me his wife is in the audience. He left behind a child – no, I’m sorry, I’m being corrected. The child hasn’t been born yet. It’s going to be a boy."" I described the man, and a woman raised her hand. ""That’s my husband,"" she said, fighting back tears. ""He was killed in a holdup last month."" Then she confirmed that an amniocentesis had revealed the child was male. ""He’s telling me that he’ll be there at the birth of your child,"" I said. ""And he’ll continue to watch over the two of you from the spirit world."" Thank you, the woman mouthed as she wiped her eyes. I took another breath to centre myself, then felt the next spirit presence. It had perhaps the most satisfying message I delivered that day. It was the words of a boy who had passed when he was eight years old. Being a parent, I have no idea of what it would be like to lose a child, and those kinds of messages always leave me with an ache in my heart. I described the boy to the audience, and the sensation I was feeling of how he had died. ""He wants his parents to know that he’s alright now,"" I said. ""He’s sitting on the floor playing with a little red fire engine. He says that’s his favourite toy."" The parents acknowledged my words with nods and gentle smiles. Afterward, they approached me to say that one day, a fireman had given the boy a special ride in an engine, and his favourite toy was indeed a shiny red fire truck. ""In fact,"" the father said, ""it’s sitting on top of his dresser in his room."" What made my day was when the father said that before this afternoon, he hadn’t believed in the afterlife. ""Thank you,"" he said. And as the couple walked away, I thanked spirit for allowing me to deliver those healing words."
13,Why Drunk Driving is Bad,news-society," Why Drunk Driving is Bad Every single day, 28 people die from drunk driving – that means fathers, mothers, babies, siblings are taken away from each other daily. If you are driving drunk, you are putting every person’s life at risk when you decide to start the ignition with a warped vision of reality. The unfortunate part about drunk driving statistics is that even if you are not driving drunk, because you are on the road with unsafe drivers, you are also at risk of being harmed. Studies show that those who get caught driving drunk have done so over 80 times before getting into legal trouble. This means that people are driving drunk until they are caught. The effects of drunk driving reach far beyond being irresponsible – it is the difference between life and death for many. Car accidents are devastating – extreme impact followed by injuries and even death can lead to lifelong regret, medical expenses and heartache. Car accidents can happen from a variety of circumstances: speeding, traffic violations, weather conditions, lack of visibility and drunk or distracted driving. With over one million lives claimed each year from car accidents and 20-50 million injuries endured by survivors, it is a hard reality to swallow that a large chunk of these fatalities are 100% avoidable by simply not getting behind the wheel after a few drinks. Most people are aware that drunk driving is dangerous and can lead to serious injuries, but there are a few other drunk driving facts that many people are unaware of. On top of potentially having your license revoked and spending time in jail, a first DUI offense in the US is typically between $7,772- $10,172. This chunk of money is broken down into: Minimum fine of $400 State restitution fund Attorney Fee (around $2,500) Alcohol abuse education fund Driving alcohol school Blood breath testing fee Auto Insurance Increase (typically between $3,600-$6,000) The damage from drunk driving is alarming yet not startling enough for people to stop getting behind the wheel while intoxicated. The consequences of drunk driving are life-changing and the tragic stories of family members lost too soon are avoidable – the next time you or your friends need a ride home after drinking, remember a safe ride home is just a phone call away."
14,Healing Veterans Across the U.S.,news-society," Help Heal Veterans (Heal Vets) is finding new ways to honor the memory of a fallen hero, and help returning veterans at the same time. If you have lost a loved one in military service, you will understand the importance of Memorial Day. Additionally, taking care of returning veterans is an ongoing mission for Heal Vets. In recent weeks they have partnered with ""Walking Dead"" actress Kerry Cahill. Kerry Cahill describes herself as an army brat growing up in small rural towns of Montana, Oregon, and Texas. In 2009 Cahill’s life changed forever when her father Michael Cahill who was fatally shot while working at Fort Hood in Killeen, Texas. Kerry Cahill joined forced with Help Heal Veterans (Heal Vets) to create a wristband in memory of her father similar to the one he wore daily. Heal Vets arts and crafts also provide therapy for veterans suffering from memory loss, stroke or extremity weakness. ""My dad was a hero he died saving the lives of others, and that is how I want his legacy to continue, helping others,"" says Kerry Cahill. ""When we first saw Michael Cahill's wristband it inspired us to share his story further. His life was a mission to heal veterans and our military. And he dedicated his life to the healing process. And he gave his life to protect those he treated. Working with his daughter Kerry Cahill on developing Cahill Wristband has been an honor."" Says Heal Heal Veterans CEO Joe McClain Heal Vets provides Arts and crafts therapy kits to help the rehabilitation of veterans. From those recuperating from injuries such as PTSD and traumatic brain injuries. Heal Vets arts and crafts also provide treatment for veterans suffering from memory loss, stroke or extremity weakness. Help Heal Veterans has distributed more than 31 million kits since 1971 from hundreds of craft categories. McClain adds, ""PTSD and TBI are growing issues with returning veterans. The importance of taking care of all wounds both physical and mental is a priority. Complete wellness has to be addressed for veterans to go back to fruitful and fulfilling civilian life."" Says McClain. Initially, as Decoration Day the day originated from the years following the Civil War.  Ending in 1965, the Civil War took more lives than any conflict in U.S. history. Nevertheless, in 1966 the federal government declared Waterloo, New York, the official birthplace of Memorial Day. Waterloo—which first celebrated the day on May 5, 1866—was chosen because it hosted an annual, community-wide event, during which businesses closed, and residents decorated the graves of soldiers with flowers and flags. The tragic loss of life led to the country claiming land to build national cemeteries. By the 1860’s towns and villages were holding springtime tributes to their fallen loved ones. Kerry Cahill is on a mission to ensure Michael Cahill’s work continues and to make sure that day filled with fate in November 2009 has a legacy and meaning. ""The wristband will be part of the craft kits provided by Heal Vets to veterans nationwide. The kits help give veterans a purpose and work well to distract them from the horrors of war and assist in helping them live a somewhat normal life.  The goal for both myself and Heal Vets is to create something that keeps the memory of my father and his work in the area of mental health and to help those suffering from post-traumatic syndrome (PTSD),"" says Cahill. For decades, Memorial Day continued to be observed on May 30, the date Logan had selected for the first Decoration Day. But in 1968 Congress passed the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, which established Memorial Day as the last Monday in May to create a three-day weekend for federal employees; the change went into effect in 1971. The same law also declared Memorial Day a national holiday. ""Memorial Day is about remembering military and veterans. Everyone should take the time to remember that because of the brave we are the land of the free,"" says McClain."
15,Central Asian media getting overcontrolled by Soros-funded organizations,news-society," Social stability in the Central Asia is presumably at risk as Soros-funded organizations are getting more influence over the main media channels. In October 2016, the representative office of the radio station «Ozodi» located in Tajikistan’s capital Dushanbe promoted anti Russia-China-Tajikistan cooperation agenda as a part of the so-called task received from organizations funded by famous American investor and philanthropist George Soros. The radio, popular among the youth and pro-active social groups in Tajikistan openly criticized Dushanbe’s support for Moscow-Beijing economic cooperation, discouraged rapprochement of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in terms of water consumption, economic and cross-border cooperation and tried to prevent anti-terrorist cooperation between Dushanbe, Moscow and Beijing. At the same time the station highly supported and promoted opposition movements in the country, particularly those funded by the U.S. organizations and funds. Among them are «Group-24», «Vatandor» movement etc. And it also encouraged the opposition movements in Ukraine. Given huge lack of financing of the federal media in the Central Asia the proposal became a sort of easy money for the radio administration. However, such information policy is extremely dangerous for economy-sensitive and terrorist-sensitive region. With the collapse of the Soviet Union more and more countries on the post-Soviet space looked more to the integration with the West, rather than with Russia. However, opposition movements in those countries were often influenced by pro-Western organizations interested in causing the chaos in the region and in getting more power there. The debate on the future development of the post-Soviet countries continues even today. Meanwhile earlier last week a number of anti-government protests and meetings financed by Soros’ Fund were held in Budapest while in April 2016 similar protests were held in Prague. As protestesters claimed the main purpose of those meetings was to oppose government policy that prevents activity of Western and pro-nationalist movements. Initiatives of the Soros Fund are often criticized by Russia and Eastern European countries. For instance, Victor Orban, Prime Minister of Hungary earlier this month criticized the EU migration policy and its financing by the Soros Fund saying that it’s not the first time when Brussels ""is dictating its will on Hungary "". Moreover, earlier this month thousands of people (most of the were students) protested in Budapest against legislation that could force the Central European University, founded by the financier George Soros, to move out of Hungary. The ruling rightwing Fidesz party passed the bill on that followed by criticism of Viktor Orban who claimed that Hungary authorities had been once again put under huge pressure of the US and the EU which was not acceptable. Summarizing everything, it’s important to note that through creating a negative information agenda in the Central Asia and in Tajikistan particularly organizations affiliated with the Soros Fund are cultivating opposition movements in the Republic. These initiatives might undermine social stability in the country and cause mass anti-government protests. All in all, the post-Soviet countries shall decide which path to follow on their own, their choices should not be affected by any kind of propaganda, either Russian or Western."
16,Obama Care Opposition and Women's Healthcare,news-society," Katie Hogan,  Executive Director of Organizing for Action is sharing her comments on the Obama Care repeal and replace efforts, and women's healthcare.   There is still time to take action by calling your Representatives. This is the group that is deciding the future of women's health care. In this room, top opponents of Obamacare met yesterday to try to hammer out last-minute changes to their disastrous repeal bill. The first version of the bill already had plenty of unnerving provisions. It would hike costs for families who need help the most. It would cut off all federal funding for Planned Parenthood, which provides crucial health services to millions of women every year. And of course, it would leave 24 million fewer people insured, in large part by pushing millions of low-income Americans off of Medicaid. That means that on top of everything else, many poor women would lose their access to free contraception that was guaranteed under Obamacare to everyone with insurance. Repealing Obamacare would be a disaster for women's health, but there is still time to call your representative and make your support of this law known. Use OFA's online tool to call your representative before they vote on repeal today. Apparently, all of the provisions above still didn't go far enough for some members of the House, so they gathered in this room to make some additional changes. In an effort to win a few more votes, the congressmen in the room urged the White House to scrap the ""Essential Health Benefits"" provision, which requires all insurance plans to cover certain critical services. So what exactly would scrapping these benefits mean? Well, among other things: Insurers would no longer be required to cover pregnancy, maternity, or newborn care, making it much more costly and more difficult to obtain. Preventative care, like mammograms, Pap smears, and birth control would no longer be free and guaranteed. A return to the days where insurers can impose lifetime limits on patients with expensive illnesses. Taken together, there's no way around it -- these changes would once again make being a woman a pre-existing condition. These members of Congress took a bill that would already wreak havoc on the lives of millions of Americans and worked to gut its most important remaining protections, with women set to disproportionately pay the price. The policies they pushed might make sense to the people in that room, but America doesn't look a whole lot like that room. Some of us don't want our essential health benefits ripped away from us."
17,"Idi Amin’s Reign of Terror, Trial and Error",news-society," Introduction Whenever the name ""Idi Amin"" is invoked, it denotes elements of brutality, bloodshed and dictatorship--the leadership techniques that made him famous for being infamous. Amin was arguably one of the most polarizing political leaders of the 20Th century. His mental stability has been a subject of contentious debate across the globe because of the cruelty with which he ruled Uganda from 1971 to 1979. In an attempt to understand his disastrous regime, some geniuses have dramatize it through theatrical satire. The snippets of comic episodes in the movies ""The Last King of Scotland"" and ""The Rise and Fall of Idi Amin,"" give us a glimpse of what looks like his clinical insanity--Idi Amin was unable to discern fantasy and reality. His narcissistic character and dictatorial style of leadership are known. What has not been explored extensively, however, is how his lack of qualities of a good leader played a role in his downfall, which is the main focus of this article. Amin's Rise to Power Believed to have been born of a Kakwa father and a Lugbara mother between 1923 and 1925, Idi Amin was the third president of the republic of Uganda. What made him a fascinating figure of the 20th century was his ability to rise quickly through the ranks: assistant cook with the King's African Rifle (1947); army private with the infant division of KAR (1947); commissioned officer (1949); lieutenant (1959); captain (1962); deputy commander of army (1964); army commander (1965); colonel (1967); commander of all armed forces (1970); and president of the republic of Uganda (1971-1979). In 1965, Amin and Prime Minister Obote were accused by the Democratic Republic of Congo of smuggling and trading in ivory and gold with the rebels fighting the government of Patrice Lumumba. This controversial trade in exchange for guns to aid the rebels engendered an investigation into the matter by the Ugandan Parliament--at that time the ceremonial presidential position was being held by King Mutesa III. To obstruct justice and block their possible indictment, Obote initiated a constitutional amendment that abolished kingdoms. He then connived with Amin to attack Mutesa's palace and force him into exile. After King Mutesa had been deposed, Obote declared himself the executive president with full presidential powers. Following Amin's suspicious recruitment into the Ugandan army of mostly people from his tribe and from Southern Sudan, Obote demoted him from being in charge of all armed forces to commander of the army. When Amin learned that the government was planning to arrest him for embezzlement of public funds, he staged a coup that toppled Obote's government in 1971. Reign of Terror One of the qualities of a good leader is his ability to instill confidence in his followers. To the contrary, Amin created doubt, suspicion, anxiety and fear in his people. He is believed to have murdered over 500,000 people. He carried out public executions of his opponents and suspected criminals in broad-day light; murdered religious leaders, judges, and intellectuals; massacred over 5,000 Acholi and Lang soldiers loyal to former president Obote; and butchered prominent and public figures he suspected to pose a threat to his presidency such as Benedicto Kiwanuka, Janani Luwum, Joseph Muburu, Frank Kalimuzo, Byron Kawandwa, Erinayo Wilson Oryemo, and Charles Oboth. His reign of terror led to his loss of support, not only from his army loyalists, but also from the world leaders. His inability to hold himself and his close associates to higher standards suggests that Amin did not have strong values that are characteristic of a strong leader. His authorization and facilitation of the hijackers loyal to a Palestinian terror organization, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine External Operation (PFLP-EO), to hijack the plane carrying Israeli nationals in 1976 indicated that he was the terrorists' sympathizer. This led to Israeli commandos' seizure of Entebbe Airport and the eventual rescue of most of their hostages in a matter of hours. The ride on Entebbe embarrassed his presidency and exposed the weaknesses of his army. His alliance with a terror organization estranged his former allies, in turn Israel and Britain started withdrawing their presence in Uganda, which continued to isolate him further. Amin was emotionally unintelligent--a recipe for disastrous leadership. Neither did he have the ability to manage his own emotions, nor did he have the understanding of what his emotions meant and how they affected others. When Archbishop Ben Kiwanuka delivered a note of protest to his policies of arbitrary killings, he murdered him together with his two ministers in a staged car accident. This brutal action continued to reveal that his regime was a human-rights violator and diminished his international support. In order for a good leader to succeed at fulfilling his vision, he needs to build a network of valuable people around him who have the ability and the necessary experience to implement and manage his or her change efforts. Idi Amin's reign presented a unique contradiction. He oppressed not only the poor, the intellectual and the religious; he also persecuted his close associates. The incident in which his Vice president Idris was injured in a suspicious accident led to the beginning of the end of his presidency. When Idris got injured in the motor vehicle accident, his bodyguards suspected foul play and mutinied and ran into exile in Tanzania. Amin pursued them and annexed Kagera, one of the regions of Tanzania, falsely accusing Tanzania of creating hostilities against his country. Tanzanian defense forces responded militarily, chased Amin out of their country and orchestrated his ouster in Uganda in 1979. Trial and Error A good leader is the one who is focused, personable, knowledgeable, good decision maker and visionary. Amin seemed to posses none of these leadership qualities. He made errors after errors--from the time he set foot into State House to the time of his overthrow. Nobody knew what exactly Amin's vision for his country was. As soon as he ascended to power, he promised to relinquish power and release prisoners of war. This changed in an instant as he suspended some provisions in the Ugandan constitution and placed military tribunal over the civil law. These new constitutional amendments meant that cabinet ministers would be subjected to military discipline. Consequently, many members of his cabinet ran into exile for fear of their lives. The manipulation of the Ugandan constitution also damaged his reputation and signaled to the world that he had ushered in an era of terror, which would go on to grip the country for the rest of his presidency. Amin lacked the ability to recognize skill and develop those around him--one of the great qualities of an accomplished leader. Instead, he looked at intellectuals and the educated as his adversaries. He filled his army and his cabinet with sycophants--foreigners and people from his own tribe who had no leadership experience. His army was composed of 50% South Sudanese, 26% Congolese, and 24% Ugandans. His tribe occupied 60% of the 22 cabinet ministerial posts. Seventy-five percent of the ministerial posts were occupied by army generals, and 80% to 87% of the army generals in his cabinet were Muslims--despite the fact that Muslims constituted 5% of the Ugandan population. As a result, his stooges mismanaged his government, caused the destruction of the infrastructure and contributed to total economic collapse. It is ironic that his Libyan friends fought alone during Uganda's war with Tanzania while his own soldiers resorted to looting and packing their army trucks with their belongings to flee the country. Open-mindedness and flexibility were in short supply in Amin's regime. Instead of investing, developing and maintaining relationships with investors and entrepreneurs who were a revenue stream for the country, he harassed them, destroyed their businesses and expropriated their properties. After the expulsion of the Asians and Indians, his relationships with Britain, India, and Israel got ruined. Britain reduced its presence in Uganda in 1973. India also severed its relationship with Uganda. And Israel cut its ties with the Ugandan army. In retaliation, Amin expelled Israeli military advisors and turned to Libya and Soviet Union for consolation. His continued isolation by the super powers affected Uganda economically and militarily. Furthermore, unemployment rose; sugar and cement factories collapsed; and Uganda's industries came to a standstill because of the failure to repair industrial machinery. Instilling in his people a sense of belonging is another trait of an experienced leader. As I mentioned earlier, Amin's brutal and dictatorial regime caused massive movement of intellectuals into exile. One of the major defections was his Prime Minister Henry Kyemba in 1977; he wrote a book ""State of Blood"" while in exile that exposed the inner workings of Amin's regime. Amin underestimated the brain power of Ugandan intellectuals. It was through the intellectual alliance of Ugandan exile--working alongside Tanzanian defense forces--that expedited the collapse of Amina's regime. The intellectual alliance comprised of 28 military units including the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA); Kikosi Maalum, led by Milton Obote (former president of Uganda) together with Tito Okello (former president of Uganda) and David Oyite Ojok as commanders; FRONASA led by Yoweri Museveni (Current president of the Republic of Uganda); Save Uganda Movement (SUM) led by Akena p'Ojok, William Omaria and Ateker Ejaly; and Freedom Union lead by Godrey Binaisa, Andrew Kayiira and Olara Otunnu. Conclusion Idi Amin's regime (1971-1979) can best be described as a comedy of terror, trial and error: he carried out summary execution of his people; associated with, and sponsored terrorists; expelled investors and expropriated their properties; persecuted intellectuals; invaded Tanzania, a sovereign nation; surrounded himself with bowing henchmen with no leadership experience; alienated and isolated Uganda from the rest of the world because of his foreign policies; mismanaged the government; and orchestrated the total collapse of Uganda's economy. It is inconceivable and inexplicable that when all this was happening, the world was watching. As a saying goes, ""the world is dangerous, not because of what people do, but because of those who sit and watch."" I would appreciate it if someone told me a person who said those immortal words!"

19,The Cop Blaster Just Made Police Misconduct Reporting Easy,news-society," The future of American law enforcement accountability has arrived with the launch of a new website capable of truly altering the balance of power in the streets. The CopBlaster.com Police Tracking and Misconduct Complaint Reporting System utilizes technology similar to that used by law enforcement to track citizens, but instead turns the tables by allowing citizens to track them instead. Anyone can login with their Facebook account or sign up for a free membership to expose the truth about police officers, prosecutors, judges, and snitches without fear of censorship. As an ex-con recently released from a federal penitentiary, the founder of Cop Blaster knows firsthand that the greatest threat to liberty in America is not terrorism or some foreign power. It is the Federal Government of the United States, more specifically, those that swear to protect and defend the Constitution domestically, but do the opposite. Those offenders are police officers, prosecutors, judges, and the snitches that enable them to kill, kidnap, steal, and harass in the name of injustice. Starting with those responsible for his persecution, the founder of Cop Blaster has begun aggregating names, pictures, addresses, and other information hoping to lead by example. Persecuted for what? Creating a series of websites that received a lot of media scrutiny in 2012 for allowing people to anonymously post complaints about people. When sentenced to federal prison for sending a threatening email to someone that began stalking him over the websites he was ordered not to run them or any site that involves content removal while on supervision. That condition does not prohibit building new sites that do not remove content, so Cop Blaster will not remove content from the site for any reason and those seeking to remove content will be told to petition the judge to strike the conditions. Not just a revenge site. Cop Blaster has dedicated considerable time to exposing wrongs done to others that he met while behind bars and believes that such stories further demonstrate why Cop Blaster is necessary. Stories such as an inmate dying due to medical neglect, a federal judge that denied a defendant the right to tell his true whereabouts to the jury because they were considered classified by the U.S. Army, and an illegal immigrant that was wrongfully shot by a former Seattle Police Officer of the Year. The founder of Cop Blaster has chosen to host his site overseas to thwart any future attempt by the United States to take it down and has configured it to continue running should he be re-incarcerated at an upcoming violation hearing. Cop Blaster was ordered to participate in computer monitoring after his computer ban was lifted for being unconstitutional. Cop Blaster installed the monitoring software as required, but had to disable it after two computers were brought to their knees by outdated and misbehaving programs. Now US Probation is trying to get his old ban re-instated and bury the truth about the monitoring software company.

20,Our Modern Plight: An Observation Into Our Current State in Time & How It Affects Us All,news-society," As of lately the media has portrayed much chaos, all at an immensely alarming rate, and not just local predicaments, but major events taking place globally. Everyday you hear news of ""Shootings"" ""Riots"" ""Attacks"" etc. Simply put, its violence affecting vast amounts of people. From my research and overall observance of not only these current issues, but within the web of it all, the truth has become evident. The real issue here doesn't lie within our Race, Ethnicity, Police, Presidential Election or anything else the media continuously force- feeds you. Yes, these are individual concerns; however, they are due to a much greater problem. Once you are aware of this problem, all else will fall into place. The media's recent portrayal of events is merely a textbook case of: Divide and Conquer: The policy of maintaining control over one's subordinates or subjects by encouraging dissent between them. This strategy is executed by the technique of: Creating or encouraging divisions among the subjects to prevent alliances that could challenge the sovereign Why? The U.S government is run by a privately owned Central Bank named the Federal Reserve, or Fed; this system creates its own policies, and controls both the Interest rates and entire money supply of the United States. No, it is not actually Federal nor does it have any reserves. The Federal Reserve operates in absolute secrecy. As Alan Greenspan, Former Chairman of the Fed, said when asked what should be the proper relationship between the Chairman and the President of the United States, ""... The Federal Reserve is an independent agency, and that means,... that there is no other agency of government, which can overrule actions that we take. So long as that is in place... then what the relationships are, don't frankly, matter."" This corporation was given the ability, to not only create money out of thin air, but to then lend it to the government, with Interest. Interest that the Government pays by the enforcive means of the Internal Revenue Service and Social Security system. The IRS acts as the collection branch for these payments; our taxes go directly to the Federal Reserve. Currently, there is no ""law"" which states we are actually required to pay an Income Tax. The Fed and IRS were both established in 1913. With the Social Security Act being passed in 1935, wherein all citizens were covertly pledged as collateral to these Central Banks for the debt of the United States. This debt can only be paid off by borrowing even more money into existence; money that is no longer backed by gold or anything for that matter, the value it has is the value we give it. This worthless paper currently in circulation is actually a loan from the Fed to you, with Interest. As Josiah Stamp, prominent banker and economist, once said, ""... If you want to continue to be slaves of the banks and pay the cost of your own slavery, then let bankers continue to create money and control credit. Money = Debt = Slavery This means a private cartel of bankers have complete control over the Government and its money system as we know it. What we call a ""Democracy"" In the Unites States, in actuality, is an Oligarchy consisting of largely foreign banking families. These families have historically been called the ""Money Changers"", Manipulating and controlling a nations money system while allowing it to appear to be controlled by the government. As Mayer Amschel Rothschild, founder of the Rothschild banking dynasty, famously said, ""Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws."" Or better yet, as his son, Nathan Rothschild said, ""Who controls the issuance of money, controls the government."" These banking families, with its institutions and its financial system, had seized the U.S government over a century ago, through years of corruption and manipulation. After Woodrow Wilson became president, agreeing to sign the 1913 Federal Reserve Act, in exchange for sponsorship and campaign funding from these bankers, he later wrote, ""... I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit... We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world, no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men. "" Today, we are facing some of the most violent, inhumane treatment of our people in every way, and the rate of which these major incidents are taking place is reaching its boiling point. No, these aren't accidents or sporadic acts of hate, these are orchestrated events inflicted by these same families. With a hidden hand in virtually all levels of commerce, they are able to utilize the monopoly of resources they fund, such as the influential Media and of course, the Military Industrial Complex. From funding opposing sides of wars to opposing sides of political parties, these International Bankers have artificially created panics, wars, and countless *False flag events throughout history; One crucial example, ""The Panic of 1907"", was the catalyst of the governments change to a private Central Bank, the Federal Reserve System. The bankers engineered a staged panic in order to alter public opinion and thereby outcome of the matter, bringing in laws and legislation that citizens would not accept otherwise. These False flags are still taking place today, with consequences and repercussions being devastating, not only to ourselves, but to our freedom and future as well. The changes in which these events bring, will inevitably affect us all. The goals of these families would face resistance if openly stated, so in order to execute their plans, they do so without stating their intentions. As what's been called ""P.R.S."" Problem-Reaction-Solution The Banking Families (Elite), Government Etc. create a Problem, whether its an Attack, War, or Economic crisis, Whatever is best for the pursued outcome. They blame someone or something for this ""problem"", using the media to portray and thereby control the event and information how they best find suitable. They will only tell you what they want you to know, presenting it as fact or truth. This in effect, causes whatever reaction among the people they initially wanted. Now with the masses sharing this urgent reaction, Fear, Anger, Hatred, Etc. The government shall respond with an urgent Solution, one that will seem justified due to the outcome of the problem they covertly created.This will on the surface, seem like the appropriate action, it was manufactured to appear so, however, the true intent and sought outcome are only to advance their agenda. Simply put, the purpose of P.R.S, with the use of False flags, is to attain a desired reaction in order to implement a desired solution. Why? The goal of these families is to usher in, what has been called by Politicians and bankers, a ""New World Order"", or the rebranded version, ""Globalization."" As David Rockefeller, prominent banker, said himself, ""We are on the verge of a global transformation. All we need is the right major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order."" That is to bring all life on earth under one single global state, a one-world government. It is a merger between Capitalism and Communism, based on the theory of Collectivism: The practice or principle of giving a group priority over each individual in it, with ownership of land and the means of production by the state. It isn't necessarily about world government, but rather world governance, with personal control by a few. Individuality will no longer exist; we will be born and bred for the sole purpose of serving the state, never understanding the true nature of our self nor our lives. Our world will be one of enslaved servants, with no families, no spirituality, no intellect, no creativity, no privacy and no freedom, only labor. We are being conditioned, and our youth indoctrinated, to accept these changes being imposed upon our lives, to obey, and even learn to like these changes. You can see it in our educational system, where the focus isn't on life, creativity, uniqueness, or true wisdom; but on conformity, obedience, repetitiveness, memorization and standardized testing. We are told what to think, not how, nor why. We are taught less about the real history of our world, preventing us from learning from our ancestor's previous mistakes. Controlling how people perceive their past, controls their perception of the present. As George Orwell, acclaimed author, accurately said, ""The most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history."" They seek to keep us uninformed, misled and oblivious to the true nature of the world around us, accepting what we are given as reality. Through the usage of drugs, legal or illegal, genetically modified foods and chemicals within our air and water, we are literally being sedated, to become further docile and content within this system. We are constantly distracted, using our mind, time and energy for work, consumerism, materialism, and all forms of entertainment, never allowing ourselves to truly experience and focus on what matters most. We are forever immersed in an external, false reality of ignorance. One in which privacy does not exist, virtually everything you do on a phone, computer, or at work, is monitored and recorded. We are giving away this privacy ourselves, by accepting agreements with terms and conditions we don't even read. To use applications, which rarely enlighten us nor educate us, but rather distract and evoke ego, competition, separation and jealousy within us. This in effect, causes our impressionable youth to make less independent decisions in their lives, being influenced by others within this false reality of perfection. This repetitive cycle of work-eat-sleep, while blindly entertaining ourselves in between, is what keeps us supporting this system. It only works because you do. In order to rid ourselves from the shackles of this society and break free from this tyranny, we must become more attentive and observant to the changes occurring in our lifetime. We must analyze current and past issues, not only from mainstream media coverage, but rather independent research. Look beneath the surface, ask who would benefit from your reaction to this news, put the puzzle pieces together yourself. The facts are there. You will start to the see the process of Problem-Reaction-Solution unfold right before your eyes, and how major events the media perpetuates, are all inner connected. The truth becomes apparent, even obvious. Do not ignore it. It is imperative that we educate ourselves and share this information, the more awareness we spread, the more power we gain through each other. We need to become more vocal about the corruption and manipulation in our system; we must work to expose the lies of this minority, ruling the vast majority. We must organize. If not, we will find ourselves living within a totalitarian society, where thinking independently or questioning the ""establishment"" will indefinitely, result in death. We've already watched this happen to many of our great leaders of the past, who've advocated this same truth, and even millions of innocent people who fell victim to an oppressive regime or system. History repeats itself; and we are on the verge of this same change. We cannot continue to let this happen, to ourselves, our youth, our families, our world, nor our future. We must wake up, we need to seek clarity within this matrix, and we must seek truth. Above all, we must let go of all indoctrinated beliefs, dogmas and ways of thinking about one another, and ourselves. Through mainstream religion, political ideologies, race, age, wealth, class and gender, we have separated ourselves from one another, judging each other based of external illusions. We are being played into the classic divide and conquer method, used through out history to control populations. For if we are constantly fighting amongst each other, blaming opposing political parties, both in fear and ignorance, we will never fully recognize the real force controlling and manipulating our lives. The simple truth is, we are all one. All living and deceased matter is made up of the same particles, for it is only our physical manifestation within this dimension. We are in actuality, soul, spirit and consciousness within a human body. We are eternal, infinite beings of energy, sharing a physical experience on earth. We are all equal, in every way. We are equal to each other, all humans, all animals, all nature and all living entities, all life. Let us free our mind of ego and imposed ideologies, so that we may come together in harmony, and unite as one, co-existing as loving, conscious, intelligent beings. That in turn, would allow every soul to rejoice and feel absolute beautiful and pure peace within, until then.

1,Largest U.S. Oil & Gas Source Discovered - No Motivation To Get It,news-society," On November 15th, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) assessed that Texas’s Wolfcamp shale contains an estimated 20 billion barrels of oil, and 1.6 billion barrels of natural gas liquids.  These figures elevate Wolfcamp to being the largest assessment of continuous oil discovered in US history—serving as yet another reminder that even areas that have already yielded billions of barrels of oil and gas are still capable of producing billions more. That said, the questions on everyone’s minds are ""will discoveries like this continue to occur?"" and ""what does this mean for jobs and the economy?"" It’s important to point out that even the already-discovered and tapped O&G deposits tend to only give up 50-60% of the oil and gas that’s buried in earth.  These low percentages are due primarily to technological limitations, so as time goes on, not only will our discovery and assessment practices improve, so too will our recovery ability increase to more effectively exhaust these deposits. ""Changes in technology and industry practices can have significant effects on what resources are technically recoverable,"" said Walter Guidroz, program coordinator for the USGS Energy Resources Program. ""That’s why we continue to perform resource assessments throughout the United States and the world."" While it’s good to know we are growing more technically capable of both assessing and producing oil and gas from on and off-shore locations, the current economics simply fail to motivate most O&G companies from presently taking advantage of new discoveries like Wolfcamp. With the current price per barrel hovering around $46 USD/bbl, it’s just not fiscally attractive enough to pursue at this time. The bottom line for hopeful US job seekers is that foreign entities are still putting a strain on domestic companies’ ability to expand.  Like we saw from January of 2013 through July 2014, participating countries in OPEC failed to reach an agreement on production limits [to cap production and thereby protect unit price], and their insatiable quest for profits led to an ever-increasing rig count and production—an unchecked expansion vis-à-vis market demand.  The result: $97 down to $45 USD/bbl. The US rig count has been slowly trending upward (though last week, the count decreased by 1), but the price per barrel needs to rebound to Q2 2015 numbers before worker-demand increases. Morris Burns, a former president of the Permian Basin Petroleum Association noted, ""We are picking up a few rigs every now and then but we won’t see it really take off until we [get] that price in the $60 to $65 range."" We have more oil, and no motivation to go get it."
2,A Challenge to Our Two Candidates – Why Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton MUST Read This Book,news-society," E. Dennis Brod, the philosopher and author of The Essence of Ethical Pragmatism (the common sense philosophy), has issued a challenge to Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. The recently published book, lauded as being non-partisan and impartial, explains the philosophy of ethical pragmatism (EP) and shows how we can all lead our lives smarter and better, whether simply doing a personal, individual chore or running a government like that of the United States. In terms of serving in federal government, whether in a low-level ministerial job, in the Congress, the judiciary or in any level of administration in the executive branch including the president, the simple tenets of this philosophy as set out in the book would seem to help in reaching all the goals we seek in our lives and, regarding candidates for the presidency, in reaching the goals that candidates often talk about but seldom seem to achieve. The challenge deals with one specific goal related to the philosophy. The author’s views on how to get things done should not be considered a theoretical, utopian fantasy. This is a philosophy that deals with reality. EP is based on pragmatism and insists on doing only that which will work without regard to labels, prejudices, ideologies or dogmas. It requires accurately assessing facts and ignoring all corrupting emotions. It is completely non-partisan, impartial and objective. It requires the use of common sense. Three major industry reviewers just recently said about the book: ""Brod’s exposition is undoubtedly clearer than those of his philosophical predecessors …This is an admirably bipartisan book and it radiates open-mindedness."" —Kirkus Reviews ""Brod’s book is clearly written and easily accessible to lay readers … those seeking a practical philosophy will find interesting ideas presented here."" —Blueink Reviews ""Observing incompetence and hypocrisy in government and society, the author proposes that these current systems are faulty … There is much food for thought in this readable philosophical book"" Rebecca Foster, Foreword/Clarion Reviews This is what Brod’s challenge says about this one crucial topic in his challenge to Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump: I challenge Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump to acknowledge and address the issue described in this article. Not very long ago, our government managed to get us through some very difficult situations. In the last century, we fought two world wars, engaged in other armed conflicts around the globe, survived the greatest economic catastrophe in history and made great progress in the beginnings of overcoming racial oppression. Unfortunately, we may never be able to repeat whatever successes we achieved then because the political character of our nation has changed dramatically. As a result of this change, shown in the following paragraphs, the candidates for the presidency now must realize that they have to prepare for something entirely different in terms of intensity than that of their predecessors if they are elected. They have to know that they will be stepping into a figurative combat zone in attempting to lead our country. The great change between politics of today and that of yesteryear relates to attitudes and behavior of elected officials and others serving in, or working in relationship to, government. I am talking principally about the flagrant and destructive hostility between our only two real political parties. There have always been differences between and among members of different political parties. Differences among humans is what defines us as a species and, in many way, contributes to the development of ideas, technologies and varied perspectives that result in myriad benefits to our race. But today we see something that is inimical to mere differences of opinion or broad philosophical approaches to government. Today we have hatred. And the hatred is not confined to elected officials and those serving in government. It is rampant among journalists and in all aspects of what we call the media. It is felt and expressed by the general public. There are many issues being addressed by both candidates for the presidency. But in reporting, in general, the media tend to focus more on personalities than issues. The media appear to have the notion that the general public is incapable of appreciating the serious side of election campaigns and perhaps they are right. They seem to believe that the average voter prefers to hear about, see, and to a much lesser degree, read those things that are commonly regarded as sensational. Predictably, that is exactly what they provide. As a result, coverage of elections in our country has degenerated into a pandering frenzy. Many commentators, not all in the United States, believe that, in general, the media are biased. In this particular election the overwhelming criticism indicates a bias in favor of Hillary Clinton, doubtless growing out of the notion that most of the media are on the left of the political spectrum, but also based on actual observations about the content of coverage. But this tends to mean much more than favoring one candidate over another. It also means favoring one political party over the other, ignoring the reality that nearly half of the American electorate will vote for each party’s nominees. Although newspaper and other media endorsements are a tradition in American elections, media efforts to ruin a candidate are something else, and this appears to be the situation orchestrated against Donald Trump, and of necessity, the Republican party. This is not limited simply to negative photos and slants on statements, speeches and policy positions, but an outright scheme to ruin the candidate by making him seem ridiculous at every opportunity. As one of the recent reviews states, my book is ""admirably bipartisan"". This is true, but the philosophy is more than ""bipartisan"", it is totally non-partisan. It is completely objective and impartial. I can only speculate about the above reviewer’s thought processes, but this conclusion was presumably reached due to the express tenet of the philosophy which requires focus on the facts – objectively, impartially and unemotionally with a total disregard of labels. Focus on actual facts is no longer occurring in our political campaigns in general, and in the one being waged now, the loss of focus is a disaster. In terms of the relationship between the respective supporters of our two political parties, the media are doing a great disservice to the electorate. Whatever the media think of the electorate – that they are stupid, ignorant, irresponsible, foolish and gullible – the electorate deserve the truth. This means the unvarnished truth, without spin, without slant, without secret agendas and without opinion unless such communication is openly declared to be an opinion. Reporting the truth means treating both political parties without bias. It means holding the candidates to the same standards, regardless of gender, personality, hair style, size, weight or any other characteristic that does not directly reflect on one’s ability to govern. Intelligence, integrity, compassion, executive prowess – these are relevant. Reporting or commenting on trifles, personalities and the sensational is not simply irrelevant, it is an abandonment of responsibility. But there is something more. Holding up any candidate to personal ridicule foments the type of enmity that augments emotional responses and contributes to the abandonment of focus on values and issues. It fuels the emotions rather than the intellect and it creates and atmosphere more conducive to conflict than cooperation. In terms of coverage, whether in favor of one candidate or the other, any intelligent observer has to be dismayed at the amount of media exposure regarding, as examples, Hillary Clinton’s difficulty getting through a subway turnstile or Donald Trump’s hair. But this is what we have and it is difficult to change. Speaking of change, Donald Trump wants to make America great again. This is a noble goal. Although this notion is a slogan of the Trump campaign, I am certain that Hillary Clinton, if she felt that America was no longer great, would be in favor of making America great again too. To make a point, let us assume that both candidates came to publically agree on wanting to make America great again. Does this relate to anything in the book about EP? Is this related to the challenge being made in this piece? Yes, because the simple, apparently unacknowledged fact is that no president alone has the power to make America or anything great again or even for the first time for that matter. In fact, all plans, projects and programs, whether foreign or domestic, whether social or military, cannot be implemented in our country without the participation, consent and funding by the Congress. And at this time in our history, our Congress consists of two parties at war with each other. The two candidates are challenged to acknowledge this. In the book, the philosophy indicates how to get things done in a pragmatic way. In order to do that, certain requirements have to be respected, one of which is being totally objective when making observations so as to start working with the facts. And by facts, we mean the real facts, without spin, without preconceived notions and with complete impartiality. This is very difficult for the public to do when, among other negative things, they are bombarded nightly by the bilge from scripts written for late night talk show hosts bent on ridicule. No one in that situation wants to be serious about the future of our country because entertainment, no matter how destructive to our nation, is better for television ratings. EP requires being honest with others, but particularly with one’s self, no matter how painful it may be. Without the unabashed truth, any attempt to address a problem, confront an issue, design a plan or create anything new is like trying to build a skyscraper on quicksand (no intention to refer to a Donald Trump here). In terms of this particular concept, this is what the book itself, as well as the philosophy explained in the book, would propose: that the facts to be acknowledged by both candidates are the realities associated with relations between our two American political parties. This is the most pressing situation ruining our country because it diverts focus away from issues to partisan political (what the book defines as ""competitive politics"") activities. These activities cause legislative gridlock, waste energy, effort and talent and cause the failure of our elected and appointed officials to meet their responsibilities to the American people. So what is the totality of the challenge to these two candidates? What can these candidates can get from this book? First, they can sincerely begin to recognize and confront reality of what an elected president will face. They can get the point that unless each has a way of bringing the two political parties together, they will go nowhere in attempting to fulfill the loftiest goals they are promising to the American people. And second, the respective candidates and their teams can, and must, through the type of critical thinking described in the book, devise a sensible program for effecting a reconciliation between Democrats and Republicans. In so doing, they will be on their way to making our government function the way it was intended to function and the way it did for generations before. When I suggest a sensible program, I do not mean platitudes and generalities, I mean specifics and details. They could start with such things as making appointments in the new administration or in the judiciary. They could use their considerable collective abilities to devise other creative ways to bring all our officials to believe they are all on the same team. This does not require a sacrifice of one’s core beliefs. Quoting from Chapter Four of the book ""[W]e should never compromise principles, but always be willing to compromise positions"". In an overview of this specific challenge relative to the prevailing reality of the state of our two political parties, this writer believes that the candidate who presents the first credible plan for accomplishing this goal will have an easier path to the White House."
3,The Muslims in India are Blackmailing The Indian Majority in the Name of Cow Slaughter.,news-society," The Muslims are never happy anywhere in the world and more so in Islamic countries. They always find out innovative ways to invent stories of atrocities on them and start destabilizing wherever they are in minority. Throughout the world Muslims never place country before the religion, it's always I am Muslim first then I am Indian or Iranian or whatever but for the rest of Indians Its I am Indian first then a Sikh or a Hindu or whatever and this is the underlying worrying part for a diverse nation like us, to have people around us whose loyalty is more for their faith than the country and this is always dangerous. In India in fact they are vetoing Hindu development. There is a reservation for Muslims in India but the majority of India's poor committing suicides in Haryana, Punjab, Chhattisgarh are poor Hindus yet being Hindu they receive no reservation. They are not given a chance to seek salvation through visiting Char-Dham at state expenses on the contrary when they attempt with their own hard earned money they are halted at the drop of a hat. It has nowadays become an annual event so there is no hue and cry. Even During extreme emergencies Haz is never delayed and its heavily subsidized. Haz according to me not at all important as if it is so important according to their faith and if it is accepted that a true Muslim should conduct Haj at least once in his lifetime, then why is it that I never find a mention of any of our great Muslim Nawabs and Rulers from Tipu Sultan the Great, Akbar The greater, Aurangzeb the greatest etc and none of the other great rulers of India has ever conducted Haj. What should be my ideal take on this fact? that they were not Muslims or Haj is not so Important in Islam? There is a cry of intolerance from the likes of Amir khan and some others but do they realise that if they were to conduct their business from other liberal countries like The Calipahate, Iran, Saudi etc they would be now hiding or dead already. There is a lot of shout against the beef ban. Now Muslims to destabilise the atmosphere cry that Islam is under threat. In fact as Hindus believe in respecting other's religious sentiments. This also one major reason for banning cow laughter in India and not for reasons the media and Carnivorous group of men vying for the last blood drop of a cow are putting forward. In Hades Muhammad the prophet described and advised his followers to not eat beef as it is also referred to as poison by Muhammed Himself. Beef is not a food of Muslims anywhere in the world, nowhere in the Muslim countries beef is a food. Arabs don't eat it, pathans don't eat it, Pakistani's don't eat it, Turk's don't eat it,Iranians don't eat beef, Iraqis don't,. Now which Muslims started eating this in direct disobedience to the Hades? It's the Muslim Nawabs of Central India who were then ruling a Hindu Majority Kingdom started this custom of eating beef as a symbol of humiliation, control and power over the Hindus. It was akin to showing the majority Hindus his proper place. To insult the majority Hindus and show brute power they started eating beef, This helped in creating an atmosphere of fear and felicitated their rule. In fact the word 'Bara-Gost' generally is referred to Beef was coined in by native resident of Pakistan and as they never ate beef used it in a derogatory parlance to refer to the Mohajirs that went from Central India Thinking Pakistan would be heaven. In fact it's the Muslims who should come forward and fight for a Beef ban and not otherwise."
4,Pokemon Go And Legal Implications,news-society," Pokemon GO is an augmented reality game that embeds virtual creatures in the physical space. Therefore, virtual and physical space co-exist as the virtual creatures Pokemon can appear anywhere, even in the garden of your neighbour. The goal of the game is to find and catch them. The intersection of virtual and physical space urged legal professionals to start considering the impact of augmented reality games on privacy, data protection, road accidents, personal injury claims and trespassing. Privacy and Data Protection: Personal data protection and privacy are among the primary legal implications that need to be taken into consideration as information about locations is gathered, shared and stored. Personal data protection influences professional and social life, as well as, the private life of citizens. In Cyprus, ‘The Processing of Personal Data (Protection of Individual) Law of 2001’ (138(I)2001) regulates the collection, the process and the use of personal data. Road Accidents and Personal Injury: Given that Pokemon can appear anywhere, the number of road accidents and personal injuries claims increases. Pokemon GO players are so obsessed with chasing Pokemon, consequently, they are less careful and tend to be more negligent. Personal injury caused by negligence or irresponsibility of the other party can be compensated adequately only if the victim seeks professional legal assistance immediately. That is to say, in case you have been injured while someone was chasing Pokemon, then we recommend you to consult a personal injury lawyer so that to receive the compensation you deserve. Trespassing: As it has been explained, the goal of the game is to find and catch Pokemon in the real world. Consequently, players enter private properties, usually without any authorisation, to look for Pokemon and catch them. Therefore, trespass is another major legal implication that needs to be considered. Apart from entering private properties without any authorisation, in some cases, Pokemon GO players may cause damage while they are chasing Pokemon. Based on article 43 of the Civil Wrongs Law (Cap. 148), ‘’trespass to immovable property consists of unlawful entry upon, or any unlawful damage to, or interference with, any such property by any person"".  In other words, entering private property without permission and/or causing unlawful damage to any private property. As a result, Pokemon Go players abide by the Law since playing Pokemon Go does not include any right to access a private property without prior authorization."
5,Phosphate Mining In Central Florida Riparian Lands,news-society," Florida’s phosphate industry is known to own and strip mine lands in riparian areas of the state. Particularly in central Florida where the regions drinking water is degrading, caused by phosphate industry practices (1). The phosphate mining industry consists of some twenty seven sites in Florida as a whole, but most of the largest phosphate mines are located in central Florida south of interstate four (I-4). Riparian areas in central Florida, which include floodplain uplands as well as wetlands, are considered to be the most important buffer areas for protecting ""receiving water"" quality (incoming water to the system). The water quality and quantity rely on a particular set of variables. Each variable is responsible for a particular task in the natural production of clear clean drinking water. One pollutant in particular causes the most severe environmental impacts called phosphorus (2). High levels of phosphorus in an aquatic habitat causes sever outbreaks of algae which in turn lowers a critical variable called dissolved oxygen in water. This in turn causes the weaker flora to disappear taking with it the fauna that it fed. The cycle continues until all the flora and fauna disappear causing dead zones. Dead zones are sterile areas that can exist as long as the toxin creating the dead zone exists. In this case, phosphorus based nutrients (pollutants) from phosphate mining are causing dead zones in riparian lands and navigable waterways. Industry practices are the cause of many environmental issues including polluting public freshwater resources. After all the freshwater resources belong to the state and considered as public domain. Florida’s phosphate industry can consume only enough water as to not disrupt adjacent land owners and downstream users of the water body in question. Phosphate industry officials direct operations to strip mine this region of Florida possibly without legal authority based on the Public Trust Doctrine of Florida. Keep in mind, this region holds most of Florida’s watersheds north of the Everglades, so ecologically speaking, are without equal anywhere in the world. Unfortunately, the natural process creating such a landscape also produced one of the most sought after minerals for the production of fertilizer called phosphate and it intermingles with central Florida’s fresh drinking water resources sustaining numerous habitats including a 1.8 billion dollar sport fishing venue. Florida does not need phosphate mining as an economic pillar. In fact, over the last forty years, phosphate mining has cost local taxpayers billions of dollars in lost revenue due to industry accidents alone. Interestingly this same region holds central Florida’s freshwater resources intertwined with watersheds supporting lowlands and wetlands. One phosphate mine can cover as much as one hundred thousand acres which includes central Florida’s watersheds, wetlands and drinking water resources. The central region of Florida also contains navigable waterways and riparian lands being completely removed from the earth by the phosphate industry. Using Google© Earth, it is clear to see the severe environmental impacts in the region described above. Unfortunately, the Peace River basin lies in land owned by the phosphate industry and even though the industry has no legal right to mine the regions’ navigable waterways, they do anyway. Florida’s elected officials seem to be blind to the severe environmental impacts to Florida’s freshwater resources. However, water management officials continue to issue permits to strip mine very large tracts of land in Florida’s watersheds, knowing the irreparable damage being caused. The Peace River in central Florida is the 8th most endangered river in the United States while supporting the regions critical environmental connection including natural habitats for numerous species of flora and fauna. Not surprisingly, the head waters of the Peace River are polluted with high levels of algae do to phosphate based nutrients (pollutants). Curiously, the phosphate industry strip mines this region as well, creating phosphorus based pollutants. Industry officials claim they do not know how the high levels of phosphorus are entering the head waters of the Peace River. Industry officials say it is not their facilities causing the problem. Now the phosphorus concentration in central Florida water bodies is so great, the University of Miami researcher’s study suggest the high levels of phosphorus are also increasing outbreaks of red tide where the rivers and streams reach the Gulf of Mexico. The importance of the Peace River basin producing drinking water and essential habitats cannot be overstated. This region also holds floodwaters for recharging the aquifers, rivers, and lakes in the area. Central Florida’s wetlands provide habitats for priceless species of flora and fauna. All of which helps maintain production of clean fresh drinking water.

6,I Turned Down $1 Million,news-society," I refuse to take the bait. I’m talking about the challenge issued by the U.S.-based James Randi Educational Foundation – if anyone can prove they have any type of psychic abilities, JREF will give that person $1 million. While a million bucks would go a long way to paying off my mortgage and allowing me to take that Sedona dream vacation, I don’t need to prove the existence of spirit to anyone who obviously has no faith in spirit, humanity, their own spiritual potential, or God. Actually, I feel sorry for the JREF-ers, who use cold, hard-nosed rationality to blind themselves to miracles that occur daily in all of our lives. I’m not alone in passing on the challenge – reputable psychic mediums like James Van Praagh and Alison DuBois have ignored Randi’s tantalizing taunt. He was quoted in an article on sympatico.ca, saying, ""Hopefully, the JREF's Million Dollar Challenge makes people think twice when they hear psychics claiming they can predict the future or talk to the dead. If psychics can really do what they say they can, why hasn't anyone taken our million dollars?"" Further, he said the challenge was meant to target ""high-profile operators"" [like Van Praagh and DuBois] who ""are getting rich by preying on people's grief and guilt about loved ones who have died,"" calling their actions ""despicable."" While I must unfortunately admit that there are psychic scammers out there – charlatans who promise to remove curses for ridiculous sums of money – the majority of psychics and mediums I know are trustworthy individuals who truly want to serve humanity by bringing messages from spirit to their friends and loved ones still on the earth plane. From my own experience, many of my clients are happy and grateful when I provide for them verifiable evidence that I’ve connected with their loved ones in spirit. (Alas, I can’t claim 100 percent success, but no medium will make that claim.) When my husband read the sympatico.com article, he prodded me to put in my two cents toward claiming the $1 million prize. You’ve got to understand that Benjamin, besides having great faith in my skills, is a former advertising and marketing writer, and thinks the JREF test would be a great way to create publicity for me. (Another of his ideas: Serve coffee and pie with each reading. Nahhhh…) I won’t accept the Randi test for two reasons: First, if I were to agree to his challenge, I’d be doing it out of ego – to prove to myself and others that I was better than him. Because doing that, I’d no longer be working for spirit, I’d be working for myself. And I’m happy to be subservient to the needs of spirit, which needs to prove nothing. Secondly, and most importantly, it’s impossible to prove something to someone who’ll never accept the impossible. Science only goes so far in explaining how the world works – the rest is up to a person’s faith. I accept in faith that there is life after death, and I live that acceptance every time I provide evidence that a client’s mother, father, friend or pet comes through in a reading. I accept that there’s a divine intelligence in the universe that had a hand in our lives, if we allow the intelligence to work with us. And I have faith that one day, humans will transcend the petty bickering that goes on between groups and we’ll embrace each other in the spirit of tolerance and love. Why do I choose to have faith? That I can’t explain – I just believe. I accept the words of philosopher Khalil Gibran: ""Faith is a knowledge within the heart, beyond the reach of proof."" And I especially appreciate this thought from American humourist James Thurber: ""It is better to know some of the questions than all of the answers."" As a former magician, James Randi made a living creating false realities to fool people. Perhaps this is why he sees falseness everywhere, and needs to cling to science as a way to believe in the world of truth. To respond to that, may I add one more quote I’ve come to like? Henry David Thoreau said, ""Men are probably nearer the central truth in their superstitions than in their science."" Amen to that. If you have any questions or comments on this subject or on any other spiritual matter, feel free to write me at mail@carolynmolnar.com. And please visit me again!"
7,Brexit: Uk Citizens Of Cypriot Origin Can Obtain An Eu Passport,news-society," An EU passport includes the right to live and work in any EU member-state. Following, the result of the UK referendum, the UK citizens will not have that right anymore. However, after the Leave vote, some people have the false impression that they could renew their passport immediately and remain citizens of the EU for the next 10 years. This option will not work because once the UK leaves the EU, the UK citizens cease to be EU citizens. As a result, many people are seeking an alternative passport. Consequently, Cyprus passport can be one option as Cyprus is an EU member-state since 2004. Before presenting the necessary procedures that need to be followed in order to acquire a Cyprus passport, it should be clarified that the Republic of Cyprus allows its citizens to have a double citizenship. That is to say, British-born Cypriots may apply for a Cyprus citizenship and keep their UK citizenship as well. In the following paragraphs, we will explain: •	the acquisition of the Cypriot citizenship due to Cypriot origin; •	the acquisition of the Cypriot citizenship as a spouse of a Cypriot citizen; A.	Acquisition of the Cypriot citizenship due to Cypriot origin: Minors (under the age of 18)- Type M121 and Type M126: a)	Applications for registration of minors born abroad after the 16th of August 1960 whose father at the time of birth was a Cypriot citizen, and for minors born abroad after the 11th of June 1999 whose mother at the time of birth was a Cypriot citizen, are submitted on form M121. In this case, the necessary accompanying documents are: •	Applicant’s birth certificate; •	Marriage certificate of the applicant’s parents; •	Photocopy of the applicant’s and the applicant’s parents’ passports; •	Certificate of registration of the Cypriot parents (where applicable); b)	Minors born in Cyprus or abroad after the 16th of August 1960 whose father or mother acquired the Cypriot citizenship after the birth of the said minor, or who were born before the 11th of June 1999 to a Cypriot citizen, are also eligible to apply for Cypriot citizenship. The form M126 needs to be submitted by the parent who is a Cypriot citizen. In this case, the necessary accompanying documents are: •	Applicant’s birth certificate; •	Two photographs of the applicant (passport size); •	Marriage certificate of the applicant’s parents; •	Copy of the applicant’s and the applicant’s parents’ passports; •	Certificate of registration of the Cypriot parents (where applicable); •	The consent of the parent who is not a Cypriot citizen. However, it is not required if the Cypriot parent has obtained a court decision for exclusive parental care of the minor; Adults: a)	Adults born before the 16th August 1960- Type M70 or M71: Persons born before the 16th of August 1960, who are citizens of the UK and its former colonies originating from Cyprus, from the male side are eligible to apply for Cyprus citizenship by submitting an application on form M70 or M71. In this case, the necessary accompanying documents are: •	Applicant’s birth certificate; •	Birth certificate of applicant’s father; •	Photocopy of applicant’s passport; b)	Adults born after the 16th of August 1960 and adults born in Cyprus between 5th of November and 16th of August - Type M123: Persons of Cypriot origin who were born after the 16th of August 1960, whose mother is a Cypriot citizen and father a foreigner are eligible to apply for Cyprus citizenship by submitting an application on form M123. In addition, under the provisions of section 109 of Law 141 (I)/2002, are eligible to apply for Cyprus citizenship : •	Adults born after the 16th of August 1960 and originate from a person who became a British citizen based on the Annexation of Cyprus Orders in Council of 1914 until 1943; •	Adults born in Cyprus after the 5th of November 1914 and before the 16th of August 1960, during which time their parents were residing in Cyprus; In this case, the necessary accompanying documents are: •	Applicant’s birth certificate; •	Marriage certificate of applicant’s parents; •	Copy of the applicant’s and the applicant’s parents’ passports; •	Certificate of registration of the Cypriot parent (where applicable); c)	Adults born after the 16th August 1960- Type M124: Persons of Cypriot origin born before or after the 16th August 1960 and are British citizens or citizens of any Commonwealth state and have completed one year of legal residence in the Republic of Cyprus are eligible to apply for Cypriot citizenship by submitting the application form M124. In this case, the necessary accompanying documents are: •	Applicant’s birth certificate; •	Certificate of clean criminal record issued by the police; •	Copy of applicant’s passport; B.	Acquisition of the Cypriot citizenship as a spouse of a Cypriot citizen- Type M125: An individual who is married to a Cypriot citizen is eligible to apply for a Cyprus citizenship by submitting the form M125 after completing three years of marriage and two years of residency in the Republic of Cyprus before the date of application. Note that spouses of overseas Cypriots are also eligible to apply for Cypriot citizenship provided that they have completed at least three years of marriage. Additionally, a letter from the couple explaining the reasons for requesting the grant of the Cypriot citizenship to the foreign spouse needs to be submitted. However, in case the couple has completed at least five years of marriage and has at least one child, then it is not necessary to submit the aforementioned letter. In this case, the necessary accompanying documents are: •	Applicant’s birth certificate; •	Certificate of clean criminal record; •	Marriage certificate; •	Birth certificate of the couple’s children (where applicable); •	Copy of the applicant’s passport; •	Copy of the Cypriot spouse’s passport; •	Certificate of acquisition of the Cypriot citizenship of the Cypriot spouse (where applicable); •	Statement of harmonious cohabitation signed before an Officer of the District Administration Office or the diplomatic authority; •	Statement of cohabitation from the local authority;"
8,Florida Phosphate Mining Buffer Zones,news-society," Phosphate strip mining is known to cause severe landscape disruptions. Mitigation and final land reclamations plans are a must to be ""permitted"" to strip the central Florida earth for phosphate ore.  Strip mining is considered to create the most severe man-made land disturbance known said the Department of Environmental Protection. Phosphate, strip mining in general, creates severe environmental impacts to Central Florida watersheds including the Manatee River, Myakka River and Peace River to name a few. Central Florida’s watersheds produce enough drinking water yearly to support almost 6 million people and still growing. One can imagine how important central Florida’s watersheds are producing public drinking water quality and quantity. In other words, water is absorbed and contained by the landscape. Water is held in the ground sometimes for years before coming back to the surface, all the while moving through the sub-surface ""percolating"" (cleaning) the water for all to enjoy. All the above mentioned naturally contained fresh water resources are considered a treasured natural resource by all in central Florida. Most of Florida’s freshwater resources are consumed for drinking, cattle, irrigation, and other public uses. The water consumed is typically recycled by natural processes such as evaporation and rain water. However, Florida’s phosphate industry located in west central Florida over consumes water that cannot be released back to the environment because the water is extremely toxic. During consumption by the phosphate industry, the water is mixed with toxic pooling liquid acids containing radioactive materials and other toxic phosphatic waste by-products from the production of fertilizer.  Once the water is consumed by the phosphate industry, it cannot be released back into the environment but seems to find a way. One can see some advantages of building ""buffer"" zones to mitigate the toxic environmental impacts caused by producing phosphate based fertilizers. Buffer zones surrounding phosphate mining operations seems to offer empirical evidence in the reduction of phosphorus from clay settling areas (CSA) of highly compacted soils. The compacted phosphatic soils are poor water conduits for surface absorption making buffer zones ecologically important to millions of acres of land holding watersheds and phosphate facilities together in central Florida. ""In finding economic solutions to environmental problems, we are discovering ways in which the goal of regulation, rather than the process, is paramount."" Schlesinger Dean, Nicholas School of Environment and Earth Sciences Duke University.  Buffer zones are paramount, if not required, which surround phosphate facilities for the purpose of reducing severe environmental damage caused by phosphate strip mining in general. Buffer zones (1) offer a way for toxins to be absorbed (uptake) by the landscape when planting particular flora which is based on the type of toxins to mitigate. Buffer zones are an environmental advantage because they create barriers between toxic and non-toxic tracts of land. Buffer zones are set up by planting particular grasses, underbrush, and trees which uptake (absorb) specific toxins. An example is planting a three ring buffer zone. The outside ring of the buffer zone (furthest from the toxic source) is planted with particular grasses known to uptake specific toxins. Then specific underbrush (middle ring) is planted inside the grassy ring which surrounds the ring closest to the toxic source where trees are planted for maximum uptake of toxins. The tree ring or inside the ring, of the buffer zone could be planted with eucalyptus trees because this type of tree is known to absorb phosphorus (1). Phosphate facilities can mitigate much environmental destruction based on sound engineering practices, such as constructing engineered buffer zones. Engineered buffer zones are needed by the phosphate industry to mitigate damage to severely disturbed landscapes. CSA’s are a perfect example where buffer zones would reduce severely disturbed landscapes for phosphorus uptake. Eucalyptus trees apparently thrive on phosphorus uptake creating larger yields for raw wood to use for construction and other purposes. Interestingly, all of the technologies mentioned above are known to produce positive results, but Florida’s phosphate industry may not want profits to suffer at the cost of building engineered buffer zones surrounding phosphate facilities. Phosphorus uptake by eucalyptus trees around phosphate facilities using engineered buffer zones is known to decrease phosphorus nutrients (pollutants) being transmitted through to the soil outside the buffer zone including aquatic(2) areas as well. Techniques such as buffer zones are real world successful applications of engineered soils, grasses, and trees for maximum toxic soil uptake.

This words of Pope Francis are such an inspiration for everyone who wants to fit in this messy world where humans are seen as a social surplus, unable to challenge the others for finding his own truth and what’s worse is that the new generation is treated in an indifferent way, just to inherit surnames, just a part that vegetates on their responsibilities, yet the light source is an ending to hope, on the other hand there are the other ones, mindful that think that fate will bring them into the traps of those who are unable but still in the end the ideals will win upon everything because they will be those ones that they want to be, by finding the right way inside them and they are always conscious that their strength is not the strong one’s strength, but it’s the power and strength of their mind and lore and experience on their shoulder, that grew on dignity not on licking and dragging around! So, what’s Achilles’ heel for teens, the pit stop that everyone should have on their consciousness, so the refection in the future shall not be that ugly, everyone better see this refection of themselves in the hands of time, so they can know what they want, before they get lost in everyday sludge, routine, there where the best way to live to sell morals, to sell your character and soul so you can earn something material. ""There are too things that scare me, says Immanuel Kant, the starry sky above me and moral law within me"". We are used that everything that’s upon us we should carry it on our back with servility, them talk behind backs with rage of a human who searches for greater things not on his own ambition but on this system that he mocks behind the back, but encourages it as often as he can’t pass these life blockades, where greed often takes him near and far to the sins so he can be an irresponsible thoughts mask, said as a reward, always inside the interests terms sold as ‘ intellectual thoughts’ most of the time, but there are just words said by people who are bought and sold easily But, is more important what you look like than what you really are, behind the look you can see this huge waves that afflict the soul. Better shutting the mouth when is needed, but how can you hide yourself to the soul? How can your mind improve, without soul desecration? Oh, only if you use the sense of forgetfulness and the virtue of not caring at times. Or searching light within yourself so you can gain the weight of the name you deserve, to live and breathe on this pure thought that you can be hope that the future begins when you start to be the perfection you search on others.

10,Phosphate Industry Strip Mining Central Florida Watersheds,news-society," The state of Florida owns all riparian lands and navigable waterways held in ""trust"" for the public at large by the sovereignty granted to Florida at statehood in 1845 by the United States of America. The lands under ""public"" navigable waterways are defined as riparian in nature and not to be altered in any way without state consent. Additionally, anyone purchasing land holding such natural waterways must use the land so as ""not to interfere with the public’s right to use the waterway over the land"" (i.e., river bottom) in question and must recognize common law riparian rights when ones actions affect the land. An example of altering the bottom of a waterway may be strip mining, dredging, building a pier, or boat dock. What are riparian land rights you may ask? Riparian rights are those given to lands incident to navigable waterways (3). For example, the land tracts owned by the phosphate industry adjacent to or containing waterway holding riparian ""public"" lands from the low water mark to the high water mark in the waterway and cannot be privately owned, blocked, or altered. These lands are held in trust by the state of Florida for its citizen’s use since 1845. However, phosphate industry officials direct operations to strip mine large tracts of land including riparian lands and navigable waterways for the phosphate 30 to 50 feet beneath the landscape. Some of the lands being strip mined by Florida’s phosphate industry are riparian lands. Some of the waterways the phosphate industry alters are navigable waterways. Both instances (2) are highly controversial and may be illegal in some circumstances based on the U.S. Constitution and Florida laws as well. However, changing riparian lands or navigable waterways to better ""public uses"" may be allowed and is encouraged by the state. In another example, a large tract of land called the Altman Tract is owned by the phosphate industry and contains navigable waterways with riparian lands. The phosphate industry cannot alter the waterway or the land under the waterway in a way that interferes with downstream riparian lands rights and downstream waterway users. However, the phosphate industry is entirely removing waterways from the surface of the earth while stripping riparian lands as well. Why are Florida’s elected officials and public media silent concerning the above industry practices? Producing ""public awareness"" on this topic is almost unheard by most of Florida’s taxpayers, says the Florida Institute for Phosphate Research, FIPR. Are we to believe that is coincidental? In the last example, upstream waterway users cannot interfere with the natural characteristics of the navigable waterway that adversely affects downstream users. Riparian lands and navigable waterways are granted to the public by the state of Florida as public domain and may be used by anyone for travel, commerce, leisure, and the like. However, when state politics are used to rewrite history related to Florida’s lands being ""public domain"" or sovereign based on statehood, then all state laws may be subjugate and seemingly encouraged by Florida’s elected officials. Unfortunately, Florida’s phosphate industry purchases large tracts of land holding ""public"" navigable waterways and riparian lands to strip mine for phosphate. These large tracts of land are located in west central Florida, home to many environmentally challenged critical riparian lands and public waterways providing safe drinking water to millions of people year after year. Most of central Florida’s drinking water is produced by regional watersheds. What are navigable waterways you may ask? Navigable waterways are defined as water bodies offering possible benefits for ""public uses"" (2). Navigable waterways are not limited by the ability to navigate a vessel on the waterway. Public uses cover a broad range of possibilities, including drinking water, leisure, commerce, travel, and the like. Large land tracts which contain riparian land and navigable waterways in the central Florida watersheds are owned by the state since the time of statehood in 1845. The problem occurs when the state’s elected officials ""permit"" (1) mining in large tracts of land in central Florida’s watersheds to the phosphate industry knowing the industry draglines will strip everything including ""public rights"" from the earth’s surface until it finds phosphate. State officials also know that strip mining in the regional watersheds historically degrades drinking water quality and quantity and will from now on, says the Department of Environmental Protection. State officials know the severe environmental impacts caused by the phosphate industry but continue to ""permit"" strip mining in state riparian lands and navigable waterways critical for millions of Florida taxpayer’s safe public drinking water resources. Let your elected officials know how you feel on the subject of phosphate strip mining degrading Florida’s drinking water.

11,Florida Phosphate Industry Practices Severely Disturb Navigable Waterways?,news-society," Florida is known as the ""Sunshine State"", but interestingly receives more rainfall than most states in the Union. Florida receives enormous amounts of yearly rainfall from north to south every year. About fifty percent of the annual rainfall is absorbed into the ground and ""contained"" in watersheds. Central Florida’s watersheds as a whole cover an area the size of the great state of Rhode Island. The Florida landscape certainly contains or ""holds"" enough rainwater on a yearly average to naturally recharge local freshwater aquifers, rivers, streams, springs, lakes, watersheds, and lowlands. The central peninsular region of Florida ""contains"" about fifty percent of yearly rainwater for west central Florida’s, including the Tampa Bay area, drinking water. Curiously, enough rain falls in Florida annually to cover the entire state in five and a half feet of rainwater. The volume of rain described above continues naturally year after year. However, central Florida is not known for flooding by summer’s usual daily tropical downpours, or when tropical storms drop heavy rain, the water just seems to disappear right before your eyes. How and where is all that water contained you may ask? The Florida landscape and sub-surface is made up of a particular hydrogeological material called karst rock (limestone based), along with other types of porous sands and clays. These materials are naturally porous so gravity can move ground water as though the water is being mechanically pumped through the ground’s sub-surface. Without this type of landscape, Florida’s citizens would not have enough natural drinking water resources. Floridan Aquifer Floats On Saltwater Base Florida land floats on a bubble of freshwater called the Floridan aquifer which in turn supports multiple levels of smaller aquifers one upon another in the central Florida earth’s sub-surface. All of which are fed with rainwater by gravity through the many conduits of earthen materials into the Florida landscape refilled by yearly average rainfall amounts. The Floridan (1) aquifer precariously floats on a saltwater base hydraulically held in place by the Gulf of Mexico on the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the east. Saltwater infiltrates the limestone base of Florida’s sub-surface where the Floridan aquifer bubble is resting or ""floating"" on a saltwater base. The mass of the freshwater contained in the earth’s sub-surface compresses the saltwater base. When the weight of the freshwater bubble contained in the sub-surface falls below a particular level, saltwater intrusion makes up the differences in contained water pressure. Lower freshwater mass causes saltwater to infiltrate Florida’s freshwater resources causing degraded fresh drinking water quality and quantity. These symptoms are affecting drinking water for millions of Florida taxpayers daily. The explanation above on how ground water moves through the Florida earth is given to help the reader understand why phosphate strip mining is detrimental to safe drinking water statewide. Knowing how the ground beneath one’s feet holds and moves fresh water is paramount to understanding why phosphate strip mining is so invasive that it threatens an entire region of Florida’s drinking water quantity and quality. Phosphate mining removes the earth’s surface fabric including natural tributaries, streams, springs, aquifers, and the like which naturally holds central Florida’s drinking water. Phosphate industry practices create these severe environmental impacts that cannot be reversed because the technology to do so does not exist. Once the mighty dragline strips the karst rock formations from the earth surface, all the once ""contained water"" now inundates the local area flooding the mined spoil piles and pits with unmeasured wasted amounts of Florida’s public aquifer water drinking resources. Some of these pits are a square mile in surface area and can be two-hundred feet in height. That is equivalent to a twenty story building spanning one square mile. Aquifer Water Wasted Daily Daily, billions of gallons of fresh drinking water from local aquifers is completely wasted in the mined pits for an indefinite amount of time or until the water evaporates. Either way, unmetered aquifer water is being wasted daily by Florida’s phosphate industry and paid for by Florida’s taxpayers. This is shown by Google© Maps looking at the central Florida landscape around Fort Meade and Polk County. All the severe environmental impacts can be seen by all who seek. Central Florida watersheds supply over six million people with safe drinking water. Almost five million of those people live near the greater Tampa Bay area, which is the largest estuary in the state. More freshwater resources flow from area watersheds into Tampa Bay than anywhere else in central Florida. The Tampa Bay Estuary contains over 200 species of fish, including big game fish such as tarpon, snook, redfish, and sea bass or grouper. Numerous mangrove islands support a diverse set of waterfowl nesting areas. Charlotte Harbor is just eighty miles south and is the second largest estuary in the state with as many freshwater resources in danger from the phosphate industry as well. Unfortunately, Central Florida is where phosphate mega-mining occurs daily. Phosphate industry officials want phosphate ore (2) that sits beneath the richest environmentally challenged hydrological freshwater producing, earthen framework on the face of the earth. Central Florida contains the lion’s share of the 27 phosphate mines located in Florida as a whole. Over a half million acres of isolated riparian wetlands and riparian wetlands linked to state (public) navigable waters are at the mercy of Florida’s phosphate officials. Curiously, state (public) navigable waterways seem to be severely disturbed by strip mining the central Florida landscape. Historically, phosphate officials appear to refuse to be good environmental stewards and are intent on removing anything or anyone in their quest for phosphate, including Central Florida’s (public) navigable waterways and drinking water resources. The central Florida areas mentioned above being strip mined are riparian in nature and contain navigable waterways as well. If so, then state officials may step in and curtail any illegal practices and secure funds from phosphate officials to repair severely damaged landscapes caused by phosphate industry practices. However, there are no publically mentioned plans to do so.

12,Phosphate Industry Siege On Alafia River And Watersheds,news-society," The Alafia River watersheds and smaller tributaries in the area are known to be used as ""navigable waterways"" by the state of Florida during the early-19th century by European (1) settlers. During the early-19th century before and during the time of Florida’s statehood, the Alafia River was traveled by early Americans on a daily basis. The fact mentioned previously settles any doubts this river and its watersheds are defined as a navigable waterway and is considered public domain for travel, leisure, and commerce. A settlement called Riverview took root near the mouth of the Alafia River in west central Florida. Riverview is the first recorded settlement in Florida on the Alafia River in (1) 1835. The first area settled by pioneers from the 19th century is near the present day Bell Shoals Bridge just outside of Brandon, Florida. This area of the Alafia River watershed is one of the most scenic areas on the river. The river takes two dramatic bends while flowing under the Bell Shoals Bridge causing the river banks to erode into thirty foot bluffs on both sides of the river. Bell Shoals Bridge was one of the great spots for fun on the river during the summer months. (2) The bridge is about twenty feet above the average water level at this particular bend in the river. The depth of the river at the bridge was usually around twelve feet deep. The river water clarity was generally about eight to ten feet of visibility, so most of the river bottom was not easy to see. My friends and I spent many a day swimming in the river and jumping off the bridge into the river; it was great clean fun. Lithia Springs was a great fun spot feeding millions of gallons of aquifer water to the river, daily. In the early to middle 70’s the springs fed millions of gallons of cool crystal clear aquifer water into the Alafia River all day every day. Unfortunately, the phosphate industry demands so much water from the local aquifers that the main spring at Lithia dropped over ten feet, and the small spring no longer exists, but the rocks where the little spring did exist are still visible. Tubing down the river from Lithia Springs was awesome. The spring was a great place to start the tubing trip because just about a half mile down river was a small set of rapids that dumped into a vast underground cavern. We used to start tubing at Lithia Springs and tube down the river about three hours and end up at Bell Shoals Bridge. Once one passes Bell Shoals Bridge, the river gets fairly deep and slows to a crawl. The area is perfect for slowly drifting in the cool, shaded river, relaxing and catching some rays. Tubing from Bell Shoals Bridge to Riverview takes about three hours, but the trip was well worth it. During the voyage, it was not uncommon to see a family of the manatee, alligators, various water snakes, and other fellow tubers. The river empties its contents into the Tampa Bay estuary in west central Florida among the mangrove islands, sandbars, and oyster beds just west of Riverview.  This area holds one of the most critical environmentally challenged waters and ecosystems in Florida. The region contains significant environmental treasures such as breeding grounds for many species of fish, mollusks, shrimp, oysters, clams, manatee, and the like. Historically, the Riverview phosphate plant causes toxic waste releases creating miles of dead zones in the Alafia River and Tampa Bay estuary. Phosphate industry officials call these massive kills and dead zones just a ""mishap."" The ""dead zones"" may last years depending on the volume of poisons released into the environment from the phosphate facilities. However, the phosphate industry wanted a phosphate plant built at the mouth of the Alafia River on the back of the Tampa Bay estuary. Interestingly, Tampa Bay is the largest estuary and is environmentally critical to commerce on the west coast of Florida. The Tampa Bay estuary is a navigable waterway by definition, but Florida’s elected officials ""decided to permit"" the phosphate industry officials to alter navigable waterways to build a phosphate plant. Historically, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA says, ""the Florida phosphate industry is the worst environmental hazard in the state."" Why did Florida elected officials ""permit"" phosphate industry officials to construct a phosphate plant in the best environmentally critical ecosystems on the west coast of Florida? This area brings in billions of dollars yearly from tourism alone. Unfortunately, phosphate industry officials are not environmentally savvy and continue to pollute the Riverview area along with Tampa Bay and the Alafia River watershed. Historically, the Riverview phosphate plant is a site where many of the industries worst environmental catastrophes occurred. Unfortunately, the Riverview phosphate plant is one of the largest in Florida with a phosphogypsum stack over two hundred feet in height and covers about one square mile. This ""stack"" is a radioactive phosphogypsum pit full of toxic acidic sludge. Billions of gallons of lethal sludge fill the stack where sulfuric acid and other deadly liquids pool. The large pit surface produces a poisonous sulfuric acidic aerosol, polluting the air in and around the plant all the time, ""day in and day out"". The poisons are carried as far as the wind permits, sometimes for miles. Why would Florida’s elected officials allow this type of industrial environmental harm to continue to occur in such a critical environmentally challenged ecosystem? For the record, phosphate industry officials donate millions of dollars annually for ""access"" to both political parties in Florida, this is no secret.

14,Phosphate Mining The Peace River Watershed Basin,news-society," The Peace River watershed lies in west central Florida about forty miles east of the Tampa Bay area. Florida’s Peace River was declared an ""endangered river"" by ""American Rivers.org,"" a non-profit organization committed to protecting and restoring North American rivers. The central Florida region holds unique pristine watersheds, marshlands, bogs, and other freshwater naturally occurring filtering systems. Watersheds are areas of land with waterways that flow to a common destination. Most of the region's drinking water is pumped from aquifers that are ""recharged"" from the watersheds described above. Water seeping or percolating down through Florida’s landscape is naturally filtered by biological and physical reactions on the groundwater. Florida’s residents depend on this process for safe drinking water pumped from the public aquifers below (3). Strip mining these valuable resources show adverse effects on drinking water including quality and quantity. American Rivers.org lists the Peace River as the ""8th"" most endangered river in the U.S. as a combined result of phosphate mining, urban sprawl, and agriculture (2). However, typical household and agriculture water consumed is either returned to the aquifers by ""percolation"", run-off for rivers or evaporates and returns to earth as rain and so on. Freshwater consumed by the phosphate industry cannot be returned to the public domain because the water is toxic to all life forms and must be stored indefinitely in huge holding ponds of toxic waste by-products from the production of fertilizers. The waste by-product holding ponds can be a square mile in area and over one hundred feet deep. Unfortunately, over 320,000 acres of watersheds have been strip-mined for phosphate in the Peace River, its tributaries, watersheds, and basins along with crystal clear natural freshwater springs and aquifers. These once pristine unique ecologically rich areas are now no more than a toxic wasteland. There are no more flora and fauna in these largely abandoned tracts of land because the mighty dragline has stripped everything in its path, including navigable waterways and riparian rights causing disastrous severe permanent hydrological landscape changes. Suppling freshwater to over five hundred thousand residents, one can see how critical the Peace River, its tributaries, and watersheds are to the citizens living in this region of Florida. Natural wetlands provide a vital function and severe land disturbances such as phosphate strip-mining display stark negative impacts to the landscape as a whole and create adverse effects on central Florida’s drinking water. Florida’s phosphate industry officials insist that operations literally ""strip"" the fabric of the landscape by completely removing the wetlands, creating ""wastelands"" while decreasing public water quality and quantity. Over six million people in this region depend on the Peace River basin and watersheds for their drinking water. One must remember the phosphate industry has legal control for ""reasonable use"" of Florida’s freshwater reserves under phosphate industry property. However, phosphate industry officials waste more freshwater reserves in the state of Florida than any other industry consumes. This region also boasts some of the best fishing, boating, and eco-tourism in the world, which are vital industries in the area, each bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars annually by visitors from all around the world. Unfortunately, the Southwest Florida Water Management District, (SFWMD) states the Peace River is in danger of ""significant harm"" because of reduced water flow resulting from Florida phosphate industry’s over-consumption of freshwater reserves; destruction of navigable waterways, while leaving the environmental damage for Florida taxpayers to resolve. Researchers from the University of Miami previously completed studies using a mathematically based model solution to calculate associations of mining with streamflow (1). The model includes parameters derived from empirical data taken in this case, from the upper reaches of the Peace River basin at that time. The study produced an answer that pleased no one, finding that phosphate mining does have an effect on streamflow. Over time, the model has proved empirically to be correct about lower stream flows in the Peace River basin and all that it encompasses.  Interestingly, the results also show regional planning is ""urgently"" needed for reclamation designs containing and enhancing hydrological cycles in the areas of severely disturbed landscapes as an objective.  Little if any progress was made toward new reclamation plans based on predispositions concerning more industry funding required for real world reclamation applications. The Department of the Interior U.S. Geological Survey states environmental stresses to the Charlotte Harbor estuaries is adversely affected by lower stream flows from the Peace River basin. The likely cause was determined to be phosphate industry related from over consumption of freshwater from Florida’s freshwater resources.

15,Florida’s Phosphate Industry Officials Display Little Concern For Florida Riparian Waterways,news-society," The state of Florida supports riparian waterways as public domain by law. Riparian waterways are defined as rivers, stream, lakes, marshes, bogs, aquifers, springs, or any navigable waterway above or below ground, including freshwater and saltwater. For instance, one navigates a canoe from a riparian (public) river into a small spring that is surrounded by multiple landowners encompassing the land around the spring. Riparian water rights grant anyone the right to canoe, swim, boat, or just spend leisure time anchored just off the shoreline of the spring. Following the example above, imagine one scuba diving into the aquifer feeding the spring through an opening between the rocks in an underground (riparian) cavern filled with crystal clear water that also traverses property bounds above. Once in the cavern, one can cross property bounds with riparian (public) waterway rights (2). The examples of riparian waterways described above do exist all over central Florida. Florida’s phosphate industry officials know this as well. Phosphate industry officials know the irreparable environmental damage caused by strip mining riparian waterways. Florida’s phosphate industry officials buy television commercials showing wholesome industry practices that create local jobs to feed people worldwide. This is a ""smoke and mirrors"" tactic that Florida citizens as a whole do believe, based on Florida Institute for Phosphate Research, (FIPR) studies. However, industry practices have little if any relationship to the TV ads portrayed by phosphate officials as described above. The TV ads do not mention the last seventy years of destruction to Florida’s unique hydrological landscape and riparian waterways. The ads are not true based on empirical daily industry practices by phosphate industry officials. Statistically speaking, historically, phosphate industry officials reclaim abandoned mines in a 1 to 5 ratio. Meaning, reclamation of abandoned mines occurs to one out of five abandoned mines. The rest of the environmental damage is hidden from public view by building thousands of acres of massive earthen berms to surround the abandoned highly toxic leftovers (1) When industry ""mishaps"" occurs in ""abandoned phosphate mined lands"", historically, Florida’s taxpayers cover the cost to neutralize the severe environmental damage, not the phosphate industry. Mishaps occur regularly at all Florida phosphate plants causing severe environmental impacts, being hidden from the public, only to be discovered later by state environmental officials. However, many ""accidents"" occur in public view such as when a phosphogypsum stack failed and billions of gallons of toxic radioactive wastewater and by-products inundate the surrounding areas with a radius measured in kilometers. Riparian (public) waterways also become polluted, disrupted, or entirely stopped from flowing by phosphate industry mishaps. Natural water flow volumes in the major riparian waterways near phosphate industry operations decline steadily year after year without much ado from Tallahassee, (capital) or local authorities. Maybe the millions of dollars donated to both political parties in the state stop the legal process and oversight to remedy Florida phosphate industry accidents?

16,My Thoughts On Why Donald Trump Is Doing As Good As He Is,news-society," Even though I think most of us are tired of being sold, hoodwinked,or basically lied to just to get our votes, we’re pretty much fed up with the normal politician, no matter who they are. But, there are some Americans that still believe some of them are really honest and care…….I’m not sure I know what to say to you guys there, but, how has that been working out for this country? OK, never mind. Anyway, here are some points that may spin a light on why people in the thousands are hopping on the Trump Express: –   Intense verbal attacks on police officers labeling them as racists who hunt down young black men. –   A porous southern border where narcotics and human smuggling continue unabated. –   A stagnant economy where workers have little bargaining power any more. –   A growing jihadist terror threat that the Democratic party refuses to define. …… (Islamic Terrorism) –   A Democratic President who, after he announces the beheading of an American citizen by ISIS, plays golf. –   A culture that now demands political correctness even if it goes against sincerely held religious beliefs. –  A legal system that may harm a business owner if he or she refuses to participate in a gay marriage or nuns against birth control. It is our ""right"" to do so. –  A press corps that generally embraces liberalism, using its constitutional privilege to diminish non-liberals who speak out. –  An education system dominated by leftist teachers and administrators who often impose their views on defenseless children. That’s right. When was the last time you spoke with a High School or College student who described this exactly? –  A grievance industry that is often promoted by the media. Thus, anti-American zealites call this country evil and oppressive. And my last word on Trump, is very bad people are trying to disrupt and exploit his campaign to disguise racial and social hatred…….BUT, make no mistake about it. We are seeing the backbone of this country, and they are standing up by the thousands and giving him their votes…….It’s unprecedented the bashing he is taking, and the will of most Americans will not be broken by the very establishment that they know could care less about the everyday man and women of this country…….It is clear and also amazing to witness…… And I’ll finish with just one bit of proof of what I’m saying here…… These ""rally busters"" are using their 2nd amendment rights to speak out any way they feel they need to…..But, in a Fascist way, to stifle the oppressors, they want to STOP someone they don’t care for from THEIR 2nd amendment rights to speak and say what they want. As this progressed, Clinton, Sanders, Cruz, Rubio, Kasich, and Obama himself (yes the grand poo-bah), came out to put Trump down, and say these fascist, lead by the money of Soros to disrupt, and possibly cause harm CHILDREN, are at no fault for speaking their minds……….I just want to say, as soon as Cruz did that, his followers on Twitter dropped by 300,000…….That’s right, American citizens understanding BS when they clearly see it…… OK…..I’m done ranting…..You make up your own mind…And I also could go on here for about a day or two, but I’ll spare you. You may already know the things I would talk about too. Thanks for reading, and I hope you don’t think I’m wrong….."
17,"Phosphate Permits, Altman Tract, Manatee County Florida",news-society," West Central Florida is home to the mega-mining phosphate industry. This area is also rich with the only ecosystem of its kind worldwide. This unique ecosystem is one reason Florida has so many visitors yearly. Billions of dollars are brought into the state through tourism because Florida is the only state with a tropical climate other than Hawaii (3). However, phosphate industry officials are intent on completely eradicating west central Florida’s unique ecosystems for the phosphate ore just beneath the surface. In the recent past, news about the environmental devastation being caused by Florida’s phosphate industry is spreading to communities all around central Florida. The news is on a local level but does not seem to find national coverage. Interestingly, when (culpable) lawsuits are brought against the strip mining juggernaut, strong arm tactics are displayed by industry officials. Manatee County, Florida is facing phosphate industry financial strong arm tactics and various other political strategies which are very effective deterrents and can be observed every day by all who seek. Manatee County Commissioners now know the (financial) pressure that phosphate industry officials can apply by threats of lawsuits totaling over 600 million dollars (2). The industry is taking Manatee County to court for denying badly needed permits because Florida Department of Environmental Protection stated that industry planning reports failed to provide accurate information, a clear reclamation plan, and necessary financial assurance that the site would be properly reclaimed after mining. Phosphate industry officials are used to getting their way even when it is environmentally unsound to do so for Florida’s citizens as a whole. Meaning industry uses its financial muscle to destroy as they please, where anyone else would be denied permits. Historically, phosphate industry officials may financially bully anyone opposing their point of view on the ""status-quo"". Phosphate industry officials insist on strip mining another 2048 acre tract in Manatee County called the Altman Tract (1). This tract is adjacent to recently strip-mined landscape located near the unspoiled headwaters of Horse Creek, in the Peace River basin, which delivers around fifteen percent of normal flow into the lower Peace River. All of which threaten Charlotte Harbor, Florida, risking local venues bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars yearly. Simultaneously, Charlotte County officials are negotiating with the phosphate industry. This is significant because Hardee County is adjacent to Manatee County in Florida. Unfortunately, Charlotte officials submitted to the phosphate juggernaut and are now on board with industry officials and will reluctantly issue permits to strip mine the areas adjacent to previously enormous stripped tracts. The agreement called for changes requested to provide stronger restrictions in the area mentioned above by Charlotte County officials. The changes required by Charlotte County does not follow the phosphate industry ""status-quo""; so one will see if Mosaic Co. officials will entertain the requests. Historically, Florida’s phosphate industry officials do not like changing the status-quo, presently it is in the industries favor. However, litigation is significantly increasing over phosphate strip mining in central Florida. Mosaic Company is the defendant, in this case, simultaneously fighting multiple legal battles in four central Florida counties, hiring three different law firms, based in Tampa, Orlando, and, of course, Tallahassee (capital). Phosphate mining giant Mosaic Company is contesting Manatee County for 617 million dollars just two weeks after Mosaic was denied permits to strip mine the environmentally protected Altman tract (over 2000 acres). Manatee County cannot compete financially with Florida’s phosphate industry officials. County officials also submit to financial pressure by the threat of legal battles and will ""permit"" Mosaic Co. in this case, to strip mine over 2000 acres of pristine environmentally challenged wetlands, springs, rivers, aquifers, marine life, and habitats for thousands of species of life including both floras and fauna.

18,Is The Second Amendment Outdated?,news-society," The second amendment to the constitution gives United State citizens the right to own and carry a firearm anywhere in this country. Why would the people founding and declaring a new country called the United States of America want all citizens to own a firearm? The answer remains the same, food and protection. Remember, rights are not the same as privileges, where driving is a privilege, but voting is a right. In retrospect, owning a firearm is your right, not a privilege. It seems the people founding this country expected everyone to own and use a firearm. Training to use one’s firearm came naturally by practice shooting for food or protection. However, sanctioned weapons training were not required because most families used a gun on a daily basis. Historically, understanding how, why, and when to use a gun was necessary in family life. Interestingly, the United States Supreme Court decided one more time in 2010; the second amendment gives all U.S. citizens the right to keep and bear arms. The Court ruled in 2010 the right to carry without infringement, trumping state law. The Court’s decision is directly related to the right to protect one’s life from evil doers. Some people say they have no weapon nor do they want to have a firearm. They do not carry or own a weapon based on the premise one will never be required. This premise seems based on feeling relatively secure in yourself even understanding or, at least, considering people around you are carrying a gun. In many cases, this scenario plays out daily all around us. Why would one feel secure while believing people around them are carrying firearms? Maybe it’s because the unarmed citizen holds all people including the armed citizen, be and act fully accountable for keeping true to the highest sanctity for human life. This makes sense because the example mentioned above plays out daily all over the world, not just the United States. The same scenario plays out daily because the vast majority of people owning firearms feel the same unequaled sanctity for life as most humans feel. If the example here is given credence, then the evidence speaks for itself. Historically, civilizations do not condone chaos because humans have always felt compelled to protect the innocent even over fear of the attacker. Today is no different; most people understand the sanctity of life and respect one another enough not to use violence to solve a disagreement, especially when the stakes are life itself. So it is for most people owning and carrying a weapon. Personally, I hold the belief that such an event will not occur in my life causing me to use deadly force. After all, it may be my death. However, I believe I may be involved in a car accident, even though people driving understand the consequences of being involved in an accident. Meaning, drivers are aware of their vehicular responsibilities and the consequences of their actions. In the same way, most people carrying a weapon share the same awareness and do not walk or drive around expecting to be involved in a gun fight, based on the consequences of being shot. In retrospect, most evil doers also know people are unsuspecting and attack their victim’s at the most opportune time. Unfortunately, evil doers will take advantage of the innocent and use fear to intimidate their victims. This fact cannot be denied. These demented cowards use many types of weapons to intimidate their victims, causing fear and confusion to assist in accosting their victim. The experts say having a gun could cause one to be killed in an altercation because citizens carrying firearms are not trained well enough to thwart off attackers. (1) Experts in law enforcement say citizens carrying guns may be more likely to be shot with their gun during an attack because the attackers are assumed to be better trained or have the advantage of surprise. However, law enforcement does not display statistics for proof of their statements. The people writing and creating the second amendment had no second thoughts about the importance of a firearm. These early Americans knew they needed protection from all wanting to do harm, even the most powerful nation on earth at the time, Great Britain. It is no surprise these brave souls risk their lives by communicating the intent of the newly born United States. The example illustrates these early Americans used firearms for self-protection from all, including the mother country and can be used today for the same reasons, added security measures with firearms.

19,Will Drone Registrations Make the Skies Safer?,news-society," 2016 has already been a busy year for the friendly skies. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has started to roll out its mandatory drone registrations. So far, in the first month alone over 300,000 drones have been registered by the FAA. But will people registering the devices make the skies safer? As an air ambulance company, nothing is more important to us then safe, uninhibited skies. One of the reasons the FAA took the step to make drone registrations mandatory is because of a few careless near accidents. Last year alone drones have flown too close to comfort to several commercial flights and have landed in high security areas (like the White House lawn or near the Presidential motorcade). It was estimated by the FAA that there were 241 reported cases of drones flying too close to airplanes in 2015 in the United States. The problem was especially rampant in larger cities like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. All of these near misses made national news and kept those of us who operate in the skies very nervous. As a response the FAA has mandated registrations on drones. The rule applies to any drone weighing between 0.55 and 55 pounds. The deadline to register is February 19th. But there are still issues to be worked out by the FAA. Even if 300,000 drones have been registered, it is estimated there is around 700,000 drones purchased by hobbyists in 2015 alone. Right now the only rule applies to small drones used for recreation or hobby purposes. The FAA says it is still working on flight rules for commercial drones and hopes to have those rules set by spring, according to NBC News. If drone owners do not register they could face civil fines and criminal charges. The most serious offenders could risk up to three years in prison. The FAA hopes that these penalties will eliminate those ""close calls"" that happened last year between drones and airplanes. The new law is being met with some resistance by drone enthusiasts as well as manufacturers and retailers who sell drones. Some legislation is currently in federal courts, which may appeal or limit the drone registrations. While the new law may have caught some owners by surprise, there is certainly a need for some way to track drones. Responsible drone owners may not like to have to register a device because of a few bad apples, but the FAA is right in taking some steps to hold people accountable. Just one mishap between a drone and airplane would be disastrous. While more needs to be done, including increasing penalties for anyone convicted of violating federal airspace laws, the FAA is moving in the right direction. What results, if any, from the new law remain to be seen, however."
20,Increased Oil Competition: Survival Of The Fittest,news-society," Is the U.S. shale oil industry in trouble? No, it is engaged in a high-stakes competition for market share. As oil flooded the market in 2014-15, prices dropped dramatically and producers began burning midnight oil to manage the downward economic pressures. While some overleveraged companies won’t survive the economic challenge, in true Darwinian fashion, the fittest will prevail. According to the U.S Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) ""Drilling Productivity Report,"" it is estimated that by January 2016, daily production in the seven most prolific shale oil and gas areas in the U.S is expected to fall by 116,000 barrels of oil and 365 million cubic feet of gas. Those seven production areas—ranging from the Utica and Marcellus shale deposits in the Northeast and the Bakken, Niobrara, Haynesville, Permian, and Eagle Ford deposits in the middle of the country—accounted for 92 percent of domestic oil production growth and all natural gas production during the years 2011-14. The decline is directly attributable to a 2014 decision by the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries (OPEC) to produce without regard to market supply. Consequently, a barrel of Benchmark Brent crude oil that brought $114 in June 2014 today brings under $40. OPEC members, particularly Saudi Arabia, can afford the lower price because they can pump oil for as little as $15 a barrel --a competitive advantage American producers cannot match In December, OPEC doubled down on its strategy and oil prices hit a seven-year low. The lower price hits OPEC profits too, of course, but the greater harm is done to competing oil producers with higher production costs. Those companies can only stop producing and exploring. Many will fail altogether. So far, some 250,000 job losses around the world are attributed to the lower prices, about 79 percent of that in oil field-service companies like Schlumberger and Halliburton. Swift Worldwide Resources speculates that more than 10,000 workers have been let go by struggling independent contractors and subcontractors. In keeping with their independent status, such companies typically don’t announce layoffs. The glut of oil has affected shale oil field operations—OPEC’s primary target—with the number of oil rigs in North America declining 62 percent from December 2014, according to WTRG Economics. Some shale oil producers with high production costs are going bankrupt, while other producers are, in the words of an Oxford Institute for Energy Studies report in November, ""[going] into hibernation"" or otherwise adjusting as needed. Many companies are creating different survival adjustments include selling off assets, such as pipelines, to private equity investors, -- part of Chesapeake Energy’s strategy--  ""refracking"" wells using newer technologies,.  and using multi-pad drilling with ""walking rigs"" that are moved from hole to hole on a single site.  Well-endowed companies are shelving Arctic megaprojects (e.g. Royal Dutch Shell) or getting out of deepwater drilling altogether (e.g. ConocoPhillps) in favor of shale oil production. ExxonMobil has drilling rights to 1.5 million acres in the Permian Basin shale formation and in October was looking to acquire more. As the OPEC challenge continues, producers are implementing ways to keep their heads above water. Many producers are downsizing their employees and finding cost effective means for continual oil production, however despite the temporary strategies that are in place, it is not certain who will survive.

When many times these purposed laws and regulations are in direct contradiction to the common good. Paul Chehade. The professional politicians in Washington DC are out of touch with America and average American. It's time WE take back America for American's. They will not be happy until they send the last American job to China and through CAP & TRADE they also plan to raise your GAS TAXES by 15% to 25% they plan on raising your home & small business electrical bill to 25% and to raise your home & small business heating gas by 25%. Can YOU afford a 50% increase in your home energy bill? Can you afford to pay the extra for gas for your car? IF NOT, it's time to TAKE BACK AMERICA. We don't care if they are a Democrats, Republicans, we will support anyone who agrees with our ideals and goals. America for American's - Everyone Else Can Go Home! Lobbying (also Lobby) is suppose to be illegal for foreign governments to hire lobbyist and try to influence our politicians. This law needs to be strengthened with stiffer penalties. Foreign governments have NO business in our domestic affairs period. ANY politician who takes any form of contributions from foreign governments or entities should go to jail for a LONG time and be permanently banned from any politics or holding any government office, wither one that is voted/elected or appointed. Likewise any lobbyist who represents a foreign government or entity should also go to jail for a long, long time. Lobbying (also Lobby) sounds illegal to me and others. Corporations DO NOT vote so how is it they hire most of the lobbyist? Just because they have the means and money to hire lobbyist they then have the means to induce politicians to be in their favor for upcoming laws and regulations. When many times these purposed laws and regulations are in direct contradiction to the common good. It is the act of attempting to influence decisions made by officials in the government by individuals, other legislators or government actors, constituents, or advocacy groups. There is one simple reason why Congress can't get up the gumption to deal with lobbying. It is self-interested, and lobbyists serve that self-interest. The only way to deal with corporate lobbying is to outlaw it, and the only way we can do that is if the citizens of each state engage in anti-lobbyist referendums, preventing their local corporations from setting up shop in Washington. Until then, we get the government we deserve: by the corporations, for the corporations and of the corporations, who rule over us like medieval monarchs. An Example: Say an auto parts store had a ""lobbyist"" who talked or bribed the owner into buying his parts exclusively and promised all kinds of kick backs, bribes gifts of cash and goods etc. The local District Attorney's office would jump all over this. Unfair trade practices, the kick backs, bribes not to mention the cash and gifts to influence the business owner. Unfair competition etc. etc... Then why is it OK for politicians to accept, cash, gifts, goods etc. from lobbyist? Everyone seems to think there is nothing wrong with this and everyone seems to think this is business as usual. I DON'T THINK SO. Let's start a crusade to end the powerful lobbyist movement in State & Federal government and return control back to the people (who do vote by the way). IF you are a politician and this offends you, I am sorry for you. But in all honesty you have to ask yourself just who do you represent, the people or your special interests who hired the lobbyist to influence you? Unfortunately when you are in this boat (working for special interests/lobbyists), you are NOT working for the people and you DO NOT have their best interest at heart, no matter what you say. I hope you see this my way and join me. Contact your local state representatives and your federal representatives and send them this message: If you take special interest money we will vote you out or you can join us and help make lobbying illegal as it should be. You can send this as an Email or print it out with your name and address and mail a copy to your representatives. They are always saying how they want to hear from you and to voice your opinion, now's the time to let it be heard. With hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars changing hands in back room deals this is the only way we can keep everyone honest. God bless America Paul Chehade:.

2,Paul Chehade - Solid Investment Advice For Anyone Looking To Invest Their Money,news-society," Paul Chehade - Solid Investment Advice For Anyone Looking To Invest Their Money When it comes to investing, a lot of information exists. So much in fact that even if you could take the time necessary to read it all, the ensuing confusion would probably see you knowing less than you do now. Then what are the fundamentals concerning investing that you should take the time to learn? Keep reading to find out. It is vitally important that you confirm the reliability of any investment broker before you consider handing over your hard-earned money to them. There are free resources available to help you perform this confirmation quickly and easily. By spending some time investigating their background, you can avoid rouge brokers who will rob you of your hard earned cash. Set realistic goals when you begin to invest. Every professional investor will tell you that success almost never happens overnight, and when it does there are some very high risks involved. Keep this in mind, play it safe, and avoid these costly investing mistakes. Creating a long-tern strategy is the best way to make the most money when you are investing. Try to set realistic goals in order to have more success in your endeavors. Hold your stocks as long as you can to make profits. Short selling might be something you should consider. The ability to receive a loan of stock is what makes this work. This is when investors borrow shares through an agreement that will deliver the exact number of shares at a date that is later than normal. The investor then sells the shares where they can be repurchased when the stock price drops. Don't over invest in the stock of the company you work for. It's ok to add support to your company by investing in their stock, but sometimes this can backfire. Your risk of loss of a large amount of money is greatly increased in the case of poor performance or company failure. Do not invest in damaged companies; damaged stocks are acceptable. A company's stock price might be going through a temporary downturn, and that makes it a great time to get in on a good price, but just be sure it is in fact only a temporary setback. An example of a situation that causes a temporary downturn in a company's stock value is the panic created by a missed deadline caused by a fixable material shortage. However, a company when harmed by a scandal might not be recoverable. Steer clear of tips and/or recommendations that are randomly thrown at you when people hear you are planning on investing. Of course, you want to listen to your financial adviser, especially if they are successful. Ignore everyone else.

Cash doesn't always equal profit. When running your life or a business, having enough cash on hand is important to keep things going. While reinvesting is a good idea, you must also always be sure to keep your bank account balance in the positive so that you can pay bills and handle your daily expenses. You should have the equivalent of six months worth of living costs squirreled away just in case. Beginning stock traders should start with cash accounts instead of marginal accounts. A cash account alleviates some of the risk because there is a limit to the amount of money you could possibly lose. So, there it is. You now have the basic information about why you should invest and how to do it. Many young people do not like to think too far in the future, but it is necessary at times.

4,Has Zuma made one bet too many?,news-society," I am not South African, but it is a country very close to my heart and one which I always watch with interest. This week saw #ZumaMustFall day. A series of marches in cities across the country calling for the immediate recall or resignation of President Jacob Zuma. It was sparked by the remarkable decision by the President to go through not one, not two, but three Finance Ministers within the space of a week, which in turn sent the country’s currency, the Rand, in to a temporary freefall. Although it has stabilised slightly since. This is not the first time that Jacob Zuma has faced calls to resign from protesters on the streets. The recent #FeesMustFall social media campaign also saw protesters take to the streets, that time about the prohibitive cost of tertiary education in South Africa. Then there has been the long running saga of the property in his hometown of Nkandla, which has seemingly been paid for using public funds. Combine this with the economic downturn affecting the country, which has seen it lose its place as Africa’s largest economy for the first time, as well the poor state of public services, rampant unemployment, and a crime rate that remains stubbornly high, and it is staggering to those not familiar with South African politics that he has survived this long. This is leaving out some of his personal uhum…. statements, regarding the HIV menace that riddles the country he leads. Through all of this the President has never been put in any kind of real political danger though. Partly this is due to the unique makeup of South African politics, which sees an almost religious devotion to his party, the ANC, the anti-apartheid freedom movement turned party of Government, which Nelson Mandela led to victory in the country’s first ever free elections in 1994. Part of it is also down to Zuma himself though. He is a political survivor who specialises in the type of dividing rhetoric that ensures that he presents himself as a son of the freedom movement, and that is ultimately all that matters. This has helped him weather all the previous storms that have come his way. This time feels ever so slightly different though. Nobody with any sense thinks that the marches will actually lead to the President going, but it does show a shift change. Namely the involvement of two key groups. One, the educated and reasonably affluent black middle class, and two, whites. On the second of these groups, there has been criticism by the President’s supporters that this is primarily about white people wanting to get rid of the first President who has actually threatened their privileged position, and one look at the pictures from the marches does definitely show a heavy Caucasian makeup-especially in Cape Town. But this is to miss the point. Until very recently the only whites who would be seen publicly voicing their despair and anger at the current Government would have been either highly political people activists, or right wing fringe characters harping for the return of white rule. What was different about yesterday is that normal, sensible and, until now politically unengaged, young white people were marching through the streets demanding the President go. That this generation of white South Africans feel confident enough in their place in South African society to so clearly and publicly state their views and criticisms is, in itself, a sign of progress in the country. Their parents-the generation that went through the transition from apartheid to democracy- would almost certainly been too afraid to show any signs of not being happy with the new national project for fear of being labelled as racists who are living in the past. The other key group, and one that ultimately has the potential of doing more damage to Zuma, is the educated black middle class. For these young people they see their country being left behind in the global race for progress as a result of a corrupt and incompetent Government, which is now actually costing them money and opportunity. If you look at the democratic toppling of leaders throughout history, they have almost all come about for the same reason. And that is that they have cost the middle class money, or put another way, that the middle class didn’t trust them with their money. In the UK it was not, despite all the fuss, Labour’s foreign policy that cost the party, it was the feeling that middle income families did not trust them with their mortgages, savings and pensions anymore. Conversely the same can actually save an administration. Bill Clinton survived the relentless attempts by his Republican opponents to impeach and defeat him, because of, as he said ‘the economy, stupid’. As long as people’s money was safe, they could look the other way at everything else. Thatcher achieved the same magic trick, until the magic ran out. The same is true in South Africa. Even the great Nelson Mandela, rightly deified in the country, had enough political nous to understand that he couldn’t alienate those who are responsible for bringing money in to the Government’s coffers. Hence the middle of the road economic policies of his time in office. His successor, Thabo Mbeki had the same understanding, although lacked the personal charisma to carry it off to the same extent, and was often criticised for the fact that his Government left too many of the people they were supposed to help, out of the new South African dream. That criticism was not entirely unfair, but it was not what ultimately ended up costing him. Zuma on the other hand, has followed a different path. A more radical and redistributive political and economic plan based, apparently, on redressing past wrongs. Oddly, that would have probably worked better for him in the 90s, when any redistributive policies would have only punished a white minority that was already on the naughty step and in no position to push back. But South Africa in 2015 is very different, and the people who are now being having their pockets hit by his plans are black as well as white. And they don’t like it, not one bit. On their list of priorities, bringing up past injustices is fairly low down, especially when compared to the success of their business and the economic security of their families. President Zuma has underestimated these people. He wagered that they will put up with taking the brunt of his policies and forgive his personal shortcomings, as long as it meant correcting the past. In that wager, South Africa’s political gambler has been beaten by the house. He will survive this week’s events, but one can’t help feel that this is the start of something not the end."
5,Paul Chehade - Ebola virus in the United States of America.,news-society," Paul Chehade - Ebola virus in the United States of America. The government has been incompetent in the face of the Ebola threat. But our other institutions are dropping the ball too by Paul Chehade. What inexcusable incompetence. The fact that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention allowed a nurse who had cared for an Ebola patient to board a commercial airplane despite a 99.5-degree fever is shocking. All that was needed was common sense. We in the United States have protocols for everything but the problem is who know and respect them? Containing Ebola means setting and enforcing strict protocols. Just one weak link in the chain is a recipe for disaster. So administrators need to be vigilant in their hiring, training and supervision of health care workers, to ensure that patients. America's Ebola Panic. What's wrong with news articles and cable-news segments that caution against Ebola hysteria by telling the truth? Two things: First, the non-stop harping about people overreacting to Ebola is turning into another form of overreaction. Second, the coverage of Americans freaking out about the disease, might, ironically, make widespread panic more likely. Ebola has been making headlines since March when an outbreak of the rare, but deadly, hemorrhagic disease began in Guinea. Earlier this year, two American aid workers, Dr. Kent Brantly and missionary Nancy Writebol, who contracted the virus overseas have been transferred to Emory University's hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, for treatment. Both have received doses of an experimental serum to help fight the disease, which has no known cure. How Ebola is transmitted? Ebola is transmitted through the bodily fluids of an infected person. So it's much harder to contract than the common cold or influenza, Dr. Schaffner said. ""People from West Africa can be brought into the United States. If they are healthy, they don't put anybody at risk,"" he said. ""It's when they become sick that [they're contagious."" Although, he continued, Ebola transmission requires fairly intimate contact with someone - you must swap bodily fluids for the virus to transmit. True Ebola symptoms. There's a misconception that Ebola causes victims to bleed from every orifice in their body, including their pores. The reality is that only some late-stage patients bleed externally, sometimes from the eyes, nose, ears, mouth and rectum, and internally as well, according to the National Institutes of Health. But this only happens in about 41 percent of patients, according to a study in the wake of the 1995 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo - and it's not correlated with death or survival. Bodily secretions such as blood, salvia and semen are how the virus transmits person to person. In Africa, viral spread has also been recorded through the handling of infected animals, including chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines found ill or dead or in the rainforest, according to the World Health Organization. How common is Ebola? Ebola for all its horrifying complication and mystery - is well known around the world. But it is also relatively rare. How common is Ebola? There are five known types of the virus, three that have been associated with large human outbreaks. Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) is the strain currently devastating West Africa - though this outbreak marks the first appearance of a new, perhaps particularly tough to treat strain of EBOV, according to a preliminary report published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Two strains of Ebola, Tai Forest ebolavirus and Reston ebolavirus, can infect humans, but have not been associated with human disease outbreaks to date. Fighting Ebola. No cure or vaccine exists for Ebola. There aren't even any specific treatments for the disease, though typically patients are given intravenous hydration and electrolytes Patients can remain infected - and perhaps contagious - for an unknown amount of time. The Ebola's virus is mysterious. Fruit bats are believed to be the natural reservoir of the virus reinforcing the idea that more research and prevention guidelines are needed. Medical care in the United States has traditionally been judged superior to that of many other developed nations. More recently, however, public support for research and education has been reduced, while freedom from bureaucracy has yielded to onerous insurance and governmental regulation. As a result, the superiority of American medicine is waning. God Bless America. Paul Chehade:.

7,Paul Chehade - Why We Should Reduce Our Non Renewable Fuel Source Useage,news-society," Paul Chehade - Why We Should Reduce Our Non Renewable Fuel Source Useage More and more people today see the benefits of looking out for our fragile environment. Using green energy will help you save money and do your part to protect the environment. In this article, you will find great ideas that will make green energy a way of life. If you are thinking of designing your outdoor areas with lighting, consider using solar lamps instead of conventional power. These lamps are very cheap, as they require no external power source, just the sun. You will not only reduce the energy you use. It will also save you money by not having to wire the outdoor lights to your home. Switch to water heating systems that use solar power to heat hot tubs, pools and indoor water. Solar water heaters tap into the abundant and free energy offered by the sun. Water heated by other methods, like natural gas, propane, or electricity, is not an efficient method. While some upgrades cost more initially, they can qualify you for deductions on your tax return for using green energy. Solar panels can be easily installed on your home and are used to collect energy from the sun for use in your home. However, before you do this, there are a few things that you need to take care of. The most important thing you need to consider is the amount of sun your home gets regularly. You can't take as much advantage of solar energy if your house gets a lot of shade rather than sun. When you can, wash your laundry in cold water. Almost 90% of energy used for doing laundry is due to heating the water. Using a quality detergent means it is unnecessary to use hot water. Also, don't wash your clothes until you can completely fill the washer, as this saves energy over time. Check out all the different resources your community has available for energy. Check the cost of running your home using these utilities, taking into consideration any recent legislation regarding energy costs. You may find that natural gas will be better for your home than electric, or that well water is an available alternative to city water. If you clean your dishes using a dishwasher, do not operate before it fills up. No matter how many dishes you have in there, it still uses the same level of energy. Also ensure that it is set to air-dry if you are aiming to reduce your energy consumption. Put the solar energy system's batteries close to its cells during installation. This will prevent power from being lost in the cable. It also reduces shading of the solar shells. Shading reduces solar panel energy generation. Change up the way you dress in your home and warm yourself up to avoid turning on the heater if possible. A light sweater gives you 2 extra degrees of warmth, while a heavy sweater gives you 4 degrees. There's no reason you can't bundle up in the privacy of your own home, so put on a sweater and cut down your energy bill! Try to learn about passive and active solar power. Active power is the power stored for later use and passive doesn't require pricey cells for storing power. In order to use active power, you will need to install a few things, including solar cells, mechanical systems, and most importantly, solar panels. Passive solar power uses the heat of the sun to hold thermal energy within your home. Use the tips in this article to take care of your environment while minimizing the carbon footprint you put out. The money you save can make the changes even more enticing! Paul Chehade AAA Construction & Development http://www.mpcd.info"
8,Paul Chehade - Symbolic rebuke to President Obama over immigration. Where are we heading? What is our future?,news-society," Paul Chehade - Symbolic rebuke to President Obama over immigration. Where are we heading? What is our future? Emboldened House Republicans issued a stern but symbolic rebuke to President Barack Obama over immigration Thursday, passing a bill declaring his executive actions to curb deportations ""null and void and without legal effect."" Paul Chehade. Our nation has been traditionally headed by two political groups, the Democrats and the Republicans. In light of this political failure, what will the future bring to the American people and coming generations? What are the expectations to live a life with dignity and hope. The Democrats and the Republicans have promised, politically and publicly, to serve the nation for decades, but the reality is that both of them after consecutive failures, only prove that they serve the powerful economic groups that for generations have drained the economy of our nation and have left our citizens in the most precarious and fragile economic situation in the American history. In light of this political failure, what will the future bring to the American people and coming generations? What are the expectations to live a life with dignity and hope. Without desire to deepen into the subject I would like to mention the pillars for the growth and strengthening of our society which are essential for the development of every human being: Food, health, housing and education. In light of the economic crisis that our nation is confronting, mainly due to the bad administration of the last two governments, still today our President Obama is neglecting the fundamental issue of providing basic food supplies for the American people, especially for our children, the future of our nation, that are the most affected in this national crisis. We need to understand that the cost of food has increased almost 50 % in many cases and in other cases up to 100% in the last years. All of this without any real increase in salaries for the fortunate ones that still have the opportunity to work, and without counting the millions of unemployed that are suffering with anguish and despair because they have no means to cover the basic necessities for their families. In the health area, our government has approved a new health law that in reality does not favor the majority of our citizens; the truth is that the working force of our nation, which is the middle class, is the one being punished with this law. As time has gone by, health for the inhabitants of our nation has become an unattainable luxury for the common citizens that do not count with the minimum economic means to afford the inflated costs of hospitals and medicines. Regarding housing, it is a common knowledge that more than 1 million people will lose their homes this year, again as a consequence of the economic crisis provoked by the bad administration of our national resources. Under these conditions it will be even more difficult to survive. Regarding education, consider that every human being requires the minimum conditions to develop, like been properly feed and live in the proper environment to have good health and a decent place to live in order to facilitate a good education. All these aspects are basic and essential for a good educative and professional formation. I would like to mention that due to the reduction in the Budget, courses that are in the annual school system are being eliminated, as well as many educational centers are starting to reduce the number of teachers and personnel because they claim don't have enough economic resources. All the aspects mentioned are fundamental for any society to develop properly and it is very sad to see our nation that has always been the world's example, submerge in this deep economic, social, moral and cultural crisis. We ask ourselves, what is our future, where we are heading if the leaders elected have not provided any real solution nor have they implemented any concrete measures to improve the quality of life in this country? Each day we see less and less opportunities for the new generations and the basic elements to live are almost inexistent. We now find ourselves in an uncertain future where our values are at high risk, values that were the fundamentals of our nation. As an example of the lack of ethics during the year 2010 - 2014 in order to cover up the government deficiencies and the lack of decision of our government officials, they have played with the sentiments and necessities of our citizens, thinking that we do not know better, blaming the less fortunate, like the immigrants and other minorities, pretending to distract our attention from the real causes of the bad administration of our politicians who are the only ones to blame for the shortcomings that we are now facing. I wonder, why do we need to suffer and endure the consequences derived from the incapacity of our elected officials? The true solution to the majority of our problems could be that our politicians would take real conscience that their salaries are paid by the people and should use all their time and energy to work for the benefit of all us, the people, and not for the groups that finance their electoral campaigns. Keep always in mind that the power comes from the people and the government belongs to the people and that the President of our nation should serve every citizen without distinction of race, color or religion. Equally, don't ever forget that the White House represents the liberty and democracy of our nation, that was built by Afro-Americans like many of the houses and buildings were you live have been built by immigrants with or without documents, contributing to the development of this great nation. With this I want to say that it is fundamental and an obligation that our government officials provide a worthy life to all the citizens of this great nation, without discriminating because everybody including the immigrants has contributed to the formation of our nation. It is a lack of respect to the human intelligence and immoral to use the suffering of our people for electoral purposes, promising many things that will never be fulfilled. This is a direct treason to the voters and the nation that has believed in them and see their hopes and dreams get shattered by the unfulfilled promises. Our nation needs Americans and Immigrants in one effort together to create jobs, give a better education to the children, facilities to go to Colleges / Universities and a dignity life to the old people. Love and freedom form a fundamental duality in human life. One without the other soon becomes a disaster, as would be night without the day. The most important is respect the life, and every day we won't do what is right is a day we are lose an option to protect our family, community and world.

9,Get Ready for Winter Mayhem!,news-society," Severe storms are making it more and more relevant for survival kits and emergency preparedness plans.Texas and several other states have seen more than their share of disasters this month. These storms rushed across five states and left two others on the lookout. November, 2015 tornadoes hit Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana and brought blizzards to Colorado and Kansas. Anyone in those states that didn’t have an emergency kit or at least a preparedness plan, were caught unprepared. The tornadoes that hit the Texas area brought 99 mph winds and heavy rain. Storms this severe aren’t normally seen until the spring months. This massive storm pulled moisture up from the Gulf of Mexico and poured a downfall of heavy rain on the areas below. This amount of water caused flash flooding, downed trees and powerlines, and washed out roads, leaving 44,000 people without power. In this situation a survival kit with a flashlight and some extra batteries could mean the difference between life and death. To make things even worse, of the 42 tornadoes reported at least two were a mile in width and swept across vast areas of land causing a lot of damage. Fifteen to twenty trailer homes were damaged and three trailers were flipped in an RV park. These tornadoes also destroyed a bank and left one high school with severe damage. In the midst of all the damage rescuers had their work cut out for them as well, as they responded to over 90 water rescues. Having food, potable water and a plan would have prevented many from dehydration, and provided a better chance at surviving until rescuers could arrive. After the tornadoes blew through and everything settled down six people were found dead and at least two were missing. Advanced preparation of an emergency plan and obtaining a survival kit with the proper items, can be instrumental in preventing fatalities. The same storm that hit Texas also brought a humongous blizzard to Colorado and Kansas. Forty-five mile per hour winds and nine foot snow drifts swept across the states and brought horrible driving conditions with it. Semis and cars were lined up along the interstate and several landed in ditches. Having a roadside emergency kit or an automobile emergency kit would be a great thing to have to keep people safe and warm along the road. I-70 was closed from Colorado into parts of NW Kansas and flying was nearly impossible as over 200 flights were cancelled. These two states saw at least five feet of snow in under a week. Although these disasters are out of our control, it is in our control to keep ourselves and our families safe; to do that we must be prepared. Having an emergency preparedness plan and a survival kit are great ways to stay prepared and keep yourself and others safe this winter. Don’t get caught without a plan. Be prepared."
10,Two Million Dollars Bail,news-society," Wow. The Superior Court is not pussyfooting around on this charge. Victor Bennett of Camden New Jersey, last Wednesday night,  allegedly hid in the dark between two parked cars and awaited the arrival of Officer Reed’s unmarked  police car. When Reed pulled up alongside his position,  Mr. Bennett unloaded his clip into Officer Reeds car and body and then ran away into the darkness of his densely populated Parkside neighborhood affectionately known as  ""Darkside"" among the local criminals. Victor Bennett, the alleged shooter was apprehended a few days later hiding in a garden shed of some unsuspecting homeowner in an adjacent town. He was still packing his automatic as well because the police now have the gun and have matched that exact gun to another shooting in Camden just one day before the cop shooting!  Both victims, civilian on Tuesday and Official on Wednesday, escaped with serious but survivable gunshot wounds. They haven’t charged Bennett with the Tuesday shooting and I suppose he will remember that he loaned the .45 automatic  to his grandmother that day.  He knows that a civilian victim will never testify against him for fear of getting shot up again.   Why should the victim need to worry about encountering a loser like Bennett on the street again? Here is why;  the guy is jail-proof.  He makes bail.  In his three short years of adulthood he has two illegal gun convictions, an unresolved  sexual assault on a child and unresolved charges from two other shootings in Camden six days before he committed  the rape.  He apparently committed all of these violent crimes in just three years.  We don’t know his juvenile record because that is secret.  If his juvenile criminal history were to be made public it might hinder his chances at a fresh start as an adult. The point is that he was legally on the street the night he opened up on the cop.  No one event within this campaign of violence including the various attempted murders were enough, individually, to require his actual incarceration.  He was allowed to pile up charges, indictments and crimes dealing with each one separately, entering his pleas, getting his bail bonds and showing up for his Court dates.  That’s his day job. His night job is moving dope around and ambushing cops. Criminal law is extensively studied by intellectuals and legislative panels.  I am not one of those experts. I am just a citizen with an opinion.  New Jersey recently reformed its Bail System.  The reforms were probably pointed toward reducing the population of the hideously crowded county jails.  The bail system in New Jersey seems to weigh every factor except the cumulative horror of the suspect’s actual street life.  As long as he shows up for his appearances he can do whatever he wants during the rest of the week and pile on whatever charges he wants before the present ones are even considered or resolved.  The crimes come A la Carte in New Jersey.  Bennett  is presumed innocent on the cop shooting and he is presumed innocent on the others that remain non-adjudicated. ""Bail status to remain the same""  the judge says he yawns at the conclusion of another pre-indictment conference.  As long as Mr. Bennett is at the Counsel Table in the Courtroom first thing Monday morning,  the Judge is not concerned with what he may be doing on the streets of Parkside last thing Tuesday evening. As long as that one Ala Carte case is on track, then not that judge or any judge is going to be looking at the other half-dozen unresolved crimes in various jurisdictions or even  the ones in the same jurisdiction. The parties are in Court to address one specific docket number and one set of allegations.   The defense lawyer will jump up like a jack-in-the-box at the mere allusion to any of his client's  other very recent and very serious crimes. I don’t know what this man’s bail was on the child rape charge.  Maybe is it was $100,000 and maybe Bennett got a $100,000 bail bond by putting down $1,000 and signing a zero interest note for the $9,000 balance of the premium.Maybe is it was $100,000 and maybe Bennett got a $100,000 bail bond by putting down $1,000 and signing a zero interest note for the $9,000 balance of the premium.  The Bail Bond agency was happy to spring him from the jail on a promise to pay for the bond later because Victor Bennett does show up for Court and because some half-dozen family members most likely co-signed yet another bail bond installment purchase agreement along  with Victor.  Maybe his Mom came up with a Grand.  However they swung it, Victor was legally out and about basically on the strength of a few signatures.  The Bail Bond agency appreciates his business and they will be glad to do it for him again and again and again.  They thank God that cop survived though. The more amazing thing is that the new Judge on this brand new attempted assassination of a police officer has yet again offered this man freedom on bail!  This time though the bail is two million dollars. Ooooohhh!  Let’s see him come up with two mill.  I guess its possible he won’t but much more likely that he might.  It will not be in the news when he is released again. People have the idea that the Bail agency brings over a bag of gold bullion and deposits it with the Sheriff.  That is not exactly the way the industry works. They deliver a piece of pink carbon paper to the sheriff.  The paper if you can read all the small print and hand printed names in various blank spaces solemnly promises that Lloyds of Lubbock Insurance Company will be responsible to the County for the full amount of the bail if this particular defendant skips on this particular charge and then can’t be found anywhere on the face of the earth. No money changes hands. I don’t know if any Insurance Company has ever actually paid one of these defaults. I doubt it happens very often, if ever.  The Lloyds of Lubbock Insurance Company doesn’t really underwrite the Bond at all. The local Bail Agent has assumed all the risk on himself.   Lloyd’s just picks up a flat fee for allowing the use of their name on the pink paper. I have talked to enough of these criminal individuals to understand that they are focused on today only.   To these habitual offenders the penalty starts on the day they are picked up on a charge and it ends on the day they waltz out of the jail on bail or whatever. They are out.  That thing is over. Now they just have to keep track of their various Court dates and they can get back to that life they live before it was interrupted by an arrest.   So here is my issue about bail, the money doesn’t mean a damn thing. Anybody can make any bail in this town.  It is just a question of whether the price of freedom is low, moderate or high. Whatever it is though, that price can and will be met by anybody with any family connections at all.  I don’t mean political connections I just mean a bunch of relatives that will sign the note for the unpaid bail bond premium. They just have to have a name and be able to fog a mirror.  That's all it takes to produce a huge bail bond. How about the other ""conditions"" of bail?  The conditions that are typically imposed by the Court are like no conditions at all.  No contact with the victim. Yes your honor, sure thing your honor. No contact for sure, we just wrote that down Your Honor.  What if the Court was serious enough about public safety to impose some other actual affirmative conditions?  You may remain free before trial so long as…….. a) You have no other charges pending at this moment that you are standing there. b) You do not incur any new charges during the time you are on pre-trial release from this charge. c) You have never been accused of carrying a gun illegally.  I said accused not convicted. d) You consent to a reasonable inspection of your living quarters. e) You report to work or volunteer work somewhere everyday that you are out on bail except Saturdays and Sundays. One day missed and in you go. f) You maintain a working phone number everyday you are out on bail. Out of service means in the jail. g) You carry an out-on-bail card that you show to any police officer who has reason to ask for your identification.  If you happen to forget to show the card then, your bail is canceled. Anyone of these conditions (especially a & b) imposed after any one of the pile of crimes committed by Victor Bennett would have prevented the shooting of Officer Reed and of the other dude who remains unnamed.  Any one of them would have kept Bennett in the jail where he apparently belongs.  Apparently no one in our Legislature or our Judiciary saw any of these common sense conditions as reasonable and prudent.  This dog was not just entitled to one bite he entitled to unlimited bites.  Even trying to kill a cop with a gun did not warrant pre-trial detention. Incredible. Again all these proposals would be part of a voluntary two party arrangement between the defendant and the Court. Nobody has to accept any of these conditions. They are welcome to tell the Court thanks but no thanks and then do what OJ Simpson did. He settled into jail and demanded his speedy trial.  Bang-bang-bang Johnnie Cochran rhymed, OJ tried a glove on and he was home without ever obtaining  a bail bond and without piling on new charges before the old ones were tried. That’s was OJ.  I do favor a fair bail system.   I sure hope if I were ever arrested that XYZ Bail Bond Company would spring me from the County on the strength of my homeless friend’s  signature while I did my best to bring the wheels of Justice to a grinding halt. If that happened to me and  XYZ came through for me,  I would appreciate the chance to sleep in my own bed I would respect the law at least until my case was over. This man Bennett used the system as he was permitted to do so that he could ride around the City at night shooting cops with an illegal handgun.  I have to say that it was not unforeseeable that he was capable of doing that exact thing.  He was already known to act just that way.  I would like to blame his freedom to terrorize the City on some particular Judge but it goes way beyond that.  Any and all judges apparently would have set him free to continue his spree.  The Judges wear blinders just like the horses at the race track. They only see what is immediately in front of them on their docket. They don’t see the corner of Kenwood Avenue and Park Boulevard at 1 AM.  They don’t see the three year saga of an unrepentant cop-shooting gangster.  They just see a code section on a police report and a schedule of reasonable bail to apply to each offense.  They don't know or don't care that the bail system is a corrupt joke and they are not in the least concerned with his past, pending and future crimes.  They only care if their little Courtroom and their precious calendar is administered in any efficient and orderly manner.  They are really not concerned with crime or public safety at all.  So the young man who stands before them ""presumed innocent"" can be assured that he will momentarily be released again so that he can continue his frantic life of violent crime while the various Courts he is involved with  move at their  accustomed snail’s pace. Welcome to New Jersey."
11,Opal discovery may prove life on Mars,news-society," Scientists have for the first time discovered the existence of opals on Mars. This incredible discovery comes as traces of the precious stone were found in a Martian meteorite, which fell to Earth in 1911 and was examined recently by researchers at the University of Glasgow. The announcement has sent shock waves through the scientific and wider community as its presence could take us one step closer to proving if life existed on the red planet. The opal was discovered in a 1.7g fraction of the Nakhla meteorite, which landed in Egypt some one hundred years ago and has been stored safely at the Natural History Museum in London ever since. In a paper published in the journal Meteoritics and Planetary Science, the research team describes using a powerful scanning microscope to find traces on the gem known here are ‘fire opal’, with its distinctive orange, yellow and red colour combination. But the findings could represent something much more significant. Here on Earth, we know that opals are often formed in and around hot springs, where microbial life thrives, and as such can be preserved in deposits for millions of years. Not only does this discovery confirm what NASA’s imaging and exploration of Mars had suggested, it will guide future missions to Mars. You never know, the next opal discovery on Mars could contain Martian microbes and provide proof that the planet once held life. Asteroids, just like the Nakhla meteorite, could contain a wealth of minerals and metals. If so, space mining could be a reality in the not too distant future. In which case we hope we’re around to see it. In the meantime here on Earth, at National Plant & Equipment we stock one of Australia’s largest ranges of equipment used in mining, including mining machinery and mining plant hire."
12,Children and Urban Planning From the Viewpoint of City Planners Like Leon Churchill,news-society," In today’s world where everyone’s always on a rush, it’s easy to overlook the day-to-day details around us, such as the sidewalks, streets, and gutters. For most people, these are merely blurs as they traverse along roads in their cars, or navigate their way on foot, mindful only of getting to their destination on time. To urban planners like Leon Churchill, however, these details are their lifelines, and they try to look at the nooks and crannies of city streets from the viewpoints of everyone, including toddlers. Try to change your perspective to that of a toddler’s, and you will see your city in a brand new light. The sidewalks, streets, gutters, and even storm drains and manholes, become more significant, especially if you’re thinking of creating a safe environment for all ages. ""Cutesification"" of Cities Unlike adults, who walk by streets and sidewalks without closely observing their surroundings, children tend to be fascinated by everything that comes their way, be it a tree root or a couple of pebbles. With children as the focus of their planning efforts, some city planners designed changes aimed at giving kids the chance to engage in physical activity wherever they are. This has given birth to such innovations as swings on bus stops and etched hopscotch lines on sidewalks. Some planners have also latched on to the idea and taken it to bring ""fun"" in city streets for all ages. It has become common to see more colors and art everywhere, even on manhole covers. This approach has been dubbed by some as the ""cutesification"" of urban design. Just like any idea that goes against traditional norms, however, this effort has its fair share of criticisms, with some pointing out that the ""cutesies"" are not what people really need. A Reliable Metric on Walkable Streets One thing that all city planners like Leon Churchill agree upon, however, is that the streets and sidewalks should be made safe for all, drivers and pedestrians included. Approaching urban development through the eyes of toddlers can be a reliable metric in creating safe, walkable sidewalks and streets. With children being among the most vulnerable pedestrians, along with the elderly and the disabled, planning a community through their eyes, needs, and habits can help set a stringent standard in the creation of a safe and engaging environment for everyone. Now that everyone is in need of a more walkable community, planning from a toddler’s perspective can make a lot of sense.

13,Leon Churchill Reviews On the Factors that Make a City Feel Safe,news-society," Which city is considered the world’s safest? Data from the Safe Cities Index, a brainchild of the Economist’s Intelligence Unit (EIU), puts forth a rather interesting answer. While some may think of a ""safe"" city as one with as few inhabitants as possible (less people, less crime, apparently), the title of the world’s safest city goes to Tokyo—ironically the most populous metropolis on the planet. The word ""safety"", when discussed in city terms, almost always brings to mind one thing: crime. But it’s not always the case. City planning resources like Leon Churchill reviews stress other factors, such as sanitation, infrastructure, healthcare availability and quality, financial security, and in today’s predominantly digitalized world, cybersecurity. All these factors are vital when considering whether a specific location is safe or not. In an attempt to delve into the public’s perception of a place’s safety, some researchers have created a special online tool, which asks users to compare images of cities like New York or Boston, and subsequently judge which felt safest. Among the images presented were city streets littered with trash, which the users rated as unsafe. Once the trash was edited out the picture, there was a massive 30 percent increase in perception of safety. In general, city safety relies heavily on sound urban planning. With it, authorities can easily identify root causes of problems, establish local government presence, and build trust between the population and institutions, which is considered an effective crime prevention strategy. City planning helps increase safety in various ways, as most Leon Churchill reviews show. One method is through mixed use development. By combining residential, employment, and commercial zones within neighborhoods, city planners aim to create more opportunities for active and passive surveillance—therefore reducing the exposure to possible violence and enabling commercial activities to attract pedestrian activity. Another is sound use of existing public facilities for occupational activities: a well-maintained public space elicits a sense of ownership and identity, thus helping reduce crime. There’s a wide variety of factors and situations that make a city feel safer than others, which all combine to achieve a common goal. What matters most is that these factors be recognized and tended to continuously. For more information, visit cxcglobal.co.uk/component/newsarticles/article/270."
14,The Types and Purposes of Zoning According to City Planners like Leon Churchill,news-society," No matter the business, the government—whether federal, state, or local—will surely have a say on how, when, and where it can be set up. Most cities and counties have zoning guidelines that define and limit the uses of the various parcels of property within their jurisdiction. These guidelines serve many objectives, but for prominent city planners like Leon Churchill, their most important purpose is to separate and group properties in a manner that can be beneficial to all inhabitants. How Zoning Laws Operate Zoning laws work under the basic premise that property must be protected from having a neighboring property that impacts it negatively. This is why residential areas are built away from commercial and/or industrial areas. Put simply, zoning laws are the government’s method of making (almost) every citizen within its jurisdictions happy. Cumulative Zoning Cumulative zoning is a scheme that prioritizes residential districts and is less protective of other land uses. For example, under this scheme, a house can be built in an industrial zone, but a manufacturing plant can’t be built in a residential zone. The logic behind this scheme is that property usages that are higher on the priority list (residential) must be protected from the harms that can potentially come from usages lower on the list (industrial). Single-use Zoning Single-use zoning—aka mutually exclusive or Euclidean zoning—makes no exemptions with regard to the prescribed uses for an area, regardless of level of priority. This means that the city will not tolerate the building of a residence in an industrial district, and vice versa. Reasons for a jurisdiction to implement single-use zoning can include suppressing conflict between differing property owners, public health concerns, and the preservation of certain spaces for certain usages. Modified Cumulative Zoning Modified cumulative zoning was developed to allow cities to provide a greater deal of protection than what cumulative zoning alone offers. In this type of zoning, districts practice cumulative zoning by default. However, residences won’t be permitted in an industrial area. Most cities employ a hybrid between these different zoning types as they see fit. They may uphold single-use zoning in one area, and practice cumulative zoning in another. It’s all about finding what works for the population. Discerning which type of zoning is best for an area is what prominent city planners like Leon Churchill do best. Learn from their examples by researching on their work or by visiting websites like asla.org."
15,The Singapore Lesson: Leon Churchill Reviews on Effective Urbanization,news-society," Cities are living, breathing beings, and like any living being, cities can evolve with time. This evolution can be controlled in a manner that ensures the city serves its inhabitants well. Innovative planning, design and development that focus on people are the key principles of this evolution—readers of Leon Churchill reviews know this for a fact. In 2013, the Urban Land Institute (ULI) and Singapore’ Centre for Liveable Cities (CLC) released a paper titled 10 Principles for Liveable High Density Cities: Lessons from Singapore, that highlights the Asian island city-state’s success in urbanization despite its dense population. The paper was developed during two workshops hosted jointly by ULI Asia Pacific and CLC in 2012 that brought over 50 different leaders, experts, and practitioners from different industries related to urban planning and development. Below are some of the paper’s most noteworthy points: Plan for long-term growth and renewal. Urban renewal involves the relocation, demolition, and relocation of city assets. Proponents see it as an economic and reform mechanism that can enhance existing communities. When it comes to urban renewal, city planners need to ensure that the city doesn’t feel cramped and unlivable. Singapore was able to harness long-term planning, development control, responsive land policies, and good design to create dense developments that are functional, attractive, and don’t feel overly crowded. Develop affordable, mixed-use neighborhoods. Mixed-use neighborhoods are self-sustaining neighborhoods. They perfectly combine work, homes, and facilities such as hospitals, schools, and parks in a way that adds pleasure and comfort to city living. Singapore’s neighborhoods have a healthy mix of public and private developments with a full range of easily accessible and highly affordable facilities. Prioritize green transport and construction options. Reducing energy consumption and dependence is a key factor in achieving sustainability. With regards to construction, Singapore was able to implement a resource-conscious growth strategy that relies on efficient planning, design, and use of low-energy environmental systems. For its transportation system, the city was able to implement great alternatives to driving by means of an efficient public transport system and well-connected walkways. Today’s city planners can compute and calculate issues far better than before. All it takes is the intelligence and willingness to do what’s right for the people.

16,What Is The History Of Flag Day,news-society," People observe Flag Day on June 14 because it was on this particular day in 1777 that the adopting of the American flag by the Second Continental Congress transpired. In 1916 President Woodrow Wilson gave a proclamation, which set up June 14 as the date that Americans would honor our flag. The Congress then eventually established it 33 years afterward in 1949. This particular specific day in which we honor our flag is neither a federal nor a state holiday except one state, that being Pennsylvania. They started commemorating Flag Day as a state holiday on June 14, 1937. There is a parade in Troy, New York that honors the flag and is the largest Flag Day parade in the nation with an average attendance of 50,000 people. George Morris of Hartford, Connecticut is considered to have been the first to suggest the observance of a ""Flag Day"" and although the tradition did not continue, it was celebrated for the first time in Hartford in 1861. In 1885 Cigrand J. Bernard, a schoolteacher in Waubeka, Wisconsin, was the earliest to formally honor Flag Day in Waubeka at Stony Hill School. From that time on, Cigrand encouraged patriotism, and respect for the flag, and the need to observe a very special day in its honor all around the country. In June 1886 when attending dentistry school in Chicago, the Chicago Argus newspaper released his initial public proposal for the yearly observance of the birth of the United States Flag in a short article titled ""The Fourteenth of June"". Then in 1888, became the editor-in-chief of American Standard, a magazine established by a Chicago group known as ""Sons of America"", encouraging reverence for American symbols by authoring articles. His write-ups were not only shared in American Standard, but in numerous other magazines and newspapers as well. And in 1894, over 300,000 school children in Chicago commemorated Flag Day. Cigrand continued to become the president of the American Flag Day Association and the National Flag Day Society, with the help of these particular organizations; Cigrand was able to deliver over 2,000 speeches about patriotism and the American flag. He later resided in Batavia, Illinois from 1913 up until his death on May 16, 1932. Several regard him as the ""Father of Flag Day"". William Kerr of Collier Township, Pennsylvania, who established the American Flag Day Association of Western Pennsylvania in 1888 and serving as its own national chairman for fifty years, attended the signing of the Act of Congress in 1949 by Harry Truman, which in turn formally established the observance of this day. George Boch, a kindergarten principal in New York City, celebrated this day in his school in 1889. Elizabeth Duane Gillespie, the president of the Colonial Dames of Pennsylvania, in 1893 tried a resolution for the establishment of a June 14th Flag Day. All these are but a few notable patriots who championed the national observance of Flag Day."
17,The Peterson Group Stand on Euthanasia,news-society," The Peterson Group, a non-profit organization campaigning against death penalty, has outspokenly expressed its opinion in contradiction of the practice of execution as part of government law and capital punishment. Because of this, TPG has received a lot of feedbacks through email on judgment opinion. Euthanasia has been one of the topics interrelated with death penalty. Many reviews show the method used by euthanasia is similar to that of lethal injection. Pro death penalty and supporters of Euthanasia reason out that the two are different considering that euthanasia, in most cases, has the consent of the family, the doctor and/or the patient himself. On the other hand, lethal injection is considered as one of the methods of death penalty for offenders of the law. There are even some people who stand for Euthanasia but are completely resolute against death penalty. Will it make a difference? The Peterson Group has expressed its remorse for legalization of both practices. In an interview with John Dole, spokesperson of the organization, he stated, ""Killing is killing, no matter what form or name it uses. Euthanasia is taking a person’s life even when it is not yet their time."" On arguments of heeding the patients request to end its suffering, he added, ""for doctors, instead of aiding them with their health, giving them hope that they can still make it, they consent on their loss of faith and hope. There are people who just need a little push and a little inspiration to make it"". The Peterson Group also pointed out that in the Hippocratic Oath which all medical practitioners have vowed to honor and live with for the rest of their lives and which reads, ""I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect"", is slowly being discarded in favor of killing people. Slogans and statements like ""the right to die"", or ""choosing not to suffer"", ""death with dignity"" and ""doctor-assisted suicide"" are some of the phrases this generation has invented to clear conscience and lessen the guilt. One of the members of The Peterson Group who want to remain anonymous tells how she was asked by the attending physician if she wants to prolong the life of her dying grandmother. She stated, ""I was in Jakarta, Indonesia at that time. When the doctor asked me if I want to ‘end all her suffering’ and it was all up to me if I want to end her medication, I stepped back and really cried. It’s as if he was asking me to end grandma’s life as well. I almost did it though, seeing her suffer. But the conscience is too much. My grandmother passed away naturally a week later but the thought of keeping her from living a week more still shivers me inside."""
18,Investors grow impatient on Indonesia’s Infrastructure,news-society," Construction industry in developing countries in Asia has been greatly advancing in the last couple of years and a lot of investors have seen the dramatic change and big potential. As these third world countries continue to strive and advance, many business owners have had set up local manufacturing companies and distribution. Operations have been run smoothly and expectations are set for a continuous success of the industry. Indonesia is one of the nations which excel in the field of infrastructure, enough for it to be tagged as the one who pull others towards the ladder of certain definite accomplishment. Tens of projects are being done around the city of Jakarta and its archipelagic geography is not able to hinder business operations across islands and local materials to be distributed all over cities. However, it seems that investors are growing impatient with projects which have not reached its goals and isn’t near materialization. Also, there are complaints on how ambitious pending projects are. Critics had cited that ever since the current leader of the country, Pres. Joko Widodo,  internationally known as Jokowi, has sat to office, certain unreliable decisions were made. Last 2014, the new administration has allotted billions of dollars for what seems like far-fetched projects of infrastructure bill-outs. In defense of the president, many analysts wish to pursue plans for public projects centering on ports, roads and airports which are counted to have the largest portion in the ""ambitious"" allotment for last year. Despite the bumpy start to his time in office, Mr Widodo still has a lot of popular support. And many senior figures in Jakarta’s business community expect the state-owned construction companies to push ahead with spending on infrastructure projects in the second half of the year. Companies like Axis Capital Group which sells and rents capital equipment across Asia and is one of the privately-owned companies which has expanded its business to Jakarta from its main office in Singapore seconded the motion to carry on with the plans. Axis has pleaded its fellow investors to give the country more time to fulfill its plans as the result is not expected to rule out immediately after implementation. A number of projects has already been launched and is underway towards reality including a power plant programme, 24 seaports as solution to the archipelago’s interisland gap and Trans-Sumatra toll road. As one can expect, the road to infrastructure is one bumpy ride."
19,Observation And The Heritage Of Memorial Day In The United States And Globally,news-society," Memorial Day or Decoration Day is a national holiday in United States. Memorial Day is celebrated on the final Monday of May. This particular day is to recognize and remember U.S men and women that have passed away in military service to their country. It originally began to recognize Union Soldiers who died in the course of the American Civil War. For many, it hearkens the outset of summertime. Schools are typically dismissed on Memorial Day. This holiday, often many people visit cemeteries and memorials. At 3 pm, Washington time, a National Moment of remembrance occurs. An additional traditional practice on Memorial Day is to fly the National flag at half staff from sunrise to the high noon local time. At various cemeteries, the graves of the martyrs are ever more overlooked and neglected. The majority of people no longer commemorate the correct flag etiquette for the day. Even though there are communities and cities that continue to have Memorial Day parades, many have not held a parade in many years. Little by little, as years go by, the present generation is perplexed whether Memorial Day is for honoring any and all dead, and not just those died in service to the country. In addition to the traditional practices, friends and families do take some time off to go for picnics, celebrations and sporting functions. In 1915, inspired by means of the poem ""In Flander's Fields"", Moina Michael responded with her own poem: We cherish too, the poppy red That grows on fields where valor led,. It seems to signal to the skies. That blood of heroes never dies. Moina Michael then imagined a concept of wearing red poppies on Memorial day in honor of people who died serving the nation during the American Civil War. She was the very first one to wear. She also sold poppies to her good friends and colleagues and the cash went for the blessing of servicemen in need. Other countries similarly appreciated the tradition and were inspired to recognize a quite similar Memorial Day in their own nation. Madam Guerin from France visited the United States and learned of this unique tradition started by Moina Michael and once she returned to France, made artificial red poppies to raise money for war-orphaned children and widowed women. This particular custom spread to other nations. As a matter of fact France and Belgium observe a little something very similar called the Remembrance Day that takes notice of the end of World War I. The Netherlands honor fallen soldiers and civilian casualties from World War II, but additionally from wars in Indonesia and other wars on May 4th, Just one day prior to ""Bevrijdingsdag"" (Liberation Day in recognition of liberation from Nazi Germany on May 5, 1945). In Ireland, National Day of Commemoration celebrates all Irish that died in past wars or in service with the United Nations. In Israel, Yom Hazikaron (Memorial Day) is celebrated one day prior to Independence Day. In Australia and New Zealand, April 25 is celebrated as a remembrance of individuals who died at Gallipoli during World War I."

1,All That People Never Knew Of April Fools' Day,news-society," April Fools' Day truly is among the most cheeky days of the year. This year to enjoy a small laugh of your own, consider giving someone a humorous free e-card that contains a small joke or prank of your own. E-cards really are one of the simplest means at getting back at the people that caught you out last year. Throughout many ancient societies of the Northern Hemisphere, the commencement of the New Year was celebrated on or around the Vernal Equinox, the day on which the Sun's plane intersects with the Equator, causing the duration of night and day totally equal on all parts of the Earth. The Vernal Equinox normally takes place on March 21st or 22nd. A few cultures held celebrations in February, some as late as May, but the drawn out timing of the festivities perfectly secured all the renewal and excitement of springtime, and the rejuvenation of energy connected with the coming of a new year. Throughout France, the annual New Year commemoration happened in late March, with the festivities lasting up to the 1st of April. When the adoption of the Gregorian calendar swept the Christian world starting in 1562, and was probably too ceremoniously endorsed by France's King Charles IX, lots of folks who perhaps preferred the early spring festivity to its replacement or were oblivious of the calendar change, continued to observe the customary, seasonal new year. These particular reactionaries were made the fools of childlike pranks played by their more obliging compatriots; hence the name April Fools' Day. In France, the name for April Fools' Day is Poisson d'Avril, which suggests April fish, due to the fact that once the customary joke is delivered or the prank has been discovered, the fooled is referred to as ""Poisson d'Avril."" April Fools' Day falls during the zodiacal sign Pisces, the sign of which is fish. Therefore, the French term for the befooled. In England and Scotland, the victims of practical jokes were similarly referred to as ""April gowks,"" a term of taunting for the cuckoo, a bird typically located in both temperate and tropical climate zones. The intent of a regular April Fools' prank is to convince someone that something untrue is true. Thus prankish pranks like distributing invites to bogus parties, sending people on fool's errands, turning time clocks behind or ahead of time, messing up the restroom seat with food stuff, and endless others are not only commonplace, but may be a terrific way of sharing some laughs. While playing pranks within the framework of April Fools' Day is appropriate, they should be ultimately harmless in nature. There is a big distinction between hoaxing a friend and being malicious. So assuming your prankster plans are friendly, have lots of fun on April Fools' Day! American writer Mark Twain on April Fools' Day: ""The first of April is the day we remember what we are the other 364 days of the year."""

4,Birth Of President's Day And George Washington's Birthday,news-society," Not many young people nowadays remember that ""President's Day"" was in fact a holiday established to specially acknowledge George Washington, on his birthday. The holiday was initially established in 1885 by a bill signed by President Chester Arthur, which stated that February 22nd, Washington's Birthday, will be a federal government holiday. Nevertheless, as with a lot of things to do with Washington, things were not so basic. Washington's Birthday was essentially on February 11th, but that was according to the Julian calendar. That being said, Britain subsequently changed to the Gregorian calendar, which in turn shifted everything ahead 11 days. Eventually, Abraham Lincoln was elected president and turned out to become a president as noteworthy and served as much of a driver to the nation as Washington did. His birthday was February 12th, and several states began to celebrate that date as a holiday. The Birth of President's Day Years later, in 1968, legislators decided that it would be a lot easier to commemorate the holidays if they were on Monday so that workers might have a three day weekend rather than having a broken week in the middle of the week. This bill moved each of the holidays to Monday, so Presidents Day lies the third Monday in February. This legal holiday is often referred to as ""President's Day,"" in tribute of both Washington and Lincoln, yet the official title continues being ""Washington's Birthday."". In order to establish the solitary legal holiday more inclusive of both Presidents, Congress considered a bill to rename it as President's Day. Congress turned down the bill. A few in Congress would like to make the national holiday more comprehensive of not only Lincoln, but all Presidents who served our country. However when it boils down to it, the original intent of the holiday was to honor the very first significant and great President who had one of the largest roles in founding this country and establishing the Constitution that we hold so dear. Washington merits to be recognized as the most important leader the United States have ever had. What Exactly Does President's Day Represent to Americans? Should you ask most Americans about President's Day, they'll likely tell you that it is among the very best shopping days of the year. Merchants give some of the steepest discounts of the year as they switch over from winter stock to spring goods. Stores hope to tidy up floor space for the new products, and getting rid of the remaining winter goods are their optimum goal. Occasionally the priority is so high that sales are considerably shocking. Regretfully, this process has resulted in the legal holiday, which was designed to recognize President Washington and President Lincoln, to emerge as a highly commercial holiday, much like Christmas has become. It seems regrettable that most Americans do not recognize the significance of the day, the history behind it, and the history behind the men for which it was created. Ways to Commemorate President's Day. That's not just to say that you shouldn't indulge in a very good day of rock-bottom bargains at your local business. But mainly, mothers and fathers should devote the day with their kids, enlightening them about Washington's history and the history of the birth of our country. Parents should enjoy activities with their children that reflect on what it means to become a U.S. President, and exactly what sort of struggles and tribulations George Washington encountered during his time as a young child, his time on the field of battles of our young nation, and his time as a leader of this great nation."
5,Preferring To Be Alone For Valentines Day Is Simply Not Rare Or Is It?,news-society," Let's face it, very few people are all alone on Valentines Day voluntarily. Worldwide, people typically, would if at all possible prefer to be with a partner they really love on Valentines Day nevertheless that is not always practical. It shouldn't be to challenging for a couple in a lasting relationship but for those who are not currently dating, life may be a bit more difficult. But don't despair as this article is going to explore a couple of options of securing that all-important Valentines rendezvous. While you would most likely expect that any couple would automatically prefer to share Valentines Day with each other then you would certainly be wrong. Take as a scenario, that of a couple that have not been together for a long time. They are possibly unsure of the feelings of their new partner as to whether they wish to spend that special day with them. It could be merely a case of basic insecurity. It will also depend on the intensiveness of the relationship; if the ""love bells"" are jingling strong in each of their minds then enjoying Valentines Day together can probably be a guaranteed certainty. But for the couples that find themselves in a more slowly developing relation, almost casual as a matter of fact, then the aspiration might not be so powerful, they are not yet confident of just where they want this connection to go. Quite sensible really, you may perhaps adopt the approach that what truly is so important about Valentines Day in any case. Is it just yet another over hyped, over advertised annual occasion? Well maybe so, but it has been with us for a great many years and it would be a shame if it disappeared. It has sparked several famous sweethearts! Naturally the hesitation might be the concern of rejection on both parts. Well there are a couple of points here, forget leap years, there is nothing these days to prevent a lady from making an approach as well as the man. And in both cases why not just put one's heart and soul into it? Ask the question. The worst that can happen is that the other half says ""no"", so then you find out precisely where you rank and it may be about time to go on! You may think it safe to conclude that couples that have been in a solid relationship for some time would by default be spending Valentines Day together. And ordinarily this would hold true unless employment or perhaps other family commitments prevented this from being possible. It goes without saying Valentines Day can occur on any day of the working week and is not a national holiday in any nation. Assuming this is not going to be a complication then the next minor impediment could just be one of taking things for granted. For instance, each partner may be taking for granted that the other is intending that they spend Valentines Day together. But in fact perhaps one or both parties have no such intent. This has taken place many times leading to a split in the relationship leaving one or both on their own for Valentines Day. This could have all been prevented if the two had just made that small amount of effort to discuss the understandings together. Typically, single people are the group that may be more than likely to spend Valentines Day alone, not usually on purpose but due to a whole range of circumstances. Maybe they just prefer to be alone at all times of the year and are just not prepared to enjoy any real contact with the opposite sex. On the other hand there could be real desire to make connection with a dream partner that has been in their sights for a long period of time but contact has thus far been tricky. A straightforward approach has not been made for the possible fear of that already discussed rejection. Then Valentines Day is just the opportunity to use as a pretext to ask for that special date. Once again, what is the worst thing that can transpire, they say ""no""! Oh well at the very least you know there is no future in that direction. Time to look once more or what about utilizing of one of the many web based dating agencies? Nowadays there is very little disgrace attached to this style of dating and many long term romantic relationships have happened from just this type of introduction. But suppose that person says ""yes"", then life could be about to change majorly and not simply for that one special day either! Perhaps you are not planning anything significant for Valentines Day and have no desire to get involved at this time. So there is nothing wrong with just getting together with a casual friend or even few friends. Go for a special dinner or the cinema as a matter of fact anything that suits your company, because although Valentines Day is about love and emotion there is no reason why it has to be directed at just one individual. So long as you enjoy your day that is the only thing that matters. If it is your wish then I hope that you will not have to make it through Valentines Day on your own."
6,Significant Facets For A Probable Complainant To Think About Before A Medical Malpractice Case,news-society," A medical malpractice suit could be dubbed as a scheme for patients to receive verdicts of substantial sums in a matter of a short time. Nevertheless, these particular suits are not to be taken lightly as they provide a reprieve to patients who have been permanently injured because of the neglectfulness of medical workers. A great number of people are becoming aware of the existence of this particular reprieve and as such these suits are on the upsurge in recent years. In order for such a suit to be successful during trial, selecting the best attorney at law to represent the patient who suffered irreversible personal injuries cause by the medical negligence is extremely vital. There are a few considerations that a person must keep in mind about these kinds of claims. Statute of Limitations So as to prevent the indolent from instituting suits for medical negligence that transpired a long time back, the medical personnel are protected by the statute of limitations. This law establishes that only suits that are instituted without delay after the negligence is proved are admitted in a court of law. Bona fide litigations are those that are filed in time before the limitation time frame expires. Lawsuits that are instituted after the lapse of time are seen to be of a bad motive or perhaps greed by the victims thereby unjustly enriching themselves. That is why it is essential to consult widely before filing this kind of a lawsuit to ensure that it is an acceptable decision at the time of filing the suit. Costs Medical malpractice lawsuits are a very expensive affair as they oftentimes take a more lengthy period in court due to the intricacy of a number of suits pending and the number of expert witnesses you will have to call upon to substantiate that without a doubt there was an aspect of medical malpractice in your circumstance. The health care providers themselves also have an insurance policy cover to cater for their personal contingency and these insurance plan companies have law firms who will be zealous to fight for their clients. It is therefore worthwhile to note that for the court to rule in support of you as the injured party, you must enlist the services of a top-notch lawyer. It is a reality that is well known in the public domain that such caliber of attorneys does not come on the cheap. It is important to make sure that you have a plausible case that has significant chances of success before suing a medical workers or institution for negligence. Outcome of the Claim It is not all the time that the court of law will rule in favor of the patient and thus one should be open-minded. One should really expect any conclusion, as the court will make its decision depending upon how the malpractice was legitimately established. Nevertheless, it is feasible to have the court rule in favor of the injured party in any medical malpractice lawsuit. As long as the victim has an evident or established personal injury and their attorney at law manages to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the injury was caused as a result of the medical negligence alleged. Sometimes, in cases where victims have proper documented merits that will make the litigation successful, doctors or health institutions may opt for an out of court settlement deal. This they do in order to avoid the negative publicity that comes along with medical malpractice lawsuits as it might make them lose the public trust."

The celebration of the new year on January 1st is a relatively new phenomenon. The earliest recording of a new year celebration is believed to have been in Mesopotamia, c. 2000 B.C. and was celebrated around the time of the vernal equinox, in mid-March. A variety of other dates tied to the seasons were also used by various ancient cultures. The Egyptians, Phoenicians, and Persians began their new year with the fall equinox, and the Greeks celebrated it on the winter solstice. Early Roman Calendar: March 1st Rings in the New Year The early Roman calendar designated March 1 as the new year. The calendar had just ten months, beginning with March. That the new year once began with the month of March is still reflected in some of the names of the months. September through December, our ninth through twelfth months, were originally positioned as the seventh through tenth months (septem is Latin for ""seven,"" octo is ""eight,"" novem is ""nine,"" and decem is ""ten."" January Joins the Calendar The first time the new year was celebrated on January 1st was in Rome in 153 B.C. (In fact, the month of January did not even exist until around 700 B.C., when the second king of Rome, Numa Pontilius, added the months of January and February.) The new year was moved from March to January because that was the beginning of the civil year, the month that the two newly elected Roman consuls the highest officials in the Roman republic began their one-year tenure. But this new year date was not always strictly and widely observed, and the new year was still sometimes celebrated on March 1. Julian Calendar: January 1st Officially Instituted as the New Year In 46 B.C. Julius Caesar introduced a new, solar-based calendar that was a vast improvement on the ancient Roman calendar, which was a lunar system that had become wildly inaccurate over the years. The Julian calendar decreed that the new year would occur with January 1, and within the Roman world, January 1 became the consistently observed start of the new year. Middle Ages: January 1st Abolished In medieval Europe, however, the celebrations accompanying the new year were considered pagan and unchristian like, and in 567 the Council of Tours abolished January 1 as the beginning of the year. At various times and in various places throughout medieval Christian Europe, the new year was celebrated on Dec. 25, the birth of Jesus; March 1; March 25, the Feast of the Annunciation; and Easter. Gregorian Calendar: January 1st Restored In 1582, the Gregorian calendar reform restored January 1 as new year's day. Although most Catholic countries adopted the Gregorian calendar almost immediately, it was only gradually adopted among Protestant countries. The British, for example, did not adopt the reformed calendar until 1752. Until then, the British Empire and their American colonies still celebrated the new year in March."

9,Casual Marijuana Use may Come With Some Not-So-Casual Side Effects,news-society," A recent article on the FoxNews website raises alarms for even casual marijuana smokers. If that’s you, you may have felt immune from any harmful side effects from the drug—and yes, marijuana is definitely a drug, no matter the legal standing it has gained in some quarters recently. You may have felt that, as someone who tokes only on occasion, not regularly or heavily, you should be immune to any harmful effects it might inflict on heavy tokers. Think again. We are reprinting the FoxNews article here for your enlightenment.  Casual marijuana use may come with some not-so-casual side effects. For the first time, researchers at Northwestern University have analyzed the relationship between casual use of marijuana and brain changes – and found that young adults who used cannabis just once or twice a week showed significant abnormalities in two important brain structures. The study’s findings, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, are similar to those of past research linking chronic, long-term marijuana use with mental illness and changes in brain development. Dr. Hans Breiter, co-senior study author, said he was inspired to look at the effects of casual marijuana use after previous work in his lab found that heavy cannabis use caused similar brain abnormalities to those seen in patients with schizophrenia. ""There were abnormalities in their working memory, which is fundamental to everything you do,"" Breiter, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, told FoxNews.com.  ""When you make judgments or decisions, plan things, do mathematics – anything you do always involves working memory.  It’s one of the core fundamental aspects of our brains that we use every day.  So given those findings, we decided we need to look at casual, recreational use."" For their most recent study, Breiter and his team analyzed a very small sample of patients between the ages of 18 and 25: 20 marijuana users and 20 well-matched control subjects.  The marijuana users had a wide range of usage routines, with some using the drug just once or twice a week and others using it every single day. Utilizing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the researchers analyzed the participants’ brains, focusing on the nucleus accumbens (NAC) and the amygdala – two key brain regions responsible for processing emotions, making decisions and motivation.  They looked at these brain structures in three different ways, measuring their density, volume and shape. According to Breiter, all three were abnormal in the casual marijuana users. ""For the NAC, all three measures were abnormal, and they were abnormal in a dose-dependent way, meaning the changes were greater with the amount of marijuana used,"" Breiter said.  ""The amygdala had abnormalities for shape and density, and only volume correlated with use.  But if you looked at all three types of measures, it showed the relationships between them were quite abnormal in the marijuana users, compared to the normal controls."" Because these brain regions are central for motivation, the findings from Northwestern help support the well-known theory that marijuana use leads to a condition called amotivation. Also called amotivational syndrome, this psychological condition causes people to become less oriented toward their goals and purposes in life, as well as [to] seem less focused in general. Given these eye-opening results,  Breiter said that more research is needed to look into marijuana’s effects on the brain – even in those who use the drug only once or twice a month. ""We need to see what happens longitudinally,"" Breiter said. ""What happens as you follow people over time?  What happens if they stop using – do these bad effects continue? What happens if you can intervene early?...My worry is we haven’t studied this compound and here we are looking to change legislation on it."" Although Breiter’s team members did not examine the patients’ cognitive symptoms, they do believe that the brain abnormalities seen in their study could lead to substantial effects on brain development and behavior, especially given the young ages of the participants.  Breiter also acknowledged the problems of analyzing a very small study sample – but said that their findings should still serve as a wake-up call to others. ""This study is just a beginning pilot study, but at the same time, the results that came out are the same as a canary in a coal mine,"" Breiter said.  ""...The interaction of marijuana with brain development could be a significant problem."" If you see yourself in that article, if you are fond of rolling joints and enjoying the effects you get from a few hits of weed, just how much risk are you putting yourself at? Do you really want to take that chance…or are you ready to quit and live a healthier, happier, more productive life?"
10,Casual Marijuana Use may Come With Some Not-So-Casual Side Effects,news-society," FoxNews, on its website, recently posted some alarming news for those who think of marijuana as a fun, safe, non-hazardous drug. Their article reads as follows: Casual marijuana use may come with some not-so-casual side effects. For the first time, researchers at Northwestern University have analyzed the relationship between casual use of marijuana and brain changes – and found that young adults who used cannabis just once or twice a week showed significant abnormalities in two important brain structures. The study’s findings, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, are similar to those of past research linking chronic, long-term marijuana use with mental illness and changes in brain development. Dr. Hans Breiter, co-senior study author, said he was inspired to look at the effects of casual marijuana use after previous work in his lab found that heavy cannabis use caused similar brain abnormalities to those seen in patients with schizophrenia. ""There were abnormalities in their working memory, which is fundamental to everything you do,"" Breiter, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, told FoxNews.com.  ""When you make judgments or decisions, plan things, do mathematics – anything you do always involves working memory.  It’s one of the core fundamental aspects of our brains that we use every day.  So given those findings, we decided we need to look at casual, recreational use."" For their most recent study, Breiter and his team analyzed a very small sample of patients between the ages of 18 and 25: 20 marijuana users and 20 well-matched control subjects.  The marijuana users had a wide range of usage routines, with some using the drug just once or twice a week and others using it every single day. Utilizing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the researchers analyzed the participants’ brains, focusing on the nucleus accumbens (NAC) and the amygdala – two key brain regions responsible for processing emotions, making decisions and motivation.  They looked at these brain structures in three different ways, measuring their density, volume and shape. According to Breiter, all three were abnormal in the casual marijuana users. ""For the NAC, all three measures were abnormal, and they were abnormal in a dose-dependent way, meaning the changes were greater with the amount of marijuana used,"" Breiter said.  ""The amygdala had abnormalities for shape and density, and only volume correlated with use.  But if you looked at all three types of measures, it showed the relationships between them were quite abnormal in the marijuana users, compared to the normal controls."" Because these brain regions are central for motivation, the findings from Northwestern help support the well-known theory that marijuana use leads to a condition called amotivation.

""This study is just a beginning pilot study, but at the same time, the results that came out are the same as a canary in a coal mine,"" Breiter said.  ""...The interaction of marijuana with brain development could be a significant problem."" While the sampling is admittedly small, the implications are alarming. If you’re a cannabis user, are you going to keep toking till the inarguable smoking gun is on display for everyone to see? Don’t wait! You could be seriously, permanently harming your brain function!"
11,Woman exercises her right-to-die and takes her own life surrounded by her family,news-society," Brittany Maynard, the American who became the public face of the controversial right-to-die movement over the last few weeks, ended her own life Saturday at her home in Portland, Oregon. She was 29. ""Goodbye to all my dear friends and family that I love. Today is the day I have chosen to pass away with dignity in the face of my terminal illness, this terrible brain cancer that has taken so much from me ... but would have taken so much more,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""The world is a beautiful place, travel has been my greatest teacher, my close friends and folks are the greatest givers. I even have a ring of support around my bed as I type ... Goodbye world. Spread good energy. Pay it forward!"" Doctors told Maynard she had six months to live last spring after she was diagnosed with a likely stage 4 glioblastoma. She made headlines around the world when she announced she intended to die - under Oregon's Death with Dignity Act - by taking a fatal dose of barbiturates, prescribed to her by a doctor, when her suffering became too great.brittany-maynard 2 ""My glioblastoma is going to kill me and that's out of my control,"" she told PEOPLE last month. ""I've discussed with many experts how I would die from it and it's a terrible, terrible way to die. So being able to choose to go with dignity is less terrifying."" On Oct. 6, she launched an online video campaign with Compassion & Choices, an end-of-life choice advocacy organization, to fight for expanding death with dignity laws nationwide. ""For people to argue against this choice for sick people really seems evil to me,"" she told PEOPLE. ""They try to mix it up with suicide and that's really unfair, because there's not a single part of me that wants to die. But I am dying."" A Heartbreaking Choice Arriving at her decision was a gradual one, she said. ""It's not a decision you make one day and you snap your fingers,"" she told PEOPLE. She said she began thinking about death with dignity in January - when she was first diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor - after coming across an article on it while researching possible treatments. ""Really, from the beginning, all the doctors said when you have a glioma you're going to die,"" she told PEOPLE. ""You can just Google it. People don't survive this disease. Not yet."" Doctors removed as much of the tumor as they could, but it came back larger than ever two months later, she said. After researching her options, she decided not to try chemotherapy or radiation. ""They didn't seem to make sense for me,"" she said, because of ""the level of side effects I would suffer and it wouldn't save my life. I've been told pretty much no matter what, I'm going to die - and treatments would extend my life but affect the quality pretty negatively."" In June, she moved to Oregon with her husband, Dan Diaz, 43, her mother, Debbie Ziegler, 56 , and her stepfather, Gary Holmes, 72, so she could have access to the state's Death with Dignity Act, which allows physicians to prescribe life-ending medication to certain terminally ill patients. Maynard originally told PEOPLE she'd chosen Nov. 1 to end her life, but on Thursday she released a new video saying she might not do it that day. ""I still smile and laugh with my family and friends enough that it doesn't seem like the right time now,"" she said in the video recorded Oct. 13 and 14, ""but it will come because I feel myself getting sicker; it's happening each week."" Her Final Months Maynard spent the last months of her life making the most of the time she had left. She traveled to Alaska, British Colombia and Yellowstone National Park with her loved ones and explored more local attractions like Olympic National Park in Washington.brittany-maynard 3 On Oct. 21, she and her family took a helicopter ride to the Grand Canyon, a place she'd been longing to see before she died. ""It was breathtakingly beautiful,"" she said in a statement. The following morning, though, she had her ""worst seizure"" so far, she said: ""The seizure was a harsh reminder that my symptoms continue to worsen as the tumor runs its course."" Maynard said she was deeply touched by the ""outpouring of support"" she got after going public with her diagnosis and her decision. ""I want to thank people for that, for the words of kindness, for the time they've taken in personal ways,"" she told PEOPLE. ""And then beyond that, to encourage people to make a difference,"" she said. ""If they can relate to my story, if they agree with this issue on a philosophical level, to get out there and do what we need to do to make a change in this country."" Maynard also talked to PEOPLE about her legacy. ""For me what matters most is the way I'm remembered by my family and my husband as a good woman who did my best to be a good wife and a good daughter,"" she said. ""Beyond that, getting involved with this campaign, I hope to be making a difference here,"" she said. ""If I'm leaving a legacy, it's to change this health-care policy or be a part of this change of this health care policy so it becomes available to all Americans. That would be an enormous contribution to make, even if I'm just a piece of it."" Before she died, Maynard asked her husband and her mother if they would carry on the work she started to get death with dignity passed in every state. ""I want to work on the cause,"" Ziegler told PEOPLE last month. ""I have so much admiration for people who are terminally ill and just fight and fight. They are so dignified and brave. This is a different choice, but it is also brave and dignified."" She also shared with them her hopes and dreams for their future. Upstairs in the home she shares with her family are neatly wrapped Christmas and birthday gifts for her loved ones for the next year. ""She made it clear she wants me to live a good life,"" Ziegler says. In her second video, Maynard, who is an only child, said she hoped her mother does not ""break down"" or ""suffer from any kind of depression."" And for Diaz, ""I hope he moves on and becomes a father,"" she said. ""There's no part of me that wants him to live out the rest of his life just missing his wife."" Source: People"

13,Government Inefficiency Increasing Costs,news-society," Despite probably the worst rollout in US history, it would be disingenuous for me to say the Affordable Care Act is government inefficiency at its best. Truth be told, GSA (General Services Administration) is even more challenging to deal with. Nevertheless, I just received another notice regarding the status of my healthcare policy. This time, AmeriHealth Insurance has informed me as a courtesy that the documentation I have provided the government is insufficient. After sending in documentation now several times, I have to wonder, is it me or are they just that disorganized? How many times do I have to send Marketplace (a.k.a., Big Brother) a copy of my W2, paystub and tax return before they are satisfied of my earnings? Do I have to start digging up deceased relatives now to verify who I am? You would think they would finally realize that it would save money to provide a simple explanation why documentation is insufficient. Allowing them to reject documentation without a reason almost guarantees the problem will recur. Each time that documentation is rejected, we as tax payers pay for their lack of clarity. Noting a general message is absolutely pointless and that seems to be their standard method of handling feedback. Calling Marketplace rarely solves anything because the person who rejects the documentation never gives any information leaving the representatives answering questions based on conjecture. A single line explaining why a person's tax return, W2, etc. are not suitable for establishing income would likely avoid repetitive processing and save tax payer money but even if this was not the case, each reoccurrence would at least provide some additional feedback leading to a solution faster. A proper system would also require that after repeated rejections, a manager would automatically be assigned to help resolve the issue. Not doing this shows poor accountability and an unwillingness to handle matters properly. Unfortunately, Marketplace is not alone in their unproductive policies. Inefficiencies in government persist across virtually all agencies. Anyone who has a GSA schedule knows how annoying it can be to not have a way for the schedule holder to remove line items from their schedule without having to first get formal approval and then spend countless hours, days and sometimes even weeks rebuilding the schedule, checking it and uploading all the products and images via SIP (Schedule Input Program). Even government programs that have been easier in the past like the DOD (Department of Defense) EMALL are becoming difficult to work with. Initially DOD EMALL supported the use of image servers but dealers with large feeds may need to provide these images on a recordable DVD now as they are often too large to email or fit on a single CD. Trying to validate DOD security certificates can also be a hassle but all this pales in comparison to the aggravation of working with FSSI (Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative). As many applicants have found in the past, FSSI is very meticulous about whom it works with and that effort is in no way a guarantee of acceptance. Although government programs can be a great asset when everything is working, critical thinking must be done to establish more streamlined processing. The first step though in resolving issues is listening and it is not always clear even this much is being done."
14,The Dangers Of Drowsy Driving Are Like Drunk Driving,news-society," A recent study, just published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, has confirmed that inadequate sleep increases the risk of car crashes for young drivers. The study was conducted in New South Wales, Australia, and interviewed more than 19,000 young, newly licensed drivers; all were between 17 and 24. The researchers asked the drivers questions about their sleep habits, including how many hours they slept on weeknights and weekends, then tracked the participants for two years, and obtained police reports to document car crashes. The drivers who reported sleeping six or fewer hours per night were about 20 percent more likely to be involved in a car crash over a two-year period, compared with those who slept more than six hours a night. Among the sleep-deprived, car crashes were more likely to occur between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. than at other hours. The researchers accounted for other factors that affect car crash risk-age, number of driving hours per week, risky driving behavior-and sleep deprivation stood out as a serious influence. Of drivers who reported getting six or fewer hours of sleep a night, 9.4 percent were involved in a crash, compared with 6.9 percent of drivers who reported more than six hours of sleep a night. In the United States, it's estimated that drowsy driving is responsible for 20 percent of all car crashes-but the majority of studies around this issue have not focused on young people. The researchers added that educating young drivers to prevent drowsy driving should become a priority, as ""this group experiences more impairment in alertness, mood and physical performance compared with older age groups with similar sleep deprivation."" Driving tired doesn't get as much attention as distracted driving and drunk driving, but it's a serious problem. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates drowsy drivers cause 100,000 automobile crashes annually, resulting in 71,000 injuries and 1,550 fatalities. This results in an estimated 1,550 deaths, 71,000 injuries, and $12.5 billion in monetary losses. These figures may be the tip of the iceberg, since currently it is difficult to attribute crashes to sleepiness. Â·There is no test to determine drowsiness as there is for intoxication Â·State reporting practices are inconsistent. There is little or no police training in identifying drowsiness as a crash factor.. Â·Drowsiness/fatigue may play a role in crashes attributed to other causes such as alcohol. About one million such crashes annually are thought to be produced by driver inattention/lapses. Â·According to data from Australia, England, Finland, and other European nations, all of whom have more consistent crash reporting procedures than the U.S., drowsy driving represents 10 to 30 percent of all crashes. Symptoms of drowsy driving are similar to DUI: slower reflexes and reaction times, comprised memory (forgetting the last few miles driven), lowered alertness, difficulty focusing, restlessness and irritability, swerving and drifting, missing turns, and difficulty keeping your head up. Really, even driving to work safely requires sleeping seven to nine hours the night before. It's pretty much common sense, but bears repeating that alcohol and sedating pharmaceuticals and OTC drugs should be avoided when driving. On a long drive, schedule in rest times. Whenever possible, have two adult drivers in the vehicle, so you can trade shifts. Stopping often to stretch and get fresh air is helpful; chewing gum and chugging coffee are not actually that useful over a longer span of time."
15,The New Killer Instinct Season 2,news-society," The New Killer Instinct Season 2 The ""Killer Instinct"" series of fighting video games debuted way back in 1994.

16,California Drought Update 2014,news-society," California is in its third year of little to no rain.  It’s interesting that as the East Coast was literally bombarded with rain and snow, we had virtually nothing.  Water?  What water? Here in hot and sunny California, we are having the worst drought since the mid 1800’s, according to National Geographic.  As of today, nearly 60% of the state is declared to be in an ""exceptional drought"". This is a title reserved for the most severe category. We have had droughts in the past, obviously.  This one, however, comes with a few surprises. Of small importance, the bottled water you are drinking may have come from this very dry and needy state! In more urgent matters, San Diego Scripps has declared that due to such severe dryness, the mountains have actually grown by one-half of an inch.  Other scientists are declaring that it will affect the fault lines and we can expect more severe earthquakes, more often.  In fact, we had one just yesterday. What is being done about it?  Is there anything that you can do about it? Save water, save water, save water! I do have some tips below. One of the things that the state is concerned about is your watering habits.  State Water Resources Control Board is handing out $500.00 fines for having green grass!  In contrast to this, Glendora residents are being fined by the city for having dry grass!  Be that as it may, it is best to minimize how and when you water your garden. Another way the state is trying to conserve water is  that for the first time in its history, the State Water Project, which supplies water to 25 million Californians and about 750,000 acres of farmland, will not be delivering any additional water later this year. This is a rationing, not a real solution to getting us more water. Unfortunately, we at home will be forced to ration as well. This is where you come in. Here are some tips on things you can do to conserve water. Here are some great tips to water your house plants or potted plants: 2.Don’t just throw the leftover water in that water bottle away!  It’s also good for watering!  Plants are not germaphobic! 3.Dropped an ice cube?  Don’t throw it away (why do we throw it into the sink?)  Instead, put it into a plant. 4.Collect the water you use while rinsing vegetables and fruit.  And do what? That’s right, water your plants! Here are some other tested and true ways you can help: 1.Turn off the water while brushing your teeth.  Doesn’t seem like much, but while you are cleaning those pearly whites, several gallons of water is being wasted. Also use this technique while washing dishes by hand. Amazingly, studies show that washing dishes by hand uses more water than a dishwasher! 2.Use the washing machine and the dishwasher for full loads only. 3.Cook food in as little water as possible."
17,Elliot & Associates Research Japan Global Markets: The challenges of the Japanese economy,news-society," Since the Fukushima nuclear disaster triggered by the giant tsunami that hit Japan in 2011, the country has gone through a difficult transition as a developed country and as one of the global economic leaders. As of 2012, Japan had the third highest GDP in the world but placed as the top nation with the greatest deficit in its national budget. Several primary factors have brought about the present economic challenges of Japan in relation to the global market which used to be its primary source of its wealth, if not its virtual playground, from the 1960’s to the 1980’s. Here are the reasons for its economic woes at present. Almost every country that experiences a calamity suddenly undergoes a period of depression, both economic-wise and socially. That is an obvious result to such devastating causes that can disrupt the natural, political and social environment, as well the human infrastructure needed for the delivery of essential public and private services. Business activity slows down as well as the consumption of non-essential goods. People prefer to save whatever resources they have for their daily survival needs. As things improve, however, as they must have already done so in the interim in Japan, people might become more upbeat. Other factors, nevertheless, complicate the situation, as we can glean from the other factors that continue to challenge Japanese society. Japan, not unlike many developed and developing countries such as Singapore, Sweden and others, has a shrinking population with a big part of which is made up of aging citizens. On the average, Japan has a ratio of two workers for each retiree, a rather large and unsustainable ratio compared to its previous more productive years. This ratio means the government will have a harder time sourcing out funds to support its growing elderly population while seeking to address the other side of the equation by enhancing its number of productive workers that will support and sustain its economy into the future. Ever since the Fukushima event, the use of nuclear energy to provide power for industrial and general use has greatly diminished. Energy shortage and power costs have battered the Japanese economy as if it were a daily tsunami hitting its shores and wreaking havoc over its traditional role as a powerful economic and trade force in Asia as well as in the entire globe. Previously providing one-third of its energy requirements, nuclear energy has almost lost out totally to other power sources (coal or gas) which have to be imported; thus, aggravating the economic landscape that is already bleak as it is. Until Prime Minister Abe came out with policies to revive the Japanese economy, the post-Fukushima scenario was a period of gloomy outlook for the nation’s economy. Inviting local and foreign investors to rejuvenate the dwindling economy in the face of natural and global economic causes has somehow given new impetus for people to spend more aggressively than before. The renewed confidence might just be the signal for Japan’s recovery in spite of the existing challenges. However, implementation of new policies and economic thrusts sensitive to the realities of the present will determine how the nation will fare into the near future. One factor that observers have felt must be addressed is the repositioning of Japan as a more active trade partner with growing economies in Asia as well as those in the trans-Pacific Region. The road ahead is not very clear; however, like most nations in general, the prospects of growth are rife. It could be the right direction that Japan needs to reinvigorate its economy and reclaim its position as a leader in global trading. Rising from the literal ashes of the last world war to become a world economic power, Japan is not a newcomer in terms of overcoming great odds and achieving dramatic success and economic development. The character of the Japanese people has been proven time and time again in the past. No doubt, the nation will be able to face its challenges with the cooperation of other nations which share the same challenges. The great nation that once tried to live as an isolated island separated from the rest of the world cannot afford to move on without joining the global family of nations toward a more united, progressive and equitable global community.

18,Unclear Future for the U.S. Terrorism Insurance Program,news-society," Who would pay for shattering destruction if terrorists were to attack a U.S. city again, or any part of the world like SE Asia such as KL Malaysia or Jakarta Indonesia? The answer: the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. Axis Capital, a group of companies based in Bermuda with 29 branches worldwide including the United States, provides customized insurance coverage –i.e. terrorism. Whereas most ordinary people will never have need of it, Douglas Durst, one of New York's real estate barons, surely does. According to him, without the federal government providing a backstop on private insurance policies, many major real estate transactions would grind to a halt since his family has trophy properties, like One World Trade Center, Bank of America Tower and the Condé Nast Building, all around Manhattan. All of his occupied buildings have terrorism insurance. ""We would not be able to build or refinance our buildings without it, because banks insist on having insurance for all risks,"" Durst says. What does the act provide? It guarantees that if a policyholder has private terrorism insurance and damage from an attack exceeds $100 million, the federal government will step in to cover most of the liability and damages above that point. As of the present year, the program is up for renewal, as well as over the past few months, the thought of it might be in trouble started Durst along with other members of the New York real estate establishment to worry. The Senate plans to vote on it this month. But then again in the House, renewal of terrorism insurance was decelerated by the program's opponents. The renewal effort lost one of its biggest allies when House Majority Leader Eric Cantor was defeated in his primary bid for his House seat in early June. Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, says Cantor came in to his office in Manhattan to talk with building owners. ""There was no question that Eric Cantor was helpful"" to the renewal effort, Spinola says. Spinola is now watching the Republican leadership shuffle closely and looking for new allies on the Hill. However conservatives aren't the program's only detractors. The Consumer Federation of America says it's a bad deal. There had been complaints. ""First of all, I don't think the taxpayers should be in the business of offering free insurance to anybody for anything,"" says Bob Hunter, the group's insurance director. Hunter emphasized that contrasting in previous federal insurance programs; the government in this condition doesn't collect any premiums from policyholders. ""Without a premium, it's not a real insurance program — and especially in a program that protects very large interests,"" he says. Hunter says a government backstop is needed, but it should be limited to nuclear and biological attacks — not bombs and planes. He says private insurers can handle a Sept. 11-style attack. ""The impact it would have on the insurance industry today, in today's dollars, is infinitesimal. They can really handle a 9/11 event. I've done the calculations,"" he says. Now there's a bill in the House of Representatives that sets a higher damage threshold for those types of attacks, before government assistance starts to flow. To Spinola from the Real Estate Board, this is dismaying. ""It's now more than 10 years since 9/11, and people are forgetting about it,"" he says. Over the next few months, new tenants will start to fill the long-delayed One World Trade Center Tower. Durst says he expects to pay $3 million to $4 million a year to insure it against attack. But he says if the government scales back its terrorism insurance program, the cost of doing business in America's downtowns could rise significantly."
19,Paul Chehade - The Perils of Unlimited Campaign Contributions.,news-society," Paul Chehade - The Perils of Unlimited Campaign Contributions. Unlimited campaign contributions can present an ethical challenge for political candidates by Paul Chehade. Paul Chehade - The Perils of Unlimited Campaign Contributions. Earlier this week, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling on the case of McCutcheon v. FEC, which struck down the limit on the total amount of money wealthy donors can contribute to candidates. The United States has always been a capitalistic society. We value hard work, and the benefits it brings, including financial profit for our efforts. In general, we agree that the government has no business telling any American how he or she may spend that profit. It is also vital for a democratic republic that citizens be involved in the election of candidates which represent them, and more importantly, make the laws by which we all must abide. In many cases, that means making financial contributions to political candidates which represent an individual's views. Those who are more productive and make more profit can afford to contribute more. At the same time, we all fear the specter of corruption in politics. No one wants to think that wealthy donors can use their vast reserves of money to ""buy"" a candidate, in what would amount to a clear case of quid pro quo. Undoubtedly, the temptation will be there for some. However, campaign donations have been around for a very long time. That the limit now has been greatly increased does not change the basic question: can wealthy donors expect favors from the politicians to whose campaigns they contribute? Of course, the answer should be a resounding ""No!"" We must trust in the honor and good faith of our elected officials, the public servants who shoulder the responsibility of leading this country down the right path. We must also pray that God gives us the wisdom and moral fortitude to avoid the pitfalls that come when candidates receive large donations. It is incumbent on our political leaders to resist the temptation to bow down to special interest groups in exchange for campaign funds. Those who can stand unaffected by access to money are the leaders we deserve. Those who fall prey to corruption should be removed from office and face the harshest criminal penalties. Paul Chehade:.

1,"Paul Chehade, candidate for President of the United States of America in 2016.",news-society," Dear Fellow Americans, Once again it is time to fight for the values of our country, we must not let our principles be destroyed, as proud Americans we must return to the values and foundation of our nation. Yes, again it is time to battle and correct the course of our nation, we have had enough of politics and partisan privileges. We must repeat ourselves, the hard reality is that both major parties that have controlled our country for so many presidencies continuously fail to bring prosperity and undermine our most sacred rights, the freedom to live with dignity and peace in our hearts. Once again, it is time to do what it is best for our nation and its people and not what a handful of influential economic powers dictate for their sole benefit. It is for this sole reason that, after consulting with my family, colleagues and friends around the country, I have decided to run again in 2016 for President of this great nation, praying to GOD for guidance and protection in this most difficult endeavor. After my last political campaign, by now many of you know that I am not a politician. I am just a simple person like most of us that loves and cares about our country and just cannot stand our nation's unsustainable situation anymore. My message will be the same, simple and straight forward, not like the political phrases that candidates say in their speeches when they are campaigning and then like always they not fulfill their promises. My main issue will be to once and for all unite our nation under the umbrella of our founding fathers and protect our freedom, peace and prosperity, including every American without distinction of race, creed or color, ""One nation under God"". In this new campaign for 2016, our political platform will be the same, we will push for a law that protects our low income senior citizens from paying taxes on their homestead and secure that their basic needs are met. We will again present in our platform the importance to protect the rights of our men and women in uniform, especially the ones that fought for our country to protect our rights and freedom. We will guarantee that at their return, they will have secure jobs and their families will be guaranteed that their basic needs will be covered. Sadly the present healthcare system and the one our government is trying to implement is not the solution for so many reasons that I will need a whole book to explain. We need to find a solution to the healthcare problem in America without punishing and damaging free enterprise. We need to find avenues to provide free insurance to the low income people and reasonable and affordable insurance premium for the rest of the population, but never impose a law that will restrict the right of choice of each individual. We all know that the basis of our nation is made of honest and hard working immigrants, for that purpose we must impose hard laws that cannot tolerate discrimination in any form. A very sensible issue and a mayor problems of our nation is illegal immigrants, we should abide by the law, but at the same time we should contemplate the possibility of legalizing all these immigrants so they can start contributing to this country by paying taxes like all of us and by spending and investing their money in our country and secure our frontiers with a effective system to detain future infiltrations. We need and we must implement a new solid and secure system to protect our borders and one option could be using the expertise of our armed forces to avoid the immigration problem in the future. Each day that goes by shows us again and again the importance of reviewing our position and commitments in the International arena and in my view it is essential to start giving priority to our American Continent. I believe it is very important to strengthen the relationship with our American neighboring countries and work in unity for a better future of our Continent. Our American Continent is so exceptional and rich that we have at the reach of our hands all the major resources that we need for today and future generations. We must built special preferences and give priority to all the products ""Made In America"" and rebuild the manufacturing industry that will give jobs and security to our people. Again and more significantly, we need to address the rampant spending that started decades ago, but that has skyrocketed in the in the last two administrations pushing our nation to the brink of collapse. Our deficit is a cancer destroying our nation from within. My last campaign question still stands. How confident are you, the common citizen, in our nation's future with the current trend of economic and International policies? In 2016 we will have another opportunity to save our nation. I ask again to all Americans with solid values that love this country, like I do, to help me restore the faith and principles of our founder fathers and return this nation to be admired again as a great nation. God Bless America. Paul Chehade:. Honor and Truth"
2,Identity Theft: Protecting Your Digital Life,news-society," Your online life is convenient and, in lots of ways, fun. However, identity thieves break into online accounts to gain access to other parts of your life. For example, if a thief gets into an online-shopping account, he can use information like your credit-card billing address to con customer-service representatives at other sites into giving him control of those accounts. Internet security doesn’t have to be an ordeal. You can still enjoy your online life while keeping your finances, identity, and computer secure. These tips will help you maintain control of your accounts without sacrificing much of the convenience of using the Internet. Passwords Each site should have its own password. That way, if one account is compromised, the bad guy can’t easily access the others. You can use password-management options like LastPass to store all your login information. The master password should be a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters like exclamation points; you don’t want one that’s easy to force or guess. Security Questions Most account-security questions ask for information that anybody who has a casual conversation with you can discover. In fact, you may have voluntarily made some of these facts public by posting to social-networking accounts. Depending on privacy settings, anybody may be able to learn your favorite pet’s name, your high-school mascot, your hometown, or any of the other things you typically see as answers to security questions. The trick here is to create incorrect, but memorable, answers to these questions. Answer ""mother’s maiden name"" with her nickname for you when you were a child. When asked for your favorite book, answer with your favorite ice-cream topping instead. Avoid obvious two-word phrases, like using ""purple"" for the question and ""haze"" for the answer; they’re easy to guess. Spyware, Malware, Viruses, and Other Junk Scanning for malicious software, and actively trying to keep it out of your computer, can prevent lots of problems. Even if you don't visit shady sites, some of your favorite, trusted places can become infected with malware and other, nasty things. That's why, no matter where you go online or what you do while you’re there, you should keep up with anti-virus and anti-malware scans. Payment Information For most sites, you don’t really need to keep payment information on file. Even though the site does not display the entire card number, an identity thief can get info like the last four digits of that card. This might be enough to trick a different company’s representative into giving him access to that account. Delete payment information after your card’s processed. Use pre-paid debit cards, which limit account balances and offer theft protection. Fund accounts you regularly use—paid-download sites, for example—with gift cards. Social Engineering Sometimes, account control is out of your hands. When other people are tasked with helping keep your accounts secure (customer-service representatives, for example), the best you can do is find good ways to use the tools you can control. Keep an eye on your e-mail and, if you see something suspicious, contact customer service. You might get an e-mail informing you that your password change was successful. If you didn’t change your password, get in touch with somebody at the company or site. Routinely changing passwords also helps. Some people use different e-mail addresses for each, online account, which frustrates thieves. The bad guys assume that you use YourName@example.com everywhere, so using different e-mails makes their lives harder. Free, Web-based e-mail accounts work for this purpose. Backups Regularly backing up your online life makes being hacked a lot less frustrating. You might still lose some information, and you’ll still have to regain control of your online accounts, but not all of your irreplaceable data will vanish. On the Internet, there are no identity-protection guarantees. Your job is to make your accounts more difficult to break into than somebody else’s. Most identity thieves have plenty of soft targets and will focus on those instead of working harder to wreak havoc on your digital life."
3,Texting A Major Cause of Accidents Among Adolescents,news-society," Texting and driving is a major problem among American drivers, especially adolescents. A study just out from the Cophen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York, has found that texting and driving causes more than 3,000 teen deaths and 300,000 injuries annually. These numbers surpass fatalities and injuries caused by drunken driving among teenagers (2,700 and 282,000, respectively). The study also discovered that 49 percent of boys aged 15-18 admitted to texting while driving-45 percent of girls the same age admitted they have texted while driving. The study's lead researcher, Dr. Andrew Adesman, said his work found that ""A person who is texting can be as impaired as a driver who is legally drunk,"" and added that a texting driver is distracted from both the movement of traffic and the function of his or her own vehicle. Dr. Adesman and his research team hope their study will draw more attention to the risks of texting and driving. He adds, ""We have very strong taboos against drinking and driving. Kids don't drink and drive every day. But some kids are out there texting and driving seven days a week - and they admit it."" Punitive damages vary from state to state. In Illinois, they're not obtainable without the judge granting permission to seek them in a trial. Punitive damages are different from statutory damages, which compensate the victim; punitive damages are intended to punish the defendant, for behaving ""with an utter indifference for conscious disregard for the safety of others."" Frequently judges permit juries to award punitive damages in DUI cases, and these awards can be substantial. But texting while driving, which is at least as dangerous as driving while intoxicated, seems to muster a different public opinion-many people don't think it's a big deal, despite major pushes from safety groups (like public service advertisements) about the risks it carries. People are more willing to admit they text and drive than drink and drive, and the image of someone holding a smartphone in one hand while driving is somehow less disturbing than someone holding a beer. But, as public tolerance for texting and driving decreases (and it will; this activity claims around nine lives a day in the U.S.), it's likely that punitive damages from resulting crashes will become common in trials. A study recently published in the journal Injury Prevention examined what happens when people text on their cell phones while crossing the street-in short, rudeness and unsafe behavior. Researchers observed 1,102 walkers at 20 different intersections in Seattle, Washington and discovered that one out of three people used their phones to talk, listen to music, or text while they crossed the street. The texting pedestrians took 18% longer to cross the street, and were almost four times more likely to disobey traffic signals, cross mid-intersection, or walk without looking both ways. All of these actions are risky behaviors, and women were twice as likely as men to exhibit at least one of them. Interestingly, people listening to music walked slightly faster than undistracted pedestrians-but it's hard to hear oncoming traffic when you have headphones blasting. The Centers for Disease Control estimate that 4,000 pedestrians are killed every year, and another 60,000 are injured; distracted behavior, on the part of pedestrians and drivers, is pushing these numbers up. Beyond the hazards to public safety, texting while walking, especially on crowded streets, is by most people's standards, pretty rude. When someone's texting, their eyes are on the screen, not on where they're going; they walk more slowly (holding up the people behind them) and sometimes straight into other people."
4,Solar Powered Lighting,news-society," Providing ambient garden lighting with solar lighting is becoming increasingly popular because of the affordability of lighting units and zero running costs. Mains powered lighting normally incurs much higher installation costs than solar lighting. Solar lighting is a great solution for areas that don't have a local mains supply. During the past few years, advances in solar lighting have lead to better performance and reliability. Using LED bulbs has simultaneously reduced the power required while increasing light levels. Until recently solar lights required hours of direct sunlight in order to function well. Modern solar lights are much more efficient at harvesting energy. This technology is set to continue improving and becoming even more efficient in the next few years. There are many different types of solar lights. Wall lighting: Lantern Style. Lighting for post or hung style applications. A large variety of different fairy light designs. Deck lighting which is mounted flush with the timber surface. Security and spot lights. Some compact designs of solar lighting contain integrated solar panels. Other have a wired panel that can be positioned elsewhere to harness the suns rays. The position and aspect to the sun will ultimately determine the ideal style of solar lights for your needs. Lights with solar panels built into them tend to be smaller because of the space limitations, which can sometimes cause issues because they then require more light for longer in order to function well. In less sunny locations, lights with external panels will allow you to position the solar panel in direct sunlight. For the best performance replace the factory fitted rechargeable batteries that come with your lights with a high quality replacement. Replacing these manufacturer installed rechargeable batteries with high quality replacements will give your solar lighting the best performance possible. Solar lights are hugely affected by their location. Your solar lights should ideally be positioned so that they can receive direct sunlight during daylight hours. If your lights are shaded during the day, it will reduce the charge that they receive. If you are looking for solar fairy lights take a look at the great range of tested and approved lights we stock. Try to avoid positioning your solar lights where they will have shadows cast over them as that will reduce their performance. Product performance will improve as solar panel and battery technologies improve further. Each year sales of solar light products is continuing to climb. Our energy supply on earth is finite. Solar energy not only helps to reduce your energy consumption, but is environmentally friendly too."
5,Thimble Collecting: A Fun and Educational Hobby,news-society," Many of the most interesting hobbies involve collections of a certain object. Many people collect stamps, porcelain dolls and other figurines, and some people even collect Pez dispensers and matchbooks from restaurants around the country or the world. For decades, thimbles have also been a popular collectible. Thimbles vary widely in value depending on where they are from, the materials they are made of and their condition. Commemorative thimbles are also produced with collectors in mind. With the wide variety of thimbles on the market and stories attached to them, collecting thimbles is a fun hobby for all ages. Many types of thimbles appear in thimble collections, and thimbles vary by type (work or display), material, era and design. Thimbles have been made of many different types of materials through the centuries, including gold, silver, bone, mother of pearl, ivory and brass. Many thimbles dating back to the late 1800s are actually stainless steel thimbles dipped in silver in order to prolong the thimble's useful life. This practice of dipping the thimbles in silver was known as the Dorcas method, and Dorcas thimbles have a value all their own even they were developed strictly for work purposes. Thimbles will vary in value according to era as well as the type of material and condition. A circa-1840 set of three commemorative thimbles celebrating the marriage of Victoria and Albert and the birth of the Prince of Wales has recently been advertised on Christie's for $400-$500. Newer thimbles made of less expensive materials and commemorating more recent events typically retail for about $10-$15 when ordered online, whereas new thimbles made of silver with an enamel design may sell for over $100. For many, this begs the question, ""How do I know if it's silver?"" This is a good question to ask, since Dorcas thimbles in mint condition may look exactly like pure silver. When perusing thimbles at antique malls, the easy way to tell a pure silver thimble apart from a silver-coated thimble is to hold a magnet to it. Thimbles made of any other metal will be drawn to the magnet, but a pure silver thimble will not. People thinking of buying silver thimbles online for their collection are advised to buy from a reputable dealer; check with Thimble Collectors International for guidance. Collectible thimbles produced in recent years are often lacquered in order to have a smooth surface on which to place a tiny screen print. While plain, well-worn metal thimbles can be valuable as historic artifacts, the ones with the highest resale value are generally the ones with fancy designs, particularly those commemorating an historic event. Commemorative thimbles include a great many dedicated to the births of members of the British royal family, including the 2013 birth of Prince George to William and Kate. Thimbleguild.com even sells a thimble commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Dalai Lama's first visit to the United Kingdom. While a large thimble collection - or even a small one consisting solely of gold and/or silver thimbles - can cost a small fortune to amass, thimble racks and cabinets cost less and are the ideal way to display one's thimble collection. Brand-new thimble racks holding 20 thimbles can be found for as little as $8 online, and display cases for larger collections can cost $50 or more. Thimble racks and cabinets generally come fully assembled and with felt interiors and glass doors to prevent dust accumulation. If these seem too costly, any other small figurine display case will do, although it would be a good idea to add felt to the interior to keep the thimbles from coming in contact with hard surfaces. Thimble collecting can be a good hobby for a number of reasons. As with stamp collecting and collections of other types of figurines, each thimble presents a different sort of history lesson: when and where did it come from? What is it made of, was this material commonly used at the time, and if so, for what purposes? Since thimbles are a manufactured product, each thimble is or was made within a particular historical context with regards to both the materials and, if the thimble was not manufactured for work purposes only, the event that it commemorates. Older generations of collectors can look back fondly upon events from their youth through a thimble collection, and younger ones have an opportunity to learn about major historical events through commemorative thimbles. Thimble collecting can be a fun reason for visiting antiques dealers or even for combing through an older relative's sewing box. What collectors find is often educational and just plain fun and exciting to be able to add to one's collection. When it comes to starting and expanding a thimble collection, the sky's the limit. For a fun and different hobby and a potentially valuable collection to pass on to younger generations, consider thimble collecting! Websites such as the Thimble Guild make it very easy to begin a thimble collection and you do not need a lot of money to start collecting them. In addition, because of the internet, sites including the Thimble Guild will help you look for thimbles for your collection. If you want to find the ""older"" thimbles, you will often find them in antique shops or, sometimes, at car boot fairs. If you want to make a start and get involved in this ever popular hobby then why not visit the Thimble Guild website and see what they have on offer. However, be prepared to be hooked on this hobby - as you learn more about the unique and true gems that a collector can sometimes just stumble. You will very soon become a bona find a digitabulist and will likely begin looking everywhere you are for that special or one of a kind thimble."

7,Are Social Energy Tariffs As Fair As People Think?,news-society," When social tariffs were first proposed, they were not seen as being fair to everyone. The idea was to combat excess winter deaths by helping UK residents that were at risk of fuel poverty to pay their bills with a discounted rate. However, that discount would be heaped on the backs of wealthier customers who would then make up the difference. The effect was to be temporary as the Green Deal would then help more and more UK residents to adopt green technologies that would reduce the overall energy demands of the country via grants and other types of financial assistance. Now that the social energy tariffs are being replaced by the Warm Home Discount, the same question arises with respect to the most vulnerable groups in the UK. Is it fair to get rid of social tariffs that the broader group needs to keep heating their homes? Low Income Group Has Green Options The UK’s energy strategy continues to evolve as it seeks to reduce its dependence on outside energy sources while maintaining social protections in place for its more vulnerable citizens. The social tariffs were never meant to be a permanent fixture, as the policy outline in 2009 indicated that the effect would be temporary based on the implementation of the Green Deal technologies. For that reason, numerous schemes were put in place to help low-income citizens improve the draughty homes so typical of Britain using insulation, window-glazing, and other services. Many of these services were provided for free to qualifying low-income households. Also, those who could afford to implement these technologies and pay for them were also helped to find ways to achieve these goals. None of these energy schemes are expected to last forever, however, and even the Warm Home Discount is to expire in March 2015. Keep An Eye On Excess Winter Deaths There is data to indicate that the social energy tariffs, along with other grants and energy improvement schemes, have helped to reduce the excess winter death rate in the UK. While there were 24,000 excess winter deaths for the winter of 2011/2012 in England and Wales, that figure represents an 8 per cent drop from the previous winter. The social tariffs are being slowly phased out, with many of them being replaced by the Warm Home Discount for the 2013/2014 winter seasons. Even though no one can tell how much warmer home are in the UK, if the schemes have done their job and the Warm Home Discount is doing a fair job of it, then this number should continue to decrease. If it goes up, it will be a huge indicator that more changes need to be made to the UK energy strategy, not just to make it fair, to avoid killing more residents. Fair Deals Change With Government A question of fairness is always going to be an issue with social reforms. However, political parties tend to see fairness in their own terms. This does lead to changes in how schemes are planned and implemented, or whether they are eliminated altogether. Some would suggest that the Winter Fuel Payment changes are unfair to expatriates who live in countries deemed ""warmer than the UK"" even though the winters may be equally harsh. These UK residents will no longer be eligible and may suffer undue hardship. However, with the change of government, comes a change in the ideals of fairness. The new government believes that it is not fair to continue to pay for heat subsidies that are going to people who aren’t even in as drastic a need of them as others. As policies change, so do social tariffs, with the eye towards creating reforms that hit realistic targets and that do good in the community of people it is meant to serve. None are meant to be permanent, nor are they meant to require no further changes once they are implemented. As the UK faces the harsh winter ahead, social tariffs may be a thing of the past, but the ideal to create a fair society where even the most vulnerable have a chance at being able to pay their bills has not. It is merely changing and adapting towards newer social reforms that meet the needs of the population as a whole."
8,Electronic Cigarette Advice,news-society," All smokers are well aware of the risks that take with their health every time they light another cigarette. Smoking and the Law It is ironic that the same government that tells us to stop smoking, raises over Â£12 billion annually in taxes on cigarettes. The only other substance that is sanctioned by the government while also harming its users is alcohol. You can also find further information about the medical research carried out so far  full story. There is an increasing movement making lots of noise, voicing their concerns over the potential dangers of vaporizer smoking devices. Each year, 200 people die in work related accidents, leading the government to introduce health and safety legislation to protect them, however, at the same time they allow 100,000 people to die each year from smoking related illnesses because the exchequer needs the tobacco duty. If everyone stopped smoking, the government would have to raise Â£12.1 billion from other taxes to balance its books. We can conclude that if there is enough profit involved, the government won't necessarily protect us. E-Cigarettes and Possible Regulation The lost tax revenue from smokers switching to electronic cigarettes will force the exchequer to look at the regulation and taxation of e-liquid. Regulation will lead to the e-cigarette industry being taken over by the large conglomerates. Lost tobacco duty needs to be found from somewhere so it seems only logical that e-cigarettes will be regulated and taxed. The only reason for the regulation of e-cigarettes will be to enable tax to be levied on e-liquid. Competitors to electronic Cigarettes Both the tobacco industry and the smoking cessation industry have the most to lose from the rising popularity of electronic cigarette devices.  Nicotine patches and gum don't give the user the same satisfying hit of nicotine when used. The tobacco industry can't really argue against e-cigarettes on health grounds because their product is proven to kill people. It is believed in some quarters that the tobacco companies are quietly supporting the smoking cessation industries campaign against e-cigarettes. Likely Regulation of Electronic Cigarettes When the main concern of legislators is how to preserve their income from the duty on cigarettes, rather than the health of the general population, it makes you wonder whose best interests our politicians have at heart? If duty is applied to e-liquid then people may well decide to save money by making their own, which is quite easy to do. Whether people will end up making their own e-liquids is sufficient numbers to affect the government's finances remains to be seen. As long as cigarettes tasted ok and had nicotine in them we weren't that concerned where they came from as I recall. Depending on how quickly the use of e-cigarettes grows, it is likely that we will see regulation introduced. The important thing for the government is to find a way to effective tax e-liquid. If governments can't successfully apply tax to e-liquid then in all probability they will choose to ban the devices regardless of the fact that they are less harmful that tobacco cigarettes. As the use of electronic smoking devices grows, it is inevitable that they will be taxed and regulated as this will allow the government to recover shrinking tobacco duty revenues. Tobacco duty receipts are set to steadily fall as more smokers switch to electronic devices. The inevitable conclusion is that electronic cigarettes will be regulated at some point in the near future so that they can be taxed to offset lost tobacco duty receipts."

11,Kemper Plant Critics Propose Puzzling Vision,news-society," Given what we know about the Sierra Club’s activism nationwide, it comes as no surprise that the group would oppose a new power plant in Kemper County. After all, the Sierra Club is opposed in principle to the use of coal-fired power, and has even fought the construction of solar power plants and wind farms. Though they claim to be concerned about power customers, the Sierra Club’s opposition to the Kemper County plant is really just an extension of an impractical - and truly radical - philosophy: build nothing, never, nowhere. Even the national media is becoming aware of the Sierra Club’s duplicity. The Wall Street Journal explained recently that ""...having succeeded in banishing traditional coal-fired power from the future electric-power mix, the greens are now trying to scuttle any realistic alternative, even the clean coal they claim to support."" Sadly, it’s not just the Sierra Club that is showing a lack of vision about Mississippi’s energy future. In recent editorial pieces, author and newspaper publisher Wyatt Emerich has criticized the Kemper County plant for costing too much, being too risky, and unfairly distributing the costs to electricity customers in Mississippi. The same criticism has been levied by Bigger Pie Forum Chairman Kelley Williams. Both men wonder aloud - without any real evidence to do so - whether the coal-to-gas technology employed at the new plant will ever work, arguing that Mississippi Power Company should have been forced to construct a natural gas plant instead. First, there is nothing unproven or untested about the core technology that makes the Kemper County project possible. While it’s true that the plant will use a combination of technologies that hasn’t been utilized together before, the component technologies themselves are working elsewhere, and they will work in Mississippi. Second, the rate increases that customers will pay - about 22% by the end of 2014 - are typical of what happens when a small market adds much-needed new generation. Customers in Mississippi saw similar rate increases, for example, when Plants Daniel and Watson came online more than 30 years ago to meet growing energy demand. Those costs are never welcome by the end consumer, who sees no appreciable difference when flipping the light switch, but they are necessary, especially considering that the Kemper County plant will be the first baseload power facility added to the utility’s fleet in 30 years. There’s an even more troubling oversight, though, by critics of the Kemper County plant, including Emerich and Williams. They seem to live in a world where natural gas will always remain cheap, while decades of experience prove exactly the opposite. Instead of having Mississippi Power Company diversify its fuel mix, as it is doing with lignite coal in Kemper County, they would force the utility to chain its customers to the long-term price of natural gas. Keep in mind that 75% of the utility’s generation today already comes from natural gas. Instead of pursuing diversity, Emerich and Williams favor doubling down on natural gas. Instead of averting risk with a broader base of fuels, they would have Mississippi Power roll the dice and gamble their customers’ future with the hope that natural gas prices do what they’ve never done: stay put. You might expect this sort of advice from the Sierra Club, which famously took $25 million from the natural gas industry, but such advice from those who purport to care about customers is puzzling. In fact, following the vision of Emerich, Williams, and the Sierra Club is exactly what you would do if you were trying to create an energy future in Mississippi that created the maximum amount of long-term fuel risk and left customers as vulnerable as possible. Surely that isn’t their goal. Building a new power plant will always have its critics. Consider the case of Entergy’s Grand Gulf nuclear plant in the 1980s, which encountered the same sort of criticism as the Kemper County plant is enduring today. The price tag seemed high then, too, and the technology unfamiliar. Fortunately, regulators then eschewed the advice of critics by keeping the big picture in mind, instead of taking the easy path. They were visionaries who shared the same philosophy as the Mississippi Public Service Commission does today: that building a diverse portfolio and investing in new technology, as opposed to simply building the cheapest plant at the moment, is the best approach to protecting customers in the long run."

13,So why is it important to improve yourself?,news-society," Have you ever had that moment in your life where all your doubts, fears and insecurities that you wrap yourself up in, for some reason you seem to come up with the idea of ""I wish I was somebody else."" More often than not, we think and believe that someone or rather, most people have it better than us.- when in reality, the fact is, most people are thinking just the same as us. Have you ever been at a party or a local bar, and you spot a totally eye-catching girl or guy sitting by themselves, casually sipping on a glass of Champagne or a cold beer. You think to yourself, ""They look so perfectly calm and confident."" But if you could read their mind, you would see a bunch of thoughts and you might just be amazed that their thinking ""are people talking about why I am seated here alone?... Why don't girls or guys find me attractive? ...I don't like my ankles, they look too skinny... I wish I was as intelligent as my best friend."" Or we look at a young business entrepreneur and say ""Wooh... what else could he ask for?"" He stares at himself at the mirror and murmur to himself, ""I hate my big eyes... I wonder why my friends won't talk to me... I hope mom and dad would still work things out."" Isn't it funny? We look at other people, envy them for looking so outrageously perfect and wish we could trade places with them, while they look at us and thinks of the same thing. We are insecure of other people who themselves are insecure of us. We suffer from low self-esteem, lack of self-confidence and lose hope in self improvement because we are enveloped in quiet desperation. Sometimes, you notice that you have an irritating habit like biting off your finger nails, having a foul mouth, and you - of all people, is the last to know. I have a friend who never gets tired of talking. And in most conversations, she is the only one who seems to be interested in the things she has to say. So all of our other friends tend to avoid the circles whenever she's around, and she doesn't notices how badly she became socially handicapped - gradually affecting the people in her environment. One key to self improvement is to LISTEN and TALK to a trusted friend. Find someone who you find comfort in opening up with even the most gentle topics you want to discuss. Ask questions like ""do you think I am ill-mannered?"", ""Do I always sound so argumentative?"", ""Do I talk too loud?"", ""Does my breath smell?"", ""Do I ever bore you when were together?"". If you ask questions, in this way, the other person will know that you are interested in the process of self improvement. Lend her your ears for comments and criticisms and don't give her answers like ""Don't exaggerate! That's just the way I am!"" Open up your mind and heart as well. And in return, you may want to help your friend with constructive criticism that will also help her improve her self. One of Whitney Houston's songs says ""Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all."" True enough. In order to love others, you must love yourself too. Remember, you cannot give what you do not have. Before telling other people some ways on how to improve themselves, let them see that you yourself is a representation and a product of self improvement. Self improvement makes us better people, we then inspire other people, and then the rest of the world will follow. Stop thinking of yourselves as second-rate beings. Forget the repetitive thought of ""If only I was richer... if only I was thinner"" and so on. Accepting your true self is the first step to self improvement. We need to stop comparing ourselves to others only to find out at the end that we've got 10 more reasons to envy them. We all have our insecurities. Nobody is perfect. We always wish we had better things, better features, better body parts, etc. But life need not to be perfect for people to be happy about themselves.Self improvement and loving yourself is not a matter of shouting to the whole world that you are perfect and you are the best. It's the virtue of acceptance and contentment. When we begin to improve ourselves, we then begin to feel contented and happy."

People experiment with drugs for all sorts of reasons. Many first try drugs out of inquisitiveness, to have a good time, because friends are doing it, or in an effort to improve athletic performance or ease another problem, such as stress, anxiety, or depression. Use does not automatically lead to abuse, and there is no specific level at which drug use moves from casual to problematic. It varies by individual.

Drug abuse and addiction have negative consequences for individuals and for society. Estimates of the total overall costs of substance abuse in the United States, including productivity and health- and crime-related costs, exceed $600 billion annually. This includes approximately $193 billion for illicit drugs,1 $193 billion for tobacco,2 and $235 billion for alcohol.3 As staggering as these numbers are, they do not fully describe the breadth of destructive public health and safety implications of drug abuse and addiction, such as family disintegration, loss of employment, failure in school, domestic violence, and child abuse. Fortunately, treatments are available to help people counter addiction's powerful disruptive effects. Research shows that combining addiction treatment medications with behavioral therapy is the best way to ensure success for most patients. Treatment approaches that are tailored to each patient's drug abuse patterns and any co-occurring medical, psychiatric, and social problems can lead to sustained recovery and a life without drug abuse. Similar to other chronic, relapsing diseases, such as diabetes, asthma, or heart disease, drug addiction can be managed successfully. And as with other chronic diseases, it is not uncommon for a person to relapse and begin abusing drugs again. Relapse, however, does not signal treatment failure-rather, it indicates that treatment should be reinstated or adjusted or that an alternative treatment is needed to help the individual regain control and recover. If you think that someone you love is addicted to drugs, it's important that you handle the situation carefully. It's common to be afraid to approach you loved one about drug use, because you don't know how he or she will react. However, the important thing is finding the substance abuse help he or she needs. Before you talk to your loved one about treatment options, you need to approach him or her about the drug problem. It's important that you don't confront a drug abuser in a way that will cause an argument. Drug abusers tend to get angry easily, so you need to approach the situation with care."

19,More States Than Ever Before Are Supporting Solar Energy,news-society," The popularity of solar energy increases every year. Here are 4 reasons why more and more individuals are relying on it. Renewable energy is virtually air pollution cost-free The amount of air pollution produced by solar panels is significantly less than the amount of contamination produced by other power sources. For example, nowadays carbon dioxide is among the most talked about atmospheric pollutants. Even though co2 is a natural part of the environment, in recent years, we as individuals have actually started to confuse the world's eco system to the point where co2 has actually begun to reach dangerous levels. We introduce co2 into the environment in many ways, however one of the main methods is via burning woods or fossil fuels for heating. Solar panels do not emit co2 and when we change conventional energy sources such as wood or fossil fuels with solar panels, we lower the amount of carbon dioxide that we introduce into the atmosphere. Solar power conserves you money You will pay even more to get and install a solar panel system for your residence than you will for the more traditional heating kinds of equipment such as radiators, hot water heaters, gas heaters, oil heaters, and so forth. The landscape is swiftly being modified, nonetheless, as brand-new breakthroughs in solar panel modern technology and manufacturing strategies, not just make them less expensive to make but additionally increases their kilowatt output effectiveness. Just what this indicates is that also though the preliminary upfront financial investment expenses might be greater for solar panels, the long term payback in energy conserving will certainly be more outstanding and occur at a quicker rate than ever previously. If you want to free yourself from the spiraling expenses of oil and gas, now may well be the right time to take a new look at the solar modern technologies readily available in your city and state. Tax credits target towards solar energy helps to save you more money In a mainly unknown occasion, in 2005 the United States congress passed the Energy Policy Act. This act offers for a thirty percent tax credit to any type of home that purchases residential solar water heating, photovoltaic equipment, or fuel cell parts. The law has because been extended to the end of 2008 and will potentially be extended again. In addition, many states offer their own tax credits to home owners and companies. Massachusetts, for instance, offers tax motivations to people and companies that install sustainable energy systems at their homes or workplaces. The state of Oregon's Company Tax Credit, under specific conditions, covers up to 50 % of the solar system expense. More states are climbing up on the renewable energy bandwagon every year so it's definitely worth your while to not only take advantage of the government tax credits however also check if there are state or local tax credits available to you also. Solar energy panels need incredibly little repair As a rule, solar panels do not have as many moving parts as a lot of traditional energy devices. Therefore, there is a lot less that can go wrong. Normally, once a year you'll have to do an aesthetic evaluation, however for the most part, presuming that you've bought quality panels, once the solar panels are in location, there's not much you need to do to maintain them - quotes range to less than 20 hours a year. It's been a long road getting here, but finally solar power is finally coming into its own. And not a moment too soon, since we can not afford the energy sources of the last century."
20,The United States or Just America,news-society," Does the United States actually exist as the country we once knew, or is this nation really just some sort of transitional nation which is or will be called America? The concept of our founding fathers, obviously, was to create a Constitutional Republic where men could pursue their dreams and live a life free from the twisted whims of tyrants. Of course, as we all know, nothing man-made lasts forever and it appears that dream is either dead or dying and at a rapid pace. I believe what we now have, is exactly what the framers fought to rid themselves of, a dictatorship run by petty demagogues in a so-called foreign nation which is now just called America. So just exactly what has transpired to foster this atmosphere, which has festered over time into this seamy dictatorship that would make King George proud? One factor is undoubtedly the misguided belief that the U.S. Constitution is a ‘living Constitution’ which evolves over time. According to David A. Strauss, ""A living Constitution is one that evolves, changes over time, and adapts to new circumstances, without being formally amended."" Mr. Strauss explains some of the pros with regard to a living Constitution such as, ""The cumbersome amendment process, the world has changed in incalculable ways, the nation has grown in territory and population, technology, the international situation, the economy and social mores,"" are all different today. But he also touches on the cons, ""The Constitution is supposed to be a rock-solid foundation, our basic principals-our constitutional principles-must remain constant, and the term…is hardly ever used, except derisively."" So, although time moves on and the nation and the world changes, should the U.S. Constitution change? I believe the Law of the Land is just that and it shouldn’t be surreptitiously altered, by public opinion, a liberal or conservative agenda, or the whims of anyone, especially politicians. I believe a cumbersome amendment process is a good thing; it keeps politicians and judges from forcing their opinions and their laws down our throats just because they are in office or on the bench. However, that rock-solid foundation appears to be more like quick sand than anything else. Obama care is actually a good example of why a living constitution is a bad idea. Whether we need some sort of overhaul regarding our health system or not, is a matter that should be up to the States. Yet, somehow this immediately went to the Supreme Court to decide. In essence, doesn’t that remove State sovereignty? The University of Alabama Law Review states, ""A problem for our time is that we cannot help knowing that our highest courts are not merely enforcing rules…We know too well that they often shape the rules… according to their own preferences to assist one rival interest or another."" (p. 4 of 68) Something tells me if Judges are supposed to be impartial referees, their own preferences should have absolutely nothing to do with enforcing rules. The Alabama Law Review goes on to state, ""Justices sitting on the Supreme Court…have by the terms of their certiorari rule almost completely disowned responsibility for assuring that individuals’ legal rights and duties are actually enforced by lower courts in individual cases. They seldom bother to decide a case unless it has impact on some public interest…It decides only those cases which provide a suitable occasion for expressing policies the Justices choose to express."" (p. 5 of 68) So it would appear that the Supreme Court has, in effect, become an activist for political cause within the U.S. government. How is it possible to be an activist and impartial at the same time? Rather than allowing the States to decide an issue which is inherently an issue for the people of each sovereign State, the Supreme Court has decided that for us all; the Supreme Courts usurpation of the rights of each and every sovereign individual as well as each and every sovereign State is apparent. If the U.S. government wishes to make a nationwide health care system, shouldn’t they actually be required to go through the extremely cumbersome amendment process in order to make that law? As far as I can tell, a national law, such as Obama care, is much like an amendment to the Constitution as it becomes (part of) the Law of the Land. As sovereign individuals, which is a status guaranteed to each of us in the U.S. Constitution through Republicanism, we cannot simply step away from this edict, because the self-serving type of politician which has decreed a national health care system, is the same type of politician which has decreed we are no longer a Republic, but a democracy where we are governed by force. This is the malevolent effect of a living Constitution. Lobbyists and PAC’s are another form of decimation to the U.S. Constitution, which gives the extremely wealthy organizations who can simply pay for votes to achieve their goal. I’m certain Machiavelli would be proud of our politicians, after all, to these types of people, the end justifies the means. However, if you stop to consider the Republic of the United States is not supposed to be a Machiavellian society where the Prince rules over the people with an iron fist, then there must be a problem. What we now have, like it or not, is a nation which is sold to the highest bidder. This comes in the form of the special interest group. Among these advocacy groups you will find according to Dr. Kathi Carlisle, ""The AFL/CIO, Amnesty International USA, the Arab American Institute, the Business-Industry Political Action Committee, Campaign for United Nations Reform (or Citizens for Global Solutions), Communist Party USA, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the Feminist Majority, Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders (GLAD), the John Birch Society, Muslim Public Affairs Council, United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, the Socialist Party USA"" and many more. In essence, these groups attempt to influence the way which elected officials vote, which basically puts the politician in someone’s pocket. These groups also attempt to steer the country in one direction or another with no legal basis for their actions. Governance paid for by pressure groups is governance by force, not freedom. Another factor which I believe erodes our Constitution and the status of our nation are agreements such as NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement), OAS (Organization of American States) and GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), which is now called the WTO (World Trade Organization), and are all undoubtedly beholden to The World Bank. Organizations such as these can only tend to move jobs and money out of the United States to others around the globe and leave us here, in the United States, in a position of poverty and servitude. We no longer have a manufacturing base of well paying jobs, we are stuck buying substandard products which are intended to break and be thrown on the junk heap as well as further the misguided notion that we are the world’s policemen. All of this has been done at the cost of our bank accounts and our sovereignty. While Americans are and have always been a people who are extremely generous, that generosity needs to come directly through the people as we see fit, not as the government sees fit. Organizations such as these, especially when given the blessings of our so-called leaders, can only chip away at our individual, State and national sovereignty. I believe this is, in part, the New World Order. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, ""Many economists agree that NAFTA has had some positive impact on overall U.S. employment. But most also agree that gains have been accompanied by some painful side effects."" According to Edward Alden, ""Wages haven’t kept pace with labor productivity and that income inequality has risen in recent years."" Opponents of NAFTA such as the Economic Policy Institute state, ""The deal’s trade agenda has served to widen U.S. trade deficits and has indirectly pushed some U.S. workers into lower-paying jobs."" I don’t know about you, but I personally don’t like the idea of ‘painful side effects’ or ‘lower-paying jobs’ for Americans. According to RT Question More, ""The US government’s official unemployment rate, now at 8.3 percent, only takes into consideration those who have no jobs and are looking for work…this is called a ""U-3"" rate…The national U-6 rate is 15.3 percent, but some states have a shockingly higher individual rate."" Somehow, I just cannot fathom how these so-called economic blocs are good for either U.S. workers or our economy. But with such a high unemployment rate, the U.S. government still thinks we should allow others to come and take our jobs away from us. I defy anyone to prove to me that politicians in the U.S. aren’t crooks. In a report by Erika Lovley on 6 November 2009, ""Two-hundred-and-thirty-seven members of Congress are millionaires. That’s 44 percent of the body – compared to about 1 percent of Americans overall."" Keep in mind that was nearly 3 years ago, so the figure is undoubtedly higher today. Yet these individuals believe they know what is best for the people of the United States. I believe other factors which further this agenda are a perverted immigration policy, the Department of Homeland Security, FEMA and even TSA. If we look at our immigration policy, the word amnesty is used far too often. The Washington Post reports, ""Under the new policy, as many as 1.4 million undocumented immigrants under age 30 will be able to apply for the amnesty."" It appears the Federal government doesn’t have a problem with the 1.4 million ‘undocumented immigrants,’ which is a really a euphemism for people who broke U.S. law by entering the United States illegally, and their families. If 1.4 million are eligible, how many others are there who are also here breaking our laws? Apparently, the Department of Homeland Security (the name itself smacks of Soviet style language) doesn’t see this as a threat to our sovereignty. But I have to wonder why? Isn’t it their duty to protect the ‘Homeland’ against invasion? If it isn’t, then why have they ordered 450 million rounds of ammunition from ATK? If it isn’t to keep illegal invasion from happening, perhaps it’s for some other diabolical reason. We already know all too well what FEMA’s position is with regard to Americans. During Hurricane Katrina, they stood by and did nothing while Americans died and lived in squalor in New Orleans and many still do. In a PBS NEWSHOUR report, Senator Lieberman stated, ""But government failures…allowed much more human suffering and property destruction to occur than should have."" Louisiana Governor Blanco’s press secretary stated, ""We wanted helicopters, food and water. They wanted to negotiate an organizational chart."" How pathetic is that? It wouldn’t surprise me one bit if FEMA, which was incorporated into the Department of Homeland Security in 2003, was in league with the rest of the Federal government in an attempt to assist in the formation of a new North American Union, made up of Canada, the US and Mexico, after all, they are doing quite a good job of turning the United States into a Third World Nation. In a report by Jerome Corsi on 19 May 2006 he stated, ""Secretly, the Bush administration is pursuing a policy to expand NAFTA politically, setting the stage for a North American Union designed to encompass the U.S., Canada, and Mexico."" The report goes on to state, ""President Bush intends to abrogate U.S. sovereignty to the North American Union."" The report concludes, ""His secret agenda is to dissolve the United States of America into the North American Union. The administration has no intent to secure the border, or to enforce rigorously existing immigration laws. Securing our border with Mexico is evidently one of the jobs President Bush just won’t do."" As previously stated, it appears President Obama is on board with this same idea. He also refuses to secure the border with Mexico, he refuses to enforce existing immigration laws, and neither the Bush nor the Obama administrations are friends of the sovereignty of United States of America. Quite frankly, I believe this goes back even further. Something tells me George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barak Hussein Obama are all cut from the exact same piece of cloth. Plots such as these do not hatch themselves overnight, but take decades to form and implement. Could this lead to a complete loss of our rights guaranteed to us under the U.S. Constitution? Would the U.S. Constitution even exist under such a system? While it isn’t much of a secret that the United States has been bankrupt by our leaders; our outstanding public debt as of 7 August 2012, according to Ed Hall of brillig.com is, ""$15,918,879,613,227.57."" Would such a ploy by the Federal government con-artists of this former Republic be for such a simple reason as to gain new taxpayers? I can’t believe it would really matter. Without the United States or the U.S. Constitution, we would be nothing more than slaves to our usurpers, who already are nothing more than puppets of their masters, the so-called ‘illuminated ones.’ So just exactly where would the central power then be located? I have no doubt the central power would temporarily be somewhere in North America. I can’t help but imagine some sort of Triune would be set-up. After all, the United States has already proven their affection for Trinities; Nimrod-Semiramis-Tammuz is a good example of that. But undoubtedly, the central power would eventually be shifted, or should I say freely given to the Vatican. All of this is simply a precursor to a One World Government; a New World Order which has been envisioned by certain extremely wealthy families for thousands of years. Before you laugh too hard, perhaps you should take a moment and think about the ramifications of such an idea. Ask yourselves if the Constitution and your rights have been slowly eroded by the U.S. government, extremely wealthy multi-national corporations and banks. It’s funny how they seem to get bailed-out by us, but we get shafted by them. And by them I do mean the government, corporations and the banks. Please prove me wrong. Tell me, are the secrets which are enthusiastically and fastidiously guarded by our so-called leaders for the protection of the nation, which means the people of the United States, or are they kept for the protection of the ruling elite? I submit that these secrets are maintained because the people would most likely revolt if they knew the truth. These deceivers know they can continue to spoon-feed us lies and they know we will accept the continuation of those lies because they are easier to swallow that the truth. Don’t be fooled by the families of those who have prepared for countless millennia for their ‘thousand points of light.’ It’s not the light which they seek, although they call themselves ‘the illuminated ones,’ they seek darkness; war, famine, disease, slavery and death, all in the unholy name of their master who yearns for our wanton obedience to feed his desire for the power to control and destroy. Be assured, these people and their master, seek to enthrall others by any means available, but they prefer to receive this through our free-will. Treachery and deception are a small part of the arsenal from which their cabal ensnares others into taking their mark freely by thoughts and beliefs as well as acts and deeds. Now is the time to wake up! Arise and throw off the chains of mental, physical and spiritual slavery which unknowingly have been fastened around our throats with the sole intent of dragging us down into the depths of the abyss where they reside. It’s never too late to come to our senses and do what’s right and save ourselves and our Republic, the United States of America. God Bless this Great Republic, the United States of America. Brett L.

1,On Sovereignty,news-society," We, the people are the rightful masters of both Congress and the courts, not to overthrow the Constitution, but to overthrow the men who pervert the Constitution. Abraham Lincoln Are we in the United States sovereign individuals? I believe we are according to the U.S. Constitution. The purpose of this treatise is to investigate and expose the principals of not only what it means to be sovereign, but of sovereignty in general and whether the U.S. Constitution actually guarantees the individual sovereign status. This discourse will touch on the differences between republicanism, democracy and the actual make-up of the United States with regard to the U.S. Constitution as well as the beliefs of our founding fathers. What is sovereignty? Black’s Law Dictionary 2nd Ed. defines sovereignty, ""The possession of sovereign power; supreme political authority; paramount control of the constitution and frame of government and its administration; the self-sufficient source of political power, from which all specific political powers are derived."" By definition, sovereignty gives the ownership of power; ultimate political power to determine; preeminent direction over the make-up and structure of not only the government, but the administration of the government as well; the provision for one to supply for his own needs, sans external assistance; and the source of our ability to act with regard to politics. According to 1215.org Lawnotes, ""A republic and a democracy are identical in every aspect except one. In a republic the sovereignty is in each individual person. In a democracy the sovereignty is in the group."" This may seem like a very small distinction, but the difference is great. The individual’s sovereign status cannot be taken by the majority in a republic, with the exception in the U.S. being ""100% of a jury convicts, then the individual loses sovereignty and is subject to group-think as in a democracy."" But, in a democracy, ""The minority only has those privileges granted by the dictatorship of the majority."" A republic is, ""That form of government in which the powers of sovereignty are vested in the people and exercised by the people, either directly, or through representatives chosen by the people, to whom those powers are specially delegated."" A Democracy is, ""That form of government in which the sovereign power resides in and is exercised by the whole body of free citizens directly or indirectly through a system of representation, as distinguished from a monarchy, aristocracy, or oligarchy."" So, ""In a republic the group only has advisory powers; the sovereign individual is free to reject the majority group-think."" Article IV, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution states, ""The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government."" Article VI, Clause 2 states, ""This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof…under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land."" As unequivocally stated in the U.S. Constitution, the sovereign power which is vested in the people through Republicanism is guaranteed by the supreme Law of the Land, the Constitution of the United States. There can be no doubt, our forefathers, believed in the sovereign individual or the U.S. Constitution would clearly state, we the people of the United States are a democracy. Yet nowhere within the U.S. Constitution is the word democracy even mentioned. The Constitution is not an instrument for the government to restrain the people; it is an instrument for the people to restrain government. Patrick Henry Are our Constitution and our sovereignty inviolate? I would argue, by Law, i.e., the U.S. Constitution, and by definition, our possession of sovereign power; the answer is undeniably yes, both are inviolate. But if you look not only at our modern day society, but to some of the founding fathers themselves, it is obvious there is a debate on this issue. Modern day discussions involve such matters as the 2nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court has ""Ruled the 2nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution confers an individual right to possess a firearm for traditionally lawful purposes such as self-defense,"" in District of Columbia v. Heller. In United States v. Cruikshank, the courts view was the 2nd Amendment ""Has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national government."" Of course, one case (D.C. v. Heller) wasn’t for a criminal enterprise, while the other (U.S. v. Cruikshank) was. Yet what is interesting is the wording, ""Has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national government."" But in the case United States v. Miller, Mr. Miller and another person ""Were indicted for transporting an unregistered sawed-off shotgun across state lines in violation of the National Firearms Act of 1934."" Mr. Miller’s argument was, ""That the section of the National Firearms Act regulating the interstate transport of certain firearms violated the Second Amendment."" The U.S. District Court agreed with Mr. Miller, but the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the decision. The reasoning was, ""The absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a [sawed-off] shotgun…has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument."" Obviously, one has the tendency to believe none of the Supreme Court justices at the time, had ever been in the military. I can only believe with regard to Mr. Miller’s case, as well as present day politics, We the People may as well refer to the Supreme Court as Nine Empty Chairs. Unlike the U.S. government’s belief in dictatorship, whether it’s Executive, Legislative, Judicial, Federal, State or Local, I personally believe, as I believe many of the founding fathers of this nation believed, the government needs to be restrained by the people for good reason; they cannot be trusted. Let’s take 12 of the founding fathers of the nation - 6 truly believed in a Republican form of government; Madison, Jefferson, Franklin, Mason, Wilson and Randolph, but 6 truly believed in a Federalist form of government; Washington, Adams, Hamilton, Morris, Sherman and Jay. Which 6 were correct and which 6 weren’t? All 12 men believed in the U.S. Constitution, the Federalists simply believed in a stronger national government while the others believed in more of a Republican form of government where the individual and not the government maintained the most power. Yet to the British, they were all traitors, and none of the founding fathers of this nation believed in an overreaching government or wanted one. The men who fought for Independence risked their lives, families, wealth, property and their positions for Liberty and Freedom. Now we have just the opposite. We live in a country which is governed by force, the people are fed lies, the economy is a joke, our foreign policy is that of murder and our so-called elected officials are what appear to be Satanists who thrive on killing in order to satiate their thirst for blood. Whenever governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of the people, they always attempt to destroy the militia, in order to raise an army upon their ruins. Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts Just exactly what the etymology of sovereign or sovereignty is, is also a matter of debate, which I will not go into. I have no doubt the Supreme Court or any other court in this nation would argue I know nothing, but what I do know for a fact, is the men who wrote the U.S. Constitution, ordained, established and ratified it, for the people. But the Hussein Obama administration and the rest of our self-centered narcissistic leaders have apparently once again proved their love for Liberty, Freedom and the People of the United States by awarding ATK a contract to supply 450,000,000 rounds of hollow point ammunition to the Department of Homeland Security! By all appearances, the U.S. government doesn’t believe in the sovereign individual. James Madison wrote in the Federalist papers No. 37, ""Among the difficulties encountered by the convention, a very important one must have lain in combining the requisite stability and energy in government, with the inviolable attention due to liberty and to the republican form."" In Federalist No. 39, Madison posed the question and gave the answer, ""Whether the general form and aspect of the government be strictly republican. It is evident that no other form would be reconcilable with the genius of the people of America; with the fundamental principles of the Revolution; or with that honorable determination which animates every votary of freedom, to rest all our political experiments on the capacity of mankind for self-government."" The individual citizen is guaranteed a Republican form of government by the U.S. Constitution, so why does the individual who is guaranteed sovereign status by the Law of the Land, the U.S. Constitution, have to seek remedy before the court with regard to his sovereign status? Has the Judicial branch of government violated the very Law which they have taken an Oath to defend, protect and preserve; the U.S. Constitution? The obvious answer is yes, but the Supreme Court with their life-time appointments have, in effect, furtively elevated themselves to what they consider to be the level of Godhead. It is not only his right, but his duty…to find the verdict according to his own best understanding, judgment and conscience, though in direct opposition to the direction of the court. John Adams Has the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution been misconstrued and ill applied by the courts? The true purpose of the 14th Amendment was to ensure a Constitutionally guaranteed right was not abridged, such as States enacting ‘Jim Crow Laws’ which were portrayed as ‘separate but equal’ but were in effect, ‘separate and extremely unequal’ in order to circumvent the 13th Amendment. But isn’t the 14th Amendment which should be viewed as ‘basic fundamental fairness’ viewed as ‘Federal supersedes State instead?’ Federal should only supersede State when the Constitutionally guaranteed right of the sovereign individual has been violated by the State or for example, if by some strange reason the State of North Dakota decided to invade South Dakota or either of the Provinces of Saskatchewan or Manitoba. The Federal role in this is merely to assure the State cannot violate the individual or the U.S. Constitution, the Federal government has no authority to decide how the individual exercises freedom, nor does the State, unless the individual has committed crimes. If you consider the fact that in a Republic it is the guarantee given in the U.S. Constitution, that the individual is sovereign and the State is sovereign, the Federal government cannot take away that guarantee; the tail cannot wag the dog, as the Federal government is nothing more than the tail and We the People, which make up the States, are the dog itself. The hierarchies within the United States are the sovereign individuals, which make the sovereign States, which in turn make up the sovereign Nation. The power and responsibility within a Republic is vested in the People, not the government; who serve only at our pleasure. Picture if you will, a pyramid. The triangular point at the top is the Federal government’s three branches, the middle portion would be the States and the bottom portion would be the People. In a democracy, this would be an accurate depiction of the power structure. But in a Republic, where the People are guaranteed a Republican form of government, where the individuals are sovereign and the States are sovereign, the pyramid must be inverted. The portion or base which is now at the top is the People, the middle portion is the States and the bottom triangular portion is the Federal government. Everything flows down to the State and to the Federal levels through the People. And as the People are the power of the United States, it is our duty to ensure the government, whether State or Federal, are defending, protecting, preserving and furthering the U.S. Constitution which is the Law of the Land or they need to be removed and held accountable for their actions. But the usurpers of the Republic of the United States are the government officials at every level. They have done nothing more than attempt to destroy our Law, the U.S. Constitution, and this has been done in many ways. The manipulation of our monetary policy; a weak dollar, low interest rates, excessive debt, unchecked spending, the surreptitious voiding of the gold standard and the creation of a worthless fiat currency, as well as voodoo economics where the belief that wealth trickles down to the people, when the wealth actually trickles down to the State and Federal governments from the people. The destruction to our Law has also occurred through a very destructive and misguided foreign policy agenda which clearly debilitates our nation’s stature as well as our wealth, and has an appearance not based on anything which has any semblance of peaceful diplomacy. The national policy of the United States is one which appears to be, and is in effect, governance by force. So, are we in the United States sovereign individuals? I believe we are supposed to be, according to the founding fathers of this nation, but in reality, we are slaves to the Federal and State governments. Are we a sovereign nation? Once again, I believe we are supposed to be, according to the founding fathers, but in reality, our so-called leaders are really nothing more than puppets of the Illuminati; the destroyers of men and nations and the proponents of a one-world government or New World Order, where no man is Free and Liberty is non-existent. We must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt. We must make our selection between economy and liberty or profusion and servitude. If we run into such debts as that we must be taxed in our meat, in our drink, in our necessities and comforts, in our labors and in our amusements, for our callings and our creeds...our people…must come to labor sixteen hours in the twenty-four, give earnings of fifteen of these to the government for their debts and daily expenses; and the sixteenth being insufficient to afford us bread, we must live… We have not time to think, no means of calling the mis-managers to account, but be glad to obtain subsistence by hiring ourselves to rivet their chains on the necks of our fellow sufferers.  Our landholders, too...retaining indeed the title and stewardship of estates called theirs, but held really in trust for the treasury, must...be contented with penury, obscurity and exile…private fortunes are destroyed by public as well as by private extravagance. This is the tendency of all human governments. A departure from principle becomes a precedent for a second; that second for a third; and so on, till the bulk of society is reduced to mere automatons of misery, to have no sensibilities left but for sinning and suffering... And the fore horse of this frightful team is public debt. Taxation follows that, and in its train wretchedness and oppression. Thomas Jefferson God Bless the United States of America.

2,The United States and the U.S. Constitution,news-society," The Constitution of the United States is much more than just a piece of paper; it is a document written by God fearing men who believed in Liberty and Justice for all who are citizens of this great nation and their Posterity. While the U.S. Constitution is a guide for ourselves and for those who represent us, the U.S. Constitution is much more; it is the ""law of the land"" and should be viewed as such, as well as considered whenever any of the three branches of government, i.e., Legislative, Executive, or Judicial, enact new laws or perform the duties of their respective offices. I also believe every Citizen of the United States should question themselves with regard to their actions; are we Just, are we promoting the general Welfare, are we striving to ensure Liberty, are our actions helping to form a more perfect Union? These ideals cannot simply be for one, they must be for all, as eloquently stated by our fore-fathers, ""We the People of the United States."" On the 17th day of September in 1787 the U.S. Constitution was Ordained and Established; the U.S. Constitution was ratified in 1788. This document gave us reasonable guidelines by which to govern ourselves in a responsible and civil manner and the delineation of the processes by which we elect government officials, the formation and function of the three separate branches of government and the duties of each within the boundaries of the Constitution of the United States. Article IV, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution also guarantees to each and every State in the Union a ""Republican Form of Government,"" whereby the individuals as well as the States themselves are sovereign. Enough cannot be said about the value and intent of the words within the U.S. Constitution itself. Article II, Section 1, Clause 8 clearly states the President shall, ""Preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."" Article VI, Clause 2 clearly states, ""This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States; shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding."" Article VI, Clause 3 goes on to further state, ""The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution."" Undeniably, the framers of the Constitution of the United States demanded the continued preservation, protection, defense and support of the Constitution in perpetuity for the People of this great nation. There can be no doubt the Constitution of the United States is the Law of the Land. Our leaders are bound by the oaths of their offices to uphold the Constitution of the United States. The U.S. Constitution is a means to promote not only the general Welfare, but to promote an equitable system of governance, through just laws which provide the framework to form a more perfect Union. As stated in Article III, Section 2, Clause 1, ""The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority."" The U.S. Constitution is the conception of an ideal by decent, free thinking men, whose sole purpose was to live a life free of tyranny from those who would oppress us, and to ensure those same ideals existed for their Posterity. The United States of America is, in effect, not only a conglomeration of people, but of ideas as well. Through the supreme Law of the Land, the U.S. Constitution, sovereign citizens of sovereign States, within a sovereign nation act to establish a just and equitable society, where Liberty is unfettered and the government exists to serve the People. While the art of articulation does not elude me, I find myself unable to match what I consider to be a perfect man-made statement of Truth and Wisdom: We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and to our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America. God Bless this Great Republic, the United States of America Brett L. Baker"

5,"The ""Ins and Outs"" of Event Budget Planning",news-society," Creating a budget is one of the most important parts of planning any event.  Experienced professional meeting and event planners know there are budget items that are often overlooked.  Most people sit down and make a list of the big budget items such as location, menu, entertainment and decorating costs.  Some items that are easily forgotten are taxes, gratuities, delivery and set up fees. Professional event planners can help you plan an effective budget and manage actual expenses as the event comes together. One of the first steps to creating an event budget is to make a comprehensive list of everything that will go into the event.  An experienced event planner will be able to add items to the list that may not have been thought about.    For example: • Will the event need signage outside of your venue to direct guests? • Is valet staff required? • Will a podium or rented audio-visual equipment be needed? • Will attendees or honorees receive gifts? • Does the event require permits that would increase the cost? Another helpful tool is to organize event details into logical categories.  You might group them by priority, chronological stages, or the must-haves versus the wish list items.  The venue and catering costs usually are the most significant expense.  A meeting and event planner can help you determine which of the items on your list are truly necessary and what the price ranges might be. Depending on the type of meeting or event, miscellaneous overlooked expenses can add up.  You might factor in the printing cost for invitations, but may forget name badges, programs, tickets, table signage, maps and registration packets.  As you look at the location of the event, consider the possibility of needing additional space or amenities.  Will you need break out or dressing rooms? Do you have any special electrical, internet or phone specifications that might result in extra charges?  The list is endless and potentially dangerous. Relationships with venues and suppliers can provide more accurate cost estimates that allow a realistic budget and can help prioritize budget items.  Event Planners help determine which items could actually be eliminated without negatively affecting an event is priceless. Sticking to the event budget shouldn’t be difficult if all details have been accounted for in the planning process."
6,Recent Rise in Shut Downs of Over-the-Road Truckling Companies Cause For Alarm,news-society," A recent rise in trucking companies cutting corners and ignoring Federal Motor Carrier Transportation Laws could be placing the public at an elevated risk. Recently, the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) have shut down two separate trucking companies for blatantly disregarding the law and safety.   Cutting corners is a bad practice that rises in all businesses when the economy is bad, but this simply is not acceptable when you are talking about companies that put heavy 18 wheelers and other commercial vehicles on the public highways. On March 30, 2012, the FMCSA ordered Utah-based Reliable Transportation Services, Inc. to immediately cease all transportation services.   Reliable Transportation Services, Inc. and the trucking company’s principal, Jay Zachary Barber, were both declared an imminent hazard to public safety.  The shut down order comes after safety investigators found hours-of-service and driver qualification violations that substantially increased the likelihood of serious injury or death to the traveling public.  FMCSA’s investigation revealed that the company was using drivers with suspended or revoked commercial driver’s licenses (CDL) and was not employing any drug or alcohol tests with regards to their drivers. Reliable Transportation was also found to be transporting concealed hazardous material loads without valid federal registration.  Hazardous material loads are highly regulated and require special permits to ensure proper containment and disposal. On April 9, 2012, the FMCSA ordered the shutdown of J&A Transportation.  Several roadside inspections found that the company’s truck drivers had committed multiple hours-of-service, driver and vehicle maintenance violations.  Investigators further found that the trucking company continued to operate without an active US DOT number or valid operating authority, that they were operating vehicles that had serious mechanical defects, and were not regularly inspected and repaired. Hours-of-service violations often refer to drivers either not keeping proper log book records or driving for a longer time than Federal Law allows without taking the appropriate amount of off-duty and/or break time.  Excessive driving hours can lead to truck driver fatigue.  Driver fatigue is a major cause of accidents with regard to over-the-road truck drivers. Vehicle defects can refer to anything from safety devices and signals not working to faulty air-brakes, lights, gages and/or tires.  All of these violations can lead to very serious and catastrophic consequences if permitted to continue. If you see an 18 wheeler on the road that appears to be swerving or having difficulties maintaining a single lane, please contact the local authorities at once."
7,The UK's Compensation Culture Explained,news-society," The so called ‘compensation culture’ of the United Kingdom has been one of the media's favourite topics for sensationalist journalism for the past few years. However, much of it is precisely that. The media has made a point out of creating scapegoats and generally generating a great deal of hype surrounding the compensation culture phenomenon. It's true that car accident claims and whiplash injury compensation claims are clearly on the rise but let's take a look at what is really going on from the view of an insider for an explanation to how the car insurance premiums got so out of control. The phrase compensation culture started getting bandied around in the late 1990s when the introduction of Conditional Fee Arrangements was seen in the UK legal system. This type of legal arrangement is also referred to as the ‘no win no fee’ claim. Because claims brokering companies were able to refer claimants to solicitors and other legal professionals for a referral fee, it wasn't long before people involved in car accidents and other types of personal injury case were being encouraged to start compensation claims. With the increase in the number of claims, it was only a matter of time before a few highly frivolous cases made their way through the courts. This was fuelled by the notoriously elusive nature of whiplash injury diagnosis. Once the media had picked up on a couple of such claims, it wasn't long before they were splashed all over the headlines. Once Great Britain entered into an economic downturn, people had a lot less spare money going round and somebody crashed into while driving, they were all too aware of an easy four to five-figure sum of money which could be made. The brokers, which are also known as claims management companies, are regulated by very strict series of rules in order to stop them from encouraging people to start car accident claims or to contact them using unsolicited means to encourage them to take legal action. However, as word got around that these regulations could be broken without authorities such as the Information Commissioners Office taking legal action, it wasn't long before many companies started trading illegally and cold-calling people to make claims. It was basically a combination of the economic downturn, the elusive nature of whiplash injuries and a lot of media hype which added to the mix which caused the UK's compensation culture to spiral out of control. In spite of what any sensationalist media stories may say, this is the crux of what happened. There is no one party to blame and it’s the result of a series of badly timed circumstances. With pending changes to personal injury law due to be put in place by the UK government in April, it looks like some positive changes towards stopping the compensation culture may soon be seen. However, even with these changes, there are no guarantees that this will be the end of the story. Until then, citizens of the United Kingdom will have to wait with baited breath to see if their car insurance premiums go back down to the previously acceptable levels."
8,How Does a Wind Turbine Give good benefits and What Does it Decide on To build One specific?,news-society," What is usually a wind turbine created from? What is basically a wind turbine as well as the way does it do the job? What is normally a wind turbine, and also the way does it make electrical ability? What is normally a wind turbine manufactured from? Wind Wind electric turbines crank out electrical power for households and businesses and for promoting to utilities. Wind turbines presently being produced now have electrical power rankings ranging from 250 watts to five megawatts (MW). How to make a wind turbine. Wind vegetation can assortment in measurement from numerous megawatts to hundreds of megawatts in talent. Wind capacity crops are ""modular,"" which suggests they consist of very small personal modules (the turbines) and might possibly rapidly be built higher or much more compact as needed. Wind turbines are fundamentally distinct from fuelled electrical power vegetation within this admire. Electricity Vitality inside wind turns the turbine's blades all close to a rotor. How to make a wind turbine. Power made generally because within your generator following getting transformed by automatic approaches which function is often to alter good high quality of electrical power to needs inside Nationwide Strength Tactic, is delivered to distribution strategies. Air has mass, and when it may very well be in motion, it contains the vitality of that motion (""kinetic potential""). Some portion of that electrical energy can converted into other varieties mechanical generate or electrical energy that we are heading to use to finish obtain the operate completed. BEST RATED Turbine subsystems include: a rotor, or blades, which convert the wind's vitality into rotational shaft electricity; a nacelle (enclosure) containing a crank out educate, generally which involve a gearbox* plus a generator; a tower, to aid the rotor and drive comply with; and digital electronic electric objects for example controls, electrical cables, floor allow instruments, and interconnection gadgets. Turbine Turbine subsystems integrate: a rotor, or blades, which convert the wind's strength into rotational shaft vitality; a nacelle (enclosure) containing a create coach, ordinarily which incorporates a gearbox* in addition as being a generator; a tower, to help the rotor and create educate; and electric electric methods for example controls, electrical cables, floor support devices, and interconnection gear. Turbines are monitored continuously by method of a SCADA (Supervisory Deal with and Info Acquisition) computer software. Turbine and generator operation are continuously monitored by means of a SCADA course of action, and any conditions which may perhaps have an impact on turbine operation are straight apart described once more to some central monitoring facility. Electrical Power Electrical potential from two 660kW wind turbines enhances the exceptional of source inside the surrounding rural electrical grid. Ability vegetation that run on fossil fuel or nuclear power typically have ability attributes of 80-90%. Ability crops emitted seventy% from your sulphur dioxide, 34% of carbon dioxide, 33% of nitrogen oxides, 28% of particulate problem and 23% of poisonous heavy metals released into our nation's all-natural pure natural environment, mostly the air. Strength production depends upon nearby wind, height inside of your turbine and out of doors temperature. How to make a wind turbine. Conclusion By working with your incredibly unique windmill, your personal household can create electrical ability by making use of wind potential and which would consequently diminished your electrical electricity installments Many people now have windmills so effective they are advertising the ability again yet again within the direction of the electric organizations, it can be probable to do this too and make essential $."
9,"Some Myths about Federal Health Care Reform or ""Obamacare.""",news-society," When the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA, aka ACA) became federal law in March of 2010, there were many assumptions about what the law would and would not do. As everyone knows, it has become known simply as ""Obamacare,"" because President Obama was the one who wanted health care reform. Here are some misconceptions about health care reform. One of the first statements made was that the new law was tantamount to ""a government takeover of healthcare."" For this to be true, the government would need to inform every citizen that they were being enrolled in a federal healthcare program, sort of like Medicare, which is a federal health care program for any qualifying citizen or permanent resident over the age of 65. In fact, there is no federal alternative to private health insurance today. Since most if not all health insurance companies that were doing business in 2010 are still insuring millions of policyholders today, it is safe to say that there has not been a government takeover of healthcare.  It is also true however, that many people would like to see that happen. They would love to see Medicare expanded to include everyone; but that is very unlikely for many years to come, if ever. ""Medicare benefits will be reduced."" Actually the opposite has happened. Medicare now covers annual physical exams and colonoscopies in addition to the quite comprehensive benefits they have long provided. It is true that premium costs to Medicare beneficiaries will go up in future years, but medical costs and premiums have been rising steadily for decades, and seniors do use more medical services than people under 65. There will be government ""death panels"" that will make end-of-life decisions for people on Medicare. This idea was borne out of a well-intended provision in the health care bill that would have helped pay for the end-of-life planning discussion cost that the elderly already have with their physicians and caregivers. So a good thing became a bad thing. Now there can be no provisions in Medicare for this benefit which, ironically, hurts seniors and can actually adds to the cost of health care.  Illegal immigrants will now be covered. The ACA specifically prohibits undocumented immigrants from receiving coverage. What is not known is the true long-term cost of this legislation. There are many people on both sides of the argument, time will tell what the real cost will be, and there are many components of this program still to be implemented. The truth about health care is that it is expensive no matter where you are.  Canada, England, France, Switzerland, Italy, China. All of these countries have some form of government provided health care and while it is less expensive per-capita than in the United States, it is expensive nonetheless. The common element of all health care programs is that every citizen or legal permanent resident is covered. The cost of care per person is far lower when everyone is covered. What needs to be understood about health care is that every person at some point will seek it out when they need it. Whether or not they have health insurance is not a factor when there is a need for treatment. If a person cannot afford car insurance they have the option of not driving, and few people drive without car insurance. Not so with health insurance, and the situation is made worse by the fact that uninsured people often ignore minor medical issues because of the cost. Unfortunately those minor medical issues have a way of becoming serious, and that is when the uninsured seek care. And where do they go to get treatment then? The emergency room, which happens to be the most expensive entry point into the entire health care system in the U.S. They go there because federal law prohibits hospitals from turning away anyone during a medical emergency. This is a huge factor in the cost of health insurance, and a major reason why health insurance premiums have risen far in excess of the CPI over the past 30 years. Until that part of the health insurance equation is resolved the cost of insurance will continue to be out of reach for millions of Americans. In summary, the cost of delivering health care in the U.S. is not going to go away as an issue. The debate over the number of uninsured and whether or not they should be covered, public vs. private insurance, and who pays for all of this will go on until our politicians realize that there is no one best solution.  All sides will have to agree that there will always be some elements of a common health care system that not everyone will like.  There are many elements of the Affordable Care Act which work, and those elements need to be preserved.  Many insurers who initially opposed the Act have since re-tooled their benefit and pricing models to reflect the major objectives of the program.  The irony here is that abolishing the ACA would actually increase the cost of coverage as insurers once again had to redesign their policies and coverage.  What is needed most of all is a system that works reasonably well and covers everyone or nearly everyone.  In the long run, the cost of excluding millions of uninsured will cost more than covering them."
10,Wounded service man braves injuries to support Help for Heroes,news-society," Jonathon Le Galloudec has recently climbed to Everest base-camp to raise money for the charity Help for Heroes. This is despite having been shot in the spine during a tour of Basra and told that he would be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. His inspirational story will hopefully encourage others to follow his example. Service men and women endure some tough conditions in their jobs. They have to be at the peak of their physical fitness, survive in hostile environments and remain calm under fire. It seems, however, that this courage is simply part of who they are. Hundreds of military personnel are sadly injured in the line of duty every year, but many of these go to remarkable efforts to recover and raise money for their wounded comrades. One such soldier is Jonathon Le Galloudec, who was ambushed and shot during a tour of Basra in 2007. The bullet struck his spine, partially paralysing him from the waist down, and his friend Corporal Rodney Wilson was killed. Although Jonathon was rescued and taken to a field hospital, his life was in tatters. Despite being told by doctors he would never walk again, Jonathon took his first steps within months and has recently completed an incredible expedition. He climbed to Everest base-camp, over 5,000m above sea level. The journey was a fundraising mission for charity Help for Heroes, which endeavours to support wounded service men and women in the UK. The charity has recently been involved in the development of Personnel Recovery Centres, working alongside other charities to provide facilities which will support service men and women with their injuries, both physical and mental, for life. On his expedition, Jonathon was joined by his father and 26 other fundraisers. They achieved their objective through teamwork and grim determination; Jonathon often wrote of the pain he was in, but refused to give up. This was because he believed in what he was doing. As a wounded serviceman himself, he knows what it is like for those injured in Iraq, Afghanistan and other conflicts. Jonathon may think that he was just ""doing his bit"", but his exploits are truly inspirational."
11,Spanish King Juan Carlos the first  visits Brazil,news-society," In recent months Spain and Brazil have experienced a number of problems affecting their relationship. Strong efforts have been made to try and resolve these difficulties, culminating in the recent visit to Brazil of the Spanish King, Juan Carlos 1. The main purpose of his visit (at least the main one declared and admitted) is to boost two-way economic links between the countries. This has clear implications of course for the billions of that constantly ebb and flow in both long-term and short term investments and commerce (and its potential for growth or shrinkage) between the two Atlantic countries. After all, last year alone mutual trade between Spain and Brazil was the equivalent of over eight billion US dollars. However, and despite this, one of the main areas of dissension between them is the thorny issue of immigration. Both feel this has now got to be treated with the urgency that they feel it merits. Unsurprisingly, given the circumstances, the starting point for last week’s tasks was a declaration of mutual respect by the Spanish and the Brazilians. In addition, the discussion between Juan Carlos and the Brazilian President, Dilma Rousseff had a particularly cordial and constructive tone. This was evident when the two Heads of State conferred about the spate of unfortunate mutual deportations of each other’s citizens that have so soured the recent relations between both nations. After he arrived last week, the Spanish King and his staff also met with Antonio Patriota, the Brazilian Minister of External Relations, as well as Dilma herself. Among the Spanish delegation were also a number of leading business executives. These included those from Santander (the Eurozone’s largest bank) and communications giant Telefonica (which already operates in Brazil under the name Vivo). Also present were representatives from Iberia, the Spanish Airline. All these (and others) are clearly seeking to expand their own financial and commercial interests. Underpinning all this however, this recent set of discussions also focused on concerns about Spain’s current economic woes and the steps involving the EU to try and fix them. Brazil is seeking assurances that the 'right' actions will be taken by all concerned. A side issue is the increasing influx of Spanish workers coming to Brazil in the past months. In the last full year, for example, The Brazilian Ministry of Employment declared that the total of work visas issued to Spaniards went up by over thirty percent compared to the previous year. In contrast, there have been a number of high-profile cases of Brazilians being refused entry or work permission when they sought these from Spain. In most instances, the reasons given hinged on the declined applicants not having the right paperwork. This is suspected by some of possibly being more of an excuse than a reason. Despite these admittedly serious upsets, the economic relationship between the two countries demands that solutions be found. Following these meetings between the two trading partners, both the Spanish and the Brazilians expressed optimism. Subsequent announcements by both the King and the President looked forward to an even better relationship in future."

13,Divorce and Financial Resolutions - Child Maintenance,news-society," Having looked at the issues surrounding the division and distribution of wealth during a divorce, the other financial issue that needs to be resolved, often concurrently during a divorce but also following any separation, is that of child maintenance. As a rule of thumb the parent with whom the child does not spend the bulk of their time will be obliged to pay some level of maintenance to the child’s main carer to help cover the child’s costs of living. Usually, therefore, the payment will be made the child’s the other (resident) parent but it can sometimes involve payments to grandparents or guardians instead where they have taken on the responsibility of being principle carers. The goal of child maintenance is that the principle carer does not have to carry the sole financial burden of the child’s living costs and that that burden is shared equally by both parents regardless of who the child actually lives with for most of their time. It is always advised (except where they may cause a threat to each other’s welfare if in contact) that parents try to reach an agreement as to the levels and structure of payments between them. This cooperation, as with mediation and collaboration processes in divorce disputes, will be more likely to lead to a resolution in which each party has had a good say is therefore happier. The approach can ensure that practical nuances are included in the agreement which benefit all those involved as well as help to foster a sense of collaboration in the relationship between the estranged parents, to the long term benefit of the child. However, it is worth remembering that such agreements are not legally binding and will run purely on good will. As a consequence, parents can have the flexibility to respond to changes in circumstances straight away but there is nothing to prevent the agreement breaking down in the event of a dispute. Where parents need assistance, the government’s Child Support Agency can be called upon to varying degrees. The CSA can act in a simple advisory capacity with its most basic service being a simple calculator that parents can use to determine how much the non-resident parent should pay. For parents that cannot reach an agreement at all the CSA can be called upon to arrange and timetable the repayments, in addition to calculating the amounts to be repaid. What’s more, if there are issues which prevent the parents from being in contact with one another, the CSA can act as a go between to collect the payments on behalf of the resident parent. They can even be used to track down the non-resident parent when their location or contact details aren’t known. Any agreements or arrangements made through the CSA (not including the calculator service) will be legally binding so this route is preferable for parents who need that reassurance. The CSA will look at a number of variables to determine the level of maintenance that should be payable, including how much time the second parent spends with the child, the income of both parents and their situations in regard to state benefits, as well as the number of other children who live with the child in question. There are some circumstances, however, where the CSA cannot be used to enforce a resolution and the only option is to go to court. Scenarios that fall outside of the CSA’s remit and come under court jurisdiction include those where the children involved are the non-resident parent’s step children, the second parent lives overseas, the second parent is a high earner and the carer feels that the child is entitled to more of their wealth than the CSA can award, there are education fees to be covered or the child is disabled and so has further needs. As with the other financial disputes that arise during a divorce, the most effective way to keep costs down, and to ensure that relationships are left as healthy as they can be is to seek personal agreements through methods such as mediation. After all, the less money and emotion that is spent on resolving these disputes, the more that is left to invest in the child’s future, whether it be money in a Junior ISA or a set of more contented parents."
14,The Impact inside Earth broad internet on Contemporary Literature,news-society," Literature essentially is all the points which has previously been posted. Whatever in the earliest poems of Homer, to right now's word wide web pages, is often regarded as literature. But to get a specific feeling, you can find various varieties of literature. Literature might be composed within a particular language, like English Literature or be printed by a distinct culture, which contain African Literature. But literature truly implies a lot more than printed phrases plus the entire world huge web undoubtedly could be a a part of literature. I must remember which the word literature comes about in the French phrase belles-lettres, which signifies ""gorgeous generating"". When a piece of give good results is often known as literature, it can be commonly considered of a great run of high-quality art work. The net literature would not necessarily ought to be by undertaking this on your proven incontrovertible fact that no one controls the web literature. Inside the following essay I'm shifting to talk concerning the impact from your net on literature of these days. You are going to discover two significant courses of literature which could be also present across the world extensive website: fiction and nonfiction. Fiction is crafting that an author creates out of your imagination. Authors could possibly consist of individual practical knowledge, or data about real folks or things to do, but they combine these information with imagined circumstances (Moran, 45). In non-globe-wide-net literature the challenge undergoes a minimum of some type of censorship with regards to what text is often applied, nevertheless the web permits the authors to place almost whatever they require around the word extensive internet site and get pleasure from it. Most fiction is narrative making, for instance novels and shorter tales. Fiction also contains drama and poetry. Nonfiction is factual creating about real-existence conditions. The principal kinds of nonfiction consist of the essay, biography, autobiography, and diary (Browner, 90). The net presents a clean sorts--internet pages, or web publications. Of us look at literature to the assortment of motives. 1 from the most frequent reason for studying is satisfaction. Men and women study to pass the time, or for information and expertise. By suggests of literature, people meet up with up with characters they'll identify with, and generally locate options for their incredibly personal problems. With literature, everyone can typically comprehend circumstances they couldn't in any other case comprehend in correct located (Koehler, 28). Generally, just the arrangement with all the phrases is likely to be fulfilling, just as getting a infant likes the sound of ""Ring Across the Rosie"", though they may perhaps perhaps not totally grasp what the words imply. You'll discover 4 components of literature: characters, plot, theme, and style. An fantastic author has the potential to stability these parts, acquiring a unified operate of art perform. The characters make up the central attention of quite a few dramas and novels, much too as biographies and autobiographies. A writer really should know each and every and every character completely and employ a clear imagined about just about every sole types seem, speak, and strategies. The net literature just isn't difficult for making to the undeniable fact that as opposed to ""typical"" literature the planet vast net literature calls for minimal get started up charges (Moran, 47). And thanks on the simple fact seeking by way of typically consists of convenience, at some degree of time a single would not be stunned to find out handy electric gadgets that could be transported wherever and would get hold of guides from the world wide website and present them in electronic construction. Determination may very well be the explanation for characters actions. A superb writer may be selected that the motives of your character are clear and logical. The net writers usually do not should be this style, they are really actually not controlled plus they hardly unsafe anything at all by publishing on the web. Setting is the area a character's story needs web site. The plot is designed all around a series of routines that need area within just a definite interval. It could be what takes site about the characters. No rules exist to the purchase all through which the occasions are provided. A unified plot capabilities a starting, middle, and an conclusion. In literary phrases, a unified plot contains an exposition, a escalating motion, a climax, and also a denouement, or outcome. The exposition delivers the background and circumstances through the story (Browner, 93). The rising movement builds upon the exposition. It creates suspense, or maybe a reader's generate to ascertain what happens following. The climax will be the highest position of fascination, also a turning level with the story. The denouement can be the conclusion. The theme can be the standard method expressed by a do the job of literature. It develops within the interplay of character and plot. A theme may perhaps incorporate morals, to warn the reader to direct a greater everyday residing or possibly a diverse form of day-to-day residing.  The net literature is not planning to must be by accomplishing this inside minimum merely simply because no one controls it. The have the ability to write choose minimal possibility with regards to funding, yet quite perhaps can locate audience from all over the globe, which might compensate out for that e-e-ebook and obtain it to their very own desktops, may very well be extremely excessive (Moran, 49). A severe author strives to create his give beneficial benefits an straightforward expression of sentiment, or precise emotion. They steer clear of sentimentality, which implies providing too much emphasis to emotion or pretending to seriously come to feel an emotion. A author of sincere emotion will not likely must inform the reader what to contemplate a story. A amazing story will immediate the reader towards the author's conclusion. Sort might be the way a author employs phrases to construct literature. It is usually challenging to love a story's characters or plot with out enjoying the author's sort (Browner, 98). The mannequin of an author is as crucial as what he's trying to say. Place of view, or the way a story is offered, is yet another part of variety. A author may well maybe inform a story within quite initially specific person, doing work with the pronoun I, as if the narrator are already a important or minor character in it. Or, the author may possibly possibly use the third person technique, during which the narrator stands apart within the characters and describes the motion making use of these kinds of pronouns as he and she. You'll be able to discover two sorts of 3rd specific views: confined and omniscient. Inside of the third particular person confined levels of view, the narrator describes the features as observed by a solitary character. In the third man or woman omniscient, or all realizing, location of view, the narrator reports on what a amount of characters are contemplating and sensation. Studying is certainly an intently private artwork function."
15,Who are the Globalists and what is a Globalist,news-society," The Globalist agenda is real and the Globalists themselves are the greatest threat to human civilization. Every day, more and more people are affected in some way, shape or form because of the Globalists and the Globalist agenda. In consideration of the entire Globalist plan, the Globalistideology and other Globalist propaganda, I think it's time to redefine what a Globalist is. The most popular definition of what is a Globalist and who are the Globalists so far is ""the Globalist movement is an alliance based on self-interests of the private international financiers and the royal, dynastic and hereditary land owning families of Britain, Europe and America which over the years have intermarried to create a self regenerating power structure that through lies and deception seeks to control everything and everyone"". Although this definition of who and what is s Globalist is true, I think the definition doesn't go far enough to explain why the Globalists intend to bring forth the new world order, why the Globalists exist and where the Globalists intend the global community to be in 50, 100 and 200 years. It's also an appropriate time to evaluate the standard definition of who are the Globalists as the Globalists have now encroached in almost every country of the world. Up until 30 years ago, the Globalists only had an interest and presence in western countries and a limited number of African and Asian countries. A New Definition of Who Are The Globalists and What Is A Globalist. After much consideration and thought, I would like to propose to the activist, free thinking, and anti-Globalist movements that we define the Globalists as: The Globalists are a conglomerate of individuals, interest groups and large corporations who actively seek to eliminate all countries to create a global border-less society so that they can centralize, reduce and standardize all economies, production and the processing of natural resources so that they can directly control, manipulate and influence the decisions we make to ensure they maintain their power, control, wealth and historical influence. This new definition of who are the Globalists takes a broader view of why they exist and why and for what purpose do they seek to implement their Globalist agenda."
16,The Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant Lie,news-society," It's been over a year now since a massive earth quake hit Japan and caused one of the worst tsunamis on record. The number of reported deaths is around 20,000 and the number of people who are still suffering from this tragic catastrophe is in the millions. A direct result of the earth quake and tsunami was the destruction of the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Unbelievably, the situation at the Fukushima nuclear power plant is unchanged and the environment surrounding the Fukushima nuclear power plant has not improved. The government has been lying to us all about the severity of the situation and is not sharing any information to domestic and global communities. With the assistance of intense political pressure and demands of the global community to know what is happening at the Fukushima nuclear power plant, the government of Japan has been forced to reveal the severity of the Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster. In a recent probe of one of the nuclear reactors that is still accessible, it was found that the levels of radiation are so high that it would result in almost instant death if anyone entered the area unprotected. The level of radiation found within the reactor was reportd at 70 seiverts an hour. Radiation at 70 seiverts an hour could kill an adult within 6 minutes and would you believe the levels of radiation were unbelievably 10 times higher than experts had been hoping. The latest investigation into the Fukushima nuclear power plant also reveals that the other two reactors that were not accessible are in even worse shape. Irrespective of where you live in the world, the radiation from the Fukushima nuclear power plant is affecting you. It has been reported that the radiation from the Fukushima nuclear power plant is impacting people living within a 250 kilometre radius of the toxic site. In fact, the area within the Fukushima nuclear power plant is so toxic and so dangerous; the government of Japan has announced that they are going to have to develop a new type of protection so that anyone can access the site. So what can the people of Japan and those who live near the Fukushima nuclear power plant expect as a direct result of the Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster? Well, the experts and the government won't tell anyone anything. However, from what we can see from the awful nuclear disaster in Chernobyl, it was concluded that around 60% of children experienced thyroid cancer, 10% of children experienced mental disorders and many children have a genetic disorders. It would be fair to conclude that this is what the residents who surround the Fukushima nuclear power plant can expect. I again pose the question, why is the government keeping quiet and why is the government not communicating this information? The tragic events of the Fukushima nuclear power plant prove two important things. The first is that we can't control the environment and sometimes mother nature serves us a curve ball that we cannot avoid. Secondly, whenever a community is challenged with a disaster, the government will lie to us all and will never make public the severity of the disaster."
17,Derrick Bell:  His Literary Legacy,news-society," Civil Rights Attorney And Law Professor Rediscovered In March 2012, five months after he passed away, Derrick Bell became the target of conservative media, in particular Breitbart.com and Sean Hannity, in an slap against President Barack Obama.  After the footage of a young Barack Obama hugging Professor Bell at a Harvard Law School student demonstration was shown on all the television news shows, the ""scandal"" waned as not much of a news story.  Paradoxically, this lame slap against Barack obama has given us a chance to learn more about the late civil rights activist, legal academic and respected author Derrick Bell. Critical Race Theory The majority of people who heard the reports of Derrick Bell's death probably had little acquaintance with his idealistic career as a lawyer and law professor or his importance as one of the architects of critical race theory. The Critical Race Theory (CRT) is a field of study focused upon the application of critical theory, a neo-Marxist examination and review of culture and society, to the intersection of race, power, and law.  According to CRT racism is inherent in the system and fabric of the American society. Bell continued writing about Critical Race Theory after accepting a teaching position at Harvard University in 1969.  Writing in a narrative mode, Bell contributed to the intellectual discussions on race.  According to Bell, his intention in writing was to analyze the racial issues within the context of their political, social, and economic dimensions from a legal standpoint. Embracing the Narrative Much of Professor Bell’s scholarship discarded dry legal analysis in favor of stories.  In books and law review articles, he presented parables and allegories about race relations, then argued their meaning with a fictional alter ego, a professor named Geneva Crenshaw, who compelled him to address the truth about racial bias in America. Scholarship Bell is probably the most significant source of thought critical of traditional civil rights discourse.  He used three major arguments in his analyses of racial patterns in American law:  constitutional contradiction, the interest convergence principle, and the price of racial remedies.  His book Race, Racism and American Law, now in its sixth edition, has been continually in print since 1973 and is regarded as a classic in the field. Noteworthy Writings of Derrick Bell Race, Racism and American Law Published in 1973 by Little Brown: This is Bell’s milestone work in the study of race, racism and civil rights law in the United States.  This was the first judicial decisions book devoted to race and racism in relation to the American law.  It has been part of law school curricula for almost four decades and is currently in its sixth edition. And We Are Not Saved:  The Elusive Quest for Racial Justice Published in 1987 by Basic Books: Bell initially wrote And We Are Not Saved as a foreword to a 1985 publication of the Harvard Law Review on the Supreme Court.  In this expanded adaptation, professor Bell stated that although racial equality has been legally confirmed, economic equality after initial gains is retrogressing despite affirmative action.  He recommended the formation of a alliance of disadvantaged blacks and whites, urging that entitlement standards include class as well as racial disadvantage. Faces At The Bottom Of The Well:  The Permanence Of Racism Published in 1992 by Basic Books: This group of essays discussed the problem of racism in America and the class differences involved in discrimination against minorities.  In this book, Bell discussed the civil rights movement in American society, and determined that racism is everlasting, and will forever be part of society. Confronting Authority:  Reflections of an Ardent Protester Published in 1996 by Beacon Press: Derrick Bell wrote this book three years after sacrificing his tenure at Havard Law School.  Bell provided a detailed account of the events that led him to give up his position as a Harvard Law School professor to protest the school's never having granted tenure to a minority woman. Gospel Choirs:  Psalms of Survival in an Alien Land Called Home Published in 1997 by Basic Books: Gospel Choirs is the third in a series of essays and parables by Derrick Bell that shed light on probably the most perplexing challenges of our day--racism.  Bell merged dialogues and dreams through his own voice and that of the fictional civil rights lawyer of the 1960s, Geneva Crenshaw,.  Not to mention, it's not just racism that Bell pondered.  Some of the writings challenge African-Americans' attitudes toward sexuality and sexism. Ethical Ambition:  Living a Life of Meaning and Worth Published in 2002 by Bloomsbury USA: In Ethical Ambition, Bell produced good insight into an individual's quest to live by the highest of personal ideals and standards.  Bell analyzed his struggle to meet what he termed an ethical standard.  He confessed that an obsession with ambition, even in an altruistic sense, may violate the ethical obligations owed to family.  He considered the conflicts of issues in his own religious traditions that he negotiated to reach a higher spiritual awareness frequently lost in traditional religions.  Bell also cited cases of well known ethically principled individuals--W. E. B. DuBois and Martin L. King Jr., among others--who often strove for higher ethical standards, single-handedly and at great personal cost. Silent Covenants:  Brown v. Board of Education and the Unfulfilled Hopes for Racial Reform Published in 2005 by Oxford University Press: In Silent Covenants, Bell critiqued the function and constraint of the landmark Brown decision.  He asserted that he, like many of his colleagues, confused the means of integration with the objectives of superb education and racial equality.  To analyze racial reforms, he created a theory of converging interests into one of racial fortuity.  In other words, when the interests of African-Americans converge with the interests of whites, African-Americans are more likely to have their needs addressed; otherwise they are not.  Bell admonished blacks to not abandon their real interests even when they do not converge with the majority, and certainly prime among those interests is the educational advancement of black children. Conclusion Whether you see Derrick Bell as a raving racist or a distinguished intellectual, introducing his books to your non-fiction bookshelf would be a sensible step.  In 1971 Derrick Bell became the first black tenured professor in the history of Harvard Law School.  That marked a significant critical point in his life.  Two years later he wrote his seminal opus, Race, Racism and American Law, thus starting his career as one of America’s most important theorists."
18,The Unsung Heroes of every time,news-society," The future foundation of our society’ was how one bearded Irishman put it in his rant on Wall Street via a now-famous YouTube video. He was not, of course referring, to the Wall Street bankers, but to teachers. This is my own rant, aimed at systems of human beings that have come to the decision that public school teachers could be deemed expendable. I simply cannot see how one can justify a layoff of one public school teacher in a developed economy where the same cost-cutting measures could be spread across many of the different sectors in that economy. No, I’m not going to name the different public schools in the United States that have become prey to the downsizing effect simply because the United States is the easiest country to point a figure at. That’s only the case because of the vast amount of media reports publicizing these layoffs are only so expediently available at the click of your mouse. Let me make this clear. This is NOT an attack on the American/Western way of governing. This isn’t a critique of the American system of governing. Why? Because this isn’t an American issue – at least not exclusively. THIS IS A HUMANISTIC ISSUE, a problem for humanity as a collective to solve, because these layoffs are not happening in one place at a certain point in time. Every job in an economy is important – every job contributes to a state’s welfare. Some, however, are more important than others. There’s absolutely no shame in that. But please try to persuade yourself that academia doesn’t fit in the all-star category. Think of it. Every single aspect of human development – at least those that us human beings have control over – has come through the efforts of academics. From the language you’re reading this article in (hopefully this reads English to you), to the language of writing you would choose to criticize this article; from the logic of reasoning your mathematics teacher instilled in you growing up, to the study of your religion (the list goes on and on). How can one dismiss the fact that this cornerstone of our society can be sacrificed for anything else? It is with this sacrifice, of course, that the teacher gets caught in the crossfire. Leave politics aside for a minute; leave the fact that the man or the committee on the chair(s) has to take hard, sometimes unthinkable decisions. Leave the economic mess that we’re in, with no clear sight as to when this freaking nightmare will end. Have we, as a humane society, dropped down to this? Foregoing the enhancement of our children’s’ education and why? Because someone thought ‘Well hey, we tried different suppliers, we tried getting the municipality to reduce our leasing fees, we tried working with the school board on this, we tried everything. There’s just no other way, WE GOTTA LET YOU GO.’ If an economy’s most important resource is education, as many (including yours truly) believe, how can we layoff a single bearer of academia? How can we accept one public school teacher – who also needs his half-decent pay-scale to put his own kids through school- to be downsized? For those of you too immersed in popular culture to research for yourself, I would recommend watching season 4 David Simon’s The Wire, which deals with the harsh, realistic conditions in which public schools have to contend with in Baltimore, Maryland. For a more idealized reference, look for a debate on Aaron Sorkin’s The West Wing. Season 1, Episode 18: Six Meetings Before Lunch. Rob Lowe’s character Sam Seaborn gives this excerpt, which I will close this article with. ""Education is the silver bullet, education is everything. We don’t need little changes; we need gigantic, monumental changes. Schools should be palaces. The competition for the best teachers should be fierce. They should be making six-figure salaries. Schools should be incredibly expensive for governments and absolutely free of charge to its citizens, just like national defense. That’s my position…I just haven’t figured out how to do it yet."" http://www.weird-strange-facts.com"

1,2011: An Economic Highlight Reel,news-society," There are no slow years when it comes to the world economy. When dealing with such a fluid, dynamic phenomenon there are always bound to be talking points over the course of a year. True to form, 2011 was no different, with more than its fair share of highlights (and lowlights) both here and abroad. From the global share market, to activities within the US and Europe, and of course the rugby world cup, there was scarcely a dull moment all year. Share Market Activity Things certainly got off to a bang in the US, with widespread drops causing acute economic concern around the start of the year. This soon mellowed though, and the market eventually returned to equilibrium later in the year. Though it made no overall gain, it more importantly avoided taking on a sustainable loss. Over on our shores in New Zealand, business was quiet overall, but a handful of our biggest firms had remarkably productive years. Auckland Airport, Mainfreight, and Port of Tauranga all made gains of approximately 20, 30 and 38 percent respectively. Investors that stuck by the mainstay companies of the New Zealand stock exchange, were rewarded for their loyalty in kind. Trouble Afoot In Europe Though the all out doomsday predictions for the European economy proved inaccurate, that doesn't mean 2011 was a great year overall. The European economy is closer than ever to going backwards in its economic growth. Now they have another year to fight against defaulting or the collapse of the central currency in general. The US Stays Largely on the Sidelines What was most interesting about the US economy this year, at least from a governmental perspective, was that they were content to get little done. The now infamous credit rating downgrade was born of far too much in-fighting, which led to indecision and blame sharing. Housing prices remained on a slide and the US generally confirmed its own economic fallibility by not jumping to action sooner. The All Blacks Won the World Cup This is hardly an economic event all on its own, but must be included in any 2011 round up. The world cup was expected to be a significant economic boost to New Zealand. Though it was far milder than previously predicted, the excitement of lifting the cup helped to distract from economic turmoil elsewhere. Some would say it also had a positive flow on effect for National in term of helping galvanise support for them ahead of the election. It's been a year of ups and downs - now to see what 2012 will bring!"
2,2012: An Economic Outlook,news-society," No economist claims to being right all the time, but if you can be on the money over half of the time then you are doing remarkably well. Bearing in mind that predicting global economic movement is like predicting the weather using your intuition, here are some predictions for 2012, organised into four broad categories. The Global Share Market Simply put, things are looking up. This goes for both here in New Zealand, and especially in the United States. The continued financial backing of strong local companies here should see the market push through any barriers to growth, with a moderate rise of about 5% a likely figure. The United States can expect to turn things around in quite a big way this coming financial year. After a turbulent 2011, which eventually settled about where it started, this coming year should see about a 10% growth rate in the overall market. Why? The big reason is that it's an election year, in which the market has almost always taken an upswing. As they say, the best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour, so watch this space for some tidy gains in the market. Interest Rates Interest rates in 2012 can be summed up in three words; low, low, low. Borrowers will find themselves much better off, with the Official Cash Rate set to climb no higher than about 3%. This is not such great news for anyone who has stashed away large amounts of savings, but appears to be an inevitable outcome in the current economic climate. Inflation On a similar note, look for inflation to ease off comfortably back into the 1-3% range set as a target for the New Zealand economy to operate in. This in turn affects interest rates, and supports a low Official Cash Rate. In a tangible sense though, the things we need will probably continue to cost more (especially food) and will only be offset by drops in the price of luxury items (such as electronic equipment). Global Politics With the political landscape in New Zealand recently set for another three years, look to the election coverage in the United States, and Europe's continued economic woes to dominate the headlines. Despite flailing approval ratings and unemployment at a high level, Obama should still have enough to hold onto his seat in the White House. This could be down to a desire not to disrupt recent improvements in the US economy, or simply because the Republican Party rarely put up their best candidates to challenge an incumbent president (making for a weaker field). The Eurozone will continue to struggle, but it is unlikely to reach the point where they will have to go their separate ways. The cost of doing so is simply too high, and even with the European economy in the shape that it is now; this would be a disproportionate reaction. We're all set for an interesting year, and the world will certainly be watching as the months unfold."
3,All Information about the Funeral procession,news-society," A funeral procession is basically a procession taken out in motor vehicles, from a church or mosque to the cemetery. The deceased is transported in a vehicle specially meant for the purpose, while the family members and friends follow in their vehicles.

5,The models that were used in the formation of the United States Supreme Court,news-society," English history, American colonial experience in the operation of the national government under articles of Confederation provide the background to the United States Supreme Court authorized by article 3 of the Federal Constitution.  By the time there was an English colonisation of North America, there were three common-law courts with the Court of Common pleas, Kings bench and the Exchequer.  The first exercised general civil jurisdiction, the second was a criminal trial court with certain appellate authority on the third originated as a revenue collection agency but later determined controversies to which the crown was a party. These four courts formed the basis of a colonial court systems and variations between colonial systems resulted from assigning jurisdiction courts of a different name or combining types of jurisdiction within one or more courts. After 1686 the number of colonies adopted the jurisdictional pattern established by Sir Edwin and Ross for the Dominion of New England. This placed the jurisdiction, and common pleas, the King's bench and the Exchequer into a single common-law court usually called the Supreme Court judicature or the Supreme Judicial Court.  In Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and some other jurisdictions the functions of the Chancery Court were performed by the common law courts but it was usually the case that chancery powers are exercised by separate chance records and in most cases composed of a colonial governor and members of his council. American colonial legal system is driven heavily upon the English court system to their concepts of jurisdiction but they also tended to combine types of jurisdiction that are historical reasons remain separate in England. The Supreme Court of the United States, exercising both common-law and equity jurisdiction represents a continuance of this American trend. Separate from the English common law and chance records was a High Court of Admiralty established around 1360 which decided civil disputes that occurred on the high seas and punish crimes and piracy and in time of war exercised prize jurisdiction necessary to award an enemy vessel and its cargo to the capturing crew.  American colonial Admiralty Courts formally established around 1696 perform these functions under the appellate control of English High Court of Admiralty.  In this way, the antecedents for the United States Supreme Court were laid."
6,Is the federal government well prepared to set up insurance exchanges?,news-society," It is common knowledge that many U.S. states are unwilling to launch their health insurance exchanges until the Supreme Court gives its final ruling on the constitutionality of Affordable Care Act of 2010 and its individual mandate clause.  If the states are unable to submit viable health exchange plans by January 1, 2013, the federal government will step in to establish their own exchanges in the defaulting states. With increasing number of states backing out of HIX establishment plans the pressure, of setting up federal exchanges in these states, is growing on the federal government. The common questions doing the rounds in the U.S. healthcare industry is that – is the federal government well prepared to establish their own exchanges by the designated HIX deadline of January 2014? The federal exchanges will operate similar to the proposed state health insurance exchange models – a one-stop, web based platform where individuals and small businesses would be able to compare health plans from different vendors based on different parameters such as quality of medical service, price and coverage options. The exchanges will also provide consumers with the facilities of checking eligibility online for Medicaid, small business tax credits, federal subsidies etc. The exchanges – established by state or federal government - will need to maintain a large pool of consumer specific income, residency, and financial status and employment data. It would be hard to evaluate the preparation and readiness status of federal government in setting up fully functional insurance exchanges by 2014, as there is not much data available on them to make a rough estimate. Setting up insurance exchanges will require a lot of deliberation on the structural, technological, administrative, data security and financial aspects and the task may prove equally daunting for federal government as it is for the state governments. While most of the U.S. states have taken Level 1 health insurance exchange establishment grants from the national government, some states such as Florida, Louisiana and Alaska have openly declared that they would not be setting up their own exchanges. Other states, who even though have applied for Level 2 establishment grants, may still not be able to meet the January 2014 deadline. For all such states, the federal government will have to step in and launch their own exchange websites if the status quo remains the same over the next year. Apart from setting up HIPPA and other security standards compliant online exchange, the national exchanges will need to be interlinked with other exchanges operating around the U.S., to maintain the integrity of data and establish connectivity. The consumer data for all Americans will need to be collated, maintained and regularly updated to ensure accuracy in any analysis. The federal government is facing formidable challenges as far as setting up fully functional health insurance exchanges are concerned. Although there is not much data available on the federal exchanges progress as of now, one can only surmise that when the deadline approaches, the federal government will be able to deliver on their promise of fully operative insurance exchanges."
7,Sergeant Robert Bales is facing court martial for gunning down 18 civilians during a killing spree.,news-society," Staff Sergeant Robert Bales, the US soldier accused of gunning down 16 Afghan women and children, has been transported to Fort Leavenworth military prison and has been placed under solitary confinement. The 11-year veteran is most likely to face military proceedings. The US Army does not affirm or reject the possibility of a court martial procedure for Bales. His case is currently under review. However, several senior US Army officials have admitted -off the record- that Bales will face court martial for his crimes. Robert Bale's neighbor -Kassie Holland- said that she was shocked to hear the news, because Bales has always shown good attitude towards his neighbors and was family man. In fact, most of Bale's neighbors testified that the would see him quite often at the park, playing with his kids. However, concerning Bales there's more that meets the eye: The records show that in 2002 was arrested at Tacoma for assault and he was sentenced to 20 hours of anger management. In addition is 2009 Bales was involved in a hot-and-run charge in Sumner. Allegedly, the Sergeant drove his vehicle under the influence of alcohol and tried to imitate the Car-mageddon   video game where you get point for hitting people with your car. The Staff Sergeant had served 3 times in Iraq and was wounded twice in action. He was also decorated. This does not comply with his March 11 actions, when he raided a village called Alkozai, barging into homes and opening fire on civilians. In fact, all his victims were women and children, while 11 of the dead were from a single family. Right after murdering his victims, Bales is reported of  keeping his coolness and tried to burn some or all of the dead bodies. This action from his behalf, contradicts another theory, derived from an anonymous Pentagon source, that told reporters that Bales killings were a result of a combination of stress, alcohol and domestic issues, having as result that the Sergeant ""snapped"". Some soldiers that served with Bale during his 3  previous Iraq deployments, said that the 11 year veteran was  showing signs of distress and anger for his imminent 4th deployment to Afghanistan. In fact, the Sergeant was hoping that he wouldn't be transferred to the US Army Corps in Afghanistan, and rather return home. What is worse, is that Afghan president -and US puppet- Karzai (also know as the ""mayor of Kabul"" because his presidential authority is limited within the walls of his capital), called for NATO troops to withdraw for the Afghan villages and to confine themselves only to major US bases. This is quite ironic since Karzai is reported as corrupted to the bone, and is quite unpopular among his people. His authority rests only due to American generosity."
8,"Carefree is ""Car Country"" Every Saturday Morning",news-society," Carefree Arizona—Automobile enthusiasts from all over Arizona and visitors from all over the world descend upon Carefree on Saturday mornings to attend a ""Cruiz-In"" at the Town Center.  At this weekly event there are anywhere from fifty to over one hundred cars lining the streets around the Sundial.  The variety of the one-of-a kind automobiles, hot rods, muscle cars and sport cars there is as diverse as Carefree.  It is a true walk down memory lane — an attraction for everyone.

9,Protesters Picket Key Tobacco Show in Philippines,news-society," Hundreds of anti-smoking advocates on Thursday picketed a large international tobacco fair in the Philippines, a country that has drawn more attention from the industry as Western nations pile on restrictions and taxes. A pack of cigarettes costs only about 50 cents here, and nearly one out of every three Filipinos 15 years or older smokes, according to a survey cited by the World Health Organization. The government supports legislation aimed at discouraging smoking with a new tax, but it is also trying to ramp up foreign investment to fight rampant poverty and unemployment. Organizers of the tobacco exhibits, among the largest in the world, said city authorities waived an indoor smoking ban for delegates. Philippine President Benigno Aquino III sent a welcome message with hopes the meeting would benefit the country's economy. One of the protest leaders, Roberto del Rosario, said the government should not have allowed the trade fair to go on. ""This business kills people,"" said del Rosario, president of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control Alliance-Philippines. WHO also criticized the gathering that opened in Manila on Thursday, saying it provides a platform for the industry to promote ""a deadly product in the Philippines and throughout Asia."" Media were barred from the trade exhibits; organizers said the shows were ""strictly industry-only private meetings."" They said the Philippines was chosen as a venue ""after months of in-depth research locations ... for a number of compelling reasons."" It provides opportunities for tobacco and cigarette producers to meet suppliers of raw materials such as leaf, paper, filters and manufacturing equipment. Dr. Shin Young-soo, WHO director for the Western Pacific, said the Philippines' hosting of the event runs counter to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which it signed. The convention requires signatories to completely ban tobacco promotion, advertising and sponsorship. The Philippines has among Asia's highest smoking rates, and among the lowest prices for tobacco products. A pack of cigarettes costs about $1 in Laos, $3 in Malaysia, $6 in Hong Kong and $9 in Singapore. Two former finance and two ex-health secretaries issued a statement saying that young people and the poor are encouraged to smoke and drink because cigarette and alcohol prices in the Philippines are so low. Proponents of the proposed tax measure, which is being pushed by the health and finance departments, say it will correct the current tobacco tax structure, which favors one company that controls over 90 percent of the market, and which lacks a system to adjust the rates to inflation. The bill is still pending in Congress. The dominant tobacco company, PMFTC Inc., is owned by Philip Morris International Inc., which bought local Fortune Tobacco Corp. in 2010. PMFTC President Chris Nelson said the proposed taxes are ""unreasonable."" ""Our message is: We are here for employment, we are here for growth prospects for alcohol and tobacco and therefore, I think, obviously ... you should have reasonable and realistic (tax) increases,"" he said. Despite the proposed higher taxes, he said he is upbeat about prospects for the industry in the Philippines as more farmers return to tobacco-growing."
10,Article on euro 2012 news,news-society," Here is some Euro 2012 news for you. The 2012 European championships co-hosts Ukraine have promised to cut hotel prices all over the event, amid issues that prices are being cranked as much as sky-high ranges as a result of a lack of supply. ""The country's executive will find how one can make the costs of staying within the u . s . during the Euro-2012 extra acceptable for our guests,"" Deputy Prime Minister Borys Kolesnikov stated at a information conference. ""Poverty causes greed,"" he added. ""We forgave our lodges their debts 10 years ago to stimulate their development. We counted on their loyalty however they lifted the prices."" ""However, our government has enough power to reduce their appetite,"" Kolesnikov promised on Euro 2012 news. Earlier this 12 months Ukraine's media expressed deep worry over resort capacity in probably the most Euro-2012 host towns and the high value of staying in Kiev for overseas visitors. Estimates placed the price of rooms in Kiev at double that of staying within the Polish capital, Warsaw. An overnight stay in Kiev all over the match is anticipated to succeed in a staggering $332 (247 euros), compared with $149 in Warsaw. Tent pitches within the Kiev suburbs will price vacationing fans about forty euros ($54), the cost of a daily keep in a hostel in Warsaw. Kolesnikov insisted that Ukraine has enough space in affordable accommodations in all of the host cities, although he admitted there's a lack of capability in Donetsk. Fans there will find a way of staying on native school campuses, he added. Kolesnikov additionally said that Ukraine is ready to open the country's skies for the entire world's airlines. Euro 2012 news tells that this is initiative will allow enthusiasts who consider staying in Ukraine to be too dear to return to Ukraine to look at the fit and return house right after the showdown."
11,Next president election 2012,news-society," Ron Paul's administrative center has showed experiences that the Texas Congressman is about to run for the next president election 2012. Paul unites opposition to the warfare and the police state at home across all the political spectrum and against this to the current gaggle of criminals running the White House, represents the whole thing that America actually stands for. A gargantuan effort in reinforce of Ron Paul must be mobilized now to prevent Americans from being hoodwinked as soon as once more into electing a special puppet of the similar darkish establishment in 2012. Paul first ran for President because the Libertarian candidate in 1988, receiving a big 400,000 votes. He now commands the toughen of the ones all across the political spectrum, from libertarians through anti-war Democrats to real paleoconservative Republicans. Paul has been in and out of Congress because the 70's and is universally hated by way of the Republican elite, who routinely again Democrats towards him just to take a look at and get him out of office. The former Vietnam flight doctor is the perfect candidate for President and activists from every nook of each political persuasion will have to mobilize now in an try to assist Paul shatter the ability monopoly of the Republican and Democrat establishment who have labored together for decades to slit America's throat in the interests of power, greed, and ego - all running towards the belief of a brand new global order. The Texan represents a loss of life breed in Congress, individuals who in fact forged their votes according to the Constitution and no longer on the discretion of lobbyists or the fear that the elite will tarnish their political careers if they don't regularly fortify the establishment. As a result Ron Paul is the elite's worse nightmare, simply having him at the price tag itself will be a massive public members of the family blow, and that's the reason why media organs it is going to be activated to check out and discredit him ahead of next president election 2012. Paul was one among only a handful of Republicans to vote against the unlawful invasion of Iraq, contenting rightly that the Constitution clearly states that only Congress can declare war. In bucking a trend, Paul used to be anti-war lengthy ahead of the majority of the country came visiting to a similar state of mind following the disaster of the occupation. While Democrats soft-peddle and comfy up to Bush, creating phony arguments in regards to the stage of troop presence in Iraq and ignoring the bulk will of the country to deliver the troops home immediately, Ron Paul's opposition to pointless wars of intervention has remained steadfast throughout his complete political career. If a gargantuan effort is produced from now till the top of next president election 2012 to heighten Paul's media profile and forward him as America's final hope, he in point of fact has a vital likelihood of giving Jeb Bush, Rudy Giuliani or whichever elitist puppet the Republicans make a choice to put ahead an actual run for their money."
12,The Weimar Hyperinflation - Could it Happen Again?,news-society," At the end of WWI Weimar Germany was suffering from rising inflation, which was starting to get out of control. During a two year period from 1921 through 1923 Inflation was running away. During the time, nearing the end of 1923 Weimar Germany would forever be remembered as a place where one of the greatest hyper-inflationary events in history took place. When hyperinflation finally took hold of Germany during this time, its devastating grasp wiped out the entire Weimar Society. These are times where iconic photos taken of the time can be seen in history books. Photos such as a man using his German marks as ""wall paper"" or of people trying to buy a single loaf of bread while pushing a wheel barrel full of cash around just to pay for it. Another iconic photo of a woman burning her German marks in a wood stove just to keep the bitter cold away. At that time the money was worthless, burning money was cheaper than burning wood to use as fuel for heat. The hyperinflation was so terrible that on November 1st in 1923 at the height of the crisis 1 pound of bread cost 3 billion German marks while a glass of beer cost 4 billion and a pound of meat cost an incredible 36 billion marks. As the Weimar example shows their devastation and suffering, this could become an economic event to reach America soon enough. Can the United States actually fall into a Weimar Style Hyperinflation? Well below we can see startling similarities between mistakes made in the 1920’s that created and strengthened the Weimar Event along with many of the same mistakes being made by the United States and many other world governments today. •	The US Government’s unwillingness to raise taxes to support its 10+ year war costs. Looking back at Weimar the same parallel can be seen as their lack of raising taxes was a huge factor in the lack of funding for their post war re-construction and war reparation payments. •	High prolonged unemployment. •	Both the United States and 1920’s Weimar Germany operate with huge budget deficits and huge deficit spending. •	40% of every dollar the US Government spends today is borrowed, while at the time Weimar’s Government was borrowing 50% to support its costs. •	Both have kept interest rates way below the rate of inflation. •	Both creating rapidly increasing money supplies. Increasing the money supply is one of the most devastating factors in the creation of hyperinflation. Central Banks such as the US Federal Reserve are responsible for the creation and distribution of the paper currency they print. This 2-way responsibility creates an unbalanced supply and demand for printed money or fiat currency. With products and services attaining minimum growth at best, they do not match the ""additional"" amount of printed money, so the intrinsic value of this excessive money supply decreases. Just as Weimar Germany had done many years ago, the Federal Reserve has been creating new money too, out of thin air. More recently during the last two ""quantitative easing"" bond buying schemes, operation twist and international dollar swaps programs with foreign central banks. Soon most likely, round three of the quantitative easing program will be coming out from the Fed. This money creation is done through speculative bets on the books of private banks; furthermore it produces nothing of value for the US Economy. According to online usdebtclock.org at the time of writing, the United States has a federal budget deficit of $1.26 trillion dollars. The current federal spending is at $3.6 trillion dollars, the US national debt is currently at $15.4 trillion dollars and the total debt for America is now sitting at $56.66 trillion dollars. With the clowns in Washington’s three ring circus manning Congress the Senate and White House today their constant in-decisions, cross line fighting and inline party fighting are helping no one. Under the big top no one can agree on any constructive reforms to stop the madness now growing into full bloom. With all these facts happening were seeing a surefire prescription leading towards hyperinflation. The fact is we are now beyond the ""tipping point"" to where any constructive fiscal policies, stimulus, government intervention or anything else for that matter will reverse course on the giant fiscal engine that is driving us towards hyperinflation. Unless some kind of miracle comes around due to how the Government and the Federal Reserve have been constantly avoiding any true fix to this problem we will be heading right back into the same situation. Worse yet since the US dollar is also the world’s reserve currency and central banks around the world are still holding both large amounts of US dollars and US debt, when the dollar finally does collapse from massive hyperinflation, the fall out will also take out or drastically affect other countries, due to the dollar’s dominance around the globe. Hyperinflation could match or even exceed the event that occurred in 1923 Weimar Germany. Hopefully this article is a wake up call for those sleepers out there. Bottom line is to be prepared. Time is on your side for the moment, so use it to the best of your advantage. During hyperinflation you will experience long lines for food, fuel and other necessities. You’re also going to experience over inflated extremely high prices. There is a very strong possibility in no time flat the shelves in every store you visit will be empty. Prepare Yourself Now Stock up now on basic food staples such as canned (cheaper) or freeze dried foods (long shelf life 15 + years) as they store well. You also want drinking water; a means to purify your own drinking water is also a very wise idea. Have prescription medications, first aid supplies, alternate cooking sources such as a camp stove as well as spare cash, and items that would be good for trading or bartering for additional goods and services as cash will be of short supply. Another wise move would be to protect at least some of your purchasing power by holding physical gold and silver coin or bullion. As gold and silver have throughout history been a true store of value acting as an insurance policy against systemic failures and problems within financial markets within every society as far back as history has been recorded.

13,David Wood and Mitt Romney: Much In common But A World Apart,news-society," David Wood and Mitt Romney: Much In common But A World Apart What do David Wood and Mitt Romney have in common? They’re rich and famous - and enjoys being so. However, they can be a world apart. What else is common? Don’t be shocked with what I have to say:  both are men of God ! You think it’s only from my point of view, but considering that both of them belong to The Church of Christ of the Latter Day Saints, or the Mormon Church,  they are pretty much into God and Religion. (That we differ from them in our religious views, is another matter.) As far as I know, their young people all go through a period of  at least three years in  active missionary service. Saw those clean-shaven young  men in neck-tied white shirt and black pants, wearing nameplates and smiles, knocking door to door Bible in hands? Yep. You can bet that’s who they are - missionaries in the service of the Lord ! (At this point, picture in your mind the young David and Romney exactly attired as described - and you have 2  saints walking together…) What else is common to both men? They’re businessmen - however, in different industries. David is a topnotch internet marketer with a Google monthly search of over 130,000 for the keyword David Wood alone. Add to it the other several keyword variations, and you get millions. He has thousands of downlines in different MLM companies he excels in,  founded his own company, and  has established himself as a go to mentor in his chosen field. (That’s really cool…) Not to be confused with many other David Woods,  try typing ""work with david wood"" or ""working with david wood"" and you’ll be taken to the site in .29 seconds, compared with simply googling his name. As for Romney, (never mind googling him as his face is one of the most familiar faces that you can see on every news channel) everyone knows what businesses he’d been into, and is into. Almost everything about his life is under public scrutiny - especially that he’s known to be worth at least more than $300M and counting up in assets. (He’s still entitled to some privacy that shelters him from having to declare the exact amount no matter how public a person he is.) They’re both family men. David is so public in his declaration of love for his wife. I believe this  endears him to her even more. And he can gain love and respect from everyone for that honest show of love and fidelity. Mitt enjoys and takes pride in the support of his wife, which they mutually express; and the number of their children is enough of a showcase to see that they live in love. What sets them apart is politics. David is not into politics but Romney is. Whereas businessmen  are always associated with money, whatever be the connotation of money, good or bad, (remember, the Gospel, in many instances, looks at money and riches with disfavor, like placing God and money as two masters you can not serve, or the rich being unable to go to heaven lest they go through the eye of a needle…) politicians are associated more with money, corruption and lies. Ugh. Guilty by association. Not fair. Rally, really not fair. Only lawyers may come in close second to politicians in being targeted with this guilt by association  mudslinging technique; but they are usually spared from this in a subtle way because they’re quite often its practitioners. Oh no… What have I written? (sigh…) I like David and Romney for who they are… could be a fan of both, however apolitical. Never meant to associate anything  with unsavory connotation. These are just generalizations… I like money. Who doesn’t?  Even they who may look at money from the Gospel point of view depends on money so much for their charity."
14,How To Promote Your EBook,news-society," Selling your book online is, quite frankly, not easy. I've been selling my books since March 2011 and I think I've learned quite a lot in that time. So here are a few thoughts and tips on the subject. Your Website Having your own website to promote your new eBook, or even printed book, is the best way to start promoting your book. It's your shop window and if you can attract some serious traffic to 'walk' past your window then you have a good chance of selling to them. But it has to be an attractive website, easy for users to see what's on offer and above all, pleasant to look at and read. Informative websites are a must. It's not just about pretty pictures, you have to give your potential customers information on what the book is about and make it easy for them to purchase. With a bit of thought and visiting a few other sites that do something similar to what you want to do, you will soon have a great site up and running. That's the easy part over and done with. Now comes the hard part. If you ever thought writing a book was hard, well, you ain't seen nothing yet. Web Traffic Getting the right people onto your website is really, really, hard. One thing I've learned, so far, is that buying into web traffic is fraught with danger, not least of which is choosing which company's service works and which doesn't. Some will offer free traffic, the vast majority of which will bounce of your site in less time than it takes to sneeze. If you purchase web traffic it can be inexpensive and it can be expensive and it may work or it may not... most of the time it will work a little bit. You can probably expect a 0.1% sales rate at best. So for every 100,000 who land on your site you may well get sales of 100 - but it's going to cost something like $250 for good US traffic. So you will need to sell a lot of eBooks to recover that outlay if you're selling at $2.99 on Amazon. If you decide to buy into web traffic, make sure you have some sort of online stats, like Google Analytics, and only buy in one service at a time. That way you can look at the stats and match that traffic to your sales. However, even this has a hidden problem if you're selling your book through Amazon. The one thing you will never find out is if your buyer bought direct from Amazon without going onto your website first. Bit of a bummer if you've paid a fortune out for web traffic and can't prove the sales you get came from that traffic. SEO or Search Engine Optimization Again, this can set you back a lot of money and there is NO guarantee it's going to work. And even if it does work, you will still have a lot of work to do on your site to make it worthwhile. It can take anything from six months to a year to get traffic onto your site. If you decide to do this yourself then you will simply have to get your site registered on as many search engines as possible and have your site set up to be SEO friendly. Then you will have to go through the process all over again. This is because you are going to have to read as much about SEO as you can, and then read some more and then realise that the advice is conflicting, because SEO is something of a unknown quantity. Nobody, except Google and the like, knows exactly what it is that makes a website successful. On my website I originally had ten keywords, these being the words Google's (and other) search engines will use to list your site. But, after setting up the site I then read that you need lots of keywords, so I did a bit more research and found those keywords. Only to be told by an SEO 'expert' that I had too many keywords. To date, I've gone through six different variations of keywords in six months and still I'm getting contradictory information from the 'experts' in this field. Maybe it's just me being a bit thick, but I do feel that SEO, if it works, is great, but you need someone to steer you through it. I'm asking my ISP, a well know company in England, to help me out... I'll let you know in a years time if it worked. Advertising It's expensive is all I can tell you about advertising. Tried a freebie from Facebook and got nothing. Tried another freebie from another company and the same happened. I'm looking at Google AdWords but it's expensive and complicated. Not for the faint hearted or those who don't have deep pockets. Again, there is no guarantee as you are reliant on someone noticing what it is your trying to sell on a web page that is probably full of similar ads. Promoting On Amazon KDP Select is an new service that Amazon offer. Make your book exclusive to Kindle for 90 days and in return it will be part of the Kindle Owners' Lending Library for the same period and you will earn your share of a monthly fund when readers borrow your books from the library. You will also be able to promote your book as freebie download for up to 5 days during these 90 days. The lending part of it I have no problem with, one of my titles has been loaned of over thirty times in January 2012. It's the free for 5 days I have a problem with. In January 2012, I set up two of my titles free for 5 days and I had 810 free downloads. Both titles got good reviews, four and five star, but sales from that has been a handful, not even ten. However, the good thing is that over time the good reviews will help to bring in more sales. The most obvious thing to come out of my experience is that it takes time to promote a website in order to sell books. It's a big market and the internet is a vast place, but your website is a drop in the ocean. And just to prove a point and get myself all depressed and unhappy, tap the following into a Google search, ""kindle books to read"" and see what you get. My results showed 888,000 and the top four were all Amazon. My website appeared on page... well, I got fed up after page ten and gave in! Copyright (c) Tom Kane 2012"
15,The Future Of Mobile Communications,news-society," In the early 20th Century, no one would have predicted the invention of the mobile or cell phone. Such a device was inconceivable to our ancestors. Today, the mobile phone is king and it's not unknown for people to change their phones at the drop of a hat. But what will society be using in the future, say in a hundred years time? You can bet it will look nothing like today's mobile phones, in fact, you won't even see it. In today's world the mobile phone isn't something we can do without, it's an essential. Where I live, in the Republic of Cyprus, not having a mobile phone on you could have serious consequences. I live in the wilds of Cyprus and here, leaving your phone at home when you go out, is a serious problem if your car breaks down or runs out of petrol. In the summer especially, it would be a long hot walk to the nearest petrol station. This highlights one of the problems of the mobile phone, it's mobile and can end up anywhere if you're a careless owner. How many people do you know who have left their phone on the top of their car at a petrol station? How many have lost their phones in pubs or clubs? Mobile can mean lost. Here's where the future of mobile communications will come in handy. Your new mobile phone will be in your head, not in your hand. Think how small mobile phones are and compare the size they are today to what the first mobile phones looked like. The first mobile phones could easily have been used as clubs to fend off an attack from a mugger, they were that big. Miniaturization in manufacturing has meant the mobile has shrunk and shrunk, until it can shrink no further because you still need a keypad. So, what happens if we remove the keypad? You can't make a call, that's what happens. But without the keypad, the mobile can truly shrink in size, to something so small you could have it implanted in your head. Sounds a bit mad, doesn't it? But IBM has recently announced they have created the world's smallest storage device, just 12 atoms in size and have also manage to program the company's motto, ""Think"", onto an array of 96 atoms. Now that is truly staggering. But apply this new technology to the future mobile phone and the mind simply boggles. Without a keypad your mobile phone will literally be data stored on atoms inside your head. So when we do get truly mobile, what exactly will you have to do to make a call? You are going to have to get used to the idea of a little surgery first and then maybe a little programming. What you need is a connection between your cognitive abilities and your optical abilities. What you will need is the ability to call up an optical, virtual, display in your mind and be able to create a virtual finger that will press the numbers on your virtual keypad. Phew!! Sounds a little far fetched, doesn't it? Maybe not though. Fighter pilots already use something called HUD - Heads Up Display. The HMD, Helmet Mounted Display, is technically still a HUD but it also allows the pilot to move their head in any direction and still allow them to view whatever data they choose depending on the task at hand. Now, apply that to a virtual display in your own mind where your virtual finger moves according to your wishes and taps out the number for your current girl/boy friend, all while your eating fish and chips on the number 32 bus into Ealing High Street. But the neat bit will be that you don't even have to utter a word, you simply think what you want to say and that will be what's transmitted to your loved one. Isn't technology wonderful? Soon you will be able to virtually dump your latest beau while eating your lunch Copyright (C) Tom Kane 2011"
16,Is There A Medical EBook In The House?,news-society," I've just Googled the word 'eBook' and was somewhat astonished to see the result. Not the actual web addresses, but the number of results there were, 106,000,000 to be precise, and at 106m, not 106,000,010, but 106m it is indeed a precise number. That number led me to another thought. How many people own a Kindle? Released on November 19th, 2007, the Kindle has taken the literary world by storm. Specific sales information is not available, but Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.com said at a 2010 shareholder's meeting that, 'millions of people now own Kindles.' That's an astonishing feat in such a short period of time. It has to be the fastest growing sales for any electronic device ever. This sales information then led me to wonder what was next. What sort of device would come from the common use of an eReader to read an eBook? Well, as many people would rather consult an online medical repository, maybe medical eBooks will become popular. Then it occurred to me that perhaps an eDevice will be invented that can diagnose our medical symptoms. We wake up in the morning feeling groggy, out comes the eMedDevice and we plug it into our implanted bio-output port and, hey-presto, we have a diagnosis- too much wine the night before. At this rate, in the not-too-distant-future, I can see that eBook readers, or rather their descendents, will soon be the must have device for the emergency services. Ambulance crews will arrive on the scene and instead of consulting a Doctor they will simply plug their eMedDevice into the patient and the eMedDevice into the mobile medicine dispenser and press the start button. The eMedDevice will sort the patient out and the ambulance crew can have a coffee break. You may well laugh, but bear in mind how far medicine has advanced since the 2nd World War alone. Ultrasound was used as early as 1949 to access the thickness of bowel tissue. That was just over sixty years ago. Ultrasound is used this day and age to check the status of unborn children, to check if your vital organs are functioning and for many more things as well. Clearly if we in this day and age use a Kindle to store and read thousands of books, then it becomes apparent that this sort of computing capability can only mean that human beings have a never ending thirst for knowledge. With hand held devices becoming smaller and smaller and the information they carry becoming larger and larger, it seems inevitable that at some point a device will be created that is small enough to implant into a human, but can store the sum of all human knowledge, and then some. It was reported in January 2012 that IBM scientists had created the world's smallest storage device, just 12 atoms in size. The scientists needed just 12 atoms per bit of information and were able to squeeze a whole byte into just 96 atoms. Then they were able to code the IBM motto ""Think"" by programming this block of atoms to store the five letters. So, as we go about our daily business we will have a device inside us that will continually monitor our health, check the Stock Market, link to our home computer to place an order for groceries and email our friends and relatives as we walk along the sidewalk admiring the spring sunshine. Far fetched? Well think on this, how often do you use email to contact friends, family or colleagues, once a month, once a day or even several times a day? How often do you write, physically, write a letter to someone you know? I've not written a letter in at least twenty years. Electronic information has dominated our lives for a very long time and is as natural to us today as receiving a letter in the post was twenty years ago. The use of electronic information by humans means that at some point, it will not just be inevitable, but wholly desired to be connected electronically to as many people, homes, services, institutions and leisure facilities as humanly and electronically possible. And at that point, not only will Big Brother be watching you but so will the rest of the Human race. Copyright (c) Tom Kane 2011"
17,Atomic Iran: Countdown to Armageddon,news-society," Award-winning journalist, Mike Evans is one of the world’s leading experts on Middle-East and has written many books and articles on the subject. In his latest book, Atomic Iran: Countdown to Armageddon, Evans exposes the terrific reality that Iran is working towards becoming the next nuclear state. Iran is a terrorist state Iran committed to Islamic revolution worldwide, including the streets of America. In fact, Iran’s fanatical President Amadinejad followed his radical Islamic teachings when in May 2006 he sent a letter to President George W. Bush offering to allow his enemy to convert to Islam or suffer merciless attacks on America! Dr. Mike Evans, President of The Jerusalem Prayer Team, is convinced that Iran will be able to launch nuclear attacks within the next twelve months, unless Americans unite and insist that our president and the Liberal Left appeasement politicians stand up to Iran’s president and supreme leader. The war in the Middle East may ultimately be the battle for the soul of America. Today, we face an evil unlike any we have ever faced before. Vile words of twisted hatred spill from Islamic extremists of Iran, who preach an apocalyptic jihad or holy war against the great Satan, America, and radically call for the purging of Israel from the face of the earth. Israel’s leaders believe the window of opportunity to eliminate the menace posed by Iran is closing sooner than expected. While the Obama administration is working overtime to restrict available options, Israeli leaders will not allow themselves to be boxed in by President Obama, Robert Gates, Hillary Clinton or anyone else. According to one source, ""Iran has had years to build up covert and dispersed facilities, and is known to have dozens of other facilities associated with some aspect of its nuclear programs.""Speculators have given Netanyahu until October to make a move concerning Iran. Israel doesn’t have the alternative of waiting for negotiations and sanctions to be effective; her very existence is at stake. Evans wrote this eye-opening book because stronger action needs to be taken to educate the global community as to the threat which Iran poses to civilization – to worldwide stability and wellbeing. Iran has long been described as simply a threat to the Jewish state of Israel and to the United States; that is a complete fallacy. The possession of nuclear arms by a fanatical entity, whether Iran, North Korea, al-Qaeda or any of the myriad other radical countries or groups, is a menace of great magnitude, and must be addressed with equal alacrity. This is the book that could literally save the world from Armageddon. The message of Atomic Iran is being lived out right before our eyes. This book will give you greater insight into events that could affect you, your children, and your grandchildren. It gives the real story on the Middle East conflict as it stands today and gives you a powerful insight into the current world crisis and what can be done about it."
18,"If the Evidence Proved Him Innocent, Why Did Dr. Malachi K. York Plea Guilty?",news-society," This very seemingly simple question has a quite complex answer. Unbeknown to many outside of the judicial system, this phenomenon occurs much more often than one would think. This holds ever so true even more for the offender or suspected offender that cannot afford a good attorney. A court ""appointed"" attorney is a court ""paid"" attorney. Now, if you couple this idea with a person who may already have any kind of criminal record, you have a recipe for many people being put behind bars on false pretenses. Question: It seems far-fetched that someone would voluntarily ruin their life because of a terrible lawyer, is there more to it? Answer: Yes there is. Many times, the terror begins in the 'inTERRORgation' room. This is where investigators use all kinds of physical and psychological tortures to coerce(force, trick) a person into confessing to a crime they didn't commit or not even guilty of being an accessory. Often times, just as depicted on the detective shows that come on television, the interrogation process is for the most part the same just much more harsh. An interrogation may last three to four days for hours on end and the suspect is kept up and deprived of sleep, food, and bathroom breaks. The investigators rotate out and are well rested and keep reminding the suspect of all the time they are facing. They ask the same questions over and over. All it takes is one inconsistent answer and its all but over for the suspect. For example,""What time did you leave the party?"" If the suspect repeatedly says 10:15, they will keep him/her up for hours on end for days. Remember, the may have allowed the suspect a couple of hours of sleep here and there over the last two few days. Meanwhile, they are bringing well rested interrogators in like a relay team. The suspect is in an often cold, uncomfortable room, sitting on a steel chair. They will keep asking, ""Are you sure it was 10:15, are you sure it wasn't 10:45? If you are deprived of sleep, you may slip up and say, ""Maybe it could have been 10:45."" They will never let you live that down and say you lied to us. ""You said you left at 10:15, now you're saying 10:45, you know you just f---ed up right?"" It's pretty much all down hill from there. Next question is, ""What else have you lied about?"" I think the reader should have a better sense of how these interrogation techniques can get a  confession from someone, even if they are innocent by now. I strongly suggest that everyone has a lawyer on retention that will have your best interest at hand to protect your rights from the beginning of your arrest, be it false or not, this is very important. Question: Is there more? Answer: Sadly enough, yes there is. The reasoning behind the plea agreement is as such: The ""offender""is told if he/she takes responsibility for their crime and owns up to it, they won't be punished as harshly. On the other hand they are told if you don't own up to your crime and make the State waste time and money going to trial and you(WILL PROBABLY LOSE LOOKING AT THE EVIDENCE, KNOW WHAT WE MEAN) lose, we will give you a more harsh punishment. As stated earlier, a court ""appointed"" lawyer, is a court ""paid"" lawyer who does what he/she is told by the court. This is a very important component of the Corrections Corporation of America (Prison Industrial Complex) system. No matter what happens to the person being tried, the court appointed lawyer gets paid regardless. It is similar to a stock broker who gets paid whether your investments that he or she recommended you to take in the first place win, lose, or break even. With this reward system in place, human nature takes over. So how many will really fight for you, knowing they will get paid whether you got to jail or not? Ultimately, the Corrections Corporation of America (Prison Industrial Complex) needs bodies to fill the cells whether they are innocent or not. Understand, that these statistics go up even more for minority males in the low-income bracket, especially those from crime ridden areas. More and more, stories are being brought to light about men in the low-income, minority demographic being exonerated of crimes by way of DNA evidence. There are many cases that have been recorded that show a rash of Negroid Men having been arrested from no evidence and not even fitting the description of the eye witness accounts. It's basically, ""An Any Old Low-Income Man Will Do Attitude."" A study undertaken by the Innocence Project on April 14, 2009, revealed some eye-opening results. The first exoneration by way of DNA evidence happened in 1989. Since then, there have been 235 DNA evidence exonerations. 140 of these were Negroid men as opposed to 64 Caucasoid men. Before the next question, let's take a look at some of the factors that may lead to wrongful convictions: (1) 3% Mistaken I.D. (2) 21% Informant/Snitches (3) 21% False Confessions (4) 35% Hair Comparisons (5) 101% DNA Inclusion At The Time Of  Trial. It should also be noted that even DNA evidence can be fabricated as well. Question: So how does this tie into Rev. Dr. Malachi K. York? Answer: On so many levels it does tie into Dr. York. However, his case is much more complex and has so many more dynamics to be added to the mixture. One thing that should be duly noted is that his case was not about the alleged crimes of child molestation or that of racketeering. His case was more of a war of right against wrong. Many of the injustices that I have mentioned in this very article are things he is still fighting to see come to an end, not only in America, but world over. The reader should really digest the idea that when Dr. York erected the Egyptian village called, 'Tama RE, Egypt of the West', in Eatonton, Ga, that was not only an expression of his right to practice any faith, religion, or way of life he chose as long as he was not breaking the law, he was going against the grain of a system that thrives on abuse and oppression of those too frightened and un-educated to fight. So it must be stated that as he was pursuing his rights as an individual, he was also teaching others to become self- sufficient, doers, and thinkers. As people were becoming more productive members of society, The Corrections Corporation of America (Prison Industrial Complex) was losing its supply of uneducated, dependent, hopeless, and shiftless people that it needs to keep the cells full. Question: So why would someone of such high morals, ideals, resources, and intellect plea guilty? Answer: As I stated earlier, this was a very complex case to begin with and I will do my best to explain. Rev. York knew he was wanted removed dead or alive by a lot of different people and entities for personal, business, and religious reasons as well. With that in mind let me begin. Dr. York, at the time of his arrest, was accompanied by three women. One of which was his wife, who suffers from Multiple Sclerosis. Rev. York was being told that she was not receiving the medical treatment that she needs for her ailment. Multiple Sclerosis is an illness that attacks the brain and can leave the person crippled for life if untreated. Rev. York received ineffectiveness of counsel. His lawyers at the time were Manny Aurora and Ed Garland, of Garland, Samuel, and Loeb. It should be noted Ed Garland has a reputation for talking his clients into taking a plea deal, serving them up on a platter to the  Correction Corporation of America (Prison Industrial Complex). True to form, he did the same thing to Rev. York. Dr. York has a medical condition himself, known as Acute Hereditary Angioedema. This ailment causes the air passages to swell and IS TRIGGERED BY STRESS AND CAN BE FATAL IF LEFT UNTREATED. It has been well documented that Dr. York has not received the medical treatment he needs to this day, after almost 10 years of incarceration. Rev. DR. Malachi K. York was also interrogated for hours on end for days, deprived of sleep, given very rare bathroom privileges, placed in over crowded cells, and forced to sleep on floors with true, hardened criminals, murderers and drug dealers and the likes for 6 months straight. This abuse started from the time of his illegal kidnapping by way of arrest on May 8, 2002, all the way up to his illegal plea agreement on January 24, 2003. I will remind the reader to keep in mind that he was 57 years old at the time when all this was going on!!!! DR. York was being told by his own so-called counsel that the three women would spend the rest of their lives in prison, never to see their children again and it was all because of him. His attorney Garland, told him to take the plea, it was no way he could win the case, take the plea and let the women go so they can be with their children and families, it's you that they really want. If you were my son I would tell you the same thing. DR. York is also a Diplomat, Consul-General, Head of the Consulate Post for the Republic of Liberia, West Africa. Dr. York repeatedly informed the arresting officers during their illegal arrest and kidnapping who he is and that he has Diplomatic Identification and Passport Number: D/003828-04. They only replied to him by saying, ""Shut the F*&#  UP."" Let me take this time to point out that these were county sheriffs and police officers violating international laws, namely Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. So with all this, seemingly the weight of the world on his shoulders, Rev. Dr. Malachi Kobina York took the plea deal, which was if he would plea guilty, the women who were with him that day would be set free. As one can see by this article, there is a lot more than meets the eye as to why someone would plea guilty when they were innocent, so please don't be so quick to judge.  As stated earlier, I strongly suggest that everyone who reads this article go out at your earliest convenience and retain a lawyer that will have your best interest at hand for any legal problems you may encounter in the future. I hope I have answered your questions and have given you a clearer understanding of the reason why this happens so often right under our noses."
19,Pros and Cons of Globalisation,news-society," It is obvious that the world is experiencing an economic globalisation. That is clearly stated in the development of the global trade compared to the total global production - the GDP. The global trade has been significantly increasing since the 1990s only held back around 2001 due to the IT crisis and recently due to the current financial crisis. As a result of the globalisation the economies of the world have become still more dependent on each other and especially economically, thus the trade with currencies and gilt certificates has increased too. Organisations such as WTO - The World Trade Organisation - work hardly to ensure this economic globalisation by removing trade obstacles as well as creating an atmosphere of free and fair trade globally. Another sign, which points in the direction of an economic globalisation, is the fact that the competition gets tougher on the global market, which is why company buyouts are seen together with cooperation in order for the companies to survive. Outsourcing of production has also become necessary for many companies to utilize the comparative advantages and thereby stay in the competition. And exactly an optimised possibility for companies to draw on the comparative advantages by, for instance, outsourcing production is one of the most important advantages of the globalisation. Products can now be produced where a qualified workforce is available for the right price and where the conditions favour the production. Another advantage of the globalisation is the increasing competition on the global market on especially the price and quality of products. This development will naturally be in the customers' favour. In continuation of this, investors can now place their capital where it is most favourable due to the free investment possibilities. The globalisation has also created the conditions necessary for an increasing trade between countries, which has turned out to be a vital part of the recipe for increased wealth. As a result of the increased world trade, technology is also spread around the world along with language. Western countries include more and more English words and many Asian countries get to know Japanese words and this development makes it still easier for everyone to communicate globally. However, not everything about the globalisation favours it. One disadvantage is the social distortion because the advantages of globalisation are not shared equally and in the industrialised countries it is often the unskilled workers who have to swallow the bitter pill. An increased distance between developed and developing countries seem to follow the globalisation. Many developing countries do experience growth, however, it is nothing compared to the growth experienced by the already developed countries. Countries have got too dependent on each other. That is brilliantly shown by the current financial crisis, which started in the USA and spread throughout the rest of the world. Sovereign countries have therefore become easier to influence from abroad. Finally, it is worth mentioning that big multinational companies get too much power since they often become absolute rulers with even more influence than politicians from smaller countries - a development that might undermine democracy."
20,New York Private Detective Studying Gestures,news-society," New York private detectives have been successful in obtaining a clients or witnesses account to a story.  New York private detective must first understand the fundamentals of behavior when assessing clients or witnesses during the interview.

Silent clues may provide more information than their answers.

4,Hiring a Private Detective for Detecting Child Custody,news-society," Hiring a private detective for child custody related issues have become a practice, especially after the divorce of the parents. The family members or the friends of the separated couple have appointed new york private investigator to decide the real custodian of the child. It often happens that after getting divorce, the parents make an appeal to the court for deciding the legal holder of the children, but motives of the parents are not always correct.

5,Child Molestation World Record Holder!,news-society," Being the CNN loyalist and avid conspiracy theorist that I am, I couldn't help but zoom in on the plague of child molestation cases that dominated the headlines circa. 1999. It seems that through time even celebrities are not immune, Michael Jackson, Roman Polanski, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bishop Eddie Long, former Oregon Governor Neil Goldschmidt who confessed his guilt, and R&B singer, R. Kelly had bouts with the accusations as well. Without a doubt, the Catholic priests seemed to take the lead in such an evil taboo that society has been forced to talk about. So-called cult leader, David Koresh, of the Branch Davidian was also accused as well as the Mormons of Utah, who have always been held in contempt by the other 49 states that look down on them for their lawful practice of polygamy. In the case of the Catholic Priests, it is strange that to my knowledge, I haven't seen any of them ever serve a prison sentence. My best guess is, they are covered by the Vatican, which is its own sovereign entity. So there is no way they can really be sued. So basically, what we are seeing is more or less ""here is your money, leave us alone payments, that are made out to be civil law suits for damages, emotional distress, and 'pain and suffering.' However, none of these made my 'conspiracy theory' alarm go off as did the infamous 2002 case of H.E. Rev. Dr. Malachi Z. York-El, who was known as the leader of the Nuwaupians. To bring the reader up to speed, H. E. Rev. Dr. Malachi Z. York-El, is a Consul-General and Diplomat for Liberia, West Africa, whose passport number is: D/003828-04, which would bring with it Diplomatic Immunity. Accusation per accusation, this case seemed to me very bizarre and far-fetched. Rev. Dr. York was accused of molesting up to 13 children, up to 10 times a day, for up to 10 years!! My first thought was, ""That is a lot of sex,"" and immediately my suspicions started. Just think, if we take one child for let's say 5 times a day for 5 days a week, if I am correct, that is 25 times of having sex in one week.  Now, multiply that 25 times by 13 children and that is 325 times he would have had sex for that week, correct? Now, we take 325 times a week by 52 weeks, again if I am correct, that comes to 16,900 times he would have had sex in a year!!!! Now, let's take that into perspective against the 20,000 times the Great Wilt Chamberlain said he had sex in his lifetime!! I would also challenge any pornographic film star to equal those numbers as well. OK let's finish it up, take that 16,900 times 10 years, if I am correct again, that comes to 169,000 times!!!! Which in my mind would be a world record indeed. I was quite surprised when Viagra didn't want to use him as a spokesman and even more surprised when Guinness Book didn't list him as well! While downtown Atlanta, I ran into some men who were 'propagating' the Nuwaupian doctrine and defending Rev. Dr. York's innocence. Many of the issues I had with what was being said in the media about the case were confirmed with my conversations with them. Issue 1: How could Rev. York be arrested even after presenting his Diplomatic credentials to the arresting officers?    The Nuwaupians answered that because of the doctrine that Rev. York has presented to the world, there are people who wanted him off the streets as a free man at all costs. Taking into consideration, that Malachi York is also a sovereign who knows what his status and the UCC CODES entail. This was also something that he wrote about in one of his books called, ""Let's Set The Record Straight.""   In it he outlined the history between America and Morocco and the treatise that were made between them, namely the Treaty Of Peace And Friendship, which is the oldest treaty that is still recognized to this day. Issue 2: Why would Dr. York plea guilty after originally entering a plea of innocent and the evidence clearly proved him innocent?   This was done because Dr. York was told the women who were with him at the time of his arrest, would be let go if he would plea guilty, being that they were Innocent and it was he who the prosecution really wanted in the first place. Issue 3: How the hell could somebody possibly have sex that many times, yet alone have enough time? Again, they confirmed my suspicions with facts and common sense. It was clear that children were behind this plot, because any adult would have know it is impossible to have sex that many times. Put to me as such, H. E. Malachi Z. York has written over 400 books. That's right over 400 books!! Now, find any person who publishes books and ask them how long the process of writing and publishing just one book is and see what they say. Issue 4: How did the whole mess start in the first place? They told me that it was all started by a group of kids who lived on the Nuwaupian land and could not break rules as they wanted. It was against the rules to have sex if they weren't married, they couldn't dress in skin tight clothing and go out to party. They got fed up with the rules that were in place to keep the order that was established by Dr. York and that was their way of getting back at him. They then conspired with the racist sheriff by the name of Howard Richard Sills, of Putnam County, GA, who hated the Nuwaupians and could not come to grips with the reality that a group of Black people lived together, had wealth and no criminal records. In return, for a conviction, the government promised them they could sue Dr. York for millions of dollars and split the pot between them. It was also the result of the 476 acres of land that the Nuwaupians owned stood in the way of an economic plan that the Putnam County government had in development for the next 20 years. This economic plan included turning the city of Eatonton/Putnam County, GA into a tourist attraction/resort area of sorts. This also had ties with neighboring Greene County that has a major resort area called Reynolds Plantation and a Ritz-Carlton Hotel. Reynolds Plantation is owned by Mercer Reynolds, who is a close friend and business partner of Former President  Bush the younger. Recently, Reynolds has been in the headlines for having to sell some his assets to satisfy lenders. Now with all these things being said, let's look at some medical evidence to prove that Rev. Dr. Malachi Kobina York could not be guilty of these false allegations: Dr. Frederick Bright, MD OB/GYN, who is licensed to practice in the state of Georgia, was called in as a medical expert by the family of Dr. York to review the information and evidence that was brought in by the government/prosecution as early as Dec. 2002.  After his examination of the evidence and testimonies of the alleged victims, he found many what he termed 'consistent inconsistencies.'  This case was purely a 'hearsay' case! In child molestation cases it is the normal procedure to have medical examinations done within 72 hours of the alleged molestations, the acute stage of the alleged events, to obtain forensic evidence-skin, hair, semen, saliva, etc, from the genital areas. What Dr. Bright found was that no history of events was taken by the examiners to determine the level of evaluation necessary for each victim which is very critical. Some of the children had STD's, including Chlamydia and Herpes 1. Dr. York upon examination, was found to have had none of these diseases and did not even have the anti-bodies present to suggest that he was even treated for any of these diseases and had them cured. For the record, all of the alleged victims didn't have an STD. This shows an inconsistency. They all should have had the same STD, because they testified that Rev. Dr. York would go from one to the other. There was no DNA evidence ever found to suggest that Rev. York had engaged in any sexual acts with any of these alleged victims. There were no pregnancies. There were no testimonies of condoms being used and these girls were at the age of puberty. When interviewed, none of the children gave any exact dates of the ""molestations"" that occurred. This includes nothing about ""I remember because it was two days before my birthday."" They always gave very vague time frames, like it was the summer of 1998 or  it was the fall of 1999, which doesn't give a defendant anyway to prove he was not in said place at said time. Many of their testimonies contradicted each other about who was present when what they saw was supposedly happening to the other. There were also no mentions or testimonies by any of the alleged victims of any abortions or anything about each time Dr. York changed the bedding or anything about plastic covers on sheets. There were no recorded interviews or statements(written, audio, or visual) from the alleged victims that could be evaluated by the defense experts which means the government/prosecution could make any statements necessary to bring charges against the accused. This is very important because the absence of recorded interviews prevents scrutiny of the prosecutions statements by the defense. Also, in the event contradictory information is identified, the contradictions can easily be dismissed or explained away by the prosecution. THIS TYPE OF CONDUCT SUGGESTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT/PROSECUTION HAD NO INTEREST IN ACCURATELY RECORDING THEIR FINDINGS OR THE VICTIMS WERE GIVING UNRELIABLE STATEMENTS. WHICH EXPLAINS WHY THE COURT WAS CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC DURING THE TRIAL AND THE TRANSCRIPTS WERE SEALED AFTERWARDS!!!! 5 other children were taken from the Nuwaupian land that was called Tama-RE, Egipt of the West, without consent and knowledge of their parents and given examinations by state agencies and not one of them were found to be abused, sexually, mentally, or physically. 8 of the 13 who originally alleged abuse by Dr. York, recanted their own testimonies on sworn affidavits. Too add to that, many of their own immediate family testified against them and said they were lying The government's 'Star Witness', Abigail Washington, recanted her testimony of abuse as well on a sworn affidavit and even recanted her testimony that Rev. Dr. York was guilty of the money structuring charges. FBI LEAD INVESTIGATOR, JULAINE WARD, TESTIFIED UNDER OATH, IN COURT THAT SHE HAD NO EVIDENCE OR EYEWITNESSES TO PROVE OR SUGGEST THAT REV. YORK TRANSPORTED OR CAUSED TO BE TRANSPORTED, ANY CHILDREN FOR THE PURPOSE OF ILLICIT ACTS. NOTE TO THE READER: THIS WAS THE SOLE REASON FOR THE ENTIRE TRIAL!!!! Assistant D.A. Richard Moultrie, stated for the record that he had no video tapes to prove any of the allegations. This is important because supposedly, video tapes were said to have been made of Dr. York engaging in these alleged acts. In closing, I would like to add some little known facts about Rev. Dr. York that I found from doing a little research. Dr. York over the past 40 years has written more than 400 books on religious, scientific, and historical topics. THAT'S RIGHT 400 BOOKS!! Anyone who has written a dissertation, thesis paper, research paper, documentary, etc, knows how much energy and time goes into writings such as these. So ask yourself, ""How the heck does someone have enough time to write 400 books, yet alone do it while molesting 13 kids everyday, all day for over 10 years?"" IT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE!!"

He believed that this step can really help generate a a number of brand-new jobs for the US citizens as well as put China in their rightful position. He will as well avert American corporations from outsourcing their very own jobs, an operation which has had a harmful influence over the United States marketplace, causing the American citizens to give up countless job opportunities. His Personality It is definitely an undeniable fact that Donald Trump is definitely a straight-forward individual. He is one of the few individuals freely criticize Barack Obama regarding personal and political matters. For example, he has plainly said that Obama's national and international strategies have entirely failed for example he has ultimately failed to cure the issues with Iraq as a consequence of his poor negotiation skills . Having stated all these, choosing Donald Trump as Chief Executive would be the most brilliant issue that had ever happened towards the United States."

Moving Surveillance Surveillance on move signifies that this operation is conducted riding on a vehicle in a disguised way.

10,Private investigators to solve family and company problems,news-society," From literature and novel characters private investigators have now become professionals that are more and more often looked for to solve many different cases. Forget about the idea that you had of private investigators and that derived from the reading of novels or from a movie. Forget about Sherlock Holmes’ pipe and about his ancient clothes, as well as about the mishaps of the many James Bonds of them movies you might have seen. The figure of the private investigator, indeed, is much more ordinary than that, and what is even more important, the services of private investigators are not only requested to unmask a killer or to solve complicated international intrigues, but also to get to the bottom of more ordinary problems, concerning both the sphere of family and the world of work. The cases that private investigators are asked to solve are of various kind, from the classic marital infidelity to the control of idle employees. In any case, the job of a professional of investigations is seen as necessary to find the truth and solve complicated situations. In the family sphere, for example, the problems that can be solved, or at least brought to light, by a private investigator concern both the relationship between husband and wife and between parents and children. If the private investigator that has been hired to unmask the unfaithful husband or the treacherous wife is a sort of classic, there is also an increasing number of parents’ requests to have children shadowed. With the help from a specialist in this field, parents aim at discovering what their children do when they are not at home, and probably not even at school. Therefore the job of a private investigator, in an time when the eyes and care of parents do not seem to be enough to control teenage children, is added to the job of mum and dad, who often do not have the time to follow their liar and idle child nor the capacity to keep under control all the sources of danger – real or virtual – that might bring kids to ""perdition"". Other sector, same situation: also in the sphere of work the help of a good private investigator can be very useful. Private detectives are hired from companies to unmask idlers in suspicious poor health, who use the sick leave to go on holiday or to devote themselves to other jobs, sometimes for their company’s competitors. The work of investigators, in these cases, consists in controlling those people whose leaves are too frequent or suspicious and in proving their wrongdoing. Very often, in the case of employees that do not go to work to devote themselves to a second job, the fact is reported by their colleagues, and in this way they get investigations started. In this regard, in June the Italian Court of Cassation established the legitimacy of investigative actions ordered by employers to control potential wrongdoing of employees, unless the investigation concerns ordinary work activities. These are only a few cases in which private detective agencies are involved, agencies that are becoming more and more useful in different sectors to solve many different problems."
11,Wireless products to dominate future,news-society," The home of the future – say, 10 years down the road – will have fewer electrical wires, better products and cleaner air. The promise of better products has been around for decades, and will continue to be a promise. For example, today’s washing machines are much more desirable than the hand-wringing tubs of a generation ago. And, frost-free refrigerators are hands-down favorites over having to chip through blocks of freezer ice. Baby boomers well may remember the hand- wringing, freezer- chipping days of their parents and grandparents, but these same baby boomers will find that today’s products will yield to wonders for their kids. It doesn’t matter whether consumer products take a generation or a decade to change. They will change. And during the next 10 years, consumers could see several breakthroughs in household technologies. Some of these breakthroughs are taking root today. Here are some of the things sees on the horizon: Wireless communication and data transmission will usher in more cordless telephones, wireless hookups to the Internet and even electric lamps and small appliances that won’t use cords or cables. ""We’ll have an increased use of more powerful batteries, fuel cells, solar and other power sources,"" said Susan Brown, technology access leader in consumer products group. ""We can even envision devices to transfer energy from your outlets to lights, vacuum cleaners and other appliances without the use of wires,"". Energy conservation, as well, may be taking another twist. Instead of solar cells on the roof of a house to collect heat, shingles could transfer solar-generated electricity to the home – without having to use wiring. Smart filters on furnaces and air vents can reduce indoor air pollution and bacterial growth. Technology also could lead to antiallergenic and antibacterial surfaces, such as in the kitchen. Home health monitors can analyze nutrition and exercise programs as people spend more time indoors. Spring house cleaning won’t have to be done all by hand thanks to an in-home system that could determine which materials can be recycled. Even envisions home-based systems that will treat and recycle water. Imagine the reduced costs on the monthly water bill. We will enter the 21st century with wristwatch-style phones and specialized, handheld wireless computers. These could be used for online banking or planning entertainment activities. Miniaturized information also could lead to a phone book for the country that fits in the palm of the hand. Affordable HDTV (high-definition television) is something today’s consumers want. All products come down in price, but they also come with more features. Just look at how computers have changed over the years. HDTV – the digital TV sets of the future – could include not only functions for home computing, but also videoconferencing and networking. Computer games, music systems, video entertainment systems and even exercise equipment will get a lot more virtual through enhanced video and sound projections. Someone exercising on the treadmill could imagine running through a nature scene as its being projected onto a wall. If only it were today, we’ve feel a lot more secure about what the future holds in terms of error-free, easy-to-use electronic commerce. Security concerns, of course, will be a major element to using and accepting the ability to buy products over the Internet. Speak and ye shall be heard with the use of voice-activated products, ranging from televisions and computers to lights and other electronic products. Today, some home lighting can be controlled by sound-activated devices, and voice-recognition software is emerging from its infancy. DNA chips and bioelectric security may sound impossible, but these devices of the future will fill a need for new identification systems. Magnetic strips on the back of credit cards won’t be enough anymore. If its predictions prove true, consumers will see as much of a change in their lifestyles as has been seen during the past generation. Just as today’s adults had black-and-white televisions as children and now look forward to HDTV, today’s kids are growing up with computers while looking toward an anxious reality. http://microphone-wireless.us/?p=359"
12,OC’s Cigarette Initiative Looking To Grow,news-society," OCEAN CITY – A positive review of the town’s Cigarette Butt Beach Container initiative was presented this week. As Ocean City Surfrider Foundaion member Terry Steimer prepared for his report on the Cigarette Butt Beach Container initiative, he wheeled in a grocery cart of bags full of cigarette butts and placed it directly in front of the Mayor and City Council. Steimer’s report followed a discussion held last winter concerning smokers on the Boardwalk and the beach. The conclusion of that discussion was to start an initiative to educate smokers on designated smoking areas by placing cigarette butt containers in areas labeled smoking areas. According to Steimer, a meeting was held with representatives from the Public Works Maintenance Department, city administrators, and the Ocean City Surfrider Foundation. They had come to an agreement where cigarette receptacles would be placed at each street indicating a smoking area. Also, receptacles were installed between each beach street access about 50 feet off of the dunes and were also labeled smoking area. ""The idea was to provide a place not contiguous to bathers, convenient to smokers and in the end make it as convenient as possible,"" Steimer said. The city purchased 200 cigarette receptacles and on July 18 of last year 146 receptacles were placed from the Inlet to 142nd Street. ""Surfriders at that point in time thought that those receptacles were not going to be adequate because they were going to be blown all over the beach and picked up and misused for one reason or another, and we would never see them again,"" Steimer said. The Surfrider Foundation painted 10, 55 gallon drums red and placed them in ""hot areas"", where they thought more of an accumulation of cigarette butts would take place, such as in front of the Clarion and the Castle in the Sand because they sell alcohol on the beach. ""As it turns out, they were insignificant,"" Steimer said. ""We drilled holes in the tops of the cans that we thought were just big enough for cigarette butts but it turns out that any time you have a flat can on the beach people think it is a trash receptacle, and I am telling you they found a way to stick trash in that can."" At the end of the summer season, every cigarette receptacle was collected and an estimate was made that there were approximately 69,000 cigarette butts were recovered. ""That was the first year mind you that we have done this, and what we figured is there are over 60,000 conscience citizens who left their spot on the beach to go smoke, being good friendly people,"" Steimer said. Steimer acknowledged that a portion of the receptacles went missing due to weather or theft, but pointed out some were just moved to other locations. He asked the council to renew the initiative for the upcoming summer season. ""Terry I think they are great suggestions, a great presentation, and the council is coming into the budget time and I am sure we will take care of you,"" Council President Jim Hall said. Mayor Rick Meehan pointed out that the cigarette receptacles placed on the Boardwalk were used more often than the containers installed on the beach. ""I think that we want to keep that in mind as we get into the budget,"" he said. ""We prefer it if people didn’t smoke but if they are going to smoke we should have a few more of these on the Boardwalk for them to utilize."""

14,Reality Check: Breaking Down Obama's NDAA Signing Statement,news-society," The President issued a signing statement when he signed the National Defense Authorization Act into law. Conservatives are freaking out over the alleged hypocrisy of Obama's usage of a signing statement and the less hysterical are still confused as to what it really means, if indeed, it means anything. So, let's break it down. A signing statement is something of a public pronouncement a president might make about a bill they are signing into law. They have been used to clarify their positions or elaborate dissent. In modern times, they are used to direct executive agencies to interpret the law according to the President's interpretation of the Constitution. As such, Attorney General Eric Holder explained that the signing statement clarifies how the Obama administration views the law and how they (executive agencies like the DoJ) will interpret it. Obama used this signing statement to amend and clarify his administration's interpretation of NDAA, a bill he is already on record as objecting to. Due to the administration's objections and the ACLU's objections, the language in the original was clarified and changed. However, all law is open to interpretation and can't be taken alone - the NDAA in concert with the Patriot Act, for example, could be interpreted to mean something much differently than the Obama administration would want to agree to - thus, the signing statement. Jason Easley reported on the NDAA signing statement (emphasis mine, to draw attention to specific areas of Presidential dissent and interpretation): In his signing statement attached to the NDAA, President Obama made it clear that the language about detentions does not apply to US citizens. In the second paragraph of his NDAA signing statement, Obama stated, ""The fact that I support this bill as a whole does not mean I agree with everything in it. In particular, I have signed this bill despite having serious reservations with certain provisions that regulate the detention, interrogation, and prosecution of suspected terrorists. Over the last several years, my Administration has developed an effective, sustainable framework for the detention, interrogation and trial of suspected terrorists that allows us to maximize both our ability to collect intelligence and to incapacitate dangerous individuals in rapidly developing situations, and the results we have achieved are undeniable. Our success against al-Qa'ida and its affiliates and adherents has derived in significant measure from providing our counterterrorism professionals with the clarity and flexibility they need to adapt to changing circumstances and to utilize whichever authorities best protect the American people, and our accomplishments have respected the values that make our country an example for the world."" The president explained why he signed the NDAA, ""Against that record of success, some in Congress continue to insist upon restricting the options available to our counterterrorism professionals and interfering with the very operations that have kept us safe. My Administration has consistently opposed such measures. Ultimately, I decided to sign this bill not only because of the critically important services it provides for our forces and their families and the national security programs it authorizes, but also because the Congress revised provisions that otherwise would have jeopardized the safety, security, and liberty of the American people. Moving forward, my Administration will interpret and implement the provisions described below in a manner that best preserves the flexibility on which our safety depends and upholds the values on which this country was founded."" Conservatives are doing backflips excoriating Obama for allegedly reversing his earlier critiques about Bush's egregious use of signing statements. They think Obama issuing a signing statement about NDAA makes him a hypocrite for condemning Bush for his use of signing statements. However, the issue was never the use of the signing statement but rather the overuse of them and the overreach included. George W. Bush ""routinely asserted that he would not act contrary to the constitutional provisions that direct the president to 'supervise the unitary executive branch.'"" Conservatives are ignoring this reality, as well as pretending that suddenly they are against a unitary executive as adored by the authoritarian conservatives of the modern day Republican Party. Bush used signing statements as a way of explaining that if he disagreed with a law or thought it conflicted with the powers he held as unitary executive, he would simply not enforce it. Signing statements have been issued by all modern Presidents, and that the objection to Bush's use of them was not that he executed them, but the number of them he executed and the expansion of powers he granted to himself in the doing. In his book, Broken Government: How Republican Rule Destroyed the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial Branches, John W. Dean points out that there are two metrics for measuring the use of signing statements: Both the number of them issued and the number of provisions within a bill that the President issues a statement about. It isn't just the number of signing statements, but the challenges to the provisions with each law. For example, President Bush challenged 1,100 provisions of the law in his signing statements, which is more than all of his previous presidents combined. 78% of Bush's signing statements raised constitutional objections compared to 18% for President Clinton, 47% for George H.W. Bush and 34% for Ronald Reagan. We see that President Bush took the theory of the unitary executive to the extreme, pushing the boundaries until it overrode the checks and balances of the other branches of government. John W. Dean calls this type of ""presidential autocracy"" the natural result of authoritarian conservatism. The Boston Globe wrote that Bush had assumed the right to disobey more than 750 laws since he took office, ""...declaring that he (Bush) has the power to set aside the laws when they conflict with his legal interpretation of the Constitution. The federal government is instructed to follow the statements when it enforces the laws."" (Rather scary on a number of levels, not the least of which was Bush's rather infamous scorn for the discipline of academic pursuit.) Bush once wrote in a signing statement that he would, ""(C)onstrue Title X in Division A of the Act, relating to detainees, in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the President to supervise the unitary executive branch and as Commander in Chief and consistent with the constitutional limitations on the judicial power."" President Bush issued more challenges to provisions in the laws than all other Presidents combined and he expanded the powers of the executive branch within his statements to include overriding the legislative and judicial branches of government. Signing statements have been the subject of much controversy, as the Constitution does not allow a President to ignore a law via a signing statement, something George W Bush announced was his right as President. The President may not circumvent, disobey, or ignore any enacted Congressional Law. The President is granted three options: sign it into law, veto it in its entirety and return to the body responsible, or do nothing. The debate about signing statements can be framed around the interpretation of the unitary executive theory, based on Article II of the Constitution. John W. Dean explains the dangers of taking the unitary executive theory to its extreme, ""In its most extreme form, unitary executive theory can mean that neither Congress nor the federal courts can tell the President what to do or how to do it, particularly regarding national security matters."" In 2006, Laurence H. Tribe writing about then President Bush's use of signing statements explained on the Boston.com, ""It's not the statements that are the true source of constitutional difficulty. On the contrary, signing statements, which a president can issue to indicate the way he intends to direct his administration to construe ambiguous statutes, are informative and constitutionally unobjectionable."" Tribe went on to explain that the challenge should be to the President for ignoring the law (as Bush did) or for harm that came to others as a result of it (e.g., enemy combatants). He also pointed out that Presidents should face the political music of a veto leading to an override rather than ignore a law. In this case, President Obama is not indicating he intends to ignore the law; rather he is clarifying his interpretation of it. However purists could argue that he should have vetoed the law if he disagreed with it, even though he faced an override of his veto. However, had he done so, the law could have been implemented without the signing statement clarification of what he found to be ambiguous language. Conservatives who criticize Obama for his use of a signing statement are being disingenuous and might want to recall back when President Clinton finally figured out that the expanded powers conservatives had used to deregulate could be just as easily used to regulate. Many liberals would like to see President Obama operate more as a unitary executive than he does. They'd like to see Obama operate like President Clinton did with certain regulations. President Obama is not the autocratic president the right pretends he is and the some of the left wish he were. The NDAA signing statement does not change the law; but it does direct the executive agencies, including the Department of Justice, as to how this administration will interpret the law. To wit, according to this administration, it will not apply to US citizens. The more pertinent question is not will this apply to US citizens as it will not under the Obama administration, but why the Senate Armed Services Committee is ignoring the very effective defense and security tactics of the Obama administration, and still pushing for a McCain approach. There was way too much of the ""give up your freedoms for security"" flavor to this law in its original form; and we should be asking why, when the Obama administration's approach has been more than effective. The real issue, as I have been writing since the inception of this debacle, is the Senate's continued push for McCain type military trials versus Obama civilian trials and the political agenda behind refusing to fund the closure of Gitmo. The push toward militarization continues, and a wise America will wake up to the folks behind this (John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Carl Levin, etc) and start to demand change from them as well.

15,Iran On The Path Of Demonizing Technology: Constantly Jamming Satellite Signals And Banning Free Internet Access And Social Medi,news-society," by Michael Orfanos Within the past few months, a wide number of news reporters and news agencies around the world have underlined the importance of free  internet access, satellite news and social media, in shaping the world politics  in the wider Mediterranean area (meaning Northern Africa and Middle East)-the so called: ""Arab Spring"" that swept  through a number of countries and brought down authoritarian regimes and replaced them with democratic governments. For decades the  people of those countries were governed by authoritarian regimes and were denied their rights, however technology was able to overcome the state barriers and reach the people. In mid 2009, foreign press reporters made a significant revelation: that people in Egypt (primarily)  Libya, Yemen and other countries, were using satellite dishes in order to be informed by foreign news channels-thus bypassing the local propaganda from the state owned channels- and they were using free internet access and Social Media in order to communicate with each other and organize into demonstrator groups. For example, a member of the central committee of the demonstrators in Egypt had more than 90.000 followers in his Twitter account. Since then, most authoritarian regimes in the above described area have collapsed and are in the process of implementing democratic reforms. However, Iran is persistently trying to oppose this democratization wave-better known as ""Arab Spring"". More specifically, the Iranian government is constantly jamming satellite frequencies of all Western channels and bans access to  Internet and Social Media sites.It is estimated that around 50-65% of the Iranian people are watching satellite TV. Instead of using the state media agencies in order to get informed, Iranians prefer using BBC, Voice of America and other similar Western channels. Accordingly, the number of Iranians using Internet and Social Media is estimated around 20-23%. What is ironic is the fact that at the same time, the Iranian government is using international airwaves in order to operate freely on an international level and broadcast state propaganda to Iranians living abroad: ""Iran is having it both ways"" says a US State Department official. ""It is basically a win /win situation for Iran. They are propagandizing on an International level while at the same time they are jamming all foreign satellites, banning all Western news agencies sites and Social Media"". Some human rights activists call for reciprocal banning of the Iranian state governed news agencies operating worldwide: Shirin Edabi an Iranian lawyer and Nobel Peace Prize winner agrees ""...until the Iranian government learns to respect freedom of expression and freedom of free information"".  The EU also called on Tehran to ""lift restrictions on communications, including internet censorship and put an immediate end to jamming of satellite broadcasting"".Iran was also referred to Jeebboo (www.jeebboo.com) latest quiz questions: More specifically the question was ""Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is President in which of the following countries: A. Iraq  B. Iran or C. Saudi Arabia"". Popular internet quiz games are also considered a threat by the Iranian regime thus are banned."

17,The Surprise Baby Shower,news-society," I have been to countless showers throughout the years; wedding showers and baby showers, for various friends, relatives and co-workers.  Many of them were merely social obligations and have long been forgotten.  Some of them were quite enjoyable and remain as fond memories.  One baby shower I will never forget. The baby shower was for a close friend, who was also a co-worker.  My friends and I spent many hours planning this shower.  We wanted to get every detail of planning just right.  We spent so much time planning that it seemed like the days just zoomed by.  Almost before we realized it, the baby was due in four weeks. We had pooled our resources and our baby gift ideas in an effort not to duplicate items.  At the top of the list was a crib.  After the crib was allotted for, we spent the remainder of the funds buying layettes, a few items of baby clothing and one very precious little white rocking chair.  The Recreation Hall had been reserved. My friend’s mother and sisters had also been invited. The day of The Surprise Baby Shower arrived and I contrived to get my friend to the Recreation Hall.  I pretended that the shower was for someone else.  She finally agreed to accompany me ""to a shower"", just long enough for me to drop off my gift.  That day had arrived clear and windy as March days can sometimes by.  I bundled my toddler and strapped him into his car seat in the back seat of the car. When we arrived at the Hall, we ""oohed"" and ""ahhed"" at the decorations.  On the center table was a white sheet cake with multiple colored decorations in the shapes of diaper pins, little toy chests and little replicas of baby furniture!  My friend’s mom was sitting with her hands on the top of a child’s bookcase. When Shannon, my friend, saw her mom with the gift she realized that the baby shower was for her and started to cry.  She was so happy!  The Surprise Baby Shower was a huge success. We had played several games.  In the Baby Items Word Scramble game, we unscrambled all of the words, except for ""baby comforter.""  In a Find the Word game, every single word was found, including ""kid’s beddings."" Not a present had been unwrapped when Shannon announced that it was time for her to go to the hospital as she thought that it was time for the baby to come.  Shannon and her mother left.  We continued the shower.  Her sisters unwrapped the presents.  I served the punch and snacks.  Everyone was in a good mood and happy for Shannon.  Everyone felt so good that they generously helped with the pick up and the packing of the baby shower gifts into Shannon’s sister’s truck.  They even helped with sweeping and mopping the floor. We were rearranging the tables and chairs, after the floor had dried, when several cell phones started to ring.  I looked at my cell phone, retrieved my new picture mail, and there was Shannon with her new baby, David.  As I looked around, I could see several of Shannon’s relatives holding up their cell phones.  They were all smiling and talking about the baby.  We jokingly declared David an official guest of the baby shower! Written By Maudry M. Miller Kidsource.Biz"

19,The Social Contract & Criminal Justice,news-society," The ‘Social Contract’ was first introduced around the 17th and 18th centuries by a group of thinkers including Thomas Hobbes, John Locke and Jean Jacques Rousseau. The underlying idea is the basic assumption that an individual will agree to give up some of their freedom in return for their freedom to not be imposed upon by others. It often falls to the state in order to police the line between different individual’s freedoms. Due to the ongoing malfunctions of the global economy we have seen a rise in the number of protest groups across the world. These protests have range from outright industrial strikes that pull individuals together to march against supposed wrongs, to the disparate Occupy movements that have been seen across the world, to the so called ‘Arab Spring’ where revolutions have occurred across the Middle East and North Africa. In order to contain these protests, enforcement teams have been employed to confront supposed activists who have sought to cause damage to property and individuals. It is at this point where we have to ask at what point does a protest become a dangerous situation? The argument over the strength of the supposed resistance by police officers has come to the fore with incidents in the U.K. where protestors are often combatted by policing methods which including ‘kettling’. This is where protestors are contained in a small area, often forcibly, and not allowed to leave. Secondly, the recent images of a police officer using pepper-spray on students at a peaceful protest at a U.S. university were described as, ""chilling"" by the chancellor of the University of California. It is incidents such as these that are driving the current debate over whether the ‘Social Contract ‘is breaking down. Questions are being asked and society itself is now asking whether a new idea is needed to consider how to form a political community in the face of ongoing economical, political, and societal fractures. There are a number of online schools which provide courses where students can study such activities. Indeed, by studying an online Criminal Justice degree, individuals will learn about law enforcement and, for example, how the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights apply to criminal law in that country. There is a great range of online degrees catering for students of Criminal Justice from a range of online schools. Whether you are interested in studying a Bachelor of Criminal Justice or a Master’s degree in Criminal Justice the range of topics available enable the student to learn more about the ‘Social Contract’ within a framework that covers a variety of topics. The average cost of a Criminal Justice degree can range from $12,000 a year to anything up to $25,000. If considering a career in Criminal Justice, it would be worth looking in to online schools which can generally provide online Criminal Justice degrees for a fraction of the cost of actually attending face-to-face lessons at another university."

8,"The Electronic Component Counterfeiting Battle, Where Will It End?",news-society," Fake or counterfeit electronic components continue to flood the U.S. supply chains, recently the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee held hearings on this issue, based on investigations that counterfeit electronic components had found their way into Department of Defense supply chains and in turn into devices and components that were installed in military equipment. The Senate hearing spoke of investigations that have been performed showing that the false electronic parts were coming from China. During the investigation the U.S. Senate contacted the Chinese embassy requesting access to China to investigate its findings and asked for more information from the Chinese government. The Chinese government however denied any access and information, citing that the outcome could be hurtful to the U.S. – China relationship. Chairman to the Senate of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin said ""they (the Chinese government) have it backwards, they have the ability to stop this counterfeiting"", ""They’re going to have to stop it or they’re going to pay a heavy price if we start inspecting all of their parts that are coming into this country"", Levin stating, that like some imported products in the U.S., a process could be put in place to inspect every electronic component coming from China and the cost of the inspections would be on the shipping companies. Throughout the hearing the senators described some of the processes involved in the creation and manufacturing of counterfeit products, putting an emphasis on that fact that a lot of the production comes from China processing electronic waste (e-waste) that it receives from many countries, the largest supplier of e-waste to China is the U.S. The fact that the biggest producer of counterfeit electronic components (China) is getting its biggest supply of electronic waste from the U.S. outlines both the problem and the solution. Rather than the U.S. government putting pressure on the Chinese government to take a stand on counterfeiting production within its borders, the U.S. can look at how it deals with its electronic waste. One solution could be to stop shipping electronic waste to China altogether, but this would in turn jeopardize local U.S. jobs and the recycling industry. Another solution could be to process the electronic waste to a point where it is not able to be used in counterfeiting production, rather than shipping raw electronic waste that is still largely intact. Once the e-waste is processed to a point that makes it useless to the counterfeiters it can then be shipped to China where it could be processed correctly as e-waste and not used for other purposes. The U.S., rather than expecting other countries to cooperate by taking measures within their own borders the U.S. can take the initiative and stem the supply of products that are being used in the production of counterfeiting components, by attacking part of the problem at its real source would in turn promote change in other countries."

10,Duty Belts Usefulness,news-society," Police personnel on duty need to have their hands clear to help them in their duties. At the same time they need to carry around a lot of equipment that needs to be used during the performance of their duties. This is where duty belts come in handy. They are belts that are made of leather or nylon and are designed in such a way, that they can carry a lot of equipment that can be just as easily accessed whenever it is needed. Because of this requirement for carrying equipment these belts are quite broad, over 2 inches, and those made of leather are quite stiff and have caused back problems. Modern day police forces have thus switched to making belts from nylon as these remain more flexible and are also more long lasting. Some police forces use vests instead of duty belts to carry the same amount of equipment. Equipment normally carried on duty belts can include handcuffs, baton, radios, protection devices like sprays, and the inevitable firearm along with ammunition. Duty belts will also carry flashlights, gloves, keys, pens and pencils. The equipment carried may vary from police force to police force and may even have things like first aid kits, CPR masks etc. Most duty belts are designed in such a way that the holders that carry the equipment can be changed in position and can be adjusted as per the working comfort of the individual officer. The weight of these belts increases substantially after the equipment is in place and can go out of position when an officer is moving about. This requires that such belts have belt keepers to ensure that the belt with the equipment remains in the same position at all times. Duty belts have always been given a lot of importance by police forces. These belts allow much needed equipment to be carried about by an officer during his or her normal duties and all these pieces of equipment remain easily accessible and can be instantly at hand when needed. The weight of such equipment can be almost 15 pounds and it is not easy for an officer on duty to carry this around. The duty belt completely simplifies this problem and also ensures that all equipment is immediately at hand when needed. For instance, when an officer is chasing and holding on to a fleeing fugitive, the handcuffs needed to restrain the culprit can be easily at hand and be ready for use almost instantly when it is taken from the duty belt.  Similarly reporting to headquarters can be immediate through the radios or other call back devices that are in their pouches in the duty belt. Duty belts are nowadays custom made so that they fit each officer correctly and comfortably. A lot of research and design capabilities have gone into the making and newer materials that enhance performance, looks and durability are constantly being used. Police equipment itself is also undergoing a lot of changes both for effectiveness, weight and technical advances. This requires duty belt manufacturers to constantly keep these advances in mind so that their belts continue to give the sort of assistance to officers that they require during their law enforcement duties."
11,The Safe Streets and Communities Act Restricts Some Canadian Pardons,news-society," The Tory Government, led by the Honourable Rob Nicholson, Conservative M.P. for Niagara Falls has brought forward the Safe Streets and Communities Act (2011), fulfilling its Speech from the Throne promise to re-introduce law-and-order legislation to combat crime and terrorism. The current Canadian version of the Conservative Parliament re-introduced some reforms debated in the last session to The Safe Streets and Communities Act, stating a commitment to law and order. Canada's Harper government and the 41st parliament introduced the September 20, 2011 new legislation designed to restrict the ability of certain types of criminals to obtain pardons for their offenses to qualify for jobs. This is meant to filter them out from employment where they would be a risk around children, the ill, or the elderly. There is an emphasis on protection against violent and sexual crimes, especially against those who are underage. The law is made to protect the young; there are also sections that generally state that criminals will have less access to the public and more difficulty finding work when that job is one where a clear criminal record is an important requirement. Minister Nicholson stated: ""I am proud today to announce that our Government has fulfilled its commitment to Canadians to produce legislation to make our streets, families and communities safer. ""We campaigned on a promise to get tough on child sexual offenders, crack down on illegal drug trafficking, and improve the overall efficiency of our judicial system. Canadians gave us a strong mandate to bring forward these reforms."" They used this chance to announce laws such as The Protecting Children from Sexual Predators Act (former Bill C-54); The Ending House Arrest for Property and Other Serious Crimes by Serious and Violent Offenders Act; Sebastien's Law (Protecting the Public from Violent Young Offenders); The Penalties for Organized Drug Crime Act: The Increasing Offender Accountability Act; The Keeping Canadians Safe Act; The Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act - and other great-sounding titles that further enhance the justice system to whatever amount that may or may not affect you. Another part of the law doubles the minimum sentence for marijuana production from 7 years to 14, but go on to include an aggravating factor of ""for the purposes of organized crime"" ….but who's going to define what type of crime will be called organized. A small conspiracy of a criminal nature is organized but they're not hiding around every corner or necessarily a violent threat to the public. Their lawyers could have an uphill battle proving that they're not The Mob when the police might have a couple of bags of evidence and a list of phone numbers. It may not be a definition stretched out too far right now but ideally we should be seeing a better society with more freedom with more freedom where a pardon application isn't the only thing standing between a person and a job. The Government, however, wants to make it clear that some offenses are off-limits when young victims are involved. The Act provides provisions to increase higher penalties for possession of date-rape drugs in order to cut down on the incidents involving GHB and flunitrazepam, by moving these up to a higher drug category, schedule 1. Penalties have been increased for offences involving dealing drugs around schoolyards or to children. Moreover it will be taken more seriously when drugs are produced nearby and constitute a hazard to the children in the immediate area. Long called for by many I'm sure, but as we all know most good law is common sense; when laying down rules you should keep in mind that more laws lead to more laws. The Judge who rules on each law may have some draconian sentences up his sleeve if he comes upon a case that qualifies. The Canadian pardons process as it is spelled out in The Safe Streets and Communities Act won't guarantee certain types of employment to every ex-offender."

But there is a world unknown to many but a few other well-known for, the world of sound systems. This is an area unfamiliar to many for various reasons, the first may be because it is not very appealing to have a sound system that only used a few times and not least other reason is that people are unaware of these teams and to believe that only experts can connect and / or use. Another reason is that only few companies are involved in the creation and distribution of sound systems, this makes their product unremarkable, but the truth is that the sound systems in cars and houses are popular in a lot of people. But another reason is that a good sound system on the market can reach astronomical figures, which would not be a good investment considering that this sound system is not being used very often, like computers, ipads and cellular phones. But in big Cities large as New York, there is the possibility of renting sound systems of excellent quality and latest technology, this makes for our major events, meetings or parties do not have to buy a big expensive sound system, or a very bad a low price, but we now have the opportunity to rent this service for a reasonable price and right time, the best quality."

16,The Benefits of Online Fundraising Explained,news-society," The problem with community level fundraising has always been the volume of support available. You will always be limited to the individuals that you can reach with your fundraising events in the local area. Now with the internet, your area of influence and potential participants has increased from hundreds, to millions. When the internet was in its infancy, it wasn't possible to incite such a level of participation that social networking and community websites have done. In this article I will explain the methods that you can use your online connectivity to expand your fundraising efforts. The first, most obvious advantage is the fact that you have such a massive audience to hear all of your great ideas, and there is already a plethora of organisations and websites dedicated to helping the destitute and needy. Online fundraising is now so incredibly easy there are websites that provide you with a direct money transfer to your chosen charity once the act of arranged fundraising has been completed. These websites have proven incredibly effective in online fundraising efforts the site ""JustGiving"" was used in collaboration with the 2009 'Rage Against The Machine' UK number 1 chart attempt and raised over £40,000 in correlation with this event and considering this was a fan lead movement shows just how powerful an idea or event can become if people get involved. The downside of having so many online charities to donate to is that they aren't subject to as much external auditing and accounting checks as well-known community based charities. There have been many reports of fraudulent online charities being set up not for maximising human well-being, but to purely pull a profit for the owners of the website. You would be highly advised to investigate a charity that you've heard about online thoroughly before running a fundraising a campaign for them. Do they have charity status and certification? The charities that have this status are regularly audited and could be considered trustworthy. If you are ever unsure of a charity's full credentials you should check with the authorities before giving them your account details or giving a donation. With the sheer scope of the internet you're bound to find thousands or even millions of people with the same passion for cause related fundraising as you do. It's simply about getting your message out there on the new generation of charity social networks, videos on YouTube and articles online. Feedback to the people who are supporting you can be given through blog posts, images or even videos. Participating in the online community for raising money has never been easier, and is only a few clicks away!"

18,Understanding Dia de los Muertos,news-society," Dia de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, is a special day that has existed for thousands of years with religious connotations in Latin America, where it continues to be followed faithfully and is now celebrated in America. The holiday holds a special place in the hearts of Mexicans, when family and friends gather to pray for and remember loved ones who have died, oftentimes with elaborate homemade altars. It is a more spiritual than solemn day, which begins on the eve of November 1 on All Saints’ Day and is celebrated on November 2. The special day bears little resemblance to the other holiday it follows, Halloween, since it is not associated with evil spirits or scary situations and has nothing in common with the new entertainment landscape filled with vampires, werewolves and zombies. Dia de los Muertos is not, as is often said, the Latino Halloween. The day of celebration falls close to Halloween so a link is often made, but for marketers hoping to grasp insights into Dia de los Muertos, there is a delicate balance for the Spanish-language dominant Latino. U.S. Hispanics enjoy Halloween, but they celebrate both holidays separately and in their own way, from generation to generation. Dia de los Muertos is a respectful yet colorful day filled with happiness and remembrance. Some marketers have already tapped into the growing market by offering some of the items that are often needed to make an altar complete on Dia de los Muertos: Families set up altars at home brimming with fresh flowers, oftentimes sweet-smelling yellow marigolds, or cempasúchil, as the flowers are known in Mexico; pan de muertos (bread for the dead) is often sold in Hispanic-friendly neighborhoods and is set out as a symbolic gesture for the person being remembered; a cup of water is left out for the person who has passed away to ""drink"" after a long journey, along with favorite foods; candles are placed nearby to light the way and to provide warmth; and decorative sugar skulls can be bought or made at home. These rituals are in fact unique and can seem a bit unorthodox to non-Hispanics unaccustomed to discussing death so openly. Dia de los Muertos is often misunderstood because it may seem almost too festive. If it is, that’s because for many Latinos honoring the dead means being happy to have had that person in their life. A growing number of pint-size ceramic skulls and skeletons found in storefront windows in predominately Hispanic neighborhoods pay tribute to the holiday, but these figurines are often dressed in elegant attire and carry a musical instrument or are placed in jaunty positions. The calaveras (skulls) and skeletons commonly used to mark the day are more figurative, not spooky like the ones used during Halloween. To mark the occasion, skull-bearing T-shirts, cards, calendars and coffee mugs are beginning to be found in traditionally less Hispanic neighborhoods which shows that the holiday has trickled into our ""mainstream"" culture. Latin American culture is so vast and so multifaceted that honoring the dead should not come as a surprise. It is a different way of approaching life, even after a loved one has died."

20,Hydroelectric Energy,news-society," Hydroelectric energy is within laymen's terms what it really seems like, hydroelectric energy created from water–particularly moving water. Presently, hydroelectricity is undoubtedly typically the most popular type of alternative energy, and supplies between 15-20% from the world's electricity. Generally, hydroelectric energy originates from the possibility energy of dammed water. The dammed water drives a water turbine and generator, which in turn converts the energy into electricity. What is Hydroelectric Energy Hydroelectricity Energy is most generally created by using dams, However particularly in places that you will find large flowing rivers and ponds to attract water from. Because of this, places like Canada, with large, intricate waterway systems make the most of this kind of energy. Furthermore they energy residential areas, however they may also actually energy energy-intensive industries like aluminum smelting along with other industrial activities. Hydroelectricity Energy can also be fairly clean. Although fossil fuel is consumed in the making of the dam, there are virtually no carbon pollutants past the dam's initial construction in non-tropical regions. Exactly the same isn't true for tropical regions; however, as hydroelectric energy plants happen to be observed to create considerable amounts of methane and co2 when the surrounding forest isn't removed. This really is because of the truth that plant-existence decays within the flooded areas in an alarming rate, creating methane, in addition to more compact levels of co2. Out of the box also reiterated below, positioning is essential if this involves creating a hydroelectric dam. Regrettably, hydroelectricity energy is certainly not without its problems. Planning hydroelectric energy projects frequently overlooks the harm to marine habitats and environments also to the nearby indigenous towns, and also requires relocating whenever a dam is made because of flooding within their towns. This kind of callousness is exactly what rapidly becomes problematic with dams. Organizers need to be especially careful when directing river ways to be able to prevent any harsh long-term effects on individuals that rely on water, whether human or animal, also to conserve historic monuments along with other sites of cultural significance. For example, while dams may be used to prevent flooding when water levels rise beyond normal levels, in the region around Burns Lake, Bc, Canada, a whole village was instructed to relocate because of flooding from the making of a dam. Hydroelectric Energy doesn't pollute water or even the air However, hydroelectric energy facilities might have large environment impacts by altering the atmosphere and affecting land use, houses, and natural settings within the dam area. Most hydroelectric energy plants possess a dam along with a reservoir These structures may obstruct seafood migration and affect their populations. Operating a hydroelectric energy plant could also alter the temperature of water and also the river's flow. These changes may harm native plants and creatures within the river as well as on land. Tanks may cover individual's houses, important natural areas, farming land, and ancient sites. So building dams can require moving people. Methane, a powerful green house gas, could also form in certain tanks and become released towards the atmosphere."

2,Medical Malpractice May Not Cost So Much After All,news-society," There has been a great deal of talk about the topic of medical malpractice with many people advocating that reform is much needed.  It’s been said that medical malpractice has driven up the cost of health care in the United States.  The traditional way of reforming medical malpractice is to put a cap put on damages paid by a doctor.  Others have recommended limiting the ability of patients to sue.  However, a recent study by Harvard researchers may change the way we look at malpractice reform. The Harvard University study found that the medical liability system only amounts to 2.4 percent of American health care expenditures.  Furthermore, the study also suggests that the cost of medical malpractice lawsuits is below one percent of the $55.6 billion spent on health care in the U.S. in 2008. The study took into account judgements granted to malpractice plaintiffs, defensive medicine costs, administrative costs such as lawyer fees, and the costs of lost work time. This study sheds some light on the bigger picture of health care costs. Malpractice reform may not be as big an issue as economists and politicians are making it out to be. In light of the debate regarding reforming medical malpractice laws, a recent article written by Peter Orszag at the New York Times offers this proposal for reform: ""[A]nyone who could demonstrate that he has followed the recommended course for treating a specific illness or condition could not be held liable."" Peter Orszag’s idea has been met with disapproval from other journalists and members of the medical community.  They say that allowing the use of guidelines raises issues of fairness.  Orszag’s idea also doesn’t take into account the differences in patients’ health situations. Another issue with medical malpractice as it pertains to reform is the cost of malpractice insurance rates.  There’s the belief among hospital associations that having a cap will lower medical malpractice insurance rates.  Meanwhile, many trial lawyers say that states that do have caps on damages have seen no decrease in malpractice insurance premiums.  They believe that damages lawsuits are the best ways to protect patients. Even if malpractice reform isn’t considered in the current health care bill, the medical community should not allow lawmakers to keep them from focusing on what they believe is in the best interests of the patient.  As long as health care practitioners offer the best possible care and are protected with medical malpractice insurance, they should not have to worry about anything else."
3,Google Invests in the Power of Pig Poop,news-society," Google just announced that it has been carbon neutral since 2007, and the internet giant also recently unveiled plans to invest in pig poop as a form of renewable energy. Working in collaboration with Duke University and Duke Energy, the company will share funding for a poo-powered methane power plant in Yadkinville for five years. Using poop from the 9,000 hogs, the facility can produce enough electric power to run 35 homes for an entire year. The state of the art facility, located outside of Winston-Salem, burns off the methane gas that is emitted from rotting pig poop. The burned gas is then used to power a turbine, which creates electricity. The model plant is a $1.2 million prototype, built to showcase North Carolina’s quest to promote renewable energy sources. Aside from providing renewable energy, the Loyd Ray Farms plant also greatly reduces greenhouse gas emissions. The plant operates by burning methane – which is a powerful greenhouse gas that is is naturally released by pig poop as it decomposes. The plant utilizes the methane, rather than releasing it into the atmosphere. So how does it work? Large quantities of animal waste are mixed with lots of grass in a tower. Bacteria then break it all down, producing methane, which is siphoned off, cleaned and filtered.This biogas fuels a large engine to produce renewable electricity. The process also has additional environmental side benefits, reducing animal waste problems associated with manure disposal on farms. The odor is reduced, and weed seeds and pathogens are killed during the digestion process The gas is then used to power an engine which in turn powers a generator. With Google’s help, the plant will operate at full force, in effect preventing the equivalent of 5,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere each year. Google’s investment in the poo power plant will give the company additional carbon offset credits, make use of excrement, prevent greenhouse emissions equivalent to 900 cars, and create renewable energy. Sounds like a win-win-win to us. As a side note: With revenue from pig products getting smaller every year, some farmers from rural England have decided to make some extra money by turning poo into profit. James Hart, who runs a pig farm, came up with a simple solution of using the huge amount of pig faeces, cow dung and chicken droppings on his farm to generate electricity. It may look unremarkable from the outside, but inside Glebe Farm there is a state-of-the-art biogas station. It's one of only a few in the UK, which has been slower than many of its European neighbours in developing renewable energies such as wind turbines and solar panels."
4,Beware of Polls a Year Before the Election,news-society," I had written an article in June advising that we shouldn't jump to conclusions too early during the presidential primaries. In 2007-08, the lead among the primary candidates changed often. Now that we're a year out, you'd think we'd be getting closer to knowing whom the GOP will choose as its candidate. But do you remember who was leading the polls in November of 2007? Me neither. So I did a little Googling. As somebody who tracks polls, I've always liked how Real Clear Politics averages the results across multiple polls. As of November 11th, 2007, candidate Rudy Giuliani was leading the Republican field. And not just by a little. According to the RCP average, Giuliani held a significant 12.4 point lead with 29.4% of those polled favoring him for the GOP nomination. Giuliani looked like somebody who could bridge the gap between conservative Republicans and the more independent, moderate side of the party. Here were the top six candidates four years ago this month: Giuliani: 29.4% Thompson: 17% McCain: 15% Romney: 12.4% Huckabee: 9% Paul: 3.8% That's five candidates with at least 9% of the vote. Thompson disappeared quickly leaving the GOP with four vying for the party's nomination. Even after the first few primaries, it was a fairly tight race between Giuliani, McCain, Romney and Huckabee. Guiliana and McCain were fighting for the moderate vote. Romney and Huckabee were fighting for the conservative vote. When Guiliana dropped out right before Super Tuesday, it left McCain with little competition for moderate Republicans. And if you look at the Democrats in November of 2007, Hillary had a huge lead over Obama. According to Gallup, Clinton held a 27 point lead with 48% favoring her for the party nomination compared to 21% for Obama. Obama was gaining a little ground, but not much. And Edwards was certainly still in play. Here's the Democratic field according to Gallup on November 16th, 2007: Clinton: 48% Obama: 21% Edwards: 12% Kucinich: 4% Biden: 2% Richardson: 2% The moral of the story? There's nothing new about what's going on in the Republican party as they weed through their candidates. Primaries are a messy process. The party doesn't unite behind a candidate until late in the process. How about today? The newest CBS poll has a virtual three-way tie between Cain, Romney and Gingrich: Cain: 18% Romney: 15% Gingrich: 15% Perry: 8% Paul: 5% Bachmann: 4% Santorum: 2% Huntsman: 1% Conclusion: Perry is still positioned well enough despite his many stumbles to make this a four horse race. It's hard to imagine Paul, Bachmann, Santorum or Huntsman making a run at this point. And like 2008, I don't think we'll know for sure until Super Tuesday, which was the day that basically anointed John McCain as the GOP nominee four years ago. Prediction: I still think it's Romney's race to lose. But he could sure lose it."
5,Volunteering Services – Participate with Children to Grow Your Acumen,news-society," Before we begin our righteous journey throwing light on the diverse aspects of volunteering services when it comes to participating with children, let’s get ourselves acquainted with ""volunteering services."" In simple words, volunteering services are those services that are chosen by those individuals that morally share their time and knowledge without receiving any payment for their services rendered. If you are keen to invest your time volunteering for the advancement of children so that you can enormously contribute to their development and would like to augment their overall skills, you can lay your hands on countless organizations that provide such devout services immaculately. Why volunteer work with children reaps you the benefits at every stage? There are numerous high school and college students nowadays that find teen volunteer work to be stimulating and satiating. There is simply no end to the rising number of more and more teens who are getting concerned all the time for such a dignified cause. There are a few high schools that make the volunteers work with children and other kinds of volunteer work. You can lay your sight at some enthusiastic teens who are involved in charity work with a variety of charitable agencies that benevolently provide services for children and adults. Nothing can disclaim the fact that every country actively encourages voluntary activities in its region to eliminate the miseries of the under-privileged communities. In this regard, it proves utmost beneficial for you if you contribute to the cause by choosing volunteering services. The organization would punctually accept your contributions for these deprived communities, regardless of time and money you want to offer. If you hold a concern for children in your heart and like spending time with them, then it is feasible to opt for a volunteer work with children. It’s true that lending your time to children can really prove to be a fatiguing affair for you due to the fact that the kids tend to throw bad temper at times which in turn, would make it quite tough for you to manage them. However, if you tend to display a sign of little tolerance and some hard work, you will certainly be able to deal with them competently. A classic example of volunteering with children would include orphanage volunteer, save the children and public school volunteer. An orphanage volunteer program focuses on diverse volunteer activities such as looking after the infant and the new born babies, distributing food in the canteen, teaching in their schools and coaching for extracurricular activities. As far as the second option is concerned, it deals with the problem of needy children hailing from local communities. The third option provides opportunities for volunteering with children of the public school that comprises of teenage volunteers helping in the usual deeds of the school."
6,Dear Politicians – Don’t be Anti-Social: We Need to Know You!,news-society," When it comes to voting for city elections, most people are ""somewhat"" informed about their local politicians. They are some of the same people who care about what happens in their city, are concerned about their tax dollars and how their policies will affect their families. However, the important thing for politicians to know is that these people are the ones voting. So, in order to vote smartly, they need to know which candidate will address their needs and concerns as voting tax-payers with families. So, it can be a bit disheartening when a person goes to look up information on candidates who are running for mayor and for city council and find very little concrete information. This is both sad and agitating. The amount of efforts put forth by these candidates make people feel duped. These candidates seemed to think that if they simply announce their candidacy that voters would flock to the polls. How could they think that? Voters aren’t sure who to vote for. In a few days, elections for major, alderman-at-large and ward alderman will be held where I’m from, Rock Island, Illinois. There are 9 candidates that should be vying for my vote. To date, I have received only one palm card (http://www.campaignpros.com/palmcards-postcards-businesscards.htm) and one cheaply created flyer in my mail box. I have had only one solicitation for a yard sign (http://www.campaignpros.com/yard_signs.htm) to be placed in my yard. And worst of all, not a single candidate has knocked on my door. This is completely unacceptable to me. From my online research, I have found that two of the mayoral candidates have a website and only one has a Facebook page.  One out of the 6 alderman candidates has a Facebook page and none have a dedicated campaign website.  I suppose I can forgive the aldermanic candidates for not having dedicated campaign websites, but Facebook is free and easy. This lack of accessibility and complete disregard for the needs of voters are extremely concerning. The laziness makes you wonder how badly these candidates really want these positions. Perhaps these expectations are too high but maybe candidates should offer their community more. What is concerning is that there are many voters who are expected to vote for someone they do not even know. Voting shouldn’t be like gambling. It should be a process in where voters can be confident about whom they are voting for."

8,Realizing the Significance of Volunteering Services in Today’s Society,news-society," In this article, you will come to know the diverse aspects of volunteering services and how they virtuously contribute to the well-being of the humanity. Before we throw some light on volunteering services, let’s define what exactly volunteering is. In simple words, ""volunteering"" is the act of serving others or a specific cause without receiving payment for their time and services. It indeed is a philanthropic activity that enormously benefits both people and organizations. It certainly gives your mind a piece of bliss when you opt for volunteering services. There are other reasons why people choose to volunteer. Some may take it as a hobby or to get an extra edge in their resumes. It literally provides you a peace of mind when you are teaching under-privileged children for their evolution. Volunteering services abroad add to your resume and distinguish you from the rest. It portrays your motivation, character and interests. If you have hands-on experience in diverse fields such as health, social services, or education, it paves the right track for you because you can realize your volunteer abroad experience as a stepping stone to development work on an international level. There are innumerable people around the world that take a deep sense of pride in rendering their services for helping those who are neglected or supporting a noble cause. Volunteering services gladly support those activities that are meant to nurture the society that’s been below poverty line for a long period of time or is totally deprived when it comes to housing, shelter, education, nourishment and there could be several other reasons why these neglected people need our efficient services for their well-being. It’s certainly true that sometimes we come across people who are fond of spending their leisure time volunteering in divergent organizations and charitable institutions. It can prove to be a very satisfying and rewarding experience for you if you are bestowing your time volunteering for an organization you firmly believe in. Nothing can disclaim the fact that there are numerous organizations that simply would not be able to make a difference in the lives of people and immensely contribute to the welfare of the society without the assistance of those volunteers who are capable of rendering their effective services for the sake of enhancing an under-privileged society. Your diverse contributions towards the poor communities would be promptly accepted as involving yourself in any form of social service tremendously helps you in reaping the benefits and it proves to be very satiating, especially if you are involved in some sort of voluntary work with children. It can be truly comprehended that working with the children can be very tiresome as they throw crankiness at times, but a little patience and some hard work would let you to manage them efficiently."
9,Best Online Business... For A Nigerian,news-society," Are you a Nigerian searching for the best online business in Nigeria that could be owned and managed by a Nigerian living in Nigeria? I want to reveal how you can successfully generate legitimate passive income from the internet if you have zeal, determination and courage. Citizen of Nigeria and most Africa countries don't get a free pass on the internet, Nigeria specifically have bigger problem.

I consider myself to be among the very few persons that have chosen to succeed with an online business in Nigeria and to do so against all odds. I want to show you how you too can replicate the same level of success by setting up and running your own online business. Several years back we all started with Multi level marketing, we tried different Species of multi level marketing (MLM) which of course never yielded any positive result. I started out with the quest to find a legitimate online business about ten Years ago and I made no head-ways until two years back. I feel the need to inform you that ninety percent of all the business opportunities you find on the internet will either get you depressed or discouraged, most of then  yield absolutely no profit of any kind, those businesses they tell you will start  Generating real income in a month or two. Every real business takes at least six month to a year to set up, anything that seem too good to be true should be googled with peeled eyes. If you want to run a legitimate online business in Nigeria you have to look away from the crowed and create your own website. forget about those multi level marking they promise you would work wonders, forget about the typing jobs they promise would start generating four figure income in just two weeks, I have tried them all. they worst part is that you have very little knowledge of the creators of most ""get rich quick scheme"" If you want to establish a legitimate online business in Nigeria, take the time and create your own website. There are many ways to own a website; there are even free platforms like blogger.com or wordprss.com where you can create a niche focused website that would generate real income without going through the vigorous process of making online payment which is becoming even more cumbersome by the day. All you would require is knowledge about a particular subject because you need to focus on a particular subject if you really want to live long on the internet. So if you know so much about something, you can create a niche focused website and generate real income to supplement your day job. Along the line you can even generate real income that would make you resign from your day job. Alternatively, You can still chose to go through the vigorous payment process and purchase one of the paid platform like SBI which has been reputed as the best when it comes to creating a real online business. This would have been the best option if Nigeria credit cards are accepted on the internet although people are discovering better ways to own SBI in Nigeria this days. So in a nutshell, If you want to create a real online business in Nigeria that have the potential to put you on the list of real business owners, you have to own your own website and stop chasing ""get rich quick"" schemes. And the process of creating a  website is not as tedious as most people believe it to be. Most website owners started from scratch without any prior knowledge of creating a website. So if they made it or should I say if we made it; you too can make it in Nigeria."
10,Why Has The Nature Of Fame And Hollywood Celebrities Transformed In Modern Decades,news-society," Hollywood celebrities in the USA have always offered us an outlet for our imagination, just as the gods and demigods of historic Greece and Rome once did. Hollywood celebrities are our myth bearers; carriers of the divine forces of good, evil, lust, and redemption. ""The wish for kings is an old and familiar wish, as well-known in medieval Europe as in ancient Mesopotamia,"" writes Lewis Lapham in his book The Wish For Kings. ""The ancient Greeks assigned trace elements of the divine to trees and winds and stones. A river god sulks, and the child drowns; a sky god smiles, and the corn ripens. The modern Americans assign similar powers not only to whales and spotted owls but also to individuals blessed with the aura of celebrity."" Historically, famous people were recorded in stone and in paint. Alexander the Great was the first famous person in a modern day sense, contends Leo Braudy, Ph.D., professor of English in the University of Southern California and author of The Frenzy of Renown. ""Not only did he want to be unique, but he wanted to tell everybody about it, and he had an apparatus for telling everybody about it. He had techniques for doing famous things. He had historians, painters, sculptors, gem carvers on his battles."" Heroes, all of us might agree, bring intrinsic benefit-the essence of the heroic and the noble. Durable gods serve to raise our vision above the mundane. But fame isn't what it used to be. Hollywood celebrities are borne aloft on pictures marketed, sold, and disseminated with a rapidity and cunning not imagined by the heroes of old, and then just as quickly cast aside. ""We're in the Kleenex phase of fame,"" claims Braudy. ""We see so much of people, and in all branches of the media. We blow our nose on every new star that happens to come along and then dispose of them."" Just about every year brings a brand new Sexiest Man Alive. Technology has transformed fame making sure that it is far more immediate and instantaneous-and our curiosity with it has become a lot more fickle. Where once the renowned attained an almost godlike status, one that appeared impermeable and historical (bear in mind Lincoln or Washington, Charles Lindbergh or Jesse Owens), today Hollywood celebrity exist for and by an information age. Within our worldwide and atomized planet of bits and bytes, where information is immediately available and massive in its amounts, and as perishable as an electronic photo, Hollywood celebrities help personalize that content. They put a human face on it. Alas, they are diminished in the process. The issue is, so are we. Information will come at us with incredible speed, in innumerable transforming faces and stories, on Court Television, on CNN in 24-hour play. We've far too much information about Hollywood celebrities these days-their love affairs, their private conversations on mobile phones, the colour of their underwear, how many nose jobs they've had, how many intestinal polyps our presidents have had taken out. But the surfeit of information strips the famous of the sacred and heroic-therefore our culture and our own lives-as heroes reflect what we feel is best in ourselves."

13,An Introduction to Negligence and the Duty of Care,news-society," The twin ideas of negligence and a duty of care, and their legal definitions, are inextricably linked and both fall within the area of law known as tort law. This article aims to give a brief introduction to this area of law without delving too deep into the complex machinations that govern it. Tort Law The legal concepts of a Duty of Care and Negligence both fall within the area of law known as Tort Law - as distinct from criminal law.  Whereas criminal law centres on the idea of a crime, tort law instead concerns what are known as ‘wrongs’ and so cases can be brought by a plaintiff or claimant against a defendant if they feel they have been ‘wronged’.  As the intention of tort law is to remedy these wrongs rather than punish an offender who is responsible for a crime, tort prosecutions are therefore usually brought by individuals against other individuals in private prosecutions rather than being brought by the state (as is the case with criminal law). Tort law further differs from criminal law in the way that rulings enter into law.  Criminal law is defined in legislature as passed by the government and law courts.  Tort law on the other hand mostly relies on case law or common law; that is cases are decided based upon the precedents set by the previous rulings on similar legal scenarios (although there are some statutory torts that are defined in legislature). There is in reality an overlap between tort law and criminal law and most criminal offences would also constitute a tort offence. For example, the crime of assault would also wrong the victim and result in a tort of assault. However, prosecution by the state of the criminal offence would usually take precedence and the tort would only be pursued by the plaintiff in the event of an unsuccessful criminal prosecution. In terms of the resolutions that tort law achieves it differs from criminal law in that cases are usually remedied by the awarding of compensation to the claimant and in some cases injunctions against the defendant (or tortfeasor), rather than custodial sentences as a punitive gesture.  The compensation awarded in such cases usually aims to restore a plaintiffs financial position to the state it would have been in if they hadn’t been wronged by the tortfeasor, in a concept known as restitutio in integrum.  Injunctions on the other hand, which are usually granted when there is a likelihood of the tort recurring, are usually defined in terms of actions that the tortfeasor is ordered to desist from, such as publicising information, but can sometimes include actions that they must carry out to prevent a further tortious act (e.g., clearing an offending rubbish pile). Duty of Care The definition of a duty of care is an obligation that exists between two parties to do no harm to each other, when harm could be anticipated, when they enter into a relationship or interaction that isn’t already defined by a contract or familial ties (and therefore does not already have coverage in legislature).  It is a similar concept to the idea of a social contract; an obligation of an individual in society to respect the rights of the other members of society.  In simple terms there needs to be a case that one individual’s actions will or can affect the other and that the effects are foreseeable to prove a duty of care. There are many examples of the relationships which would constitute a duty of care in everyday scenarios, such as those between co-workers, fellow road users, a doctor and patient and even a manufacturer and consumer. Where a relationship can be proven to exist between two parties the operation of law can be defined as applying to that relationship and therefore the duty of care that each party has towards the other can be established. Whether relationships can be considered to legally instigate a duty of care has to be decided based upon legal precedents within the sphere of case law; that is, as is the case with tort law in general, there is usually no legislature that has been passed into law and judicial verdicts will be made in accordance with precedents set by courts. Negligence The area of law that negligence covers is when a wrong is not committed intentionally but results from careless actions - a failure to take the appropriate care when the individual is in a situation where it can be reasonably anticipated that their activities could potentially do harm to others.  In other words negligence occurs when an individual breaches their duty of care. Negligence can affect not only the individual’s physical and mental health but also their property and finances. Negligence cases are usually broken down into what are known as elements, of which the plaintiff must establish each and all to have a valid negligence claim.  The first of these are that the duty of care existed and that the duty was then in fact breached.  Subsequent elements can concern whether harm resulted directly from this breach (and the cause wasn’t too remote) and whether the appropriate corrective action is to award damages or compensation to the plaintiff or claimant. It is important therefore that the risk of harm to others must be foreseeable at the time of the alleged negligence not just with the benefit of hindsight or knowledge of subsequent events. Once a case of negligence has been established the amount of compensation that a plaintiff can be awarded will often be considered separately under liability law. As with all legal issues, tort law is a very complex subject, and therefore if you think you may be impacted by it, it is always paramount to seek the best possible advice from qualified experts. For example, if you feel that you may have suffered from negligence  while in the care of medical or clinical services you should seek guidance from trusted Medical Negligence Solicitors."

19,The United States Debt Wall,news-society," It is no secret that the U.S. is facing a debt crisis today. The national debt has risen to $14 trillion this year and it is predicted to increase to $16 trillion in 2012. High interest rates and budget deficit issues are one of the key reasons why the national debt has ballooned to this amount. And as long as the U.S. federal government can’t find a way to minimize the country’s debt, the country and its citizens will suffer from its consequences. Marc Nuttle, a global economic policy specialist has recently applied the debt wall concept in the current financial situation of the U.S. This debt wall happens when a nation depends on foreign debt to subsidize the country’s deficits and there's not much foreign capital flow entering the nation. And given that the U.S. is in a rather crucial circumstance right now, they are predicted to hit the debt wall quickly. According to Nuttle, the U.S. has as few as 18 months before they reach this wall. With the tremendous debt problem of the U.S., there is no doubt that the debt wall will be hit. And having America’s back up against the wall brings bad repercussions to the nation’s financial system and its citizens. Some of the results will include very high interest rates, lack of employment, hyperinflation, bankruptcies and even sovereign instability. The U.S. budget deficit issue has been in existence for 40 years. Clearly, the U.S. is spending more than they are making which resulted to numerous debts. And since the nation isn’t earning a sufficient amount of money, they are inclined to depend on foreign debt to supply them the funds for government expenses. The reduced foreign capital flow or investments in the nation is detrimental to the U.S. currency. The lack of foreign capital flow entails a reduced demand for the currency and the U.S. will end up with a high supply of useless currencies. Due to this, currency devaluation will happen. Hence, what was once one of the most powerful currencies on the planet is just a few months away from getting devalued and pretty much close to becoming worthless. Another repercussion that every American citizen should be worried about is the possibility of the U.S. going bankrupt. Reaching the debt wall is a symbol of a serious financial problem and this is something that all nations' economy should steer clear of. When the wall is hit and there's no money going in to the economy, liquid capital runs dry. Without liquid capital, the country won't have the ability to finance their deficits. To put it simply, without money, the U.S. economy will go bankrupt. And if you believe that the U.S. will be the only one affected by this problem, you should reconsider that thought. The entire world’s financial situation is affected. For economists, the world capacity for sustainable debt is $42 trillion and that is 70% of GDP. But at this time, the world’s debt is already at $58 trillion and that's 97% of GDP. They predict that by 2013, the world debt is going to be $70 trillion, 116% of GDP which leaves the world’s economy with nothing but debts to their name."
20,California bill to fund college for illegal immigrants advances,news-society," A bill said the state of California as the ""Dream Act"" that would allow illegal immigrants to receive public funds. These funds are needed for the college education that was approved on Wednesday by the state Senate. The law still needs to be in check by the Assembly and signed by Governor Jerry Brown, he is a Democrat. His supporters say that illegal immigrants who went to California in the legal field are still difficult to get a job after graduating college, but they say could eventually help spur the federal government to give them citizenship students. ""The Senate made history today by vote to pass ... the last part of the California Dream Act,"" said a Democrat from Los Angeles who is an Assembly member Gil Cedillo, and author of the bill.

Ira Mehlman said the bill would hurt California, he is the spokesperson for the Federation for American Immigration Reform. ""The state is cutting budgets, cutting their acceptance, they cut the program, and here they use scarce resources to help illegal aliens, when so many other people feel the burden of budget cuts,"" said Mehlman. California is one of many states that offer the opportunity for illegal immigrants to pay tuition and financed by the state, based on attendance and graduation from high school state. Only a few states that allows it to provide financial assistance for students. A federal law that the dream will create a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants who attend college or who failed to become law in the U.S. Senate last year."

1,Does Montezuma’s Treasure Really Exist?,news-society," Montezuma’s treasure has been on people’s minds for ages. The question is, does it really exist? When Cortez arrived in Mesoamerica in the early 1500s, Montezuma thought he was the Great White God Quetzalcoatl, who had promised to return one day. It didn’t take long for Montezuma to realize that he had made a mistake. Cortez was a cruel man and began treating the Aztecs abominably. The king, for his own reasons, refused to fight Cortez, but the people had had enough and decided to rebel. After a great and terrible battle, the Spanish conquistadors were driven back, away from Tenochtitlan, Mexico. During this rebellion, Montezuma was killed, either by the Spaniards or his own people. No one knows for sure. While the Spaniards were taking care of their wounded, the Aztecs quickly bundled up their treasure and took off with it. They had to protect it with their lives because it was sacred. For years, they kept the treasure in honor of their god when he returned. It was a gift to Quetzalcoatl and was estimated at around $10,000,000 worth of gold and jewels. Is this just a myth? A legend? Cortez actually left a record telling about the Aztec gold. In 1519, his chronicler, Bernal Diaz, recorded what he saw in the village: ""All the riches of the world were in that room."" Diaz said that he saw a golden wheel in the form of a sun that was as big as a cartwheel with pictures engraved upon it. There was a silver one, which was an imitation of the moon, and golden statuettes in the shape of jaguars. When Cortez finally won the battle and entered the room where the treasure was kept, he found nothing. After searching the whole village, he found a few statues, which had been thrown in the lake. The Aztecs tried to hide what they didn’t take with them. They didn’t think he would look in a lake. The archeologists figured the rest had been transported to a faraway land where Cortez would never find the treasure. The search for Montezuma’s treasure has intrigued many people. In 1914, an old prospector by the name of Freddy Crystal had a newspaper clipping of Anasazi art. It was a photograph of a petroglyph engraved on the side of a cliff located in Johnson Canyon, not far from Kanab, Utah. The petroglyph was similar to the etchings on a treasure map he had found years earlier. After searching the canyon for two long years, he left and returned in 1920 with another map he had obtained in Mexico. It was a copy of a four hundred-year-old maguey map that he found in a depository of a Mexican monastery. Maguey is a fibrous plant that is cultivated in Mexico. Years ago they used it like paper and it lasted for centuries. Freddy said that he met a descendant of Montezuma who gave his interpretation of the second map. It showed a canyon with seven mountains: four mountains to the north, one on the east side, one on the west, and another on the south. That described the topography of Kanab to a tee. The petroglyphs matched his first map, but the topography matched his second map. The second one had more details. It showed steps on the side of a mountain and marshland below. White Mountain just happened to have steps carved into the sandstone that ascended more than one hundred feet. The only exception was the marshland, which didn’t exist. According to Freddy, marshlands dry up so he didn’t worry about it. Freddy Crystal promised to share the treasure with all the townsfolk in Kanab if they helped him dig and search for it. For the next two years, at the bottom of White Mountain, a large tent city was erected and townsfolk went everyday to help Freddy search for the gold. All the stores and businesses shut down every day so they could dig. It was an exciting time for everyone. The town of Kanab was unlike any other town in the United States. They had elected a mayor and a city council of all women, something unheard of in 1920. Women’s rights were not yet recognized in the East. It was the first petticoat government in all history. In fact, these good women made sure the county court opened and closed with prayer every time they met. Wow! A petticoat government! How awesome is that! When the townsfolk agreed to help Freddy, Kanab’s city council voted to not have any publicity about the treasure because they didn’t want the word to get out. If that happened, people from all over the country would invade their little town and no one wanted that. They remembered what happened to California and the gold rush. So, if anyone uttered the word ""treasure,"" they were fined. They dug and blasted until they found a cave with a series of rooms. They actually found tunnels with booby-traps, but no gold. Three boulders almost killed Freddy as they fell to the ground. He claimed they had been set on purpose by the Aztecs. When no gold was found, they figured the Aztecs had moved the treasure to another spot. After everyone gave up, Freddy left…disappeared…never to be seen again. Every now and then someone will find the ""Aztec Treasure Sign"" but no treasure. Many tribes believe that the treasure is protected. But protected by whom? Legend says that after hiding everything from Cortez, the tribe designated certain guardians to protect the treasure. If someone gets too close, they will do everything in their power to protect it and quickly move it to another spot. Some people believe their spirits still guard it today. So where is Montezuma’s treasure? Does it still exist? Is it hidden among the Utah Mountains? It’s still a mystery to this day. The subject was so intriguing to me that I sat down and began writing my new mystery/adventure novel: Montezuma Intrigue. This book is about mysterious events, the search for Montezuma’s treasure, a good-looking rogue, and family secrets. How important is it to learn about the past? When a leather parchment of Montezuma’s map is found in great-grandfather Evans’ old chest, April and the twins know this summer is going to be a memorable one."
2,The Mystery Behind Artifact Theft,news-society," Ancient American artifacts are being sold to the highest bidder. When an ancient ruin is discovered, it doesn’t take long for thieves to find out about it. Archaeological thievery is becoming more and more of a problem every year but Utah’s vandalism is the worst in the country. Theft at the Four Corners area of Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona is still a big problem. The damage to these sites is estimated at almost $42,000 in two year’s time. An ancient funeral pit can be sold for as high as $60,000 on the black market, not to mention pottery, baskets, and pendants found by looters. An article in the Associated Press said, ""Two dozen people were indicted Wednesday after a sweeping undercover investigation into ancient artifacts stolen from public and tribal lands in the Four Corners area."" (Associated Press, Mike Stark, June 11, 2009) There were around 300 federal agents that were involved in the arrest of both men and women from ages twenty-seven to seventy-eight. They were all part of an underground network. In fact, archaeological theft has gone corporate. They even pay rent on private property in order to dig without being caught. Unfortunately there is no law to prevent digging on private property. I read an article in the Las Vegas Sun Newspaper about a couple men who were loading some artifacts in the trunk of their car. A ranger saw what they were doing and questioned them, not realizing he had accidentally stumbled upon the largest operation around. The article said they recovered more than 11,100 relics. Did you know that people are actually selling shards and arrowheads on websites? The Anasazi culture is being sold to the highest bidder. Is there anything that can be done to protect America’s past? This subject was so intriguing to me that I sat down and began writing. My new mystery series surrounds the theft of artifacts. In Anasazi Intrigue, we find that the mystery of the Anasazi Indians boggles the minds of many archaeologists. Ancient dwellings, petroglyphs, and pottery are part of Anasazi history. When an ancient ruin is discovered, it doesn’t take long for thieves to take it apart. Did you know that looting is only second to selling illegal drugs? While writing Mayan Intrigue, I found that artifact thievery in Mexico has been taken over by drug dealers from Columbia. This amazed me! In other words, since organized crime has taken over, there is also an increase of violence. Can anything be done to save Ancient American history? You bet! The only way is for no one to buy it."
3,Electronics Recycling: Good for You and the Environment,news-society," Recycling has become a part of most people's lives over the last several years.  However, while many people recycle paper, plastics, glass and even those old car tires few people have understood the importance of electronics recycling. Not only are many electronics made up of metal or plastic which takes up space in landfills where they will lay forever but, they also contain chemicals that can pollute the ground and poison the environment. Electronics recycling makes sense for those who are dedicated to saving the environment and those who want to save some money, or even make some money. Part of the reason why many people have not recycled electronics is because there are places that charge for you dropping off these gadgets which ended up costing the recycler money. Now you can save money recycling as there are now places that allow you to recycle for free.  Many retailers have begun a take back policy where they will take back electronics that their company makes at no charge to you.  In addition, many cities now offer free drop of points where you drop off those used electronics without having to pay to do so.  Best of all you can even make money from recycling some of the old electronic gadgets. Ways to Make Money Recycling If you have old electronics that are still in good working order but that you simply don't use or need any more you can sell them in a yard sale, online or by placing an ad in the paper. With the poor economy there are many people who will be thrilled to buy a used electronic kitchen appliance, room heater or even television for a fraction of the cost.  Depending on the condition of the item or items you are selling this could net you between a few dollars and several hundred. If the electronics are no longer working you can still make money by electronics recycling. Absolute Green Electronics Recycling will take your old and unwanted or broken electronics and responsibly recycling them. You can recycle any electronics with Absolute Green Electronics Recycling. They will even come to your house and pick it up for you! There are also online sites that will pay you for your old cell phones and other electronic gadgets. Some of these sites even pay to have the gadgets shipped to them. Now that you know that electronics recycling is easier than ever before it's time to get up and get moving.  Not only will you be helping in the effort to save the environment but, you may be saving money as well."
4,The Mystery of the Anasazi,news-society," The mystery of the Anasazi Indians boggles the minds of many archaeologists. Who were they? What were their beliefs? How did they live? Indian art painted or engraved in rock gives us an idea who the Anasazi were, their beliefs and lifestyle. Carved into the desert varnish, the Indians left behind their heritage, their legacy. Many people wonder why the Anasazi Indians disappeared, leaving behind their belongings and valuables. Where did they go and why? No one has the answer. There is much speculation about what might have happened to them. In ""Anasazi Diaspora,"" from Navajo Visions and Voices Across the Mesa, Shonto Begay said that because the ""Ancient Ones"" were not obeying the rules of the clan, such as showing reverence and respect to God and attending religious ceremonies, the people ""lost favor"" in God’s eyes and were ""swept away."" Some archaeologists believe that discord, tribal violence, and abuse among tribes caused abandonment of the villages. Wickedness, conflict, and warring among tribes forced some clans to leave the area and move to a new place, simply to get away from the contention. In one tribe located in southern Mexico, there were cases of homicide, ""nearly all of which involved clan feuds or quarrels over women."" (The Last Lords of Palenque: The Lacandon Mayas of the Mexican Rain Forest by Victor Perera and Robert D. Bruce) Ancient dwellings, petroglyphs, and pottery found in Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico are fantastic and part of Anasazi history. When an ancient ruin is discovered, it doesn’t take long for thieves to find out about it. Archaeological thievery is becoming more and more of a problem every year. At the Gettysburg National Military Park a few years ago, a man was searched and they found a metal detector hidden in his pants. He was scouring the park with it protruding from his pant leg. He was looking for Civil War relics. Utah’s vandalism is the worst in the country. Theft at the Four Corners area of Utah is still a big problem. The damage to these sites is estimated at almost $42,000 in two year’s time. In 1906, the U.S. Congress passed the Antiquities Act because the collecting of artifacts was getting out of control. It protects archaeological sites, allows research, and imposes fines and sometimes imprisonment for the vandalism of historic sites. It was created in order to protect the archaeological sites in the Four Corners region between Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah. Unfortunately there is no law to prevent digging on private property. In fact, archaeological theft has gone corporate. They even pay rent on private property in order to dig without being caught. Sometimes entire pueblos have been removed. An ancient funeral pit can be sold for as high as sixty thousand dollars on the black market, not to mention pottery, baskets, and pendants found by looters. I read an article in the Las Vegas Newspaper about a couple men who were loading some artifacts in the trunk of their car. A ranger saw what they were doing and questioned them, not realizing he had accidentally stumbled upon the largest operation around. The article said they recovered more than eleven thousand one hundred relics. Did you know that people are actually selling shards and arrowheads on websites? The Anasazi culture is being sold to the highest bidder. Is there anything that can be done to protect America’s past? The Antiquities Act of 1906 gives the government the right to protect and preserve all archaeological sites. It allows for scientific research but will impose fines and imprisonment for vandalism on historical sites."
5,"Shenyang, China:  A Study in Human Tenacity",news-society," During the Spring Semester of 2003, I finally realized my ambition of returning to The People’s Republic of China and for several years thereafter I would come back a number of times.   I spent most of the time in China living in Shenyang, a large industrial city and transportation hub located in Liaoning Province, in Northeast China, about one hundred and fifty miles north and west of the border of North Korea and six hundred miles north and east of Beijing.  I found that in the microcosm that is present day Shenyang, one can see the many changes that are going on in the broader country. China, and in particular Shenyang, can certainly be considered a study in human tenacity.  Even after nearly five thousand years of feudalism and imperial rule, the country remains a powerful and proud nation, yet one still heavily influenced by the historical forces that forged its present existence.  And now, after the past three centuries of social humiliation and economic plundering by the Western colonial powers, followed by a brief period of Chinese nationalism, and then complete takeover by communism, the China and Shenyang of today lend themselves well to ethnographic study of its people and its culture. Probably the most obvious vestiges of the past can best be seen in the influence communist control has and continues to have on the country.  The tensions of communism stubbornly resisting the dynamics of unleashed capitalism can almost be sensed in the stagnant, smoggy air of the cities.  Today there are 70 million in the CCP—the Chinese Communist Party; these 70 million party members control the remaining 1.3 billion citizens.  Though these disproportionate numbers are hard for Westerners to understand, when control of the economy, the military, the government process, the judicial system, the major industries and the public utilities are concentrated in the hands of a few, the hearts and minds of the ruled will most assuredly follow . . . a dynamic reality that has prevailed since the late 1940s.  Perhaps this situation can be best summed up by the comment made by a Chinese-American friend of mine.  When I asked him if he thought China would ever become a democracy, he said that basically, given the history of Chinese civilization and politics, the people have no predisposition for being able to choose their leaders.  ""What the Chinese seem to want is for just a good leader who will treat them well, or at least not treat them badly.  The people have no propensity for democracy.  After 2500 years of imperial rule, they only want a good, fair ruler.""  And with the growing commercialism that has resulted from the Socialist Market Economic System of Deng Xiaoping, which in reality opened the Pandora’s Box of capitalism, a rising middle class fits well into the oligarchic Communist party.  People with more material goods are less likely to revolt.  They have more to lose . . . an idea that maybe serves as a refutation to the unanalyzed assumptions Americans have concerning everyone in the world having a predisposition for democracy . . . a lesson we did not learn in Viet Nam and one we probably will not learn again in Iraq or any other country where we try to impose our values in lieu of any appreciation of difference.   And because seventy to eighty percent of China’s population is widely dispersed in rural farming communities, these economic, social, and political tensions are most obvious in the larger, densely populated areas in the eastern provinces of the country . . . in metropolitan cities like Shenyang. Certainly one cannot really know the character of a nation by merely looking at one of its major cities—looking at New York City, for example, does not really give insight into America as a whole.  However, the city of Shenyang, with eight million people—small in comparison to a city such as Chongqing, which has an estimated population of twenty-eight million—can be observed as somewhat a microcosm of what is happening in the entire country.  The homogeneity of the nation allows for a certain degree of similarity and affinity to course through the lives of the Chinese populace.   Thus one can certainly see that the struggles of China, both past and present, are evidenced in Shenyang and the tenaciousness of the Chinese people reflected in the citizens of that city. Shenyang and the surrounding area hold claim to a major part of Chinese history.  The Northeast of China, often referred to as Manchuria, has since prehistory been a major crossroads, trading center, and invasion route.  From these regions, as well as areas to the north and west, Mongol invaders swept down and over the Great Wall to lay siege to growing dynastic empires of the ""Middle Country.""  Later, Manchu warriors swept south from here in the seventeenth century to overthrow the Ming Dynasty and impose the Qing Dynasty on the Chinese civilization.  Shenyang is home to several of the older Qing Imperial Tombs and to the first Qing Dynasty Imperial Palace—Gugong—a smaller version of the ruling emperors’ Forbidden City built later in Beijing in 1406, after the Qing conquest of the city.   In the beginning of the twentieth century, the area proved to be the point of contention for the Japanese and Russians, the culmination of which resulted in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 to 1905.   In 1912, after the last emperor of the Qing Dynasty, Puyi, abdicated his rule, anti-imperial forces in the country launched the Republic of China, under the leadership of Sun Yat-sen.  Later, through the on-going, unequal provisions of the Russo-Japanese Treaty, Shenyang became a major part of the Japanese occupation of China.  After having established a large military and civilian presence in several major cities in the Northeast, Japan’s cancerous invasion started in 1932 in Northeastern China and rapidly spread southward through a good portion of the entire country.   Drunk with their imperial might, the Japanese arbitrarily established a new de facto puppet Chinese government by proclaiming Puyi as the figurehead leader of China and establishing his seat of power in Shenyang.  Even today, people of that region harbor great animosity toward Japan and the Japanese, no matter how persistent the economic pressures for the suppression of those hatreds are.  The cruelty and brutality that so exemplified the Japanese occupation of China continues to haunt the people of Shenyang, and of China as well.  In fact, a large museum, the September 18th Remembrance Center, was constructed in the city.  On September 18, 1931, the Mukden Incident was fabricated by the Japanese in order to justify the invasion of China.  Now the museum exhibits serve as a stark, graphic reminder of the savage, barbaric nature of the Japanese occupation during that era.  And even today the forgiveness driven by economics comes slowly to many in the people of places like Shenyang and Nanjing and other areas of Eastern China. Very few Westerners know of the twenty million Chinese killed or the fifteen million who were wounded or displaced during the nearly sixteen terrible, barbarous years of that war. Then after the defeat of the Kuomintang by the Communists and the takeover of the entirety of China by the Chinese Central Party, Shenyang continued to play a major role in the country’s history.  As a major industrial and steel-producing area, Liaoning Province and Shenyang served as the  main staging and supply area for the Chinese intervention into the Korean War, when hoards of the Red ""Liberation"" Army swarmed across the Yalu River and drove the United Nations forces far south on the Korean Peninsula.  As well,  in the 1960s and 70s, being both a major industrial and agricultural area, Shenyang and Liaoning people suffered greatly during the backward and repressive Cultural Revolution of that era . . . those desperate times when intellectuals were persecuted and scorned,  when the common people stood in long lines for basic needs and want oppressed all,  when students chased Mao’s words and dreams and persecuted their fellow countrymen in place of an education . . . those ""lost"" or ""forgotten"" times the older generation mostly prefers to remain silent about.   Those who do talk about those times prefer to discuss the ""Iron Rice Bowl"" . . . the times of guaranteed employment and government succor from cradle to grave that became an outgrowth of Mao’s Great Leap Forward.  Most of the Chinese who did not farm were assigned to ""work units"" within government-owned enterprises:  industrial, factory, large businesses, trade, construction, education . . . all aspects of the economy.  For example, if a person worked at a steel mill in Anshan, an industrial city not far from Shenyang, he or she would be guaranteed a livelihood for life.  The state-controlled company provided housing, food, medical care, and retirement, all of which were meager, at best; education and indoctrination were the responsibility of the state, whose communist party representatives oversaw all aspects of the organization.  Very little was left to the imagination of the individual:  as one old worker told me through a translator, ""If there was any difficulty, the government would take care of it.  The government worked for the welfare of the people of China."" Since those revolutionary times, certainly much has happened in China.  The Opening Up economic policies of the 1970s and 80s and 90s not only decentralized the government’s power and influence and control, the growing swell of capitalism has allowed people more freedom of movement and the opportunity to change jobs or professions and to start private businesses and to engage in private enterprises.  Now the times are changing and these changes are more than obvious in Shenyang. So much new construction is going on in the city . . . ceaseless activity which reveals such a stark, sharp contrast between the old becoming the new, between tradition and innovation.  New major freeways and high-speed trains spirit people in and out of the city in remarkable time.  New north-south and east-west subways systems are burrowed into the city’s infrastructure to ease the traffic congestion.  And Shenyang, just like many other major cities in China, yields quickly to the winds of change and the pressures of economic transformation.  Gray smog heavily blankets the city most of the time, a subtle reminder that environmental concerns are often shunted to minor discussions due to the exegesis of an overheated, rapidly expanding economy.   The joke around Shenyang, and other major cities in China as well, I imagine, is that the national bird of China has now become the crane, which seems to sit perched atop of so many towering buildings being constructed around the country .  .  .  the steel ""bird""  immersed in and clouded by the inversion layers of steady ""progress"" hanging over the city. When one walks along the streets of Shenyang, he or she can almost feel the pulse and hear the heartbeat of its citizens, of the city, of the nation.  The streets are crowded with people having determined looks on their faces, maybe looks of resolve, maybe looks of quiet desperation or perhaps resignation, best described by the Hebrews verse ""Foreigners and refugees on Earth.""  Theirs is the look of ""the thousand-yard stare,"" as we use to say in the military . . . the stoic look of dogged determinism . . . the gaze of acquiescence . . . the squinty-eyed look of American ""get-‘r-done.""   And so many people.   The busy streets always resemble a restless, flowing and eddying river of black-haired humans. Certainly the changes going on in China are apparent not only on the streets of Shenyang but in the faces and lives of its citizens.  A street vendor squatting before her box of baby tomatoes eats the bad ones and moves the plump ones forward for sale.  After picking her nose, she wipes her hand on nearby corn husks, which serve as food for the donkey hovering nearby, which has hauled in her produce from the country.  The ""free"" street markets on the city streets are now legal.  The competition is great; on both sides of her are people with three-wheeled bicycle trucks who are selling the same commodities—tomatoes, green onions, limp leaks, softball-sized radishes, blocks of tofu, live squawking chickens, glistening fish and squirming eels and evasive turtles moving languidly in turgid tubs of water, and a myriad of other vegetable and fruits and slabs of fresh meats spread pinkish-red on outdoor chopping butcher blocks.  Refrigerators are only gradually becoming a part of the average Chinese person’s way of life, so day-to-day buying of foods persists and the street markets flourish.  Each vendor is indistinguishable from the other, but each does his or her own business . . . creates his or her ""own bowl of rice.""  On the steps of a nearby apartment building, a few meters behind the river of street vendors and intent consumers, a large one-child policy Chinese baby, dressed in a pink cotton sleeper, sits on its mother’s lap, fat from her milk.  Its chubby cheeks push its slanted eyes closed into mere slits.  China grows fat. Yet so many facets of this city’s daily existence can tend to offend one’s sense of propriety, or should I say my own Western, middle-class, bourgeoisie perception of ""reality.""  A taxi driver stops in the middle of traffic, walks into the bushes beside the road, and urinates openly, leaning casually against a shabby gray wall, a smoking cigarette held between two back brown fingers.  Alternating smells of lilacs and garbage and tobacco and murky rinse water tossed splashing out onto the sidewalk and tantalizing smells of cooking from the street carts confront, no, overwhelm one.  Sometimes there will be the wispy smell of incense from a store or the charcoal smell from shabby outdoor barbecue restaurants.  Often in the wintertime when cold and nasal infections are rampant, one must step carefully, gingerly around the numerous frog-belly globs of mucus spat out or expelled from pinched nostrils and cleared throats and congested lungs onto the sidewalk.  After the Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic and general panic in 2003, the Chinese Health Ministry started a health campaign warning about how this practice helps to spreads infectious diseases, but the warnings have pretty much gone unheeded. The most sobering sights are those that reveal the fact that despite the current economic surge much poverty still exists in China.  Crippled children beg openly on the streets, some using makeshift wagons and hand-held paddles to move around the sidewalks.  Many locals say hucksters recruit such invalids from the countryside and bring them to the city; at the end of each day, the hucksters supposedly shake them down for the proceeds from their begging and give them only a small portion of the proceeds . . . somewhat, I guess, like an American pimp.   I once was roundly scolded on Waishu Jie by a middle-aged Chinese gentleman for giving money to an elderly, shabbily dressed woman begging on the sidewalk outside of the General Hospital of Shenyang Northern Military Region.   His rapid-fire Mandarin, coupled with emphatic hand gestures, was probably the same argument used by many middle class people in affluent Western nations:  the ragged peasant’s plight was just a charade; at the end of the day she would leave street begging with her day’s earnings and take a taxi to her luxury apartment.   How often have I heard the same comments made of the impoverished people in America. In China many people can be seen in the streets of the larger cities, gathering and crushing plastic water bottles to sell, or scrambling to gather cardboard boxes or plastic bags, or picking through the rubble of apartment buildings for anything salvageable.  The horribly maimed and medically distressed people await tourists outside of most all main tourist attractions in Beijing, begging for any pittance.  I once saw a poor woman walking between the rows of cars in a traffic jam in Shenyang, asking for money with an outstretched hand.  She wore a tattered green army overcoat and her fat cheeks glowed red from the cold.  She went from car to car, rapping on the windows with her tin cup.  I fumbled for my wallet, but before I could weave my way through the cars she had disappeared, as though she had never existed.   Another time, as I was crossing the traffic overpass on Sanhao Jie, I happened upon three women sitting in various places on the bridge, all with a child cradled in their laps, who languidly scrawled Chinese characters on the pavement with chalk.  One of my students told me later the women were writing lamentation about probably being abandoned by their families and complaints about the unfairness of their situation.  Soon the afternoon rains would come and wash away their sorrows and they would disappear. A colleague once told me that with the many entitlement programs in America, we are much more of a socialist state than China, whose current  survival of the fittest, lais•sez faire capitalism appears to be moving it far from the its leftist, socialist background.  China, after all, has no broad-based social safety nets:  though the Chinese government has been addressing the overall issues of poverty and want in the country, that there has been less success in the development of public services, particularly in the poorer rural areas.   Those of us in American take such government programs as unemployment or disability insurance, or Welfare or Social Security or Medicare or retirement benefits or assisted living as entitlements of our citizenship.  In China such programs and benefits are at best insubstantial and at worst nonexistent.  If a person in China is unemployed or is disabled or becomes old and has no resources or no family to care for him or her, the consequences can often be dire.  There are few if any government offices to go to and few social networks or safety nets.  In Chinese society, one must make one’s own rice bowl."
6,What are Academy Schools?,news-society," Academies are a relatively new type of school that are being encouraged by the UK government. They are free from the government regulations that regular schools are and are independently run. They are state maintained but can also have the financial help of sponsors and businesses. Although academies can be independently funded they cannot charge for entry and cannot make a profit. They are effectively publicly funded schools that operate outside of local authority control and can seek additional funding as well. They have more freedom over finances, the curriculum, and teacher’s conditions than regular schools. Academies can have a large amount of choice over what they teach and how they teach it. They do have to follow the national curriculum in English, Maths, Science and IT, but other than this can teach what they like. This allows them to focus more intensely on other areas if they wish or teach subject that other schools do not. The majority of academies specialise in a certain area, such as technology or sport. Although they cannot charge pupils to attend, academies are free to choose how they run their admission processes. Pupils must be broadly from the local area but there are not specific requirements for the entry process as there are for regular schools. The academy system can particularly benefit those who wish to start religious schools. This is because they don’t have to follow the curriculum in teaching a broad range of religions. If they wish they can solely focus on one religion. Any existing school can apply to be converted into an academy that will be maintained and partly funded by the state but run independently. The first step in starting an academy is for the current governing body to apply to the department for education and for a charitable company to be registered with companies house. An academy trust needs to be set up to run the academy. If the application is successful, this trust will be granted ownership of the school’s land. They will then be able to take over the running of the school, which will at this stage become an academy. Rather than being funded by the local authority, they will be funded directly by central government receiving an annual grant. As mentioned earlier, they will be able to receive additional funding on top of this. It is thought that academies and the rules that go with them will help improve poorly-performing schools. The thinking is that by being able to attract more funding and have more freedom it will enable them to make changes to improve the quality of teaching, the curriculum and other things. They will be more able to do what they think is necessary to improve a school rather than follow strict regulations as to how it should be run. With more freedom comes more individualism and it is hoped that if specific schools have specific requirements to improve, this will be possible under the academy system. One of the aims of state education is for the quality of education to be the same for everyone. It is hoped that academies will allow poorer quality schools to improve so the gap between the better performing schools and poorer performing schools will narrow. Andrew Marshall ©"
7,Libyan secret files reveal that former US officials advised Qaddafi on how to wage a propaganda war to save his regime.,news-society," by Michael Orfanos Try placing yourselves into Qaddafi’s shoes for a moment. You have been the absolute ruler of Libya for almost 40 years now, with unlimited powers, however things don’t go as planned lately, and rebels are marching towards your capital -in order to overthrow you- aided by NATO forces that place your demoralized troops under severe bombardment causing them heavy casualties. Your regime is on the verge of collapse, while you’re losing fast political allies and public support. You now realize that you have a limited time window for action, in order to save your regime, what do you do? Well, Qaddafi decided it was time to go lobbying… Case 1: ""State Department’s Golden Boy to the rescue!"" Al Jazeera news producer Jamal Elshayyal visited the deserted central offices of the Libyan Intelligence Agency, initially looking for files entitled ""Lockerby"" or ""IRA"", however, he found out something astonishing: he found out secret files containing minutes of meeting of a secret meeting between former State Department member Charles David Welch and 3 high-profiled Qaddafi deputes, on August 2, 2011 in Cairo. ""Who the hell is David Welch and why he did that?"" you may ask. Well, former State Department official (under the Bush administration) David Welch, was a US career diplomat (www.naro.gr), having as his personal career highlight the US-Libya Comprehensive Settlement Agreement Act (August 14, 2008). The latter settled the amount of compensation for both families of American victims (Lockerbie bombing was one of them) and Libyan (bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi-1986). As a result of this agreement, US restored Libyan government’s immunity from lawsuits accusing the Qaddafi regime for terrorist acts. For David Welch this agreement meant that he could now resign from his position and pursuit work in the private sector- he joined ""Bechtel"" the same year (www.naro.gr/blog), a multi-billion corporation that was interested in getting  Libya’s oil and natural gas business. What a coincidence eh? The Minutes of Meeting found regarding the meeting between David Welch and officials of the Qaddafi regime, in Cairo 2, 2011, are quite revealing: Welch advised them to take ""confidence building measures"". This meant the recruiting of high profile US political and public opinion personalities, in order to influence US (mainly) and world public opinion in favor of the Qaddafi regime. Also, Welch proposed to his newly clients a way to undermine Libya’s rebel movement, by ""surfacing"" of forged papers demonstrating a close cooperation between Libyan rebels and Al Qaeda (!). Welch added that: ""…it’s better to receive this information as if it originated from these countries (Israel, Egypt, Morocco or Jordan)"". In addition, the former State Department official said he would be gladly to ""…convey everything to the American administration, Congress and other influential figures"", while he also proposed that ""Qaddafi step aside, but not necessarily relinquish all his powers"". Both Bechtel and David Welch when asked by reporters today for a comment, declined to do so. Case 2: ""The American Lobbyist’s fiasco"" Secret documents seen by Guardian’s Luke Harding also reveal another desperate attempt of the Qaddafi regime to influence US public opinion in favor of his regime. It seems that Libya’s former Prime Minister Al-Baghdabi Ali al –Mahmoudi, employed Sufyan Omeish, a US lobbyist. The latter in a letter to Baghdani (dated June 28, 2011) states: ""It is clear that the NATO forces have no intention of ending their military campaign over Libya anytime soon"" and goes one step further, informing him of  ""evidence of covert logistical military planning for a future ground invasion in either late September or October this year"". Clearly such actions could constitute a state prosecution against Omeish, since he was providing strategic information to the ""enemy"" (since at that time NATO was on war against the Qaddafi regime in Libya). However, in his following messages, Omeish turns out to be playing Baghdabi for a fool, reassuring the Libyan Prime Minster that ""…we also obtained a new confirmation from a high profile Princeton professor and former UN fact finding commissioner, to join our delegation"" and also about his talks with ""award-winning / Oscar-nominated filmmakers to help document the truth about Libya"" (!!!) and ensure global exposure. Mr. Omeish declined making any comment. Case 3: ""You got mail Mr. President!"" Former Libyan Prime Minister Baghdabi, sensing the end is near, with the rebels surrounding the capital Tripoli, decided to rise to the challenge: If you’re thinking this meant that the former Prime Minister joined the Qaddafi forces fighting the rebels and earning a glorious death, this simply wasn’t the case. He just wrote a letter personally to President Obama, complaining about the US’s ""unprecedented decision"" to freeze Libya’s assets, and for siding with the ""evil rebels"", and quickly fled to Tunisia (where other members of the Qaddafi family are also located). This was as close to heroic as he could get… Case 4: ""The Oscar for best drama performance goes to..."" Finally, we mustn’t forget that Gaddafi himself send an appeal to both US Congress & Senate prior to the encirclement of Tripoli by the rebel forces. The letter, as it was announced by the Libyan government to the local media, would be a ""slap in the face"" for America. Libyan media celebrated this imminent action from their leader, as an act of defiance and bravery: Qaddafi would also include in the letter his determination to fight to death in his capital. However, the letter that was actually sent to the US Congress and Senate wasn’t quite like this. Using a humble tone, Qaddafi expressed his unhappiness about the US military assistance-through NATO- to the Libyan rebels and stated that there is actually no reason for a war, since he has no power – in fact, Qaddafi claimed to have left power in 1977 (!!). He also added that all these years since the 90’s he was working hard in order to: ""establish a special relationship with the US"", claiming to be the innocent victim of France’s expansionary policies that call for indirect control of Libya under its sphere of influence. As an epilogue, we can conclude that Qaddafi’s lobbying efforts were feeble, incoherent and widely unsuccessful. All these initiatives made by the onetime ""wanna-be-President of Africa"" could not turn the tide of events that led to his eventual downfall. However, what makes the Qaddafi case so unique, is that while it is an undisputed fact, that Social Media played a significant role in the ""Arab Spring"", thus the monarchs of the countries participating in the Arab Spring, tried unsuccessfully to suppress them or block free internet access in their countries, the Qaddafi regime, was the only one that tried to engage itself in lobbying-which is a distinctive characteristic of the American political system. This means that Qaddafi knew the dynamics of lobbying in the American political system, and tried to exploit it in order to save his regime, which can be seen as a quite unique phenomenon, in global politics.

9,The Road Ahead For Politicians Everywhere Is Not Easy!,news-society," Politicians in the United States of America can surely do a better job. There must be a change of approach if they are to maintain their respect as the leading democracy in the world. The American people are in the middle of nowhere when it comes to the real state of their economic affairs. What does downgrading of the credit rating from AAA to AA+ by one agency and the refusal of the others to follow suit. What about the job situation? Unemployment is on the lips of every politician but what about the industry leaders on both sides? What are they doing to improve conditions? What about the proud position of private sector leaders that they are the ones who create jobs. Why are they not creating jobs? Listening to the debate I get the impression that unemployment has to do with the level of corporate taxes levied on companies. While the noise is in the corner of those seeking substantial reduction on current corporate taxes, there are those who feel that taxes can be reviewed upward. One of the wealthiest men in the USA – Mr. Warren Buffet favors increased taxes. The debate is heading for an obvious conclusion that there needs to be an overhauling of the tax and social benefit structures. President Obama is correct; there should be a balanced approach. The very jobs that are the concern of every politician will take a further hit if the social services are reduced. What is really needed is control of the indiscriminate fees charged by the Health Care Institutions. No politician wants to deal with the problem head on. It is all about the high cost of health care. Sometimes a patient is asked to do several tests when one will do. President Obama noted that and in my opinion it appears that he is ready to take on the GOP head on. The next few weeks are going to be critical. The 2012 election campaign will be a very noisy season.  The tea party crowd will be really loud but I also feel it will be a defining moment for them. I don’t believe that the majority of Americans were satisfied with the way the raising of the debt ceiling issue was handled. There was no need to link the debt ceiling with the reduction in spending. It was necessary to priorities the process. Get the debt ceiling out of the way and then deal with spending cuts. Here in St. Lucia there is a new trend with politicians in opposition stepping out to assist the communities they represent or hope to represent. I always asked the question why politicians in opposition are helpless and can only do things for their constituents when they are in government? This is changing now and it is a good thing. The life of a politician should be one of service whether in or out of office. The election season in St. Lucia is very much upon us and the politicians have begun to sharpen their swords. There are interesting days ahead. Many persons have already predicted the outcome, unfortunately politics is like cricket and it is never over until it is over. In the months ahead it will become clearer as to the likely outcome. In the meantime, as always the voters have a responsibility to cast their ballot. Whether it is rock the vote or get out the vote, the voter turn out has to be improved. Our young people must be taught to respect the gains made by their fore parents who struggled to achieve adult suffrage. This is not to be taken lightly and their victory must be celebrated by everyone who has attained voting age and is registered by casting his/her ballot. The road ahead is not easy for politicians as the majority of people have grown to rely on them for their survival. Self Help, Self Reliance, Self Determination, Self Worth, Self Esteem, are all words that are needed to give meaning in the lives of the people. When self worth is truly established in the minds of the people, only then will they be in a position to enter into meaningful partnership with the government. There are some fundamental steps that must be taken to get the people to contribute meaningfully to the progress of the nation. The first step is to open the door to dialogue with the people. The people should be involved every step of the way in issues that affect them. The main aspiration of the people everywhere, above all is to enjoy a reasonable standard of living and this can only be realized when the people are fully behind their leadership. Remember always to Keep the Faith, God is in Charge, Dream Big and expect Daily Miracles! Edward Harris"
10,Criteria for Immigrants to Remain in the United States,news-society," Following the new US immigration policy released by President Back Obama which allows undocumented immigrants facing deportation to stay and work legally while the government works on reforming the immigration system, guidelines for deciding who may qualify to remain in US has been announced by U.S. Custom and Immigration Enforcements. Obama's decision on US Immigration policy is a new hope for skilled workers who now experience long waiting times for their US Visa applications to be processed, and many of 300,000 illegal immigrants currently facing deportation to remain in the US. However, to decide who may qualify, the White House would use more discretion and review deportation cases on an individual basis, according to Cecilia Munoz, the White House Director of Intergovernmental Affairs. ""There are more than 10 million people who are in the US illegally; it's clear that we can't deport such a large number,"" she said. ""So the Administration has developed a strategy to make sure we use those resources in a way that puts public safety and national security first."" Accordingly, ""common sense guidelines"" will be applied by Department of Homeland Security and Justice Department. These guidelines have been written by Morton, director of U.S. Custom and Immigration Enforcement, spelt out factors that immigration officials should consider when deciding whether the person will stay or go as follows: •the person's length of presence in the United States; •the circumstances of the person's arrival in the United States, particularly if the alien came to the United States as a young child; •the person's pursuit of education in the United States, with particular consideration given to those who have graduated from a U.S. high school or have successfully pursued or are pursuing a college or advanced degrees at a legitimate institution; •whether the person, or the person's immediate relative, has served in the U.S. military, reserves, or national guard; •the person's criminal history, including arrests, prior convictions, or outstanding arrest warrants; •the person's ties and contributions to the community, including family relationships; •the person's age, with particular consideration given to minors and the elderly; •whether the person has a U.S. citizen or permanent resident spouse, child, or parent; •whether the person is the primary caretaker of a person with a mental or physical disability, minor, or seriously ill relative; •whether the person or the person's spouse is pregnant or nursing. Morton also noticed that the list was not exhaustive and the factors were still being considered so no one was determinative."
11,Conservative Policies and How They Aim to Fix the Country's Problems,news-society," Nowadays, the country is severely divided about various issues.  One of the main topics of debate currently is illegal immigration.  Capital punishment, education, and abortion are also other hotly debated topics.  Here's a look at current conservative policies on some of these topics. Our country can actually benefit from immigration, but illegal immigration isn't necessarily a good thing.  The main issue is the fact that illegal immigrants can get into the country so easily.  If anyone want to attack the country, they may be able to get in easily through some of the same venues. Another issue that conservative policies address is the role of government in its citizen's lives.  The government shouldn't stick its nose in our business.  We're dangerously close to becoming a welfare state also and that certainly shouldn't happen. Abortion is yet another issue when it comes to American politics.  Many conservatives are split about this issue.  Even if they can't agree on whether it's wrong or right, they still feel the federal government shouldn't have any say in it.  However, the Constitution can be amended to address the issue, giving the federal government some say-so. One of the most pressing issues in the country is education since it directly affects the future of the country.  Since it's an individual's right to believe whatever they want, religious prayer in school should be allowed. Capital punishment is also taken into account with conservative policies.  If someone takes another person's life, then it's only fair that their life be taken as well.  Other conservatives are a bit more compassionate about it, believing in the power of forgiveness because of their Christian roots. One of the biggest current arguments is in regards to the Second Amendment.  Conservatives don't like the thought of the government trying to take away its citizens guns.  Only criminals would be left with guns if regular citizens couldn't legally own one. Now you know how conservative policies address some of the most debated topics around the country.  Although immigration can be good for the country, people definitely shouldn't be allowed to enter the country illegally.  It's best to allow school prayer to go unchecked in school since it is an individual's right to do so."
12,Etiquette in Using a High-Class Call Girl in London,news-society," Call girls are people too and, even though they provide their clients with a very special, professional service, they also have feelings, emotions, and desires. They should be treated with respect regardless of who is paying for what. Providers will usually have a website, and it’s important that you refer to this site to ascertain her personal etiquette guidelines. Boundaries are important, and if she has clear boundaries, don’t try to get around them. It’s also generally considered rude to bring up details of her private life such as her real name, her family, or whether or not she has a boyfriend. Talking about her other clients is also impolite. Details In your initial contacts with her, which may be by phone or email, talking specifically about her sexual services, especially if she has not provided an explicit list on her website, is usually considered impolite and may even be illegal. Although basic questions may be fine, it’s usually better to simply read the reviews on her site to find out what kinds of experiences she offers. Never attempt to negotiate her down from her set rate, and don’t ask her for photos that show her face. Dress Unless she has previously told you otherwise, dress as if you were going on a regular first date. If you have any questions about dress, ask her. If she asks how she should dress, don’t specify anything that would attract too much attention. Although she may be happy to dress provocatively once she is comfortable with you, keep it simple for the first date. Hygiene Good hygiene is an extremely important part of seeing a call girl. Shower immediately before the encounter, and make sure you are shaved and your teeth are brushed. Fresh breath will help the encounter go a lot more smoothly, and if you need to smoke, ask her before you light up. Comfort Once you are at the final date location, whether her place or yours, spend a few moments getting to know each other. If you are on her territory, she will generally make the first move by indicating to you that it’s time to get comfortable. If she is at your place, she will expect you to make the first move, and you should feel free to begin kissing her when you are ready. If this will be your first time with a call girl, let her know so that she can be extra delicate in guiding you through the process. Payment The financial transaction is an essential part of the process, and the majority of call girls have specific preferences as to how they like this part to be handled. Many times, you will be asked to leave the payment in an unsealed envelope in a highly visible location, but if you have any doubts, ask. Enclosing your payment in a pretty card the first few times can endear you greatly to your call girl. After It’s not impolite to send her a note commenting on how much you enjoyed the time you spent together. If you didn’t enjoy the appointment for some reason, just don’t contact her again. Keep in mind that, although your date may have been a perfect fantasy for you, for her it is a business, and she’s probably not interested in dating you or spending time with you outside of your appointments."
13,Ways to Stay Cool in the Summer,news-society," Summer is the perfect time for everyone to take off their clothes and go to the beach. It is the time where everyone feels hot and dry due to humid weather. Summer is also the best time to wear summer clothes like dresses and shorts. But even if summer spells vacation for a lot of us, summer can also be a tad bit annoying. These are times when staying out in the sun without sun block is a no-no. Everyone just wants to shake off the heat during summer. At this time, people find their own ways to stay cool in the summer. The following are some of the steps that people can do in staying cool in the heat. One of the easiest ways to stay cool in the summer is to use air conditioners and fans. Let your fans at home do the work. Turn on your desk fans and ceiling fans in order to cool down the temperature. Although fans can eat up electricity, it’s alright to use them just for a short period of time. It is advisable that you use the fans at the hottest time of the day, like the early afternoons. If you have an AC at home, you can turn it on instead to cool the room or house faster. While staying in your cool room, you can have freezer goodies or cold drinks to further lower the temperature. This is a perfect way to spend the afternoons especially with the family. Another way is to have some splash of fun outside, like literal splash. Unfortunately, there are some neighborhoods that have rules against water outside the house. But if your place doesn’t, then grab the opportunity to play outside. You can set your own inflatable pool in the yard. You can also use water hose and even your sprinklers just to spice up the fun. There are no rules as long as you get wet and have fun with friends or your family. You can also have a water balloon fight. This won’t be a problem as long as you don’t get your neighbors wet. Creating freezer goodies is also a famous way in staying cool in the heat. This can be a fun activity with the family. One can create homemade popsicles and lemonade. This can surely bring down the temperature even for just short time. Keeping yourself hydrated is also important during summer."
14,Shaw Capital Management News: Anonymous Claims Network Breach Of FBI Security Contractor ManTech,news-society," Anonymous continued with its string of attacks designed to embarrass the FBI, this time claiming to have breached the network of ManTech International, the FBI’s cyber-security contractor. Anonymous Claims Network Breach of FBI Security Contractor ManTech ( Page 1 of 2 ) As promised, Anonymous has sought to embarrass the FBI with a network attack, this time going after defense contractor ManTech International. ""Hacktivist"" collective Anonymous claims to have ""owned"" the defense contractor ManTech International and promised to release the stolen information within 24 hours, according to a post on Twitter that appeared shortly after midnight on July 29. Some documents have already been posted as ""teasers,"" including a resume of an individual with significant military and law enforcement background and a statement of work memo for NATO Communication & Information Systems Services Agency. About 500MB of files are expected to be released. This latest attack is in apparent retribution for the July 20 arrests of individuals who are accused of participating in Anonymous group hacking attacks. Earlier this week, in the midst of news reports about British police arresting a suspected member of hacker group LulzSec and regular updates on Twitter about people canceling PayPal accounts in protest, Anonymous posted the following warning on Twitter, ""Also, tomorrow: Expect something nice. Looks like the FBI asked for a slap in the face. Well, we can deliver. #FFF (On Thursday, who cares)."" About 14 individuals were arrested on July 20 in the United States for participating in the Anonymous DDOS (distributed denial-of-service) campaign against PayPal in Operation Payback in December. The FBI also arrested one person accused of hacking into InfraGard Tampa and a customer support contractor who downloaded confidential AT&T documents and provided them to LulzSec. The group said the attacks will continue regardless of the arrests. ""We are not scared anymore. Any threats to arrest us are meaningless. We are past threats. We just act. #AntiSec #FFFriday,"" the group posted via Twitter. British police also arrested two alleged members of LulzSec, and the Dutch National Police Agency arrested four Anonymous members this month. In June, Spanish authorities arrested three members and claimed to have shut down Anonymous within the country, and Turkish police detained 32 individuals with alleged links to the group. ManTech provides cyber-security services such round-the-clock intrusion-detection monitoring, security engineering, and incident identification and response. It’s providing these services to the FBI’s security division as part of a $99.5 million five-year contract. The company also provides vulnerability assessment and penetration testing, cyber-threat analysis and specialized cyber-training services. Other clients include the National Security Agency and the departments of Defense, State and Homeland Security, among others. ""The latest attack against ManTech following a string of attacks against other defense and national security contractors shows that those charged with defending our nation are also susceptible to the same attacks,"" Anup Ghosh, CEO of Invincea, told eWEEK. ""Make no mistake — this is a failure of the security industry more than it is a failure of ManTech, Booz Allen, Northrup Grumman, and the National Labs,"" Ghosh added. Anonymous dumped 90,000 passwords belonging to military personnel from consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, exposed sensitive information belonging to agricultural chemical and biotechnology company Monsanto employees and stole more than 8GB of internal data from Italy’s cyber-crime police unit. Before it disbanded, LulzSec lifted and published internal documents obtained during its attack on the Arizona Department of Public Safety, breached two Websites belonging to FBI partners InfraGard Atlanta and InfraGard Connecticut, and broke into surveillance company Unveillance CEO’s personal email account."
15,Australia Updates Character Requirement for Immigration,news-society," The Australian Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) has recently updated and released the latest version of the Character Requirement, which now includes more criteria in the test, for those who wish to enter and stay in Australia. In the updated Character Requirement, the DIAC has added one more criteria for passing the character test. The most sufficient list of cases that lead to applicants' failure for the character test is that when: •	they have a substantial criminal record. A person is considered to have a substantial criminal record if they have been: sentenced to either death or life imprisonment; sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 12 months or more; sentenced to two or more terms of imprisonment (whether on one or more occasions), where the total of those terms is two years or more; or acquitted of an offence on the grounds of either unsoundness of mind or insanity and, as a result, the person has been detained in a facility or institution. •	they have been convicted of any offence that was committed while in immigration detention, during an escape from immigration detention, during a period where a person escaped from immigration detention, or if the person has been convicted of the offence of escaping from immigration detention •	they have, or have had, an association with an individual, group or organisation suspected of having been, or being, involved in criminal conduct •	having regard to the person's past and present criminal conduct, the person is found not to be of good character •	having regard to the person's past and present general conduct, the person is found to be not of good character •	there is a significant risk that the person will engage in criminal conduct in Australia, harass, molest, intimidate or stalk another person in Australia, vilify a segment of the Australian community, or incite discord in the Australian community or in a segment of that community, or represent a danger to the Australian community or a segment of that community. It's compulsory for Australian visa applicants, non-citizen sponsors and non-migrating family members who wish to enter and stay in Australia to have their character assessed, which means they have to meet the character requirements mentioned in Section 501 of the Migration Act 1958. This section of the Migration Act 1958 designs the character test to ensure that visa applicants, relevant non-citizen sponsors, as well as non-migrating family members are of good character. In addition, the test also gives discretionary powers to either refuse or cancel visas if potential migrants to Australia fail the test. If visa applications are cancelled due to applicants' a substantial criminal record or past and present criminal conduct, these applicants will be permanently excluded from Australia. There are some other cases when applicants are determined by the competent Australian authorities to be directly or indirectly a risk to Australian national security, their visa will be refused. Moreover, if the Foreign Minister, or a person authorised by the Foreign Minister assesses someone's presence in Australia to be contrary to Australia's foreign policy interests or Australia's Autonomous Sanctions Regulations; or directly or indirectly associated with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, that person's visa will be refused."
16,'Judge Mary Devins is alcoholic' by Maura Harrington,news-society," DISCLAIMER: all views expressed in this article are my own and do not represent the position of Shell To Sea or any organisation or cause I have wanted to write this piece for many years, but felt it best to wait until such time as my cases had resolved themselves in the Circuit Court and indeed other cases taken by the state against my colleagues had been rightfully dismissed too. As will be obvious from the title, my concern is our local District Judge Mary Devins here in County Mayo on the West coast of Ireland and a problem she has struggled with for many years. A problem that, unfortunately, has a marked and negative impact on the lives of us locals. Stories have circulated for nearly a decade now about Judge Devins being encountered in a highly intoxicated state at various Mayo restaurants and one hotel bar in particular. Usually these stories (which change slightly depending on who is telling them) also feature her ex-Fianna Fáil husband Jimmy Devins trying to placate her. In the interests of accuracy there are a couple of very important points to make about these rural myths right from the start. Firstly, it's now accepted by most solicitors, Gardaí, social workers and residents here in District 3 that such tales have not only been exaggerated but quite possibly multiplied and result mainly from one incident in 2002. Admittedly, the incident in question was noteworthy, occurring as it did in the social life of a Irish District Court Judge. It seems that many guests and members of staff at a well known hotel near Castlebar witnessed an incident during which Devins verbally abused both an elderly female friend and her own husband. Perhaps more worryingly, they also observed her repeatedly banging her head against a cigarette dispenser a short while later. This much behaviour seems certain, as so many present that night provided corroborating details and in fact to this day many people in Mayo know someone who knows someone who was eating or drinking in the hotel restaurant that night. In other words, it has become accepted as fact throughout Mayo. In my personal opinion, the story is perfectly true. I shall neither debate nor reproduce the various other anecdotes that circulate about Judge Devins being drunk in various places at various times simply because I don't have that same feeling of total confidence they are all true. Maybe the other stories are true, maybe they are not. Maybe some of them are true and some of them are not. Maybe none of them are true. It is only because I firmly believe the hotel incident is absolutely true that I have reproduced it in good faith. The second thing it's important to stress - with great haste - is the aforementioned incident really would have very little bearing on Mary Devins being a District Judge if there were not already extremely obvious problems with her. As a campaigner for the better part of my life, I want to be absolutely clear on this point. If we didn't have other reasons for concern, the nearly 10 year old episode would fall into the realm of the woman's personal life and not warrant reproduction here or anywhere. After all, who hasn't been drunk and behaved regrettably at least once or twice in their life? I myself am nearly 60 and more than a few times over the years have gotten tipsy and emotional. Haven't we all! It is when one starts to examine Judge Devin's far more relevant public court record, that her 2002 hotel incident becomes valid. That is because it's very clear to everyone that over the nearly fifteen year period since she was appointed to the bench in 1997 her record has brimmed with thousands of irritable exchanges, breathtaking mood swings and frankly bizarre rulings - many of which it is roundly agreed are profoundly unjust. It is the opinion of us locals that she has repeatedly come to work while still actually under the influence of alcohol. She has questioned whether she can trust any Gardaí in Mayo. Refused to adjourn a man's case when he was in hospital with injuries sustained in her very courtroom and a letter from the hospital was presented to her saying he could not leave their care. The judiciary itself has repeatedly had to censure her after finding that she has exceeded her jurisdiction. ""Why, when the country is on its knees do we have to pay for a Polish interpreter?"" she blurted one day. Everyone in the courtroom fell silent including the Polish defendants - and several people noticed that Judge Devins was visibly shaking. ""You have been in this country for seven years"" she seemed on the verge of tears, ""and you haven’t learned at least one of our languages?!"" As my astute blogger friend Gombeen points out, she was clearly not referring to Polish or Chinese which classify as our most widely spoken second and third languages when she referred to the plurality of dialects spoken in present-day Ireland. Nor did she seem particularly concerned with the fact that a courtroom can be a very intimidating place for a non-native English speaker. Or the fact there is a well established precedent for interpretation. On the contrary, the local wisdom was: ""she's pissed again..."" Another day, when dealing with a form of urban acrobatics in which participants known as 'freerunners' who use cities and rural landscapes to perform movements through their structures, Judge Devins said the new Defence and Dwelling Bill should make people think twice about freerunning through people’s property. ""The new bill is about household defence and people protecting their property"" she literally seemed to slur her words, ""if you do this [freerunning] through the property of a person who has a legally held shotgun, just think about it! If the bill goes through, people are entitled to take action they see necessary in their home or the curtilage of the home..."" There was a stunned silence - and almost unanimous agreement among us that this was inflammatory, incitement to violence and that once again she was not sober while speaking. Yet what could anyone say? She is a judge. On yet another occasion she described a farmer who let a line of traffic build up behind his tractor as ""arrogant and individualistic"". She then banned the driver, Michael Nevin, for one year although he maintained he had pulled over at the earliest opportunity to let traffic pass. Sound fairly unimportant? Consider that she herself has repeatedly courted controversy by consistently parking not just on double yellow lines outside Ballinrobe Courthouse but with poor co-ordination and sometimes one wheel on the path/one off, a practice highlighted by local councillor Harry Walsh. It seems that the issue of a District Court Judge blatantly flaunting the law - while doling out sentences to others - has raised the hackles of some locals. ""Lawmakers should not be lawbreakers"" Walsh reasonably maintains, adding: ""I honestly don’t see why a Judge, or any servant of the State, or anyone else going into town for business should be allowed to flaunt the law by parking on double-yellow lines. I can see why prison vehicles and garda cars need to be adjacent, but not a private car."" I invite the reader to examine Judge Devin's public court record themselves, some of which is reported through the print media and in other words available online. It speaks for itself. This servant of the state, who regularly breezes into court wearing massive earrings and sassy jackets, is not entirely in control. At the same time, I would remind people that not everything she does is reported by the media and that Devins herself knows this. Sometimes her worst abuses and offences take place when she is confident very few are watching. Therefore, it's also important to ask around and hear personal stories. Anyone who does so will soon discover that her drinking is regarded as a local 'problem'. There will doubtless be some people reading this who will assume that because I have protested against and appeared in the District Court regarding Shell's proposed pipeline, that all my ideas about Judge Devins must be based on that experience. However, the truth is her court record in general is a damning indictment of the Irish judiciary and that it's important someone stands up and says so. Important that someone refers to the elephant in the room in the Mayo judiciary. Ultimately, this has got little to do with Corrib or myself - and everything to do with the individual Mary Devins. Nonetheless, I would concede the orders that took me aback most were related to my own court appearances and because it's difficult for to remain subjective in such instances will instead quote Senator David Norris who raised my case in the Irish Seanad. ""She then referred Ms. Harrington for psychiatric examination in addition to jailing her for 28 days,"" Norris said of Devins and myself. ""Are we returning to eastern Europe? Is it an attempt to use psychiatry to control political expression? This is terribly dangerous territory!"" In fact, having a ridiculous report like that ordered on me was not what irritated me the most about Judge Devins. It was once suggested in court that I had been acting under the influence of alcohol while climbing a fence as part of my legitimate campaign against Shell. I believe that was probably the moment that most stuck in my craw. Everybody and his dog knows this Judge very has a serious drinking problem - I thought to myself privately - yet people in court are falsely suggesting the problem instead applies to me? You can imagine how infuriating that was. I suppose it's understandable that I have ended up being the one who says aloud what is on the tip of everyone's tongue. Yet I emphasize, once again, this is not about me or what I campaign for. This is a significant problem that touches the lives of thousands of people whose cases pass through the courtroom of Judge Mary Devins. I am merely the one who is saying enough is enough. The question we are all baffled by in District 3 is how do you fix a problem like Mary? From a legal point of view, the answer is simple. We have an appellate system in this country and when Devins rules in a way viewed as scandalous - as she so often does - the applicants or defendants or DPP may appeal. The case in question then gets kicked into the Circuit Court where there is no Judge Devins. Does that mean it doesn't matter how bad she is? Does it mean, essentially, that even though she might make some controversial decisions, our greater legal system provides plenty of space for us to remedy them? That she is just a soused regional dinosaur who should be forgotten about? I don't think so. In case there exists any doubt in the mind of a reader out there, all of this constitutes totally inappropriate behaviour for a sitting Judge. A significant and consistent number who come before Mary Devins are being openly and egregiously abused. The vast majority understandably come away distressed, concerned, shocked and appalled. Yet those who who question or resist Judge Devins invariably face indifference or risk paying an even heavier price at the time or if they come before her again. The existence of an appellate court does not mean anything should be tolerated in a lower one - obviously there should always be a certain standard demanded. This is to say nothing of the standard fact that appealing a case involves more money, time and stress which many cannot afford. In the interests of balance it's important to say that in addition to her aforementioned problems, Judge Devins does also have some redeeming qualities. At times, she appears to slice through layers of bureaucracy of the state, scheming by local solicitors and evasion by laypersons. Myself and many others sincerely believe that if she completely stopped drinking, she might actually be a good judge. That a certain genius we sometimes catch brief glimpses of - and which occasionally inspires people who spend only limited amounts of time in her courtroom - could blossom into something positive and genuine for the community. ""She does have a good side"" a local solicitor reassured me after my pychological report was ordered. ""But it's subsumed by an overwhelming belief in authority and what I think it's fair to say is at this stage a fairly well known problem with alcohol. She appears to completely lose control about two or three times a week. The processes and evidence that satisfies her tend to be highly questionable. In effect, she's a rogue judge and there's nothing we can do about it..."" This is quite true. In 2006 then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform Brian Lenihan Jnr was approached at an event, asked in a forthright way ""when are you folks going to do something about the problem in District 3?"" and responded by saying that impeachment of Judges is virtually unheard of in Ireland and in recent times only applied to Brian Curtain who was discovered to have purchased child pornography online with his credit card. It's worth remembering that, even in that instance, another Irish Judge tried to prevent the evidence coming to light on the basis the warrant used for the house search had recently expired. When judges are presented with evidence against other judges, their tendency is to sneeze at it. The chances of Devin's impeachment ever occurring or indeed any form of inquiry into her alcoholism are virtually nil. She will most likely do what nearly every Judge does: serve her time and retire. The only thing people of courage can really do is talk about this - raise consciousness. People outside our county and indeed country need to understand there is quite literally a climate of fear in County Mayo on the West coast of Ireland not unlike that which Irish Times editor Geraldine Kennedy spoke of experiencing in and around government buildings in the 80's during the reign of Taoiseach Charles Haughey. To those who don't know, he was leader of the government of this sorry state in which Judge Devin's husband Jimmy Devins was a TD until recent years when our country voted to remove them from power due to the profoundly decimated state of the economy they governed for 18 of the preceding 20 years.

17,Recognizing The Potential Of Wind Energy As A Viable And Profitable Source of Energy Production,news-society," Both government and industry are searching for the most efficient environmentally friendly and sustainable methods to generate energy. Society's love affair with cheap power has had far reaching consequences including the over reliance on fossil fuels which has had negative impacts on climate, habitats, and the lives of millions of people around the world. Though wind turbines have been used in various forms for centuries, there is now a renewed interest in the potential they have for supplying a large amount of energy. The ability to harness wind energy for power has been attracting a great deal of attention, especially in the US. The United States now produces more wind power than any other nation, and it is predicted that by 2030, around twenty per cent of the nation's supply will be sourced through this technology. In 2009 alone, thirty nine percent more capacity was added by the US wind power industry. This industry holds a lot of promise and a great deal of potential, however there are also obvious problems that this sector faces. There are two main concerns regarding renewable wind energy as a sustainable source of power production. First of these concerns is sustainability. As everyone knows, the wind does not always blow. For this reason, many governments are unwilling to invest heavily in the latest turbines as there is no guarantee that they will be efficient, especially for countries that rely heavily on the export of their natural resources as their main source of economic growth. Their argument is that there would still be a need to have back up systems in place to cover any periods when there is no breeze. The second concern is a combination of location and cost of operating a large scale wind project. Typically, the places where winds blow the most consistently are fairly remote. For example, steady winds are usually located at the top of mountains, out at sea, and across remote plains. This is a problem that is highlighted in Texas, the country's leading state for producing wind-power. West Texas is where the speeds and gusts are most constant, specifically on the high plains and mesas, but these regions are a considerable distance from Houston and Dallas, and installing the necessary power and utilities are difficult and expensive. There is a lot of interest in positioning turbines offshore, though this is more expensive than onshore, data indicates that the breeze out at sea is both stronger and more constant than onshore. Offshore wind farms do make it possible to create large scale wind power facilities close to large coastal settlements, without the need for costly and extensive overland transmission cables. Also, by positioning the turbines at sea, they are not the eyesore that they would be if installed on land. Cost of repair and maintenance at these locations can also be costly. However, new technology has enabled wind farm operators to assess, detect and repair large wind turbines without extended downtime and exorbitant costs that result in loss of profit. This means that the positioning of wind farms isn't as much of a problem as curbing the current governmental  mindset that fossil fuels are a necessity. The cost of extracting fossil fuels is becoming more expensive on an annual basis, yet the demand from consumers is showing absolutely no sign of decline. Sustainable power may be the solution that keeps the economy buoyant in the coming decades. With more efficient turbines being constructed on an ongoing basis, the prevalence of wind technology is only going to grow. The real trick is showing both government and consumer that wind energy is cost effective as not only an efficient long term energy production method, but viable source of revenue."
18,Gay Hate Crimes and Self Defense,news-society," On October 8th, 2010 nine men were charged with torturing three men in a New York Bronx basement. The reason; behind this horrific act were that the three men were accused of being gay. Similar hate crimes are repeated hundreds of times in other cities across the United States. Police report an increase in hate crimes committed against gays in the past three years. If this unfortunate situation were not enough, it is estimated that there are probably thousands of unreported cases. Self defense has become a primary concern for many in the gay community. As gay's struggle for the same rights afforded to other Americans, their plight is broadcasted to millions of households in what is supposed to be the home of the brave and free. The problem is that fifty percent of Americans opposes certain gay rights. Unfortunately, a small but growing segment of that population is willing to use violence to express their displeasure. As gay's gain more rights; especially in the area of gay marriage, it is estimated that the level of violence perpetrated by those who oppose gay rights will increase. One of the primary reasons inciting gay hate crimes is the perception that gays are cowards. Some think they are incapable of defending themselves and thus are easy prey? This misconception has existed for many years and is the catalyst for refusing military service to gays in the past. I recently overheard a conversation about self defense at a restaurant, when one man claimed. ""There is not a gay man anywhere in the world that could defeat him in a fight."" This notion that gay people have a disadvantage in an altercation is not uncommon among heterosexual men. Gay women are also not immune to hate crime violence. On February 3, 2011, a gay woman claimed she was beaten by twelve men and women outside a bar. She told reporters she only fought back in self defense. When police were summoned to the scene, they only arrested the gay woman. Here, lies a dilemma for gay people. Some law enforcement personnel are biased when it comes to assaults on gays. They fail to act or are hesitant to action unless serious injuries are inflicted on the victims. In many of the assaults on gays the victim fights back. Recently, a transgender woman was attacked at a Maryland McDonalds by two females. The entire incident was captured on video and posted on YouTube. Millions of viewers watched the videos of the two females beating and dragging the transgender women all over the McDonalds floor. In self defense, the victim fought back but was overpowered by her assailants and was viciously beaten. The two female attackers were arrested and later charged with a hate crime. Although hate crime charges carry some serious jail time, I am sure that the victims would prefer to avoid this incident or to successfully resist such attacks. Because of high profile hate crimes many gays are carrying non lethal self defense weapons. The benefits of owning such weapons are apparent when viewing the YouTube video of the assault on the transgender female. It becomes clear that if she had at her disposable a simple canister of pepper spray the results of the altercation could have been quite different. If she had used a stun gun on her assailants the millions of viewers on YouTube, would have rejoiced to see two bullies, get what they deserve. Many gay people are refusing to be punching bags for intolerant bigots. They realize that they have the right to walk the streets without fear, and they are taking steps to minimize self-defense threats."
19,Possible Facts of Individuals Rights to oppose  Florida DUI Arrests,news-society," A person who violated the law is entitle of Miranda rights which requires all law officials in the United States to issue the said rights to the offenders under their custody. The Miranda rights are warnings that informs offenders about their constitutional rights. If you have been given this condition it does not mean you will be under detention. It is rather a reminder in accordance with your safety against self-incrimination. If the law officials failed to offer Miranda warning to individuals, still florida dui arrests officials can interrogate the person's accuse and act upon to what evidence they gather, but the person's statement may not use to incriminate him/her. According to United States justice system all defendants are innocent until proven guilty. In order to prove that the defendant is guilty of DUI, the prosecutors must seek loop holes against the defendant who committed the violation beyond a reasonable doubt.  (He/she cannot be convicted of the crimes, without documents supported or evidences that may prove of he/she is guilty. And I am sure everyone is aware about their rights.) What Possible defenses may a Lawyer use to acquit their client? The offender's hired lawyer will closely examine all aspects of the case against his/her client, in particular attention with details. The process of investigation will likely to follow police procedures arrest and the evidence of the defendant. If there is no probable cause of DUI violation, though indeed the driver is drunk florida dui arrests officers cannot arrest the accused. Florida DUI arrests agent or police are constitutionally prohibited to detain or arrest people indiscriminately. Additionally, defense attorney can do further arguments to weaken the case, like; raising a defense statement regarding the level of alcohol intake by the driver. Apparently, person's blood alcohol level not immediately increases the intake of alcohol. It takes time to absorb the alcohol in the person's blood and it is based in several factors, such as person's weight, metabolism, and the amount of food in the stomach. If he/she is arrested due to these instances before he/she was legally drunk, the defendant may be acquitted. Can you file an appeal to halt detention? Yes! Every one has the right to retain an appeal if convicted of DUI. Appeal of conviction relates only to the appropriateness of the sentence, not innocence or guilt of the accused. Appeal against conviction concerns whether the defendant's right to a trial has been violated substantially. If you have been arrested by florida dui arrests agent due to DUI violation, you should seek an experience DUI lawyer, though Lawyers do not like to mention ""specialization"" that refers to them, but it is necessary to hire an attorney who is knowledgeable when it comes to DUI cases."
20,Alternative Energy Sources,news-society," At the beginning of the twentieth century the world has suffered from the exploitation of natural resources and air pollution and soil degradation. Oil, for example, has been a source of energy, and extracted continuously so that their wells have begun to run low, less than 100 years after the beginning of their effective use. Coal is a resource even older, is also considered esgotável. Nuclear power, just as is the warning about the danger of radioactive waste. The use of traditional sources traces its history to the decline, not only for his character, but that is a threat to the environment. We call an alternative source of energy in ecology is to gain a growing area, the sources that call the alternative, which does not affect the nature, and are renewable, and is why they are perennials, there are several types of sources for example, is renewable energy, including solar energy is the solar panels, photovoltaic cells and wind is the wind turbine and a windmill, water and hydro power is the wheel, water turbine and biomass is a matter of plant origin. Brazil has shown in international fora, that it intends to improve the use of renewable energy and diversify sources of power generation, with this commitment, it reduces the risk of further water shortages, which often leads to crisis situations and rationing. Many see the generation of renewable energy as an isolated initiative, unable to meet the demand of a large continental country. With the use of alternative energy is not immediately necessary to abandon traditional resources. Already in Germany, for example, showed that the use of renewable sources can be useful to the state, and for the people and the environment. Germany accounts for around one third of all wind power installed worldwide. This represents half of the energy generated in the entire investment Europa.com German deployment allows the use of fuel from plants, or biomass. It is virtually inexhaustible source of solar energy that can be used to produce electricity through solar panels and photovoltaic cells. Countries that the amount of sunlight is abundant throughout the year, which encourage the use of resources. There are two main issues in the use of passive and active solar energy. The active ingredient is based on the method of transforming sunlight into other forms of energy: heat or electricity, while the passive is used to heat buildings or buildings through design and construction strategies. This application is most common in the cold in Europe, where demand for heating options. Photovoltaic panels, but the most promising source of renewable energy, because their main advantage is the almost total absence of pollution. The main limitation of photovoltaic devices is their low income level, because the other drawback is the cost of producing groups that are high due to the limited availability of semiconductor materials."

1,How To Avoid Bed Bugs,news-society," Bed bugs are disgusting little creatures that invade their way into your home and make themselves comfortable in your mattress.  While you are sleeping, they make their way out of their hiding spots in your mattress to feast on your body.  Gross! It seems like there have been many more outbreaks of bedbugs lately, and the thought of getting them in my house scares the pants off me.  Ick.  I’m doing everything I can to prevent bringing bedbugs in my house, and you should too!  I think it is much easier to prevent bedbugs than it is to get rid of them.  I know someone once who had gotten bed bugs and had to trash all their mattresses and buy new ones.  That’s not frugal or green! I’ll share with you some of the tips we use to prevent bed bugs. -When staying at a hotel, we make sure to leave all our belongings out in the hallway before taking them into a room.  Usually I’ll have Mr. Money hang out in the hallway with everything while I do a twice over of the room.  Bed bugs like to hide in the cracks and seams of the mattresses, so it’s important to pull back the sheets and check for them there. -If you go shopping and buy new towels, clothing, or linens, be sure to wash and dry them before you wear or use them.  When buying things from the thrift store, be sure to check before you buy.  That would be so gross if  you took home bed bugs on the clothes! If you put the items in the dryer with heat for at least 20 minutes, that should kill anything that is lingering on the fabric.  I make sure to wash everything I bring in in the washer with a cup of vinegar and then dry in the dryer.  You’ll not only kill any germs, but you’ll also help remove any toxins from the fabric! -Bed bugs like warm areas.  They will crawl into laptops, netbooks, or other electronic devices to be warm.  Be sure to check your electronic devices before taking them back into your house after you take them somewhere. -If you think you may have picked up bed bugs, take all of your items into an area that has a hard floor where you can see the bed bugs.  Bed bugs don’t travel on people like lice or fleas, so they’ll fall to the floor. -Don’t buy second hand mattresses. While this is a money saving and green option, I wouldn’t take the risk right now.  Of course, if it’s someone you know that’s selling or giving away a mattress, I’d probably be fine with it.  Getting a free mattress off Freecycle or Craigslist? I think I’ll pass.  The chances of getting bed bugs from a second hand mattress creeps me out more than spending a little extra money and buying new. If you exercise common sense and caution, you’ll probably avoid the bed bugs.  Have you heard of the bed bug infestation?  Do you make sure you check for bed bugs before you go into a hotel room?"
2,Where Greed And Need Meet: The Horizon,news-society," Every human needs an occupation and environment  as it is an inevitable part of one's life. These two are intertwined when it comes to the health factor of an individual. An individual's health is a key factor when his productivity in a particular occupation is to be judged. The working conditions for an individual would determine the severity of the effects on his/her health. The occupational risks to one's health can be mechanical hazards, physical hazards, biological hazards, chemical hazards, psychosocial issues depending on the type of occupation. A glaring example  can be the Bhopal gas tragedy in 1984 where not only the lives of the numerous workers were lost and adversely affected but even the city was enveloped in a death cover. It seemed hell had broken itself loose on the city, but it was utter callousness that resulted in the mayhem. When the environmental health factors are put forth, a number of things need to be taken care of by an organization which include both the natural and man built environment. Proper sanitation, food protection, housing, institutional environmental health, land use, community noise control, recreational swimming areas and waters, electromagnetic radiation control, solid, liquid, and hazardous materials management, underground storage tank control, on-site septic systems, vector control, drinking water quality, and emergency preparedness. Certain parameters which make a working space workable must be adhered to. Organizations should come up with greener and cleaner  ways of industrial productions. This way the organization and the individual will benefit  on the occupational and the environmental front, rather than compromising on the best and essential input for the economy, the human resource. Another set of determinants which has come to the fore is the psychological factor at the work place. Sexual harassment, excessive job pressure, depressing work culture, the resultant idiotic inclination and dependence on nicotine and alcohol consumption are further aggravating the already serious scenario. Almost every nation around the globe has specific labour and industrial laws in place to take care of the occupational health of the working class and along with that the environmental factor too is taken care of, by designated ministries. Occupational health and environmental health are  cross-disciplinary area  which are concerned with protecting the safety, health and welfare of people engaged in work or employment without compromising on the environmental factor. The goal of every nation and organization should be to foster a safe working environment which shall for sure have a secondary effect, by protecting the co-workers, family members, employers, customers, suppliers, nearby communities, and other members of the public who are impacted by the workplace environment."

4,War Cemeteries in Cassino,news-society," Cassino is sadly known also for the 4 battles that took place in this city in 1944, during the Second World War. The city of Cassino, during the Second World War, was protagonist of one of the bloodiest battles of the war. Like many other cities that are known also because of tragic episodes of this kind, in Cassino the memory of what happened is still alive, also because to remind the inhabitants and visitors of the city of what occurred not many years ago there are not only museums and buildings, like the Abbey of Montecassino, which were destroyed during the fights, but also cemeteries, which silently but heavy cover the territory of Cassino working not only like memorials but also like warning for all of us. In Cassino many soldiers coming from different countries died, young men that died in battle for something they believed in, or maybe because they had no choice other than taking the field and risking their own life. Young soldiers that now are resting in Cassino, in the various cemeteries of the city: the Polish, the German and the Commonwealth cemetery, which is probably the most famous one. In the Commonwealth Cemetery 4,266 Commonwealth soldiers are resting; most of them died during the battles of Cassino, which took place from January to May 1944. A wide cemetery, the second largest Commonwealth cemetery in Italy, in which British, Canadian, New Zealand, South-African, Indian, Pakistan soldiers, along with one soldier of the Red Army have been buried. 284 of these soldiers have never been identified. Apart from soldiers’ graves, which form long lines of white stones on a green field, the cemetery also hosts the commemorative monument of Cassino, which was built in 1956 to honour the Commonwealth soldiers that took part in the Italian Campaign. In addition to the Commonwealth Cemetery, also known as Cassino War Cemetery, you should also visit the Polish cemetery, north of the Abbey of Montecassino. This is where 1,052 soldiers belonging to the 11th branch of the Polish Army  are resting, and this is where General Anders, who died in 1961, and archbishop chaplain Gawlina wanted to be buried. You can enter it through a lane lined with cypresses, and the crosses that remind us of the dead soldiers are placed in a semi-circular way. In the German cemetery, in Caira, north of Cassino, the corpses of 20,035 soldiers of the Third Reich who died in Italy, notably in the area of Cassino to Frosinone, Pescara, Lecce and Reggio Calabria (excluding Sicily) are resting. Started in 1959 by architect Tischler, works went on with Prof. Offemberg. Crosses are placed in a circular way in a sort of amphitheatre, which spreads upwards like a hill, and at the entrance there are the statues of a man and a woman expressing the desolation caused by the tragedy of war. On the top of the hill there is a 11-meter high bronze cross. Cassino war cemeteries, just because they host the corpse of soldiers of different nationalities, should be seen as monuments against the war in its totality, without any distinction of nationality and boundaries."
5,How to buy Football Tickets Safely,news-society," Nobody likes to get mixed up in a football ticket scam, especially if you have been looking forward to going to see your favourite team and have paid a lot of money for the privilege. Therefore, it is advisable that you follow some simple precautionary steps to make sure you are buying from a reputable seller. The first port of call when buying football tickets is to go to your teams recommended sellers or resellers list. There you will find a list of retailers that the company have sold wholesale amounts of football tickets to. You can be assured that such vendors are legitimate as they have been recommended by the football club itself. Unfortunately, most major clubs do not have a reseller list as they prefer to be the sole supplier of the tickets. This can be great for fans as it means a reliable ticket supply but it means that the club can charge any ridiculous price for the football tickets and it also means that you have to buy your tickets well in advance so they don' t sell out. Therefore, using a football ticket exchange site or a secondary seller is your best option. The great thing about ticket exchange websites is that they are trading in an open market place, meaning that no one seller sets a price, they have to stay competitive in order to make the sale. This means that fans can get a hold of hard to find football tickets for a reasonable price. However, when buying from any football tickets website it is advised that  you follow new guidelines set out by the office of fair trading. Recently, the office of fair trading has released the Just Tick Campaign. The Just Tick Campaign is a check list of five things every potential ticket buyer should tick off their list to make sure that they are buying form a reputable source. How has the website got the tickets to sell? Check with the festival to find out when tickets are being released for sale and when the tickets will be sent out. Find out what others are saying about the website. Search the internet to find out what other people's experiences have been. How can you contact the company behind the website? Check that you know their full geographic address and check they have a working landline phone number. Can they provide ticket details? Ensure that the face value of the tickets and the seat location/festival area are clearly listed and consistent with the official festival website. Do they provide refunds? Make sure there is a refund policy in case something goes wrong."
6,Medway Galvanising ringing to the rescue,news-society," A tireless fundraising campaign by locals and bell ringers to raise £30,000, has seen the restoration of six 200 year old bells at St Mary's Church in Builth Wells, Powys. The bells, weighing almost half a tonne each, were winched out for restoration in October 2010. Whites of Appleton Ltd, the oldest bell hanging company in the UK, sent the bells to London for re-tuning and the headstocks to Kent-based steel finishing specialist, Medway Galvanising, for a new lease of life. A crucial component that attaches the bell to the wheel and is pivoted on two pins set into the bearings, the headstocks had rusted and posed a potential risk should they have failed and fell. In need of full restoration, Medway Galvanising was called in to strip, galvanised powder coating, ensuring many more years of safe bell ringing in the village. Without a galvanised coating, oxygen in the air would react with the metal headstocks and begin to corrode the untreated steel. Operating to stringent quality control processes and fully accredited to all the latest BS and ISO standards, Medway Galvanising worked fast to restore the headstocks. Now complete and powder coated in Whites of Appleton's trademark blue, they promise years of corrosion-protection and trouble-free performance. ""We send all our bell fittings to Medway Galvanising to be galvanised and powder coated because, not only are they the closest firm to us with the capacity to treat the huge girders we often need treated, but they offer a supreme service that includes collection and delivery – saving us the need to hire transport,"" explained Brian White, Owner of Whites of Appleton Ltd. ""We are always very happy with the service Medway Galvanising provides and hope to work with them for many years to come."" Medway galvanising offer their galvanised powder coating services to the surrounding area, for almost any steel . The works have been an important part of village life in Builth Wells, where bell ringers can be regularly heard at St Mary's Church, the oldest building in the area. Locals worked hard to fund the restoration and even organised an abseil down the church with the vicar volunteering to go first!"
7,The Royal British Legion in need of concrete repairs,news-society," Most people know that the poppy is the national emblem of remembrance for those men and women who gave their lives defending the principles of freedom for which our country stands, but where do all the poppies and wreaths come from, and how did it all begin? The Royal British Legion Poppy factory was founded in 1922 in the aftermath of the First World War. They took over an old shirt collar factory off the Old kent Road and initially employed five disabled men. Soon the number of men employed had grown and it became necessary to find larger premises. An old brewery in Richmond was purchased and converted into the factory. In just over ten years, the factory had grown from five men to some 300 disabled ex-servicemen. Working in conjunction with Paul Raymen of Bradbrook Consulting, and Bill Kay the poppy factory’s operation manager, Cemplas waterproofing and concrete repair Limited were appointed as the principle contractor to carry out extensive concrete repairs to the external buildings columns, and the application of protective coatings to the building’s facade. Following a survey and investigation by Cemplas, the front external face of the columns was removed, and the exposed steel beams were cleaned to remove the extensive corrosion that had built up over the years. Additional steel reinforcement was fixed to the cleaned steel beam and brickwork using Hilti shot fired steel fixings and Hilti Hit Resin HY100. Pull off tests were undertaken to ensure they achieved the desired bond strength. One of the contract conditions was the columns had to be repaired to match exactly the same as the columns removed. To ensure this, shutters were cut and formed on site, and Sika armocrete poured into the prepared shutter. On removal of the shuttering, any defects were bagged in using Sika Monotop 620, to ensure an immaculate finish. On completion of the remedial repairs, one coat of Sikagard 552w was applied to the new columns, and a further two coats of Sikagard 550w was applied to the entire elevation to provide a protective and decorative anti-carbonation finish. All these techniques ensured a lasting finish to the concrete repairs taken place, as well as an aesthetic appeal for others to see when visiting. Today the factory receives some 6000 visitors each year, and both Sika and Cemplas are immensely proud to have played a part in prolonging the life of this structure helping to ensure the Legion continue to manufacture poppies for many years to come, and provide assistance to the ex-servicemen and servicewomen who served their country, and to remember and pay homage to those who gave their lives."
8,Tough Questions Require Real Answers,news-society," It is amazing to me that when talking to political candidates, so many of them seem to be running for no other reason than someone they know said they should throw their name in the hat.  Is this really a reason?  Are your friends and family true, unbiased measures of your ability or qualifications to run for any political office? There are some real questions that you need to ask yourself before you run for any office.  In addition, there are some core questions that voters will ask you while you are on the campaign trail.  You need to be able to confidently answer these questions without fluff and without waiver.  If you can’t give concrete answers to these basic questions, then you may need to rethink your run. Ask Yourself This Why am I running for office? Seems like an easy question to answer, right?  The duty of political office holders is to be representatives for the citizens in their town, district or state.  The leaders are entrusted to make crucial decisions that will affect real people.  So, it really isn’t enough to answer this question with, ""I want to make a change.""  That is assumed by all voters.  What do you want to change?  What is your plan to make these changes? Voters can see through vague, open-ended answers.  They may be entrusting you with their neighborhood and child’s future living conditions.  Think about why you deserve their trust and how you plan to make them believers. Am I qualified for this office? I chuckle sometimes when a candidate insists on putting the letters ""M.D."" or ""CPA"" on their yard signs.  I suppose for some, the quip ""Trust me, I’m a doctor"" really is comforting.  But, what does your medical degree have to do with your ability to be mayor of a city of 50,000 people?  I know a CPA who is running for sheriff.  He insists on printing ""CPA"" on his t-shirts, business cards and the rest of his campaign materials.  I can appreciate the intricate work a CPA does, but I will not vote for a career CPA to be the sheriff of my town. On the other hand, if you have spent 20 years as a law enforcement officer, perhaps spent time in a branch of the military and maybe worked as a correctional officer, please run for sheriff in my town.  If you are a respected CPA with 15 years under your belt, by all means, run for treasurer. Furthermore, when you design your palm cards to handout in the neighborhood, do not embellish your credentials, or include useless self-serving accomplishments that have no bearing on your ability to run for a political office.  Your time spent as a Boy Scout troop member means little when you are entrusted with a city budget. In his book, The Political Campaign Desk Reference, Michael McNamara gives sounds advice: It is important to gain a thorough understanding of the duties of the job prior to going public with an announcement of candidacy. Do yourself and your constituents a favor and do the research. Can I raise the budget needed to make this work? You may believe whole-heartedly that you are qualified for a position.  You may have answers that your community needs.  However, without the budget to equip yourself with the necessary campaign materials, your run may fall flat in a hurry. It is a good idea to sit with someone who currently holds office, or has recently run for office, and discuss a budget.  There are many obvious expenses you will incur—campaign signs, post cards, business cards—but, there are many that you may not have thought of, such as parade materials, booking a conference room for a rally, possibly paying a political consultant, etc. Your war chest should be funded, in large part, by supporters.  But, you will most likely need to dip into your personal funds to get things accomplished.  A certainty is you don’t want to run out of money.  You need a well-planned budget.  Many of the printed campaign materials can be researched online. Don’t fool yourself into thinking that funding is not an important part of a campaign.  I once heard a statistic that stated 80% of campaigns are won by the candidate that spends the most.  Don’t get me wrong, you still need to be qualified and organized. They Will Ask You This Voters will have three main questions on their minds when you ring their doorbell to ask for support. You should have already planned out your honest and passionate answer for this.  Be prepared to share time and time again. Proud, voting citizens go back to the polls each election to cast their support for the candidate whose objectives are most closely aligned with theirs.  You can’t win them all, but showing your genuine concern for their community and quality of life can go a long way.  Remember, voters are looking to put their trust in someone they feel shares qualities and concerns of their own. You’ve chosen to run for office, now what are you going to do?  It isn’t enough to simply have a goal.  You need to have concrete, attainable steps to reach those goals.  Don’t just tout that you are going to clean up the parks or rid the streets of crime.  How are you going to do these things?  What money and resources will you use? Don’t try and pacify voters with vague answers and generalities.  Put it on paper and share it intelligently. These are just a few questions you will be faced with.  The passion needs to be there, but so does the planning.  Voters need you and you need them.  Earn their votes."
9,New Zealand’s Struggle with Marijuana,news-society," The small island nation of 4 million people has one of the world highest marijuana arrest rates.  Views among the population are divided however on how best to fix this situation. In a nation of 4 million people 400,000 annual cannabis users is alarming. Each 10th can't pass a drug test. The New Zealand Law Commission released a report that recommended a complete overhaul of the 1975 Misuse of Drugs Act.  The Commission recommended that the Government engage in clinical test of the benefits of medical marijuana as soon as possible.  It went on to say that police should not arrest people using cannabis for pain or illness until the clinical tests are completed.  For minors the commission recommends a cautioning and rehabilitation system as opposed to criminal punishments. The New Zealand public on the other hand is divided.  Dale Kirk who manages Methcon a drug education company says, ""any moves to liberalize cannabis laws are not necessarily beneficial to the overall community, particularly young people. I think anything that makes it easier for young people to their hands on drugs is not helpful.""  He goes on to say that the move to put minors in drug rehabilitation is a ""slap on the wrist."" Mr. Kirk instead recommends a system of fines and demerit points for multiple convictions. Mr. Kirk’s views are shared by many New Zealanders.  Assuming he is not speaking form a purely financial aspect, he owns a drug education center remember, his concern about protecting kids and decreasing usage are valid.  The New Zealand Law Commission set out making their report with these same goals but came up with different solutions.  Everyone wants to protect kids and limit usage but the public has to learn the current system is not working. The New Zealand Associate Minister of Health Peter Dunne has praised the commission but says the government will need time to review its findings.  This New Zealand Commissions findings come on the back of similar findings by the United Nations and the United States Senate.  Not that long ago the only government report calling for major changes to drug laws was the 1972 Schaffer Commission which had the invest effect of Nixon declaring war on drugs.  The Schaffer Commission may have been a thorn in the side of the drug war for year but made no headway in preventing it.  With the growing mountain of reports decrying the drug war it is harder for governments to ignore the damage they have caused.  Today all the information is available the governments of the world only need the courage to act on it."
10,"Oh, the Irony! Connecticut Criminalizes Fake Pot.",news-society," Within days of decriminalizing the real thing, Connecticut lawmakers are making possession of synthetic cannibal and legal saliva a crime. In case you were unaware, on June 8th Connecticut passed SB1014, to decriminalize pot or as the bill puts it a ""non-criminal violation"".  This means anyone caught with under a half ounce of pot is subject to a ticket and fine similar to that of a speeding ticket.  This is another big victory against the drug war, and the Connecticut legislature deserves praise. Before this bill was even signed by the governor, however, the Connecticut Senate had started working on a bill that would criminalize possession of synthetic pot.  Synthetic pot is made to simulate the effects of pot, but until March was not regulated by the government.  In March, the Federal Government reclassified synthetic pot as a schedule 1 controlled substance.  This is the same level of restriction placed on heroin, meth, and real pot.  The bill to legalize pot was passed only after Lieutenant Governor Nancy Wyman stepped in to break the 18-18 tie.  The bill to make synthetic pot illegal, on the other hand, passed 36-0. Together, these bills mean that if you are caught with a half ounce of pot you have no criminal record, but if you are caught with fake weed you get a criminal record.  The irony of this is not lost on Senate Minority Leader John McKinney.  Mckinney, who voted against SB1014, said after the second vote ""For the life of me, I don’t know how I am going to explain to my constituents that we have one penalty for the fake pot but another for the real pot."" Synthetic pot was not the only thing that the second bill would make illegal.  Salvia Divinorum is a little known hallucinogen that has been growing in popularity.  This plant has been cultivated by Native American shaman for thousands of years to become the world’s strongest hallucinogen.  The reasons it has been overlooked by the drug warrior until now are its relative unpopularity and short span.  The effects of Salvia Divinorum only last for a couple of minutes and what most important - you can pass a drug test while being under it.  Like synthetic pot; salvia was often sold at convenient stores prior to this new law. In the grand scheme of things, Connecticut is still a win against the drug war.  They have helped a lot more people by decriminalizing pot than they have harmed by criminalizing salvia and synthetic pot.  With the real thing decriminalized, most likely the synthetic market would have dried up anyway.  The whole situation just serves to further highlight the hypocrisy and idiocy of the drug war."
11,Hezbollah leader Nasrallah rejects Hariri indictments,news-society," Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has rejected indictments of four of its members over the 2005 assassination of Lebanon's former PM, Rafiq Hariri. He also said no power would be able to arrest the ""honourable brothers"", who have not yet been named officially. It was Nasrallah's first reaction to the indictments issued by the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL) on Thursday. The Shia Islamist movement has repeatedly denounced the UN-backed tribunal and vowed to retaliate. Rafik Hariri and 22 others were killed in February 2005 in central Beirut when a huge bomb went off near his motorcade. Hariri's son, Saad, welcomed the indictments and described them as a ""historic moment"" for Lebanon. 'Israeli plot' In a televised speech on Saturday, Sayyed Nasrallah rejected ""each and every void accusation"" made by the STL, saying it was tantamount to an attack on the group. He said the four group members were brothers ""who have an honourable history in resisting Israeli occupation"". Women pass by a giant portrait of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri near his grave, Beirut, Lebanon, 30 June 2011 Rafik Hariri is widely credited with getting Lebanon back on its feet after the 15-year civil war Sayyed Nasrallah went on by describing The Hague-based tribunal as biased and part of an Israeli plot. The Hezbollah also urged people to stop worrying about the potential for conflict, saying the tribunal's indictments would not lead to civil war in Lebanon. On Thursday, Lebanon's state prosecutor, Saeed Mirza, said he had received the indictments and four arrest warrants from an STL delegation in Beirut. The STL later confirmed the indictments, stating that the judge ""is satisfied that there is prima facie evidence for this case to proceed to trial"". It added that it would not reveal the identities of those indicted. However, Lebanese Interior Minister Marwan Sharbil has told the AFP news agency that the names of the men charged are Mustafa Badr al-Din, Salim al-Ayyash, Assad Sabra and Hassan Unaisi. Mr Badr al-Din was jailed in Kuwait over a series of bombings in 1983, and is a brother-in-law of the late top Hezbollah military commander, Imad Mughniyeh, who was assassinated in a 2008 bombing in Damascus. Leaks from the tribunal suggest it is mainly relying on mobile phone evidence to accuse the Hezbollah members, the BBC's Owen Bennett-Jones in Beirut reports. The Lebanese government now has 30 days to arrest the four men, but Sayyed Nasrallah said they would not be detained not even in ""300 years"". With Hezbollah being a strong force within the government, no-one is expecting the arrests, our correspondent adds. http://www.alarengin.net/"
12,Michigan’s Workers Compensation ACT : What Are My Remedies?,news-society," In Michigan, when someone gets hurt while at work, the Michigan Worker's Compensation Act usually comes in to play and becomes the exclusive remedy for the injured. The Michigan Workers Compensation Act was passed in 1912 so as to benefit injured workers who would otherwise face difficulty being compensated for their injuries and lost wages.  Before the implementation of the Act workers would face many obstacles to recovering damages in typical tort actions for negligence. These obstacles included the negligence of the worker who might have contributed to his injuries in some way; that the worker assumed the risks that were involved in the job; and that a fellow employee caused the injury and not the employer.   These three defenses for employers made it very difficult for employees to win their law suits.  Additionally, tort actions are usually lengthy and can be drawn out over years.  This could potentially leave workers at a disadvantage, because employers could delay settling and going to trial thus forcing the worker, who is not being paid and not being treated medically, settle for an amount that was less than the true value of the workers injuries. Because these problems, the Michigan Workers Compensation Act made it so that a worker who received injuries that arise out of and in the course of employment no longer had prove liability.   This theoretically makes it easier for employees to receive benefits and be compensated for work place injuries.   However, this compromise was not free.  In exchange for ""liability"" workers no longer have the ability to bring a tort lawsuit against the employer for their injuries. Of course there are a few exceptions to this rule such as intentional acts of employers that injure workers; however, for almost all cases no tort lawsuit can be brought.  This ""exclusive remedy"" rule makes a big difference because under the Workers Compensation Act workers are not able to recover for the same types of damages that they would be able to sue for in Tort. Typically, workers can recover for medical treatment, lost wages, and some rehabilitation services. It is obvious at this point, that many times this does not equate with the damages one would be entitled to in a tort action.  The Workers Compensation Act does not compensate for pain and suffering and other damages available in Tort.   This is the trade off for not having to prove liability.  Moreover, theoretically it is supposed to be easier for employees to file claims and be reimbursed for their lost wages, and medical treatment than it would be to file a lawsuit.  On the contrary, the argument that payments to employees occur faster and with less hassle is becoming increasingly suspect in the current Administrative climate.  Many times understaffing, increased volume and the subtle changes in the law and administration of the Workers Compensation Act makes it difficult to swiftly and efficiently compensate workers. For this reason finding an experienced Workmans Comp or Workers Compensation Attorney to help with your claim has become more important and more necessary."
13,Sweet Land of Liberty,news-society," Freedom is the most precious gift given to all of us. It isn’t free, but it’s fought for. Have you ever wondered why tears so freely come to our eyes when we hear the Star Spangled Banner as our flag waves in the distance? Why do we value our freedom and hold it so close to our hearts? Our freedom was a God-given gift given to those who so valiantly fought for this liberty. These brave patriots hungered for freedom of choice, for their rights, and to worship according to the dictates of their own heart. The patriots fought with every fiber of strength they had, both bond and free. When we pledge allegiance to our flag, what does that mean to us? Do we take our freedom for granted? Many countries have no rights and are not at liberty to say what they feel or to worship as they please. In some countries, Christianity cannot be preached among the people. Newspapers, media, and even the Internet are all government controlled. Do we think of the freedom we possess? Have you ever thought about the patriots who fought for the liberty that we enjoy? These brave men desired to live in a free land, not ruled by a monarchy. Why do we celebrate the fourth of July? On July 4, 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote the ""Declaration of Independence."" This document inspired every patriot to fight for his liberty. As General George Washington stood before the Continental Army with the document in his hand, he took a look at the weary men before him in their tattered clothes, and he realized they had not eaten a decent meal for months. These underfed men were a sight! Washington knew his men needed to be inspired and this document would do the trick. As he read the declaration out loud, not a sound was heard as the men listened. They were touched when he came to the part, ""…We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness."" As these patriots listened to every word, they were buoyed up, inspired, ready to fight for their freedom against the tyranny placed upon them. The fire inside them grew and no one could stop the need they felt for liberty. The ""Declaration of Independence"" was inspired of God. Many of these patriots were willing to die for freedom. Nathan Hale, a 23-year-old artist and schoolteacher, felt the conviction of his beliefs so strongly that he agreed to go on a dangerous mission for George Washington. He was caught with sketches of British gun emplacements and the penalty for being a spy was to be hanged. As he marched up the steps of the gallows, he held his head high. When he turned to face the people, he declared boldly, ""I regret that I have but one life to give for my country."" Many of these brave men were even willing to die for their liberty, for their family, for peace and equality. The Continental Army consisted of farmers and merchants, not learned in the way of combat. Many were barefoot and in tattered clothes. They lacked enough food for everyone and many times went hungry but yet they still fought for what they believed in. The patriots knew the value of freedom and were willing to pay the price. When Thomas Paine saw the sad condition of the Continental Army, he wrote, ""These are the times that try men’s souls…Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: ‘Tis dearness only that gives everything its value. Heaven knows how to set a proper price upon its goods; and it would be strange indeed, if so celestial an article as Freedom should not be highly rated."" They lost many battles but won the battles that made a difference. The crossing of the Delaware will never be forgotten. Many were sick, fatigued, and their feet were wrapped with cloth to protect them from freezing weather. George Washington knew the Continental Army was outnumbered, but he was inspired to take his army across the Delaware in a terrible blizzard. He suspected the Hessians would be drunk from the Christmas festivities. In the early hours of the morning, the surprise attack was a never-forgotten battle of victory that shocked the Hessians, who were German mercenaries, skilled fighters, paid by the British to cut down the patriots. After a count was taken, it was discovered that not one patriot had been killed in that battle. This victory turned the war around. The British were stunned at what had happened. They looked down their noses at the Americans and considered them as untrained and uneducated rabble. When they found the Continental Army to be so strong and stubborn, they changed tactics. They moved a part of their forces to the south with the idea of moving northward, capturing one state at a time. In August of 1780 in South Carolina, a great and terrible battle took place. The British were gaining an advantage. When all seemed lost, General de Kalb and his men continued to valiantly fight for freedom. He believed in the cause of liberty so much that he refused to give up even though he knew they had lost the battle. He received eleven wounds, both musket ball and bayonet, before he collapsed and fell to the ground. British General Cornwallis had been watching from a distance and when he saw the courageous General finally fall to the ground, he sent his aides to retrieve him with a stretcher. Three days later he died in the name of freedom. General Jean de Kalb was the most courageous and valiant man Cornwallis had ever seen in the face of battle, fighting until he dropped, not giving up his cause for liberty. Even though he was the enemy, Cornwallis paid him the highest military honor at his burial. Most of the victories in the south came from Francis Marion and his men because the northern armies were not familiar with the territory. Colonial Francis Marion knew how to deal with the enemy in his own homeland. He was known as the Swamp Fox and had the deadliest fighting command in the whole revolution. He had trained his men to disappear into the thick forest and swamps of South Carolina without a sound. Hidden from sight, they would strike and then quickly move through the woods like silent shadows, fading into the forest and undergrowth. Francis Marion and his men tormented the British army with one ambush after another. This frustrated the British officers because they were helpless in the woods and swamps. After eight long years, the patriots beat the greatest military power in the world. Have we ever thought about the tremendous price these men paid for our freedom? The next time we look at our flag, remember the cost as you pledge your allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and remember that we are ""one nation under God, indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for all."" That’s what helps us stand out as a great nation. Without God’s help, we would never have won the war. Alexis de Toqueville, a French Statesman, visited our country in the early 1800s. He said that he looked for the ""greatness of America."" It was not until he witnessed the faith of the American people in their churches that he found the true greatness here. He said, ""America is great because she is good. If America ever ceases to be good, America will cease to be great."" Samuel F. Smith wrote, ""My country, ‘tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing; Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims’ pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring! Our fathers’ God, to thee, author of liberty, to thee we sing; Long may our land be bright with freedom’s holy light. Protect us by thy might, Great God, our King!"""

17,Self Defense and Community Crime Rates,news-society," We are all aware that the United States has a serious crime problem. Most think the way to deal with unbridled crime is to allow the police to deal with this epidemic. Non violent persons had no problem carrying some kind of non lethal self defense products. Others believe that ownership of firearms by law abiding citizens will reduce the violent crime rate. Of course arming citizens does not sit well with Law Enforcement Agencies..They are concerned that this would only aggravate an already bad situation. Just imagine what would happen if two strangers got involved in a physical confrontation and they both were carrying a handgun. We can only imagine that it could easily escalate into a gun fight. A friend of mine who carries not lethal self defense weapons and lives in a large city with a high crime rate stated. ""Every time I leave my apartment, I fear for my life"". You may not feel that helpless, but I am sure that the realization that you could become a victim has crossed your mind. My mother frequently commented when she was much younger when there was a murder anywhere in the city the community was shocked and appalled. Murders only occurred on a very small scale, and murderers were viewed as monsters. Today we are so used to hearing of homicides and other violent crimes we have become desensitized. In some major cities murders exceed three hundred a year. I grew up in Baltimore City, and I was exposed to crime and violence at a very young age. I thought all cities had the same crime problems until I did a stint in the army. Traveling around the country while in the military, I discovered peaceful crime free communities where people actually spoke to you when they walked by. In Baltimore City if a stranger acknowledges you, they usually want something. Self defense and crime were my last concern. After military service, I spent eleven years on the Baltimore City Police Department. I saw more carnage and death as a police officer than I experienced in a year of combat. I finally left the police Department and now live in small town around 60 miles from the city. I finally moved away from an environment of noise, trash in the streets and in some area rats as big as cats. I live in a quiet clean and friendly community. Although the crime rate is nowhere near the scale of Baltimore City, recently a number of brutal rapes and murders have occurred. I notice especially at night people seem apprehensive and very cautious. Rarely do you see women walking alone or approaching strangers making casual conversations. Several of my friends have obtained weapons for their self defense. There is a lesson for all honest, hard working, law abiding citizens out there. You may have always lived in a low crime rate area, or you may have recently moved to one. Crime is everywhere and self defense should always be your concern"
18,The  Death of Civil Liberties Britain?,news-society," The emergence and subsequent passing of the Bill of Right of 1689 into legislation date back to the English Civil War when parliament was fighting for the right to govern and protect itself against external interference from the monarchy. Article 9 of the Bill of Rights states that ""the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament"". The purpose of this article is to ensure that members of parliament are able to express themselves freely in parliament with impunity from the courts and the crown. However, despite such liberty, parliament has always observed a convention which encourages its members from making statements in parliament which are not in the public interest. One may also argue that the good intention of the founding fathers for enacting such a novel legislation was to ensure that parliamentarians are able to perform their duties effectively and responsibly.  Therefore  it is fairly reasonable to suggest that the founding fathers  would be very  saddened  if they  had thought  a member of parliament  will one day use the privilege they  had fought hard for  to satisfy his gossip appetite by making silly statements  in parliament which  promotes the interest of tabloid newspapers  . I am in fact referring to the latest incident in which an attention -seeking Liberal democrat MP (John Hemming) exposed a Premier League footballer as the celebrity who obtained a super-injunction from the court to protect his extra marital affair.  This kind of behaviour by Mr Hemming seems to go beyond the realms of the purpose of parliamentary privilege. It is not in my opinion for MPs to make statements about the private life of individuals which are not in the interest of the public. ‘’ I think we have to start differentiating between the public interest, and a proper definition of what that means, and stories that the media decide the public people might be interested in... It’s not the same thing."" (Alistair Campbell BBC interview) Shame fully enough, instead of accepting the fact that his attitude was out of order, he and his supporters continued to peddle the false argument that the public have every right to know about the marital life of the celebrity in question. If that’s the case, then what gave the public that right? Well, assuming an hypothetical celebrity had spent most of his celebrity career promoting himself as a good role model for unmarried men; and as a result he had managed to procure brand sponsorships for himself, then in this case, if he had then gone to do something that contradicts the image he had conveyed to the public, it will be justifiable for the public to express deep interest in his fidelities. Conversely, if all that the hypothetical celebrity does is to do the job he was paid for as opposed to projecting such image, then in this second situation, the public has no right whatsoever to know about his private life. The same logic also applies to the footballer’s case; his private life should not be subjected to public debate and scrutiny since he hasn’t done anything to suggest to he’s a good husband. Even prior to this particular incident, there had been series of attempt by some members of parliament to evade justice by claiming that their criminal behaviours fell within the parameters of Article 9 of the Bill of Right. This was certainly true in the case of the three MPs who were charged for abusing their parliamentary expenses. They argued ""proceedings in parliament cannot be impeached or questioned in any court or place outside of parliament. These principles mean that it is for the House of Commons alone to decide whether the conduct of Mr Morley, Mr Chaytor and Mr Devine has been such as to call for sanction.""(Mr Knowles; the MPs legal representative) But despite making such a despicable attempt to avoid facing the music of the law, the courts rejected the premises of their argument by reiterating that ""Scrutiny of claims by the courts will have no adverse impact on the core or essential business of Parliament, it will not inhibit debate or freedom of speech…the only thing that it will inhibit is the making of dishonest claims."" (Lord Philips) On the contrary if the courts had allowed such an appeal, democracy as we all know it will never be the same again.  It would have triggered cracks within the democratic society which our great grandparents fought hard to build for us. But luckily enough, the Supreme Court applied common sense which saw subsequently   resulted in the incarceration of some MPs. In addition, although Article 9 of the Bill of rights states clearly that members of parliament are unanswerable to the courts for things said in parliament, the British constitution has always impose a responsibility on the shoulders of MPs to respect the  judgements and independence of the judiciary. It will be disingenuous and wrong for the British government and its allies to go around the world (as they are doing now) preaching about the importance of democracy, the rule of law, civil liberties and the right for individuals to have free and fair hearing in their respective countries when members of their own country refuse to adhere to judgements made by their domestic courts. Moreover, one may also trace the root cause of the intrusion of civil liberties from the way the press has been allowed to operate. For so many years the British press has enjoyed an unprecedented right of self-regulation. This self-regulation, although good for freedom of speech, gave the press an unfettered playing field which encourages them to report stories which are damaging to civil liberties even when they know that such stories may have a detrimental effect on the individual and his family.  In some cases, some newspapers go the extra mile to hack into the phones of ordinary citizens; a further attempt to infringe upon individual’s right to privacy.  I am not in any way in favour of a privacy law which may or may not restrict the freedom of speech journalist. However I certainly think it is not morally defendable for a news organisation to plough through the phone records of ordinary people without any compelling reason for doing so. It is this relentless intrusion of civil liberties by the press that encourages the courts to issue super- injunction to ordinary citizens so as to protect their right to privacy. As judge Eady explained ‘’the court's duty remains to try and protect the claimant, and particularly his family, from intrusion and harassment so long as it can."" In this regard, it is therefore right for judges to be encouraged by both parliament and the government to continue to devise new ways of protecting civil liberties whiles at the same time making sure freedom of speech is properly upheld.  It is also time for MPs to stop hiding behind the veil of parliamentary privilege and take responsibility for their action. Failing to do so will push the UK down a slippery slope."

20,Islamic Women Divorce Laws in Egypt,news-society," Under the rules of Islamic sharia, the husband can end his marriage unilaterally by simply announcing the words ""I divorce my wife"" or ""I divorce you"" three times. He does not need to justify his decision, nor explain any reason for his divorce and never need to enter a courtroom to end his marriage. Egyptian Muslim women however are denied equal right to divorce. They are trapped in unwanted marriages or left begging for a divorce that can take years to obtain and leave them destitute. Egypt’s Islamic family law of divorce is established in five legislations: (1) the law of 1920; (2) the law of 1929; the law of 1979; (4) the law of 1985; and (5) the law of 2000. The Divorce Laws of 1920 & 1929 The 1920 law deals with divorce and financial support under which a woman might be eligible to seek a divorce from her husband, The law restricted woman’s right to divorce to  lack of husband’s economic support, such as desertion, disappearance, and imprisonment. Article 1 of the Law of 1920 provides that maintenance was a cumulative debt owed by the husband to his wife, it starts from the first time the husband failed to support his wife. Article 2 decreed the wife’s maintenance debt should be computed from the date of her divorce. Articles 4 and 5 included the husband’s failure to provide maintenance as sufficient grounds for divorce. The law of 1920 provided that if the husband is absent or imprisoned and if he does not own a property from which the wife’s maintenance can be extracted, the wife is then entitled to a divorce on the grounds of non-support. And, if the husband lives in a distant place, or his location is unknown, the wife is granted a divorce at once. Article 6 provides the husband a further period to pay the maintenance, the waiting period of the menstrual cycle (iddah). A divorce obtained from the religious court in nonsupport cases is irrevocable, however, payment of the current maintenance is a sign of good will and sufficient to reverse the divorce. The 1920 law provides that a wife may seek judicial divorce if the husband suffered from an irreversible illness such as madness, leprosy, or impotence, whether or not the illness was developed before or after the marriage. According to the law of 1920, women were not allowed to divorce if the husband claims poverty. In all these cases, women had to file for divorce in front of a male judge. At the same time, the law allowed men to exercise their divorce according to Islamic sharia by uttering the formula of divorce anywhere they choose. The law of 1929 granted women right to seek judicial divorce according to Maliki School of jurisprudence in case the husband was absent for an extended period of time. This particular cause for divorce is not included in the Hanafi doctrine. According to the Maliki School, the judge may issue a divorce decree when the husband abandons his wife for more than one year without the knowledge of his wife. The law of 1929 stipulates that a woman whose husband had been sentenced to more than three years may seek divorce after a separation of at least one year. This complies with the Maliki doctrine. In view of the maltreatment inflicted on by men on their wives, the Egyptian government deemed it necessary to adopt the doctrines of the Maliki School of jurisprudence to make it easy for women to get out of their dysfunctional marriages associated with maltreatment and sufferings, a doctrine which is absent from the Hanafi School. The 1929 legislation allowed judges dealing with Islamic divorce to refer to Maliki School instead of Hanafi in order to grant a woman the right to divorce her husband in case of maltreatment. Furthermore, the Law of 1929 grants the wife the right to seek judicial divorce in case the husband suffers from serious and incurable disease, if such a cause makes life harmful to women. Article 6 of the law decreed that where a wife’s allegation of maltreatment detrimental to the continuation of marital relationship is substantiated and reconciliation becomes impossible, the judge (qadi) shall grant the wife an irrevocable divorce. To prove the harm and bad treatment inflicted by the husband, the wife must present two witnesses, whose testimonies will be subject to the unconstrained assessment of the judge who evaluates the evidence. If the judge rejects the wife’s petition for divorce, twice,  the law mandates that he appoints two arbitrators for the couple in accordance with the Quran injunction: ""And if you fear a breach between the two, then send forth an arbiter, one from his family, another from hers"" (Q. 4:35). Article 7 stipulates that if this is not possible, men acquainted with the circumstances of the case should be appointed. These men should conduct thorough investigation of the causes for the married couple and submit recommendations to the court for reconciliation if that becomes possible. Article 10 provides that should the arbitrators indicate a deadlock, the judge is to order them to make a new attempt. If the new attempt fails, then other arbitrators are to be appointed. Article 11 stipulates that the final judgment of divorce is made after the newer attempts were fruitless and the prospect for reconciliation reached a deadlock. The Divorce Laws of 1979 and 1985 Under Islamic sharia, a Muslim husband is entitled to marry up to four wives at a time. In 1979 President Anwar Sadat issued Decree-Law No.44 to amend the previous laws of 1920 and 1929, mainly in the area of polygamous marriages. A new provision was added requiring that the husband’s remarrying without the first wife’s (or first wives’) consent be considered harmful and that if the husband remarries a second wife, his first wife is granted a judicial divorce upon her request provided that she became aware of his second marriage within a year from the day she got to know of his remarriage. The ground for such a divorce is based on the notion of harm inflicted on the wife. This law was criticized and challenged on the basis of restriction to polygamy which is considered legal and religiously legitimate in Islam. In 1985, the Decree-Law No.44/1979 was declared unconstitutional on the grounds that it was passed by presidential decree and presented to the Egyptian Assembly as a done-deal.  Later in the same year the Law No. 100/1985 was passed again with some revisions. It states that polygamy may be considered a possible source of harm, according to which a woman may seek judicial divorce. Under such circumstances, the wife presents the court with evidence showing the harm. The judge evaluates the evidence and issues his ruling. The law of 1985 does not prohibit the husband from having a polygamous marriage; it only offers a remedy to the first wife who would can seek divorce for damage resulting from her husband’s second marriage. A wife seeking divorce on this ground has to bring two witnesses to testify for the damage incurred. Such a procedure is lengthy and costly for the wife. Although the law allows women to divorce for polygamy, in many instances, judges refuse to apply this provision, which they consider to be contrary to Islamic sharia and to the Constitution of Egypt. Article 2 of the Constitution of 1980 affirms that Islamic sharia is ""The main source of legislation"". Accordingly, judges who opposed the new provisions in the divorce law brought up the ""unconstitutionality"" issue. The Law of 2000 In 2000, a new legislation was introduced in Egypt allowing women to seek judicial divorce in a procedure called Khul’, according to which, a married woman can request a judicial divorce in exchange for monetary compensation. This procedure is well known in Islamic sharia, but Egyptian judges did not intervene in such a divorce. Islamic sharia requires that the husband consent to this type of divorce without judiciary interference. The new law grants the wife right to seek a judicial divorce through khul’ without the consent of the husband. Under such divorce, the wife declares that she detests life with her husband, that the marital status between the couple has become impossible to continue, and that she fears she will not be able to maintain the ""Limits of God"" due the deteriorating relationship with her husband. As a compensation for the husband, she has to forfeit her maintenance (nafaqah), her compensation of ""mahr"" and agrees to return to him the amount of ""mahr"" that he paid her at the marriage and she must renounce the amount of the ""deferred mahr"" (mu’akhar). The law of 2000 made it possible for a wife to get a ""no fault divorce"" from the judge after a lengthy process of reconciliation. For more on the khul’ divorce in Egypt, see our piece on this topic titled: ""The Khul’ Divorce in Egypt"". Anti-Women Sentiments in the Egyptian Law It is extremely important to note that this discussion covering the Egyptian Personal Status Laws (or family law for the Muslim community) is derived from Islamic sharia and codified by the Egyptian government. Furthermore, Muslim women seeking divorce in Egypt are denied equal access; they are at a distinct disadvantage for no reason other than they are women. Muslim women seeking divorce in Egypt must resort to the notoriously backlogged, inefficient court system and face procedural and evidentiary hurdles that are inherently discriminatory and may take several years to get a divorce. When men initiate divorce, they do not have to go through reconciliation process. In fact a husband can divorce his wife in as little as one hour with the local marriage registrar. The wife does not have to be informed. When women seek divorce, including those of domestic violence, they must submit to compulsory mediation in the name of family preservation and the biased notion that women are unable to make rational decisions about family issues. Many Egyptian Muslim women, including those in abusive relationships, refrain from ever attempting to seek divorce for fear of violence and potentially life-threatening marriages. In all other court cases in Egypt, a woman’s testimony is worth half of a man. Therefore a woman living with a violent husband would need testimonies from two men, four women, or one man and two women to prove her case. The khul’ law of 2000 failed to address the discriminatory aspects of the divorce system. Its introduction has spared women the need to specify grounds for divorce, but forced them to give up critical financial rights in exchange for divorce, such as returning any cash or property provided by her husband under their marriage contract. This option is limited only to women with significant resource or those who are desperate for a divorce. Recognition of Egyptian Divorce in USA In the United States, state courts decide on divorce cases. A divorce judgment issued in Egypt is generally recognized in the United States on the basis of ""comity"", provided that both parties to the divorce receive adequate notice, such as services of process and at least one of them is domiciled in Egypt at the time of the divorce. Egyptian women citizens of the U.S. must obtain divorce decrees from Egypt as proof of divorce. The documents must be authenticated by the relevant authorities in Egypt and the U.S. This is important to women who could not remarry without presenting proof that they are free to remarry. Egyptian Muslim women who remarry without obtaining a divorce decree from Egypt, their second marriage may be considered illegal. In Islamic countries, women who remarry without divorce documents, may be labeled as adulterous, and in some countries like Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Sudan may be subject to the death penalty by stoning under strict interpretations of Islamic sharia.

2,Metro Detroiters Help Homeless Veterans,news-society," Daniel Rudolph held still as Doris Williams cut his hair and gave him a close shave. Rudolph, a 49-year-old homeless veteran of the U.S. Army, smiled as Williams touched up his salt-and-pepper locks.""Without opportunities like this I would look like a vagabond and nobody wants that,"" Williams said from beneath a leopard-print smock. Rudolph was one of the more than 300 homeless veterans expected to participate in the Veterans Stand Down event in Detroit. The event offers veterans free haircuts, medical screenings, counseling, dental and eye care along with meals, legal aid and a place to sleep. Volunteers handed out clothing, such as large fleece sweaters and t-shirts. Bands, one of which was made up of former homeless veterans, played tunes. Veterans could catch a break from the sun and heat under covered areas. The help was offered in an area adjacent to the Michigan Veterans Foundation Detroit Veterans Center on Park Avenue. Tyrone Chatman, the center's executive director, said about 1,500 homeless vets may visit the makeshift camp during the three days of the Stand Down. ""It is our way of letting our veterans know their dedication to their country has not been forgotten,"" he said. People who came to the event were given stickers that said ""Vet"" and their first name. Everyone was addressed with courtesy titles. The families of the veterans were also invited to participate. Michael Turner, a homeless veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps., sat under a camouflaged tent, reading a book about marines by W.E.B. Griffin. ""I got a haircut here,"" he said. ""I stayed the night at the Detroit Rescue Mission and then came here today and got some t-shirts."" Inside the center, volunteers cooked chicken, made pasta salad and prepared other dishes to serve the hungry vets. ""It is a wonderful way to give back to people who have given so much to us,"" said Andrea Pierce of the Detroit Tip Toppers, a volunteer organization, while washing a pan in the center's kitchen.

5,US Citizenship for Adopted Children,news-society," The section 322 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) as amended by the Child Citizenship Act (CCA) allows biological or adopted children residing outside U.S. to qualify for naturalization. Once the children enter the United States many foreign-born adopted children acquire U.S. citizenship.  They are entitled to get a certificate of citizenship but they need not formally apply for US citizenship since they become citizens automatically. Until certain criteria are met other foreign-born adopted children may have to wait after which they automatically acquire citizenship. Some need to formally apply for US citizenship especially children living abroad. Requirements to apply Following are the requirements to qualify: •	One parent at least should be living as U.S. citizen, else must have been one at the time of death. •	In the U.S. or its far-off properties the U.S. citizen parent or his or her U.S. citizen parent must have, or had at the time of death, been physically present for at least 5 years. This stay should include at least two of which after attaining the age of 14. •	Age must be under 18 years. •	The U.S. citizen parent must have legal and physical custody of the child residing outside of the United States. If the citizen parent is deceased consent of the individual in charge must be there. •	After a lawful entry for temporary period the child should be maintaining the status in the United States. •	The INA section 322 allows a child for naturalization if the child satisfies the requirements applicable to adopted children under sections 101(b) (1) (E), (F) or (G) of the INA. The person should be unmarried to qualify as a child for purposes of this section.  Children born out of wedlock must have been legitimated while under the age of 16 and should be in the legal custody of the parents. Under this section stepchild who has not been adopted does not qualify as a child. When applying for US citizenship Form N-600K must be filed on behalf of an eligible child for Application for Citizenship and Issuance of Certificate under section 322 of the INA. The U.S. citizen parent must file the Form N-600K on behalf of the child. Otherwise U.S. citizen grandparent or U.S. citizen legal guardian may apply on behalf of the child within 5 years of the parent's death. Before the child is 18 years old the whole process should be completed. The application must have been filed, approved and the child must take the oath of allegiance, if required, to obtain citizenship under section 322 of the INA. Once the adoption is final and they lawfully enter the United States as permanent resident orphans adopted by U.S. citizen parent are citizens. Children who were adopted by a U.S. citizen parent and obtained lawful permanent resident status acquire citizenship automatically though they did not immigrate as orphans. Whatever be the case it’s important that the children are below 18 years of age. Some service members who are on active duty, according to section 322(d) of the INA get a waiver from the requirement that the child be temporarily present in the United States and period of residence overseas on active duty is considered as residence in the United States. To summarize the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Form N-600 should be used for adopted children residing in the United States while filing for a certificate of citizenship and USCIS Form N-600K must be filed for adopted children residing outside the United States for naturalization. Once naturalization is complete if required the child can obtain a U.S. passport."
6,Are TASER Self Defense Products Designed to Kill?  Answers Supported by Research and Logic,news-society," Are you taking into consideration buying TASER weapons for self defense purposes, but not knowing whether or not these weapons are really lethal is keeping you from making a decision?  Maybe you are amid thousands of people who explore the world-wide-web daily for a transparent and authoritative answer…only to stumble on conflictive conclusions about the subject matter.  Search no more.  We got the response deciphered for you. Can TASER weapons kill?  The most educated answer is: ""not really"".  Emergency medicine researchers at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine (working together with investigators from the Inova Fairfax Hospital in Virginia, Louisiana State University, and University Medical Center in Nevada) studied nearly 1,000 cases of TASER products use throughout the United States.  Their research results exposed that there were either no physical damage or only mild injuries (scrapes and bruises) in the vast majority of the cases (99.7%) of TASER products' employment.  Though there were indeed two incidents of head injuries (caused by falls) and still one case in which someone was hospitalized with a condition ""of unclear relationship to the TASER"", these three occurrences altogether constituted only 0.3 percent of the total number of cases (these research results were offered in 2007 at the American College of Emergency Physicians’ Research Forum in Seattle, Washington). In spite of these facts, you may still ask yourself about those cases in which individuals have really passed over after being subjected to the TASER product's electric discharge.  Although those lamentable incidents are totally irrefutable, later investigations have exposed that there is no conclusive data to defend the belief that TASER self defense weapons actually caused those deaths, a conclusion that harmonizes with the research results of a report published in 2008 by the U.S. National Institute of Justice (""Study of Deaths Following Electro Muscular Disruption: Interim Report"").  In most cases it hasn’t been comprehensible if disproportionate police force (combined with the physical stress that comes with the verbal altercation, physical struggle or physical restraint) has been the responsible factor. The same research established that no medical proof exists to support the belief that TASER self defense products may bring on cardiac dysrhythmia when deployed reasonably. Nevertheless, the medical risks of repeated or uninterrupted electric discharges are still unspecified, so the TASER product should be used that way only for self defense situations in which your life (or that of a family member) is in serious danger, and when the benefits of using it repeatedly or continuously far outweighs the probable risks for the criminal. That issue is even more significant when considering the wellbeing of assailants who suffer heart conditions and/or other medical problems: although there are no authoritative answers on their specific case, these individuals are still considered to be the most susceptible to the effects of these self defense devices. Nonetheless, you must ask yourself: What are the chances of someone with a heart condition attacking you, anyways?  Perhaps too low to be worried about…specially in any circumstances in which your life might be at danger. Would you actually doubt using TASER self defense weapons against someone who is threatening to murder a dear family member of yours, just because he (the offender) might perhaps have a heart condition? In our judgment, your protection must always be your first interest anyways, since the one who might go to meet your maker or be gravely harmed is YOU (or your loved one), NOT the aggressor. We must make clear that we certainly have a great respect for all life and believe in the possibility of criminals to be reformed.  However you should remember that self defense is your basic human right, too. Your life (and that of your family members) should be respected and taken care of too. Death by TASER self defense weapons is not the most probable outcome for the criminal who is willing to endanger your life, as studies have exposed.  Instead, secondary accidental injuries might be a more probable outcome, although those injuries are not thought to be completely attributable to the TASER’s electric stimulation.  For example, the criminal may fall down to the ground after receiving the electric shock, and may endure impact injuries, bruises, cuts and abrasions. The assailant might also suffer muscles or tendon tears, as well as stress fractures, as a result of muscles contractions.  But if you hold yourself back from using a TASER because of that…what are you going to use instead? If we turn to common sense we will find that those secondary injuries may also result from using any other style of self defense tactics. For instance, a criminal may fall down to the ground and suffer impact injuries after the would-be-victim used his martial arts skill to defend himself/herself.  With a firearm you can even murder the provoker, which is even worse. A non lethal TASER device is definitively a more effective and trustworthy self defense weapon as opposed to all of the above. And since it was the assailant who put your life in jeopardy in the first place, it would not be reasonable to let a criminal destroy you (or a family member) just to guard him from falling down and suffering some fractures. Moreover, it must be taken into account that ANY weapon, used the wrong way, can probably kill somebody. A baseball bat can be used to kill somebody. A pencil can kill somebody, used to stab your opponent. Many more criminals have died as the result of being attacked by the defender with shotguns and knives, regardless of the existence or absence of medical problems.  In the worst case scenario, TASER self defense weapons are less lethal methods of defending yourself, your relatives…and the offender himself. TASER self defense weapons have been tested on thousands of police officials and voluntary citizens, without creating any dangerous health issues (if TASERS were lethal weapons, police officers wouldn’t consent to take part in these trials, would they?). Nonetheless, you must remember that police officers are experts, and they have taken all the indispensable safeguards during these experiments, so please, do not try it at home. TASER weapons are not toys, but serious self defense weapons. In conclusion: Are TASER self defense products designed to kill?  Our informed opinion is NO…at least not in the vast majority of cases. However, we greatly suspect that in your darkest hour, in a situation in which your life (or that of your loved ones) might be in mortal danger, you will not be questioning whether or not TASER weapons are lethal.  You will even wish you had bought one just in time…before it was too late."
7,Accident Compensation Claims: Beneficial to Virtually All,news-society," Life is a series of events that undergoes certain kinds of accidents causing mentally, physically and property damage to the victim. Ultimately, the victim suffers huge financial loss followed by the damage in an accident (of any kind). Under such circumstances, the victim is legally authorized to demand compensation claims from the accused party. That means to say, the law gives you a right to demand compensation claim against any accidents like auto accident, medical accident or accident at work from the third party responsible for your property or physical damage. The article is highlighting some of the main accidents and your legal right to demand for compensation against them. Accident car claim is the kind of claim against the third party that has caused you property and physical damage followed by the car accident. Under such circumstances, you are legally authorized to claim for the compensation against the damage of your car as well as your physical damage (if any). One of the most common injuries experienced by a car accident is whiplash injury (hyperextension (over-extension) injury to the neck) that usually happens when someone hits your car from behind causing bolt of pains to your cervical areas. In that case, you have a legal right to demand whiplash claim as car accident compensation against the accused driver. You can also claim for compensation against the doctor at certain clinic, if one of your relatives or family members experienced damage due to clinical negligence or medical laxity. The clinical negligence claims will entitle you demand for compensation against the clinical negligence shown by the concerned medical specialist who treated your family member or relative during the course of medical treatment. A claim for compensation can also be demanded in the case, if any person, working in an industry experiences certain physical damage due to disease or other environmental and security factors. Hence, the victim can demand industrial disease compensation from the concerned industry. If it is fully established that the damage claim is genuine, the court of law will sustain your claim thereby helping you avail the compensation against your damage from the industry you are working in. If it is established that your compensation claim against the third party is genuine and reasonable with evidence, then you are entitled to avail the compensation against the damage from the court of law. More importantly, your compensation claim will be well dealt with by hiring a solicitor, especially ‘no win no fee solicitor’. ‘No win no fee solicitors won’t charge you money for fighting your claim, if they lose your case in the court of law. The solicitors are legal expert to help you gain your compensation claim faster. Since, legal compensation claim against any injury involves time-consuming legal formalities and their fulfillment, hiring solicitor like whiplash solicitor will be crucial to avail compensation against car accident. This goes same with other compensation claims in which the victim has undergone from moderate to extreme physical/property loss/damage. Therefore, if you experience any kind of accident, be it medical, auto or industry accident, don’t forget to hire a solicitor like no win no fee solicitor that will facilitate your compensation claim in the court of law."
8,What Does a Loan Workout Entail?,news-society," In today’s volatile real estate market, homeowners struggle to know where to turn for help with their most valuable possession: their home. The economy has left borrowers struggling to make their payments due to reduced or lost incomes, increased expenses, and even increasing monthly mortgage payments. Some have relied on credit cards to survive, others have had to liquidate retirement accounts, and everyone has had to live paycheck to paycheck. There is hope. There are always options available to avoid foreclosure, but whether or not they are affordable depends on your specific situation. All banks offer some type of workout, including reinstatement plans; forbearance plans; repayment plans; traditional loan modifications, and Treasury Department programs. The problem that most borrowers face is getting the bank to offer these to them, and knowing which options are going to be best to pursue. Get Quick Results Banks are getting increasingly hard to deal with. Any borrower that has tried to deal with the bank has experienced one or more of the following problems: excessive hold times; conflicting stories; repeated requests for the same documents; denials, and solutions that were more expensive than what the borrower started out with. Knowing what documents are required, knowing what departments to call, and knowing what people to talk to is most of the battle. A well done and complete loan modification packet will help ensure a speedy review process, and good results. Banks have testified to the government that they have trouble getting the necessary documents from the borrower, yet many people have lost their homes even though they complied with every request from the bank. The problem is that everything in the packet needs to be current for the negotiator to be able to work on the file. Knowing what the bank wants before they ask for it is the key to success. Get Afforbable Payments Getting approved for a permanent offer is difficult. Most borrowers do not realize it, but they can be denied because of one number being off on their financial statements. Unfortunately, the approval process for a loan modification is just like buying a new home. Underwriters and negotiators have to run waterfall tests and Net Present Value tests that only a few, select borrowers are going to successfully pass. Too much income can leave you with too high of a payment, too little can cause your application to be denied; even expenses need to be itemized a certain way depending on the bank. What borrowers may think is helping them, often ends up hurting them. The loan modification process is a juggling act between getting the payment that you want and getting something offered in the first place. Success in this regard is not always dependent on your financial situation; sometimes how you fill out the financial forms is the bottom line. Knowing what each bank is going to look at, based on their policies and your experience with them can be the difference because almost every bank varies in what they look for. Stop the Trustee's Sale Once you stop making payments it is only a matter of time before the bank starts the foreclosure process. Soon after you stop making payments, the bank will hire a trustee company to handle the process. This hired company will be the one to send you a Notice of Default which is a 90 day opportunity to cure the mortgage default. Usually 3 months after the Notice of Default, you will receive a Notice of Trustee’s Sale. This notice is the 20 day warning that your home will be auctioned off. Working with the bank on a modification is often a strategy for postponing sale dates and buying time. Some borrowers have managed to stay in their home, payment free, for years because they knew how to handle it. Unfortunately, it can also be a way to lose the home accidentally. Many borrowers have had their home sell even though they were in review for a modification. Many have lost their home while on a forbearance plan, a repayment plan, or even on the trial period of the Treasury Department's HAMP program. The real problem is that the bank may have the sale on hold, but forget to communicate that to the trustee company. It is important to keep tabs on your sale date and to contact the foreclosure attorneys to confirm that they know not to sell the home. Managing the trustee’s sale for your home is an important part of the loan modification process. Keeping a Foreclosure From Being Recorded If you are denied for a loan modification, you will want to short sale the property. Short sales are an agreement with the bank to sell the property for less then you owe and have far less effect on your credit then a non-judicial foreclosure. Managing the modification process well will leave you the opportunity to short sell the property before it goes to auction. The sad reality is that a lot of borrowers do not know when they are going to be denied and do not have enough time to work with the bank to avoid a foreclosure on their record. The home can often be sold within days of a denial letter and sometimes they are even sold before the borrower even knows something is wrong. Depending on the bank, there may be an opportunity to short sale the property if you manage it correctly. Beside the credit implications, a short sale can also keep you in the home for a few more months."
9,Questions raised on 2G scam CBI charge-sheet,news-society," The charge-sheet filed by CBI in the country’s most high profile case has raised doubts over the authenticity of the investigations. There were a number of telecom operators who received the UASL in 2008 by A Raja, who was the issuing authority at that time. Putting A Raja behind bars for wrongly granting the licenses to these companies reflect that the procedure followed for issuing licenses was allegedly wrong. In this case, all the telecom operators, namely  Datacom, Loop, Unitech Wireless, Shyam Sistema, Swan and Allianz Infra, would have got licenses through the incorrect procedure. Then why only Unitech and Swan (along with ADAG for its link to Swan) named in the charge sheet. How come the same procedure was found right for the other companies and wrong for only these ones. Also, the charge sheet names Sanjay Chandra and Vinod Goenka of the Unitech Wireless and Swan respectively but nowhere mentions Anil Ambani of ADAG. Now if Anil Ambali is the promoter of ADAG, then so are Sanjay Chandra and Vinod Goenda of their respective companies. The reason for this special treatment extended to Anil Ambani remains unknown. Maybe it’s to protect the most high profile that the others are being put to test. Furthermore, things happening at the Tata’s end raise lot of doubts, that too with the claims of Ratan Tata that his Group’s business is not based on bribes & corruption. A land worth Rs 250 Crs given to DMK by Voltas (a Tata company) for only Rs 25 Crs, and the Rs 750 Crs VSNL land going to the Tata’s as part of the VSNL disinvestment makes one wonder what’s transpiring behind the scene. Unfair, isn’t it. The country wants the guilty to be booked and can’t let the CBI protect a certain set of people while nailing the other set. What makes them hand-pick only few? Are Ambani or Tata names too big to be touched by the CBI. What’s the guarantee that the naming of Sanjay Chandra or Vinod Goenka in the charge-sheet has creditable ground. Many things go unexplained. Questions unanswered."
10,2G Special Court: Is it competent to carry out a fair trial?,news-society," In an interesting move, Supreme Court appointed a Special Court to undertake the trial proceedings of 2G Spectrum Scam. Media has played a crucial role in generating heat about this case and it is reflecting in the trial proceedings, if not fully then at least indirectly in ways that can leave us wondering whether the Special Court will be able to carry out a fair trial. For instance, anyone will be taken aback on hearing that the Special Judge was able to take cognizance of the two charge sheets in just 15 to 20 minutes of receiving these documents. The element of surprise here is that one charge sheet was of 127 pages & another of 49 pages with their annexures running over 85000 pages. Now, is it that the Special Judge given some specialized training to read these documents so fast or was there some other reason . . . It is a shock to see that the Special Court room where the proceedings were taking place in front of the Special Judge was nothing but a room full of indiscipline. People talking, entering, exiting at their free will. One of the lawyers who was representing one of the accuseds in fact remarked that he was appalled to see that this shabby and congested room would be hearing an all-important case on which the whole country’s attention was tuned into. A thing that surprises the most that in times when the judiciary stresses on granting bail to lessen the burden on jail infrastructure, and given the fact that this very court of this Special Judge has granted bail in similar matters even after filing of the charge sheets, what is it that’s pressurising the Special Court to deny bail to the 2G accuseds. Legal Fraternity across has expressed its shock over the special judge’s decision. Harish Salve, a prominent lawyer & former Solicitor General of India opines - ""My personal view is that this is not a case for which bail can be denied. Today’s development is a worrisome trend"" (in Economic Times, Delhi). Another prominent lawyer and a senior advocate, Mahesh Jethmalani said on CNBC TV18, ""Bail denial to five accused in 2G Scam surprising!"" In such scenario, where people who are well aware of law are feeling strange on the decision taken by Special Court, for a regular citizen it does raise the question on the competency of the Special Court."

12,Latin American women are like paradise for foreign men,news-society," Living in Latin American must be like living in paradise. Firstly because there are more women than men. Secondly because of the high concentration of hot and sexy Latin American women in one place. What man wouldn’t want to be surrounded by all these beauties? What man wouldn’t want to constantly feast his eyes on hot bodied women? Here, you’d think it rains beautiful women. With a place where there is a major imbalance in the ratio between men and women, Latin American women have had to work much harder than the men when it comes to dating and finding love. Another reason for this place being a paradise is: not only are the women beautiful, this region is also known for having the youngest population after Africa. This therefore has made Latin American women be appealing to foreign men who are looking for young women in their prime to love and make them their wives. And to top that, these young hot women are loving and caring and would be the perfect match for any man on earth. Who won’t agree youth adds to a woman’s attractiveness. Much as all these praises sound too good to be true, those are the facts. Ask anyone who has ever traveled to this area. But you don’t have to travel to Latin America to experience this paradise. You can enjoy all this at the comfort of your home. See, most Latin American women are now being forced by circumstances to look for foreign men because of the shortage of their own men. More and more of these women are now registering themselves on interracial dating sites in order to find men who are willing to date them. Willing? What man wouldn’t want such fineness next to him 24/7? Plus the ratios are in your favor. With a good and reliable interracial dating site that has an abundance of Latin American women registered, your odds of getting one of these young curvaceous hotties are pretty high. Don’t all these facts make you want to get your computer and register online now? Paradise is just but a click away. Do indulge!"
13,Community Based Crime Prevention Projects,news-society," Many communities are worried about the high rates of crime that are being witnessed all over South Africa. This has led to the members of these communities coming up with projects that are steered at getting rid of crime in South Africa. There are a number of initiatives that have been created and designed to ensure that crime prevention is a reality in South Africa and not just a virtual thing. Communities are accepting the fact that they are not supposed to leave the burden of bringing safety in South Africa on the government and this has proven to be very effective in one way or another. In the recent crime statistics that were released some time in 2010, it was noted that the crime rate had relatively reduced and there were fewer murders as compared to other years. This shows that the initiatives being created are working effectively even if it is at a slow rate. It is the responsibility of every member of the community to help in crime prevention strategies if there is any success to be witnessed. The members of the community are given the right to participate in different initiatives that are geared in the direction of crime prevention by the government. This is one of the ways of ensuring that all citizens participate in bringing safety in South Africa. Neighborhood watch, farm watch and business watch projects are being developed to ensure that crime in South Africa is dealt with accordingly. Most of the crimes that are common in South Africa include; robberies, property crime, car theft, pick pocketing, burglary, hijacking and even murder. These crimes need to be dealt with from the core which is one of the reasons why members of the community are involved in coming up with initiatives and projects that bring to justice the most wanted criminals in the society. This helps individuals to stop their involvement with crime in South Africa and in turn be respectful and helpful members of the community. Many families in South Africa are dysfunctional and this is one of the projects that are being worked on to ensure that people communicate and relate well in their families. This is one of the social crime prevention projects that the members of the community are involved in. Other projects include schools, jobs, churches, and even the recreational facilities that are available for members of the public. These projects are meant to help the young people in the society who are seriously involved in crime in South Africa, the poor people who do not have any other means of survival apart from crime and also the unemployed. The projects are helpful in that they aid in dealing with these sensitive issues since they are the results of crime in South Africa. The social crime prevention projects that the members of the community are involved in include job provisions to the unemployed, housing initiatives for the poor in the community, education for the youths and other empowerment programs for the young people in the society to help them come out of crime and become better people in the society."
14,"Fear of Forced Sterilization By Chinese Mother of Two Not ""Well Founded""",news-society," U.S. COURT OF APPEALS (3rd Cir.) CASE: Ying Chen, Qiang Chen DATE: Opinion filed March 18, 2011 ISSUE: Married couple fight removal to China because they have two children. HELD: The Court studied a similar case from 2010 and found that while Fujian Province might fine the petitioners and there might be ""social coercion"" for Mrs. Chen to be sterilized, there is no indication that her fear of forced sterilization is well-founded. FACTS: Petitioners are from Fujian Province. Husband (Qiang Chen) entered in 1996. Wife (Ying Chen) entered in 2003. They married in U.S. in 2005 and have had two sons, born in 2005 and 2008, both United States citizens. In 2008, after the Department of Homeland Security served Notices to Appear, petitioners conceded their removability before an Immigration Judge. They applied for asylum, withholding of removal, Convention Against Torture (""CAT"") relief, and, alternatively, voluntary departure. Petitioners – principally Ms. Chen, the lead applicant and sole witness to testify before the Immigration Judge – claim that they fear persecution upon return to China for having violated the one-child policy in that Ms. Chen will be forcibly sterilized and/or face economic persecution. The Immigration Judge denied relief. Among other things, the Immigration Judge found that Ms. stated desire to have a third child upon return to China is speculative, and that, under the holding in Matter of J-W-S-, 24 I. & N. Dec. 185 (Board of Immigration Appeals 2007), she failed to show a well-founded fear that she would be forcibly sterilized upon returning with her two United States citizen children. The Immigration Judge also denied withholding of removal and found no evidence showing a likelihood that Ms. Chen will be subjected to torture upon return. The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed and dismissed appeal, finding that petitioners failed to show an objective, well-founded fear of persecution. The Board of Immigration Appeals agreed with the Immigration Judge that petitioners do not warrant asylum based on the birth of their two children, and it rejected efforts to distinguish their case from Matter of J-W-S-. The Board of Immigration Appeals rejected, in particular, the argument that children will be considered Chinese citizens for purposes of enforcing population control policy. On appeal to the Federal 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals. Petitioners argue that Ms. Chen established that her fear of future persecution is well-founded. They contend that the Board of Immigration Appeals and the Immigration Judge engaged in ""generic reliance"" on the holding in Matter of J-W-S- and failed to consider evidence showing that children will be treated as Chinese citizens, which gives rise to their fear that Ms. Chen will be sterilized or subjected to onerous fines for having had more than one child. Earlier Case Considered. The recent opinion in Matter of H-L-H- & Z-YZ-, 25 I. & N. Dec. 209 (Board of Immigration Appeals 2010), contains a comprehensive discussion that persuasively addresses many of the issues before us. This court has not previously considered in a precedential opinion the latest view of this issue. The respondents there, like the Chens here, were natives and citizens of China who hailed from the Fujian Province and had two United States citizen children. They claimed that if they returned to China, and specifically the Fujian Province, the female respondent would be subject to forced sterilization as well as a significant fine. The Immigration Judge agreed and granted the application for asylum. The Board of Immigration Appeals vacated the opinion of the Immigration Judge, concluding that the respondent had not shown that she possessed a well-founded fear of forcible sterilization or other sanctions rising to the level of persecution. In doing so, the Board of Immigration Appeals noted that State Department reports on country conditions, including the Profiles of Asylum Claims & Country Conditions, are ""highly probative evidence and are usually the best source of information on conditions in foreign nations."" Id. at 213. With respect to the discussion of forced sterilization in China and Fujian Province in particular, in the May 2007 China: Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions (""2007 Profile""), the Board of Immigration Appeals stated: Although acknowledging that there were ""reportedly"" forced sterilizations in Fujian in 2006, the State Department observes that Consulate General officials visiting Fujian have found that coercion through public and other pressure has been used, but they did not find any cases of physical force employed in connection with abortion or sterilization. In interviews with visa applicants from Fujian representing a wide cross-section of society, Consulate General officers have noted that many violators of the one-child policy paid fines, but they found no evidence of forced abortion or property confiscation. According to the Fujian Provincial Birth Planning Committee, there have been no cases of forced abortion or sterilization in Fujian in the last 10 years. In short, we discern no reversible error in the denial of claims for asylum. Because withholding of removal carries a higher burden of proof than asylum, the request for withholding was properly denied, as well.

15,"Will The World End On Saturday, May 21, 2011?",news-society," Surely a large majority has heard about 5/21/2011 marking Judgment Day and the last day on earth for those chosen by God. Many may scoff at this present day Jonah scholar's findings, but as any follower in God knows that God may come upon you as a thief in the night if you are not watchful. We are told to work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. The signs of the times are all around us. The vile affections of the Gay Pride movement, the prediction about Israel becoming a nation and Jesus saying that Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer [is] nigh. In various parts of the Bible, Israel is represented as a basket of figs. The figs represent the nation Israel. The fig tree in leaf (Israel becomes a nation again May 14, 1948) tells us the end has to be after A.D. 1948. By now you've picked up on the buzz that, according to Harold Camping of Family Radio, Judgment Day will occur this coming Saturday, May 21st. The likely hour is even predicted (6 PM), which likely will move around the earth's various time zones. If all of this makes you a bit uncomfortable, it's probably because you're familiar with Jesus' own words and warning. Speaking to the matter of predicting His return, Jesus himself replied: ""But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father"" (Mark 13:32) Nevertheless, when comparing various passages in the Bible, for believers, there is the indication they will likely know the day and the hour. It says, Could the May 21st prediction be right? Jesus tells us in Matthew 24: ""Therefore stay awake, for you do not know the day your Lord is coming ... the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect"" (v. 42, 44). This possibility that 5/21/2011 is said to be the end of the world for God's believers according to a prominent Bible teacher should have those who desire to enter God's heavenly world asking God most humbly for entrance. Those who are rejected by the Lord God remain behind behind."
16,Steps To Take Before Divorce,news-society," Statistics say that about 50 percent of marriages end in divorce in the United States. As divorce has become socially acceptable, it crawls into becoming somewhat a norm and even sometimes an inevitable outcome of marriage. But there are ways to try to save your marriage before you get to a point of no return. The first step is opening the lines of communication. A marriage will go sour when the pair stop talking to each other, stop telling each other, first, about their day, the happenings in their life, the events that are important to them, and then they will stop telling each other bigger things, like their ambitions and goals and dreams. Part of them will think that the other person simply doesn't care anymore and that will create some sense of resentment and bitterness. However, if the lines of communication are closed, then there will be no way to speak about the true feelings of what is bothering one about the other and so all of this bitterness will manifest into some secret hatred and show itself in the form of petty fights, angry remarks, or cruelty, or even silence that is icy and cold. All of these things will only get worse if no one does anything about it, if no one opens the lines of communication, absolutely nothing will improve. So, that said, it is important to try to open these lines as soon as possible. However, this is quite a hard task and one that cannot be taken lightly. But, if not taken, then it will lead to the road of divorce because things will escalate and only get worse with time. So, it is important to talk, and if you can't figure a way to start talking without yelling or snapping or being hostile, then seeking a mediator's help might be the best solution. Seek counseling or some other kind of assistance that will help the two of you finally begin speaking to one another and voicing the concerns of the various problems you two share. The next step is to try and hear the other person out without judgments or anger. Without prejudice or bias, you need to listen to what they are saying and not take it as an attack on you. Certainly much of it will be personal and hurtful and even angering, but to get through it, you need to listen to each other or else there will never be a bright ray of sun at the end of a dark and festering tunnel. Once that is done, listening is not enough. Take it to heart, otherwise it will be all in vain and might even be worse that the person opened up to you and now you won't even have the consideration of putting their words into action. You need to try and make changes, for love is built upon a valley of compromise and to make your relationship work, it is important that you make this change and listen to what they have to say."
17,The Benefits Of Traffic Cones,news-society," Today's roadways receive lots of use resulting from the amount all of us rely on them every day. Both people and vehicles could potentially cause lots of harm to these streets, based on exactly how they are utilized. Individuals travel on local pedestrian roads and vehicles run quickly on roads. All this weight and friction will cause the street to wear out and get ruined in the long term. This kind of destruction is usually repaired, however repair crews need to do something in order to let everyone know that the building project is currently in progress and that drivers should reduce speed on the streets and change lanes. This is why traffic cones are going to be helpful for them. These types of cones can serve as a sign for each motorist or pedestrian that a portion of the road is obstructed. Usually, traffic cones are used simply by putting them close to construction or damaged areas on streets. These kind of cones are almost always colored fluorescent orange and white. These particular colors are utilized simply because provide higher visibility. Orange can be quite visible throughout the day and white is visible through the night, and some cones have strips that have reflective areas to get better visibility during the night time. These kind of cones need to be seen from far away to be beneficial and safeguard drivers. There are several types of traffic cones that road authorities utilize for signs. Some of the more common kinds are the ones employed for pedestrian or reduced traffic streets. This type of cone may be lighter and a little smaller than others. They are going to help block people from taking a walking street because of maintenance or other problems. Several facilities also use these types of cones as signs of out-of-service bathrooms or wet floors. A number of traffic cones are designed especially for usage on light-traffic streets. The principle attribute of these types of cones is they can be a little bit taller and heavier as opposed to ones employed in walking areas. The heavier weight of this type of cone will keep it still when automobiles pass by the street. One of the more common varieties of cone, though would be the heavy and big traffic cones employed in high traffic streets like freeways. The road is extremely lengthy and wide and motorists need these kinds of large cones to be visible from a distance. Aside from the size, they also built these types of cones to be quite heavy since these will be the highways where travelers will drive extremely fast. The speed of these automobiles may cause lots of wind and shift the cones out of place. The weight could keep them stationary and prevent it from turning into yet another road issue. Various traffic cones have been utilized by road enforcers throughout the years and they've actually come in different forms. For example, you won't just see all of them in cone shapes but there are bollards or even posts which you can use the same way. They include the same color scheme as other cones and even provide substantial visibility on roads both day and night. The traffic cones used for road safety will allow you to be safe while walking or driving a car. They are intended to help you see what is happening on the streets so you can keep yourself from getting in mishaps, especially when the street is getting fixed."
18,"New York's ""Serious Injury"" Requirement – A Recent  Car Accident Case That The Jury Blew",news-society," I read the latest appellate (appeals) level cases relevant to my areas of law practice and interest pretty much as soon as they're published. Let's talk about one that has me scratching my head. Published on March 1, 2011 is the car accident case of Jun Suk Seo v. (against) Edward A. Walsh. The accident occurred in August 2006. This appeals court case comes from a Queens County jury verdict. The jury threw out the injured accident victim's (plaintiff's) case because he did not suffer a ""serious injury"" as required by the New York State Insurance Law. For more information about New York car accidents and the serious injury requirement (or No-Fault threshold) see my FREE Special Report The New York ""No-Fault"" Law. Accident victim Jun Suk Seo asked the trial judge to disregard the jury's verdict and give him a new trial - which is something a trial judge can do in New York. His lawyer argued that he should get that new trial (essentially, a ""do over"") because the defense attorney said nasty things in his closing statement to the jury, what plaintiff's lawyer calls ""inflammatory and highly prejudicial remarks."" As a second or alterative ground to throw out the jury verdict and give the accident victim a second trial, the accident victim's lawyer argued that the jury verdict was ""contrary to the weight of the evidence."" This means that the verdict was so screwy, that the jury must have ignored what was shown to it in the courtroom or, as the appeals court explained it, ""the verdict could not have been reached on any fair interpretation of the evidence."" The trial court judge granted a new trial to the injured plaintiff based on the first ground, that the defense attorney made an improper closing argument. The Appellate Division, Second Department disagreed and found that the defendant's lawyer's closing argument was fair enough. Then the appeals Court moved on to the second argument made by the injured accident victim's lawyer: against the weight of the evidence. I'll tell you the facts that the Appellate Division pointed out in its decision and, Dear Readers, you be the judges: Here's the evidence the jury heard at trial. INJURED PLAINTIFF'S (ACCIDENT VICTIMS'S) DOCTORS: Dr. Hal Gutstein, plaintiff's treating neurologist. As a result of the car accident, he suffered nerve damage (radiculopathy) due to herniated disks in his neck (cervical disks) which pressed on his spinal cord. He had surgery to his neck, a discectomy, a procedure in which his herniated disks were cut out and a biomechanical device was inserted into his spine to stabilize it. Approximately one year after the discectomy, an examination of plaintiff showed permanent limitations in his ability to move his neck. Dr. Ksushik Das, injured plaintiff's surgeon. Told the jury that the plaintiff's neck injury was permanent. DEFENDANT'S DOCTORS: Dr. Sang Lee, a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation. Examined the accident victim for a prior (1999) car accident where plaintiff suffered a stiff neck and lower back injuries. Dr. Renan Macias, a neurologist. Examined the plaintiff in 1999 and noted some possible nerve damage to his neck and possible disk injury to his neck as well. Dr. Leon Sultan, a board-certified orthopedic surgeon. Examined the accident victim in 2007 for this car accident, and testified that this car accident did not result in a significant limitation of the use of a body function or system, or a permanent consequential limitation of the use of a body organ or member. Dr. Sultan did not believe that the plaintiff had herniated disks; rather, according to Dr. Sultan, MRI films revealed the presence of mere bulges. What do you think, Dear Readers? What should the jury have decided? What did the appeals court do? In a return to sanity, the appeals court granted the accident victim a new trial, noting that none of the defendant's witnesses rebutted the plaintiff's showing that he underwent a discectomy, or provided any testimony that the discectomy was unnecessary. The Court's holding: the Lower Court properly granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside the jury verdict on the issue of serious injury, but should have done so on the ground that the verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence, and should have granted a new trial on that basis. Comment: This jury had its heads up its asses. I hope that anyone called upon to do their civic duty and serve on a jury for ANY kind of case will not drop the ball, will pay close attention, and will dispense justice."
19,Green Card Interview Review - Perfect Guide to Prepare for a Marriage Green Card Interview,news-society," Some people prefer these ways to prepare for any marriage green card interview : Gather up documentation of bona fide marriage, even though you submitted it with your initial AOS application. Items like cards, notes, letters, emails, photos, and other mementos are helpful. Also include any bills or assets in joint names, like utility or telephone bills, banking account statements, tax statements, property deeds, and titles to automobiles. This is not the full listing of all of the possible items that may be used to prove genuine marriage for the green card interview; along with these things, bring other things you think clearly shows that you are in a true marriage. Be prepared to present updated financial information. The immigration service will want to see that the united states citizen spouse and immigrant spouse possess a combined income of at least 125% from the federal poverty level. Otherwise, you'll need to get a co-sponsor to satisfy this requirement. It may be tough to prove that you simply meet this requirement, specifically for students, or if a person or both spouses has begun a new job or is earning much more or under the year before. It's wise to bring a minimum of three years' price of tax returns, as well as a few months of paystubs, and a current employer letter stating rate of pay, hours worked, and that prospects for continued employment are great. Bring your passport with non-immigrant visa, all I-94s, and employment authorization card for your marriage green card interview. The officer may wish to review these, and when your case is approved, you'll get a stamp inside your passport that will assist as temporary proof of your status like a permanent or conditional U.S. resident. Also bring your original birth certificates, marriage certificate, and any documents you accustomed to enter the U.S., as well as any documents issued by the immigration service (Advance Parole documents, for example). Just before your marriage green card interview, review all of the forms and documents you filed to refresh your memory, since you may get asked about your responses to the questions about these forms. If your circumstances have changed since you filed the application, be ready to explain. Be also ready to update the info. For example, for those who have were built with a child together because the application was filed, bring the youngsters birth certificate and allow the officer know. On the day from the interview, arrive Fifteen minutes early, and make certain to dress neatly and conservatively. You don't have to dress very formally, but wear something that is clean, presentable, and business casual. The officer's subjective impression of you at the marriage green card interview can produce a difference in whether or not you are approved. Avoid wearing anything with writing or slogans, especially politically or nationally oriented ones. If you have already been married for your spouse for 2 years, remind the interviewing officer that you should receive a stamp for permanent residence, and not conditional residency. The officer should assume that you simply haven't been married of sufficient length to meet the necessity. If you have been married for less than 2 yrs, the immigrant spouse will receive conditional U.S. residence for a period of 2 yrs, and you'll have to apply 3 months prior to the end of the conditional period to possess these conditions removed. Respond to questions honestly at your green card marriage interview. If you do not remember, say so. It's better to say you don't know instead of attempting to make something up. For some reason, it seems rather difficult for most people to perform, but you don't worry because there are more creative ways to do it. If you've applied to become a lawful permanent resident of the United States through marriage to some US citizen, sooner or later you will have to attend a marriage green card interview. This typically takes place from 6 to Twelve months after your application. It's important to properly prepare for your marriage green card interview, or you could experience a delay in the approval of the case. Even worse, your application could be denied if you don't present the correct information at your interview. It's a good idea to consult by having an immigration lawyer before your marriage green card interview. The lawyer can advise you about any potential pitfalls specific to your case, and can provide additional tips to prepare you for that interview. If the officer suspects that the marriage isn't genuine, you will be referred to the fraud unit. You'll be interviewed separately, as well as your responses will be when compared with find out if they're consistent. If you will find large differences between your spouses in age, lifestyle, language barriers, or simply hardly any evidence of a shared life, your chances of being known the fraud unit tend to be higher. Now, let’s discuss about Green Card Interview from Sean Bramwell and just how it might help you. I hope this simple Green Card Interview Review will assist you to differentiate whether Green Card Interview is Scam or a Genuine. One of the anxiousness of attempting to obtain permanent residency in the U.S. may be the green card through marriage application. Foreign spouses of U.S. citizens qualify to submit a green card through marriage application depending on their marriage for their U.S. citizen spouse. Unlike other family, a spouse is known as an ""immediate relative"" and for that reason isn't susceptible to a watch for green card. Additionally, an instantaneous relative application, just like a marriage green card application, is one from the few immigration applications that provide a ""cure"" to specific immigration violations, for instance unlawful presence or overstaying a visa. This ""cure"" is particularly attractive to those people who are from status or who've violated their status. In fact, for a number of foreign nationals, the marriage with a U.S. citizen may be the only choice to be a lasting resident U.S. The information contained in this book is phenomenal. It provides information from the to Z about how to prepare for any marriage green card. There is no other book providing you with all the details in one location."
20,The Stun Gun That Means Double Trouble For Any Attacker,news-society," Zap brand Double Trouble stun guns offer an innovative firing area that sets it apart from the rest of the stun weapons being offered on the market today. Strong and reliable, they have rapidly become a popular means of self defense against an attacker. Compared to many other stun weapons they are one of the most powerful. They are a low amperage, hand-held electronic device power-driven by lithium batteries. Its called the ""Double"" Trouble stun gun for good reason, and that is because of double the area between contacts. The greater distance between contacts, the more effective it makes the weapon. This increased contact space makes the shock much more effective and it quite simply makes it easier to make contact with an aggressor. The distance between contacts on this stun gun is a whopping 5 inches. The vast majority of stun guns on the market today average 1.5 inches between contacts. The unique horseshoe shape of the Double Trouble provides twice the contact, twice the stopping power. The design of this stun gun integrates two contact points which serves as a conduit to pass electronic current through when the trigger is pressed and the device is held against an attacker's body. It will not injure or kill, despite the high voltage output. In addition, it does not work against the target’s cardiac system, nor does it work by activating the body’s pain receptors. What it does is channel the flow of electricity into the muscles of the attacker, causing them to contract on overdrive, subsequently depleting the body’s blood sugar levels due to muscle overwork. The effects of the Zap Double Trouble stun gun also include blocking the attacker’s muscular electrical impulses, as well as stupefying him by hindering his equilibrium. The disorientation experienced will only disable him temporarily and will not cause any lasting or fatal injury to the assailant. Additionally, you shouldn't be afraid about being shocked should the attacker be touching you when the device is used. The current simply will not pass to you. Double Trouble stunners come with a life-time warranty and are available in 1.2 million volts. The manufacture will replace your stun gun if it fails to work for any reason other than needing a battery replacement. In conclusion, Zap Double Trouble stun weapons make extraordinary gifts for just about any occasion; Christmas, birthdays, Valentines Day, going away, to name but a few. In this day and time when personal protection and safety is on the minds of many folks, is there any better way to say ""I care about you""?"

3,"Pakistan It's People, It's Culture, It's Future",news-society," (Brian Ringland ORT) Pakistan is a country that is in the news - a lot. We hear stories about Taliban fighters in the North as well as bombings and assassinations in the South. The average North American and European hears only the stories that seem to concern the war in Afghanistan and how that war involves Pakistan. Make no mistake. Our fortunes as well as our influence in that part of the world rely heavily on maintaining a relationship with Pakistan. They will continue to do so even after the war in Afghanistan concludes, and we will look at that aspect in this article as well. Pakistan is a mystery to most people. They know very little of the country or it's place in the world. It is a country that is strategically located in history as well as geography. The following article is a three part series on Pakistan. The article will introduce the countries culture, it's history and it's people. At least six different civilizations have flourished where Pakistan is today and those civilizations left their imprints. Historically, Pakistan is one of the most ancient lands known to man.It had large efficient cities even before Babylon was built. Historical records and artifacts found in present day Pakistan can be traced back to at least 2500 BC, when a highly developed civilization flourished in the Indus Valley Area. Archeological excavations have brought to light evidence of an advanced civilization existing in ancient times. Pakistan's culture has been influenced by the countless visitors to the region. Around 1500 BC, the Aryans came and influenced the Hindu civilization. Later on the Persians occupied the Northern regions from the 6th century BC up to the 2nd century AD. The Greeks were also here, arriving in 327 BC with Alexander the Great of Macedonia. In 712 AD, the Arabs set foot in what is now Pakistan somewhere near modern Karachi and ruled the lower half of Pakistan for two centuries. It was during this time that Islam took roots in the soil and influenced the life, culture and traditions of the people. 300 years later the Muslims from Central Asia arrived and ruled almost the whole Subcontinent up to the 18th century AD before the British arrived to take control. Pakistan was added to the map on 14th August 1947. A result of the partition of the Indian sub-continent into two sovereign countries, namely Pakistan and India. Pakistan shares borders with China, Afghanistan, Iran,and with India. As for it's size, Pakistan is approximately twice the size of the state of California. The total area of Pakistan is 796,096 square km.It has a 1,046-kilometer (650 mi) coastline along the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman in the south. The northern and western highlands have towering mountain ranges that include the Karakorum and Pamir mountain ranges, which have some of the world's highest peaks: K2 (28,250 ft; 8,611 m) and Nanga Parbat (26,660 ft; 8,126 m). The Baluchistan Plateau lies to the west, and the Thar Desert and an expanse of alluvial plains, the Punjab and Sind, lie to the east. The 1,000-mile-long (1,609 km) Indus River and its tributaries flow through the country from the Kashmir region to the Arabian Sea. India and Pakistan have both laid claim to the Kashmir region; this territorial dispute led to war in 1949, 1965, 1971, 1999, and remains unresolved today. There are still armed exchanges taking place in the Kashmir region there at the time of this story. Maj. Gen. Iskander Mirza was the first president. Military rule prevailed for two decades. It must be remembered that this was a divided region from the start. Separatist tendencies grew amongst those in the east.Tensions between East and West Pakistan which had existed from the outset continued to grow. The two regions shared few if any cultural and social traditions other than religion. To the growing resentment of East Pakistan, West Pakistan monopolized the country's political and economic power. In 1970, East Pakistan's Awami League, led by the Bengali leader Sheik Mujibur Rahman, secured a majority of the seats in the national assembly. President Yahya Khan postponed the opening of the national assembly to skirt East Pakistan's demand for greater autonomy, provoking civil war. The independent state of Bangladesh, was proclaimed on March 26, 1971. Indian troops entered the war in its final stages, fighting on the side of Bangladesh. Pakistan was defeated on Dec. 16, 1971, and President Yahya Khan stepped down. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto took over Pakistan and accepted Bangladesh as an independent entity. In 1976, formal relations between India and Pakistan resumed. The 1990's saw a succession of governments. Benazir Bhutto was prime minister twice and deposed twice and Nawaz Sharif three times, until he was deposed in a coup on Oct. 12, 1999, by Gen. Pervez Musharraf. In an announcement that surprised the world, two new nuclear powers emerged in May 1998 when India, followed by Pakistan just weeks later, conducted nuclear tests. Fighting with India again broke out in the disputed territory of Kashmir in May 1999. The fighting has continued in fits and starts ever since. Skirmishes frequently break out and along Kashmir's Line of Control some more broke out over the summer of 2008, after more than four years of relative calm. Problems arose after authorities in Indian-controlled Kashmir transferred 99 acres of land to a trust that runs a Hindu shrine, called Amarnath. Muslims launched a series of protests. The government rescinded the order, which outraged Hindus. About 40 people were killed in the protests and counter demonstrations, which involved several hundred thousand people. Despite the hostilities, a trade route between India and Pakistan across the line of control opened in October for the first time in 60 years. The People Pakistan has a very diverse culture due to the fact, at least in part, that what is now Pakistan has in the past been invaded and occupied by Huns, Persians, Arabs, Turks, Mongols and various Eurasian groups. There are differences in culture among the different ethnic groups in matters such as dress, food, and religion, especially where indigenous pre-Islamic customs differ from Islamic practices. Like every other country on the planet globalization has increased the influence of Western culture in Pakistan, especially among the affluent, who have easy access to Western products, television, media, and food. Many Western food chains have established themselves in Pakistan, and are found in the major cities. At the same time, there is also a reactionary movement within Pakistan that wants to turn away from Western influences, and this has manifested itself in a return to more traditional roots Many of the population would like to see a reform or return to a more strict form of Islam. This attitude has manifested itself more and more over the last decade. The war in Afghanistan must be taken into consideration here as it has no doubt had an influence on the populations attitude towards the west. Northern Pakistan is an especially sore spot for governments in Europe and the west. This lawless region of Pakistan is home to most of the Taliban and is also an area that produces extreme view points that do not favour the west or globalization. A Few Facts: Pakistan is divided into five geographic regions: The Thar Desert and Lower Indus Valley in the south with arid valleys and rocky hills; The Baluchistan Plateau toward the west with elevation between 1,000 and 3,000 feet (300-900 meters) and covering nearly half the nation's territory; The Indus Basin, an irrigated agricultural area in the northeast; The Northwest Frontier, an area of barren mountains and irrigated valleys bordering Afghanistan; and The Far North with snowcapped mountains reaching high elevations. Temperatures vary in these five regions. With the exception of the Far North, summers are hot throughout the country with temperatures ranging to 90-120°F (32-49°C) and little relief in the evening hours. Altitude governs climate in the Far North, with pleasant summers in the lower regions and perpetual snow in the higher mountains. The average annual rainfall varies from 6 inches (40 cm) in Karachi, 15 (38 cm) in Peshawar, 18 (46 cm) in Lahore, to about 30 (76 cm) in Islamabad. Most rain falls during the summer monsoon from July to September. Population (2010 est.): 177,276,594 Population growth rate: 1.5% Birth rate: 25.0/1000 Infant mortality rate: 65.3/1000; Life expectancy: 65.3; Population density per sq mi: 215 Next Week: Part Two - Pakistan's Future - After The Taliban"
4,Obama's Birth Certificate,news-society," Obama’s Birth Certificate President Obama released his Birth Certificate after two and a half years of people asking whether or not he was constitutionally eligible to actually be President of the United States.  The question in most people’s minds is (including Oprah Winfrey in a taping she held for an upcoming show): ""What took you so long?"" For the most part, that particular drama is now over.  I was never really that concerned about it because if Obama was kicked out of the Oval Office, the next one to fill that spot would be Joe Biden.  It gives me chills (and not the good ones that run ""up and down you leg"" like Chris Matthews had) to think of that scenario. But it brings up another drama; the continuing saga of a whether or not we should have an African American man in the White house.  I for one have never had a problem with our President being African American (is it still politically incorrect to say he’s ""black"").  I have a problem with this particular African American being our President.  But it has nothing to do with the fact that he’s an African American.  It has more to do with the fact that he’s inept and unqualified for the job.  No amount of on-the-job training is going to fix this problem.  The man seems incapable of learning even the basic tenets of economics or leadership, both which have been completely absent since January 20, 2009. Peniel Joseph stated that the problem with the ""birthers"", as they are called, is that they suffer from ""a deep seated and vicious racism"" which is fundamentally connected to a white supremacism in this country"". Peniel Joseph is a history professor at Tufts University.  Apparently, Mr. Joseph missed the memo that we live in a ""post racial"" society now that the greatest country that ever existed has elected an African American to be its President. Miami Herald columnist Leonard Pitts, Jr. said, ""So it is time to call this birther nonsense what it is --- not just claptrap, but profoundly racist claptrap"".  When tens of millions of people who live in this country are concerned because their elected leader will not provide a simple document proving that I had to provide in order to simply get a Maryland Driver’s License, this is not claptrap, much less ""profoundly racist"" claptrap.  Obama has a problem with credibility.  Not too many people believe him anymore.  It’s like that old joke that you can tell when a politician is lying because his lips are moving.  Here’s a clue:  not everything is about race. If the people at the Miami Herald, including you, Mr. Pitts, had done their job in the first place in 2007 instead of acting like infatuated schoolgirls hoping Barry would look your way, most of this ""claptrap"" would not have happened.  The mainstream news outlets, both the print as well as broadcast news, asked tough questions of the conservative candidates and tossed softballs at Barak Obama.  One candidate was vilified because the speaker who opened the night for his candidate dared to use Obama’s full name: Barak Hussein Obama.  John McCain actually was called racist because of this apparent faux pas (And to think we conservatives are called hateful and intolerant). And of course, we can’t omit the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has made a career of calling white people racists.  He told the Politico that Donald Trump’s campaign to get Obama to release his birth certificate was deeply rooted in race.  ""Any discussion of [Obama’s] birthplace is a code word…  It calls upon ancient racial fears.""  Jesse Jackson is an enigma in and of himself.  He’s a reverend who has never pastored a church and a politician who has never held an elected office.  He did march with Dr. Martin Luther King, though.  I really think that Dr. King, if he were alive today, would be distancing himself from Jesse Jackson and others like him because with Jesse Jackson, it’s all about the color of skin rather than the content of character.  They lack any content of character at all.  The only reason people like him continue to bring up race is that without the ""race card"", they have no authority and no following.  Without racial tension, the Jesse Jackson and Al Sharptons of this world would have no place to go, no purpose for being here and no platform from which to speak. I’m not saying that racism does not exist.  Unfortunately, it does.  In its ugliest form, it has caused untold harm to millions of innocent people worldwide.  We all identify with people who look like we do, hold our own same core beliefs, and have similar tastes as we do.  Heavy metal rock fans don’t hang out with the Euro-Techno beat crowd, the Country Western industry or the hip-hop crowd. Personally, outside of my immediate family, I don’t have many friends that are liberal in their politics or who vote the Democrat ticket. That is not racism.  That is called personal preference. To some degree, we all have a bit of racial preference in us to the extent that we all feel most comfortable with people of our own culture, people of our own nationality, people who look like we do, talk like we do, think like we do and act like we do.  This is how we were all wired from birth.  My first dog did not like people dressed in coveralls, like workmen used to wear in the early 60’s.  She had a bad experience with someone in coveralls and from that day forth, she would growl at anyone wearing coveralls, even my dad.  My first wife’s dog did not like people in uniform.  Right after we married, I joined the Army National Guard and came home one day in uniform and met a very angry Irish Setter.  Once she saw that it was me, she stopped growling and came bounding towards me wanting to play.  She got past the external appearance and realized I was still me, just in clothes she was not used to seeing me wear. In other words, once we get to know a little about the person in question (i.e. vetting them to understand who they really are), the race issue becomes moot.  Then we can have a dialogue about the issues without all the invectives and name calling.  The issue is character.  Obama has proved his character by his actions over the past two and a half years.  In the words of the Prophet Daniel (a Jew, different culture, different look, different language, yet character that stretches as far as the eye can see), : "" You have been weighed on the scales and found wanting."""
5,McDonald's Announces New Giant Burger,news-society," The world's largest fast food chain held a news conference to kick off a new ad campaign for a new burger that the company hopes will be more popular and more successful than the Big Mac. The Big Mac has been the company's flagship burger for as long as the franchise has been open. The restaurant chain hopes to capture the 'giant burger' portion of the fast food market. The new burger will feature six patties of beef. That's right six of them. Keeping those six beef patties company will be lettuce, tomato,pickles,special sauce, onions, and a half bun separator much like the one in a big mac. And cheese. Lots of cheese. Four slices on one burger. The total weight of the burger completely loaded up is well over one pound in weight. There is 1200 calories in the burger without any bacon. That's 1200 calories without the pop or the fries. Super sized of course. The name of this new huge burger? It is called ""The Ronald"" Which begs the question; Is this burger too rich for you? Mc Donald's spokesperson Rebecca Matheson, said that Donald Trump has been signed on for the initial promotion of the new burger. ""It made perfect sense to enlist the Donald to help promote the 'Ronald' burger, she said. The new burger is set to make it's debut in select North American locations on May 1 of this year. When asked whether the company thought it was wise to start promoting a hamburger with six patties of meat and condiments adding up to almost 1500 calories for the burger alone(ironically during a time when Americans have been told by health authorities that we must eat healthier and get slimmer),spokesperson Matheson replied "" Our studies have shown a need for a burger of this type. It does more than just fill a space in the market. It gives people choice. More importantly is gives Americans the freedom to choose, and after all, isn't that why our brave young men are fighting overseas right now? For our freedom? Our freedom to choose? Do you disagree with that?"" Donald Trump will be featured in television ads as well as having a life-size cardboard cutout of himself holding a Ronald burger in every franchise that offers the burger. Mr. Trump was not at the news conference as was promised. Officials at the conference apologized for not having the ""Donald"" on hand for the event mentioning that Mr. Trump was unavoidably delayed due to heavy traffic. According to sources Mr Trump had his driver stop into the nearest restaurant on route to the news conference because he was very hungry. As it turns out the limousine he was riding in was too large for the drive through driving lane and the vehicle became stuck. The Donald, according to witnesses at the scene, remained cool in the limo and calmly ate his Whopper until the tow truck freed his vehicle from the Burger King drive through."
6,SpaceX Express Ready to Launch Rocket,news-society," Experimental research company SpaceX Express announced at a press conference on Thursday that their 'Spacebus' project has cleared all testing phases and is almost ready to start taking people into orbit.Of the ten or so companies trying to be the first into orbit, Spacex Express would have to be considered the darkest of dark horses. Yet surprisingly the company fully expects to be ferrying people into orbit by January 2012. Less than a year from now. The vehicle used for launch and re-entry resembles a regular rocket and seats twelve people plus the pilot. The ship is so small that everyone sits single file in a line starting from the captain, who must board first and then the rest of the passengers one by one. It is basically a tube with thirteen seats in a line. Because of the ships small size the tallest a person can be to take the ride into space is 6'4 inches tall. Once the ship reaches low earth orbit it starts it's journey back with the use of two thrusters. When it is at the right altitude two large parachutes open up simultaneously. One at the nose of the ship and the other at the tail so that the ship floats to earth horizontally. ""We kept the design simple"", says Dennis Love, the CEO of SpaceX Express. ""The safest approach is to minimize your design as much as possible. The best platform for reaching space isn't the one that's the most complicated. When your design is simple it is easier to build redundancy into the system for maximum safety"",he said. For the last five years SpaceX Express has been operating out of a former bus factory in a Philadelphia industrial park. They plan to move their operation to New Mexico sometime later this year to start getting ready for actual launches. When asked how much a ticket to ride is going to be Mr. Love replied: "" The price of a seat on Spacebus Alpha will vary but I can tell you that it won't be millions of dollars. It won't even be hundreds of thousands of dollars. We even plan to accept Air Miles. This is going to be the People's rocket."" When asked how the company could expect to make a profit with such low prices the CEO responded: "" We didn't go all out so to speak on expensive items for Spacebus Alpha. We shopped around, got the best deal on parts and reused stuff around the shop as much as possible. We're serious about going after the one million dollar X prize. If we can be the first private company to put people into space we'll win the million dollars and with that money we will be able to build five more spacebuses."" The location of the spaceport that will host the launch of the Spacebus has not been disclosed. Reporters were only told that an announcement on the location would be forthcoming. There has been quiet rumors that suggest no launch company is actually taking SpaceX Expresses plan seriously. One launch facility manager we spoke told us on the condition of anonymity, that SpaceX had approached them about booking launch time and were denied. When asked why the company was denied launch privileges the manager said "" We never turn down any serious inquiries into a possible business relationship, however, Spacex made demands that this facility could never provide. Nor could any other."" One of the demands was that the launch facility build, supply, staff and maintain a ""space bar"" at the launch facility. Another condition was that the launch facility be liable for anything that went wrong with the launch once the rocket was on the pad."
7,Cebu dancing inmates like Michael Jackson,news-society," Not so long ago on the Internet appeared creative photos and videos that amazed people from all countries. They were materials about prisoners dancing. In 2007 they made a real performance of mass prison dance to a song of Michael Jackson's «Thriller». This video on You Tube collected 50 million of hits. It was a record. Admittedly, a spectacle of prison dance when the 1,500 inmates dancing in unison, could’t not to produce a sensation on the Internet, especially considering the owner of an advertising campaign You Tube, on which all this is housed. Row after row Cebu dancing inmates in bright orange overalls with a large letter P (from the word Prisoner) dance in a single harmony - that is a show! Not surprisingly, after that the prisoners dancing began to attract arriving tourists to personally see the famous performance. Visitors can be photographed with the detainees and buy T-shirts in memory of his visit. Rehabilitation program was to generate income, but, naturally, do not forget about the original highly moral goals of the program. Speaking of Cebu dancing inmates shoes: it was rumored that many prisoners who have had to rehearse for hours just in prison sandals, complained of pain in their legs. But when the prison dance video and creative photos came out in 2007, they became an instant hit, and many people and other prison directors were scratching their heads in bewilderment, wondering how Garcia achieved such results in his prisoners dancing Experiment. Participants in the Philippine version of the show «Celebrity Big Brother» personally came to Cebu dancing inmates to share their skills and experience with this interesting project. Garcia said that it all was a part of the ""revolutionary penology,"" although this was not a new concept. Jeremy Bentham made a circular prison in 1785 where the public could watch the imprisoned; moreover, inmates themselves were unaware of the fact that they were being watched. In the twenty-first century that function was perfectly replaced by You Tube. Some experts have criticized this Cebu dancing inmates method of recovery, while workers of Philippine prison claim that it is an ideal way to encourage prisoners to perfect both physically and morally. Once the interesting photos and video on the Michael Jackson's song «Thriller» conquered the Internet audience, prison director decided to make new music videos on hits in his rehabilitation program. Now they dance on «In the Navy» and «YMCA»."
8,What is the history of Earth Day? EPA Planet Polls,news-society," What is the history of Earth Day? EPA Planet Polls. According to Gaylord Nelson Earth Day worked because of spontaneous response at the grassroots level. Thirty-five years before Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth made global warming a household term and the green movement went mainstream, some 20 million people across the United States celebrated the first Earth Day, on April 22, 1970. Today, more than 1 billion people around the world take part in the event. Earth Day History Until that time, protecting the planet's natural resources was not part of the national political agenda.  Factories pumped pollutants into the air, lakes and rivers with few legal consequences, big, gas-guzzling cars were considered a sign of prosperity and few Americans were familiar with recycling.  Senator Gaylord Nelson, a Democrat from Wisconsin who was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1962, was determined to wake up the federal government to the fact that the earth was at risk.  In 1969, Nelson, considered one of the leaders of the modern environmental movement, developed the idea for Earth Day. Nelson announced the Earth Day concept at a conference in Seattle in the fall of 1969 and invited the entire nation to get involved. As he later recalled: ""The wire services carried the story from coast to coast. The response was electric. It took off like gangbusters. Telegrams, letters and telephone inquiries poured in from all across the country. The American people finally had a forum to express its concern about what was happening to the land, rivers, lakes and air—and they did so with spectacular exuberance."" Dennis Hayes, a young activist who had served as student president at Stanford University, was selected as Earth Day's national coordinator, and he worked with an army of student volunteers and several staff members from Nelson's Senate office to organize the project. According to Nelson: ""Earth Day worked because of the spontaneous response at the grassroots level. We had neither the time nor resources to organize 20 million demonstrators and the thousands of schools and local communities that participated. That was the remarkable thing about Earth Day. It organized itself."" On April 22, rallies were held in Philadelphia, Chicago, Los Angeles and ""most other American cities,"" according to the Environmental Protection Agency. ""In fact, 80 percent of all observances were urban affairs."" In New York City, Mayor John Lindsay closed off a portion of Fifth Avenue to traffic for several hours and spoke at a Union Square rally with actors Paul Newman and Ali McGraw. In Washington, D.C., thousands of people listened to speeches and performances by singer Pete Seeger and others and Congress went into recess so its members could speak to their constituents at Earth Day events. The first Earth Day was effective at raising awareness about environmental issues and impacting public attitudes. According to the Environmental Protection Agency: ""Public opinion polls indicate that a permanent change in national priorities followed Earth Day 1970"".  When polled in May 1971, 25 percent of the U.S. public declared protecting the environment to be an important goal, a 2,500 percent increase over 1969.""  Today, it is hard to recall that most conservation organizations were uninvolved in lobbying against pollution in the 1960s -- not seeing what it had to do with wildlife -- and most urban-oriented groups were dismissive of the ""birds and squirrels"" groups.) By the end of 1970, the linkage was clear to all, and the next few years amply demonstrated the political power of their combined forces. During the 1970s, a number of important pieces of environmental legislation were passed, among them the Clean Air Act, the Water Quality Improvement Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. Another key development was the establishment, in December 1970, of the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, which was tasked with protecting human health and safeguarding the natural environment—air, water and land. Before the agency was founded, ""the federal government was not structured to make a coordinated attack on the pollutants that harm human health and degrade the environment,"" according to EPA dot-gov. Earth Day 1990 When the National Earth Day Committee evaluated potential sponsors for the 20th anniversary of Earth Day, only SEVEN companies in the United States made the grade. To get past the screening committee and become a sponsor, a company had to demonstrate a proven commitment to environmental values.  If a company had not endorsed the Valdez Principles (now called Ceres)- a set of 10 rules - governing its behavior - it had to introduce a major corporate environmental program developed in conjunction with Earth Day Staff. ""No polluters were allowed,"" , said Maureen Early, a spokeswoman at the National Earth Day Committee in Palo Alto, California. A research firm donated its services, so the group had access to the environmental records of companies.  Early declined to name those that did not qualify, but said about 100 companies called the group.  ""We wanted to include corporations that are environmentally responsible and progressive,"" said Christina Dresser, executive director of the The National Earth Day Committee. As a result, the committee chose only seven corporations to be the official sponsors: Shaklee Corporation, Aveda Corporation, Church and Dwight Co. Inc., California Energy Inc., (a supplier of geothermal energy), Conservatree (recycled paper), and Smith and Hawken (a garden accessory supplier) Dennis Hayes, who now was the chairman of the 20th anniversary of Earth Day, warned consumers against being wooed by companies with slick public relations messages that tout environmental concerns.  In a magazine published by Environmental Action Inc., he stated ""If polluting corporations have the temerity to wrap themselves in the Earth Day flag, then they should be held accountable to the public by making concrete changes in business practices or suffer public exposure."" As the 20th anniversary of Earth Day approached, conditions seemed ripe to take Earth Day to an international audience. Ozone depletion, climate change, threats to the world's oceans, and other trans-boundary issues were receiving more media attention. A successful Earth Day could be instrumental in encouraging heads of state to personally attend the forthcoming UN Earth Summit in Brazil, and vote on behalf of several important conventions. Hayes, by then an attorney, took leave from his law firm to serve as the full-time Chair and CEO. Senator Nelson, then Counselor to the Wilderness Society, agreed to serve as Honorary Chair, and he pursued an extensive speaking schedule on behalf of the event. As stated, Christina Desser was Executive Director, while Mark Dubois and Teresa McGlashin co-directed international outreach. By April, 1990, events had been organized in 141 countries. Estimates of participants around the world ranged as high as 200 million. Earth Day 2000+ In 2000, Earth Day focused on clean energy and involved hundreds of millions of people in 184 countries and 5,000 environmental groups, according to EDN. Activities ranged from a traveling, talking drum chain in Gabon, Africa, to a gathering of hundreds of thousands of people at the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Today, the Earth Day Network collaborates with over 17,000 partners and organizations in 174 countries. According to EDN, more than 1 billion people are involved in Earth Day activities, making it ""the largest secular civic event in the world."" Earth Day '70: What It Meant, by Gaylord Nelson [EPA Journal - April 1980] excerpt ""In the 1970s, a sufficiently large and dispersed group of people recognized the fragility and finite nature of the Earth's ecosystem, understood that everything is connected to everything else, and accepted the responsibility not only to set straight the mistakes of the past but to avoid repeating them in the future. So long as the human species inhabits the Earth, proper management of its resources will be the most fundamental issue we face. Our very survival will depend upon whether or not we are able to preserve, protect and defend our environment. We are not free to decide about whether or not our environment ""matters."" It does matter, apart from any political exigencies. We disregard the needs of our ecosystem at our mortal peril. That was the great lesson of Earth Day. It must never be forgotten.""  Senator Nelson (D-Wis.) proposed Earth Day '70."
9,Why Donald Trump Must Run For President,news-society," Our Government has now grown too large and too complex for any ""politician"" to manage.  As we have seen for a long time now, our Presidents just can’t seem to handle all the problems that our country has been facing. That’s because America’s major problems are mostly business problems that require the expert knowledge of a superstar Business Manager who has already been there, done that - and has a long record of success. We have people like that in America, plenty of them. The job of President has grown way past the capabilities of the politician who has to learn on the job, after being elected, when it is than too late. We have seen too many huge mistakes from our Presidents, that are dragging this country down. Even our politicians are now talking about ""can America survive?"" We need to elect a different kind of President, and fast. We need a President who has spent his entire life successfully managing and solving complex business and organizational problems, a President who has the training and experience to solve these problems, and a President that has been a successful business manager and now wants to give back to the country that he/she loves. Up to now, our Presidents needed only one skill: To learn the technique of being elected and re-elected. That skill has now proven to be totally inadequate for our modern and complex times. We need to select a new kind of leadership for our country. Somehow, our Presidents have decided that it's not their job to waste their time on all that technical stuff, that's the job of technical experts. After all, it's not the President's job to learn how to create jobs for the people, how to reduce the skyrocketing medical expenses, how to increase our exports, how to control the banks so they don’t blackmail us into giving them billions of dollars, or how to reduce our obscene debt, and so many of those other technical things like that. That's the job for the technical experts, who will tell us what to do. It's not my job. I was not trained for that kind of stuff. Instead, I have to spend all my time on figuring out how to be elected and re-elected. After all, I need to continue to be the President. That's my most important thing to concentrate on. It is now very clear, we need a President who has the training and experience to successfully managing a large, diverse business organization, and who has demonstrated the ability and knowledge to solve complex business problems. We need to modernize our government, with modern tools of management techniques and dedicated professional managers, including electing the right kind of President who already has the skills needed to solve major problems facing America. America has now grown beyond merely a ""politician"" as our President. We need to enter the 21st century and get a professional Business Manager to be our President. We need a person like Donald Trump who has the experience to apply strong business solutions to solve our nation’s problems. Even if Trump looses, America will still win. Donald Trump will have created a new set of criteria for selecting our President – finding the right Business Manager to be our President. Forget the Politicians, they have always screwed thing up. We never seem to know what the President will do, or what his agenda will be, until after they get into the Whitehouse, and than get us into deep dodo. The Politician’s primary goal is to be elected and re-elected. Or in many cases, to implement their hidden agenda. Whereas, the Business Manager’s primary goals are simple: solve problems, build the business, and satisfy the customers. In recent years, our Presidents have pushed their own political agenda, while blaming the other political party for any mistakes and ignoring the heavy problems facing America. The President’s agenda seems to be all about having wars, reducing our social security, lowering taxes for the rich, sending our young to war so fast that their equipment is unsafe, not helping the victims of Katrina, blaming the other politicians for not getting things done for America, telling us how great they will be when they become President – while meanwhile they send our jobs to China, run up our debt to obscene heights, borrow the money from China, let OPEC and oil speculators run up the price of oil, allow the banks to blackmail our government, than give the banks Billions of dollars, while the President is secretly allowing the American Dollar to be replaced in the future by an International Dollar (this secret plan is being spearheaded by China), the result of which will drastically lower the value of the US Dollar and cause a historic downturn in the American Way of Life, forever. We need Donald Trump as our next President to get these problems solved. Otherwise our President will delay, spin, blame the other guy, push the solutions onto our children, or just plain do nothing until it is too late. Save America. We need an experienced and proven Business Manager as our President, not a politician."
10,Tips to Protect Your Children from Online Identity Theft,news-society," Children are the most innocent creatures on earth, and ill-minded and manipulative crooks can take advantage of this innocence. The most evil advantage which is freely taking place in the fast pace of the progressing modern era is ""online identity theft"". The thieves keep a check on personal information of children using credit cards and other personal information for the theft, as they are the easiest prey. Many parents are not aware of the risks factors that are included while facilitating the kids with modern technologies. The Identity theft protection is the crucial step which should be initiated by the parents to savor themselves and their kids from this social stigma. The best way to protect your children is to teach them the value of privacy right from the beginning. Give them a detailed description of the cons of putting their personal private information on the web. Show them the importance of keeping their private information such as passwords, PIN numbers, bank account and credit card details and Social Security Numbers to themselves. This is one tip that is not limited to children; rather it should be applied to everyone, regardless of their age. Never carry your Social Security Card in your wallet or use the number anywhere on the web unless the site is encrypted or if it is really necessary. This tip is universal and applies to everyone. Another major way to protect your child online is to encourage them to use strong and secure passwords.  Passwords that are easily presumed such as their names, date of birth or pets should be discouraged. Also, for children that have PIN numbers, it would be prudent to change the number on occasion. An identity theft monitoring service alerts, monitors, and helps web surfers in managing online reputation by protecting personal information on the internet. It sends you alerts if too much personal information about your children such as Social security number, address, photos, phone number and full name or any other personal private information is found about them online. In addition, it also detects misuse of their identity, stops unwanted catalog and mail spam, enables browser privacy using easy to install plug-ins, cookie removal tools, and more."
11,Extra Precautions Needed for Florida Pedestrians,news-society," A new Florida Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles Traffic Statistics Report reveals a startling number of pedestrians injured by motor vehicles. Walkers, bikers and hikers need to take extra precautions, especially if they are Florida residents. The Florida Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles Traffic Statistics Report states that 502 pedestrians were killed in Florida car accidents across the state in 2008 alone. A further study shows that the most dangerous areas in Florida for pedestrians are Orlando/Kissimmee, Tampa/St. Petersburg and the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area. A study by Transportation for America reported that, though the national average for pedestrian deaths is 1.26 per 100,000 people, Florida averages almost 2.5 times that amount or 3.02 pedestrian deaths per 100,000 people. A possible explanation for this increase in pedestrian death is the current recession and cutbacks that are taking place. More people are using walking and biking as a form of transportation. Also, Florida’s rapid growth in population adds to the problem. Every day, more people are becoming Florida residents and safety features like bike paths and sidewalks are becoming less of a priority. The state of Florida is focusing on trying to keep up with the increase in traffic instead. Due to the fact that pedestrians are at such an increased risk, it is important to follow certain safety tips. It is always important to wear bright or light colored clothing that has reflective material on it. If an individual is walking or riding a bicycle at night, reflectors need to be present and a flashlight should be carried. Always make sure to walk on sidewalks and never wear headphones or talk on a cell phone. It is always important to be aware of the surroundings and keep all senses open and active. Always cross streets at designated crosswalks and look before crossing. Simple tips and tools like these can help ensure a safe trip for all Florida pedestrians."
12,Federal Budget Affects Pulse Oximeter,news-society," The budget show down the United States saw firsthand the week of April 8th. While congress members and members of the White House were fighting over various bullet points, over a million people were waiting anxiously to see what would happen. The shutdown of the government of course meant the furlough of non-essential federal government employees, but it also meant that the many business designed to serve the federal government would also be shut down for the time being. This includes anything from government contractors to the local deli that serves a federal agency. The ripple effect of a shutdown would have been very broad, and many people believed it would truly slow down the economic growth of this country. The momentum of the economy is very fragile at this time, and a small negative effect could throw the balance right off. One program that was in the hot seat for debate was Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood is a program designed to help low income women with health services related to birth control, mammograms, and various women related health check-ups. The two parties of congress were in gridlock over how abortion was being sponsored by this program. Even though this program was only valued at just over 300 million dollars, it tied into other medical programs. Many companies were keeping a close on this particular program, because they wanted to see if its outcome could affect other government sponsored programs. The pulse oximeter industry was one of those industries that were paying attention. The oximetry industry has nothing to do with Planned Parenthood or the abortion debate, but as a whole they do provide oximeters to the medical field as a whole. The government purchases thousands of pulse oximeters every year for both research and medical supply uses. A pulse oximeter, sometimes known as a pulse ox by some medical professionals, is a medical device which is used to get both the blood oxygen saturation and pulse rate of a patient. A pulse oximeter might not be a device that people first think about, but it is a crucial tool to the medical field. A pulse oximeter comes in various forms from a fingertip unit, a hand held unit, and a tabletop unit. Each type serves the same function though. Most clinical settings will use a tabletop unit because it can store more information within the unit, while people on the go will stick to either the fingertip or hand held pulse oximeter. A government shutdown affects various industries that are not all federal."
13,On level: a metaphorical adventure by way of the thoughts,news-society," I really contemplate about thought-provoking and attractive items as taking the actual audience with a trek beside me as a result of my mind. In the act you will find signposts along with simple guidelines of their very own awareness not to mention stuffs that that they have presumed, heard, thought, in addition to wondered, reinvigorating those things for them along with calming these individuals that we are certainly not leading all of them into a cul-de-sac, the fact that the journey is always someplace new. Of course, if I'm engaging them in onward motion, from a common location to an unfamiliar location, I have to achieve it using outstanding language as well as various other attention-getting factor in which transfixes these folks as well as moves them down to their location That will get away from the many formal purpose of the term ""teaching"" but in the best way that's what it truly is, putting out for them on an fascinating as well as interesting means, getting all of them upon an helpful excursion. Since there is something you want them to figure out which they didn't realize or didn't know they understood when they sat down in their seats. I would never ever take advantage of the statement 'teaching"" (rhymes together with preaching) in case for hardly any other purpose than whenever brand-new suggestions are disseminated via teaching  (or perhaps speechifying or perhaps discussion), men and women appear to have a strong in-born safeguard towards them. The actual comedy experience is comparable to none alternative though. People appear in just to hear a person chatter and count on the best time - you won't want to teach them or even actually tell them what direction to go - merely captivate these people and ultimately place thoughts into their imagination, when they think about the actual hilarity from it all, you've honestly developed the real notion. And they exit believing, that is certainly a motivating controversy -- as good as in case you advise them to look at some thing a way. And once I'm standing on platform - there is absolutely no reason for becoming tense : actually almost all I am engaging in is actually referring to my encounters as well as sketching understandings and ideas with the target audience who may or may not recognize. However certainly not teach, in no way preach, under no circumstances make-believe that you have got a good single concept what you're speaking about. Because that may backfire as well as no person would want to discover what you really need to claim. Therefore love your own practical experience conversing with the audience. Hold dear the actual occasions exactly where these people laugh as well as agree with you, that's when you empathize. However when you're in front of an audience and you get them to smile on the brand-new concept, you are directing their  becoming for the moment. No one is ever before much more herself or themselves compared to when they actually laugh. Their own protection are generally straight down. It is extremely Zen-like, this minute. They are really completely open, absolutely by themselves when which concept hits the brain understanding that guffaw commences. This is when brand-new tips can be incorporated. When a completely new notion falls inside immediately, it features a chance to develop. Therefore for that moment, that tiny second, I own them. That is one of the matter I seek out by following this kind of course. To be able to claim: cease with your tracks and look at this"
14,The Muslim Brotherhood in the Middle East,news-society," As the United States and its allies struggle to get to grips with its new challenges in the Middle East and North Africa, pundits, scholars and journalists have combed every inch of the Muslim Brotherhood’s history for clues to what might happen in the event the movement takes control over the region. The most important figure of Muslim Brotherhood since its establishment in 1928 is the writings of a long dead Egyptian Muslim scholar called Sayyid Qutb (1906-66). Outside the Muslim world, he remains virtually unknown, yet he has been cited as the figure that has most influenced al-Qaida leaders namely, Usama Bin Ladin and Dr. Anwar al-Zawahiri. Sayyid Qutb is considered a prominent figure in the development of Jihadi Salafi ideology; born in a slum area along the Nile Valley, in Egypt, and enjoyed both Western and Islamic education, a typical background for a modern-day jihadist intellectual. His major influential work among the Muslim population is Ma’alim fil Tariq or Milestones on the Road.  Sayyid Qutb was accused of trying to overthrow the government of Nasser and subsequently executed in 1966. Qutb is regarded as the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood; he argued that Islam is the religion of the whole universe and that Islamic Sharia and the spiritual principles of the Quran, should be the law governing the universe. He labels the West as ""jahiliyya"" or ignorant of the law of Allah, and argues that a true Muslim would be rejecting his God if he obeys any man-made government and its laws. He argues that the false gods of the Muslims living in the United States would be the President, Congress, Supreme Court, and the Constitution which empowers them. According to Qutb, a Muslim cannot serve Allah alone if he acknowledges the authority of Western institutions (jahili). Sayyid Qutb refused to recognize the doctrine of separation of religion and state; he claimed that Muslims who abide by man-made laws, such as the U.S. Constitution, will be unable to share Islamic relationships with fellow Muslims because of the doctrine of Separation. He called for the establishment of Islamic Sharia for the Muslim community everywhere they are found, and use their utmost to convert others to Islam. He claimed that secular constitutions restrict the faith of Islam, and inevitably, there will be a conflict between the demands of Western governments and Islam. He said a true Muslim living in the West is not free to serve his God because he has to live by man-made laws and recognize their authority instead of God’s law represented by the Islamic sharia. Qutb concludes the West will be destroyed from within because of its lack of spiritual values, and will inevitably be eclipsed by a more superior civilization of Islam. So what makes Muslim Brotherhood and Sayyid Qutb so popular in the Arab world? To answer this question, one has to look in the state of affair in the Middle East and the history of the Arab peoples after the eclipse of the Ottoman Empire following World War I. The collapse of the Ottoman Empire was a setback to Sunni Muslims in the Middle East; they constitute more than eighty-five percent of the Muslim population, worldwide. The Ottoman Empire was a symbol of political and theological unity of Islam. The Ottoman Sultan was political as well as Caliph, or religious leader for the Muslims. That position of the Sultan disappeared to be ushered into the era of nation-states in the region, and the independence of the Arab states, each having its own political leader and a mufti for the republic or monarchy. In 1924, the position of the Caliph was abolished by Turkish leader, Kamal Ataturk. That position was as important to Sunni Muslims as is the pope for the Catholics. Until 1924, the Sultan was the Caliph of all Muslims; he was assisted by one mufti for the Empire. Additionally, Ataturk, closed the traditional religious schools and abolished Islamic Sharia; veiling of women were officially discouraged, Western clothing for men and women were encouraged and Western calendar was adopted to replace Islamic calendar. New civil, commercial, and penal codes based on European models were adopted. A new civil code ended Islamic polygamy and divorce and introduced a new civil marriage code. New Turkish alphabet modified after Latin, replaced the Arabic alphabet, the language of the Quran. Islamic call for prayer and public reading of the Quran required being in Turkish rather than Arabic. Women were given right to vote and right to hold office, Sunday was adopted as legal weekly holiday instead of Friday and the Westernization process of Turkey began. As a result of all these and many other changes, Turkey became a secular state. Such changes were seen by the Muslim population in the Middle East and North Africa as being taken under  Western influence and do not comply with Islamic sharia. In 1928, the Muslim Brotherhood (al-Ikhwan al-Muslimeen Movement) was established. Following the independence of the states in the Middle East and North Africa, every constitution of these states contains provisions stating that Islam is the religion of the state and Islamic sharia is the source law. Among all these states, only Lebanon and Turkey have no such provisions. In the Egyptian Parliamentary elections in December 2005, Islamic Brotherhood Movement increased its presence in Parliament five-fold. The goal of the Movement is to utilize democracy to gain a majority in the elections in order to implement Islamic sharia as the law of the land. Muslim Brotherhood has the potential to take over every single state in the Middle East and North Africa and enforce Islamic sharia as Sayyid Qutb saw it."

16,Are Your Potential Dates Worth Your Time?,news-society," 1st dates are similar to a chess online game. People are generally tactical, challenging and can be a whole lot of fun should you be ready and know very well what that you are doing. The two players amongst players of initial date have a single aim, and it is to figure out who the other person is prior to they understand who you are usually. The reward: Judgment! This game of dating chess is quite very simple, but it is an imperfect program. In this era where everybody is exaggerating realities or making up fabrications to look much better than they really are, how can you discover you happen to be making the right viewpoints, or just being bamboozled? General questions like, ""where do you work?"" or, ""what do you choose to do for entertainment?"" I have been quizzed on every initial date since the start of time. Perfect practice can make perfect, being serial daters we have been trained, by means of a lot of practical experience, to normally give the same exact and perfect reply. This is why we've second and 3rd dates. Little by little most people chip apart at the individual until finally we bust them down and figure out their heart. This requires, time, money, and a whole bunch of hard work - most of it likely to trash. I have the solution. After many years of personal experience, clinical relationship investigation, and experimentation, I have come up with my very own series of questions that may help you grasp this game of dating finding. These kinds of inquiries can help you determine the personality of your date in a disarming, entertaining and roundabout approach throughout the initial 30 minutes in the date. Ask these types of questions, and then no-longer will you need to spend your time, money or effort on extensive slow initial dates, unstable next dates, or stressful third dates. You should understand the persona you are managing, their beliefs, determination, and who they really are fundamentally beneath the fake outside they have been brainwashed to represent. Are you ready to change your love life ceaselessly? You can easily thank me afterwards. Should your career awarded you just one years worth of compensated sabbatical, what would you do with that year? (This question challenges his schooling, and his enthusiasm in daily life.) If he doesn’t understand what sabbatical would mean, he’s not informed. Sabbatical is a concept you cannot fake. He either knows just what it means or he doesn’t. And then depending on his solution, you'll know their aspirations (i.e. starting their own firm), daring (journey across the globe), or uninteresting (he’ll have no idea of what to state). If your home was burning down and you could simply grab the one thing that was NOT alive, what would certainly that thing be? (This particular question assesses her morals and beliefs.) Is she a emotional individual? If that's so she is going to get her photo album. A materialistic man or woman? She will snap up her pocket book and cellphone. A accountable person? She could pick up her crucial papers. Or untroubled? The lady will snap up nothing. What's the largest false impression some individuals have of you? This question is regarded as the most disarming questions of them all. He is going to consider the immediate effect you might have of him, and destroy it. His response will be the truth, and you will know precisely what his inner thoughts are just like internally. Tell me an awkward point in time. This kind of query checks his abilities to be open and the capacity to have a good time.. If he tells you an incredibly stunning story without difficulty, look out! He may perhaps be an extroverted party animal. In case he tells you a middle of the road story and must look at it in advance, he's most likely level headed, secure, and ordinary. In case he cannot think about anything at all or lets you know something boring, he's likely a traditional person without lots of excitement in his life, or maybe he is timid and tries to stay away from risky situations. Bear in mind, with most of these questions there are no incorrect replies, good answers, or poor answers. Only responses. These kinds of answers will possibly work for your individuality, or they wont. Do not decide, just examine and classify them in mind determined by his or her replies. These questions could save you time, dollars, and hard work. They are different enough to be disarming, and disarming enough to be resolved with simple fact. Another special benefit is always that these questions are original, and will cause your date to adore you a lot more. The person who requests these kinds of queries is in control, and has all the power. Try these inquiries on your up coming 1st date or maybe on your present mate and take pleasure in the outcomes. You will be blown away at what you uncover."
17,America Has A Choice To Make,news-society," The First Amendment of the Constitution states: ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."" The genesis and purpose of the First Amendment, as it pertains to religion, was to protect people and churches from the State, not the other way around. But the Christian underpinnings of America can not be allowed to stand if the Left is going to reach its objective of making America a godless nation that places man’s baser instincts above the holy Word of God. The end result? No-fault-divorce, abortion, gay marriage, all manner of financial support for those who can but will not work, schools that no longer teach but rather indoctrinate, and another generation of statists who believe free higher education, a high paying job, and a luxury home are ""rights."" And the list goes on. Through an evolution pursued by liberal Progressives and sanctified by a Supreme Court that all too often plays politics, the clear intentions of our Founding Fathers has morphed into ""the separation of church and state,"" a phrase not found in the Constitution. The hypocrisy of the Left is mind-numbing. They demanded the State neuter Christians, and then turned the Constitution on its head to do so. Hence we have the invention of subjective ""hate speech"" that discourages pastors from speaking the Word of God from the pulpit on subjects like homosexuality. This denies our right to free speech and exercise of our religious beliefs. Worse yet, while they are demanding to be ""shielded"" from our country’s Christian foundation, they, in contradiction to the First Amendment, have imposed a religion on the rest of us. It’s called secular humanism. They are as devoted to their ""religion"" as we are to ours. We worship at the altar of Almighty God. They worship at the altar of the State. There is a dynamic confrontation taking place and in the balance is the future of our country. We are at a critical juncture, in every sense. For instance, even most of those on the Left have to admit now that we can no longer sustain the financial irresponsibility we have wallowed in all these many years. What they have trouble admitting is that our tenuous position is in large part because of their quasi-socialist beliefs, one of which is to remove God from every fiber of the tapestry that spells A-m-e-r-i-c-a. Whatever direction we choose, we must choose. As the Bible correctly notes, ""No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon."" (Matthew 6:24 NKJV) When I was a child back in the fifties we were taught right from wrong. Now children are taught that the world is made up of gray areas. Such muddling allows secular humanism to trump the Word of God, which then allows all manner of perversions as well as the death of common sense. Making the point, government strongly encouraged, and ultimately demanded that banks make housing loans to virtually everyone, some of who had no job. Even worse, in some cases the mortgages were in excess of the home’s value. Common sense says you can’t make immediately underwater loans to people without the ability to repay without substantial negative repercussions - but our government said not to worry, they would insure any loss. Citizens bought the lie, forgetting that we are the government, so the government’s loss is our loss. This is a classic example of robbing Peter to pay Paul. So with bailout after bailout we’ve mortgaged our future with nothing to show for it, except a debt that cannot be paid -- and never will be. Yet the Bible says, ""Owe no one anything except to love one another, for he who loves another has fulfilled the law."" (Romans 13:8) If only we had listened to God! This, of course, is only one example of what happens to a nation that turns its back on the teaching of the one true God. It is ultimately destroyed. How sad that we have stood by and let God be banished from what was once our proud Christian nation. How hypocritical that we call on Him when disaster strikes, as we did in the aftermath of 9/11. Some may say that we have not turned our back on God. But that false claim can be made only by a secular humanist with an agenda. For the rest of us, the standard is simple and direct and disposes of the ""gray-area"" theory that we’ve come to embrace. Jesus said, ""He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters abroad."" (Matthew 12:30) America is either with the Lord or we are against Him. We cannot be lukewarm on this. America cannot set God aside, to be used only in an emergency, for if we do we become His enemy by not standing with Him 24/7. America, as the Bible suggests, is being ""scattered abroad,"" and it’s because we have made the wrong choices. Thankfully God is lovingly longsuffering -- ""The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance."" (2 Peter 3:9) But while the Bible says no one knows when the end will come, we are, in the meantime, playing Russian-Roulette with this country that we love so dearly. Ask yourself this: Is it better for America to be with God or against Him?"
18,"This Week in the Social Networks: Japan, St. Patrick’s Day and Rebecca Who?",news-society," Teens have had a lot to talk about on the social network this week. If you thought your teen had intense mood swings before, the events from this week have caused a mixture of emotions from sadness and fear followed by excitement and confusion all within a few days of one another. First, the tragic earthquake in Japan has caused many teens to tweet their regrets and concerns for the current suffering of those affected. The massive, 8.9 magnitude earthquake struck last week causing nearly 3,700 counted deaths with 8,000 people still missing. The event left 434,000 Japanese citizens homeless and currently seeking refuge in shelters. Teens have been deeply affected by this awful tragedy and have posted videos, pictures and articles of the events on their Facebooks, with the note that they are praying for its citizens. Teens in California and Hawaii have been directly affected by the events because they caused a threat of tsunamis that left many in a state of panic. Teens are frequently updating their Facebooks with the latest news on the tragedy, including the recent complications with nuclear plants in the country. Though many teens are caught up in the Japan tragedy, the NCAA Basketball Tournaments offer a pleasant distraction for everyone– including the President himself. The Men’s Tournament is scheduled to kicked-off on Thursday, March 17th. Teen sports fanatics have been tweeting on their Twitter what their own tournament bracket predictions with a majority tending to favor Ohio State winning the championship. However, Obama had a slightly different prediction, announcing recently that he believes the Kansas University Jayhawks will take home the title. Teens this week were also excitedly preparing for the Saint Patrick’s Day Holiday on the 17th and the festivities planned for this weekend. Chances are, your teen daughter has already used the occasion as an excuse to beg you for that adorable green top at the mall that she’s been eying for weeks. Many communities are planning fun, family-friendly activities this weekend as well, such as parades, live Irish music performances, Irish dancing shows and plenty of food and games for everyone. This would be the perfect time for you to bribe your teen with that new top if she spends some time with the family at one of these events. On YouTube this week, the new music video for the song ""Friday"" by 13-year-old pop music artist Rebecca Black has gone viral with over nine and a half million views in the last six days. Rebecca Black seems to be a good candidate for the girl version of Justin Bieber. However, the video has many people wondering ""Wait, is this a joke?"" The song may be filled with vapid and insipid lyrics (with one verse repeating just the words ""partying"" and ""fun"" over and over), but it’s definitely catchy. Anyway, if it’s caused this much of a stir, someone must have been doing something right. This week has certainly been eventful, but it’s sure to calm down soon now that teens are back in school again after a long Spring Break. This means more family dinners at home and after reading this article, you should all have plenty to talk about."
19,Summarized: The Four Articles Published by Orszag In the NY Times,news-society," The New York Times has provided an exciting opportunity for Peter Orszag, who has been a guest columnist producing at least four articles about the economy from September 2010. Each subject matter, which aimed to inform the paper’s readers about a different matter that the government was facing, showed the expert’s perspective on what Congress should do to ensure economic prosperity for the nation as a whole. In the first article, published at the beginning of September, Orszag focused on the dangers of the deficit, and why it was important to reinforce tax cuts from the Obama’s predecessor, George W Bush, for a further two years. He also discussed the advantages to this passionately and in more detail, saying: ""Higher taxes now would crimp consumer spending, further depressing the already inadequate demand for what firms are capable of producing at full tilt."" Thanks to Orszag’s expertise as the Director for the Office of Management and Budget in the Obama administration, it’s hard to find an expert better-placed for such cutting analysis than Orszag. The second article in The New York Times, which was also published in September, instead focused on how increasing healthcare costs were affecting the level of investment that state government were placing into higher education. This meant that many parents were not realizing how the quality of their children’s future in colleges and universities were being affected by the spiraling costs of Medicaid. The article was called ‘A Health Care Plan for Colleges’, and also uncovered exclusive research that was conducted in association with Tom Kane. In the article, he said: ""Governments’ general support for higher education 25 years ago was nearly 50 percent greater than state spending on Medicaid. That relationship has now flipped: Medicaid spending is about 50 percent greater than support for higher education."" The third article focused on medical malpractice, and how a golden opportunity to reform the laws that currently make doctors susceptible to lawsuits had been missed. Explaining why this was important, Peter Orszag explained in his guest column: ""Too many doctors order unnecessary tests and treatments only because they believe it will protect them from a lawsuit."" To conclude, the last article mainly endeavored to talk about how the Republicans were against part of the healthcare reform measures that actually had the opportunity to save money – reducing the level of impact that initiatives such as Medicare had on the deficit."
20,Bomboniere in Italy and favors all over the world,news-society," In Italy the tradition of giving ""bomboniere"" (favors) to guests is very widespread, but also in other countries this tradition is catching on. Although the term ""bomboniera"" comes from French, we can claim that the tradition of giving guests favors to remind them of marriages, baptisms, first communions and other important events in a person’s life, is typically Italian. The word ""bomboniera"", indeed, comes from ""bombonnière"", a French term that in the 18th century stand for a finely decorated little box that contained sweets (""bon-bon"" in French), but in Italy wedding couples used to exchange little gifts containing sweets even in the 15th century, although these gifts were not called ""bomboniere"" yet. Throughout centuries this tradition has certainly changed and become popular also in other countries, but we can claim that ""bomboniere"" have always been a typically Italian tradition. In the beginning they were given to guests only in case of weddings, and in this sense they began to be popular also in France in the 18th century. The tradition of using ""bomboniere"" also for other important events, from baptisms to graduations ceremonies, from first communions to confirmations, spread in Italy only later on, most notably after the Second World War, and this tradition is still very popular. Although ""bomboniere"" belong above all to the Italian cultural heritage, we cannot deny that similar habits are widespread or are becoming popular also in many other cultures and countries, especially as far as wedding gifts are concerned. In Greece, for example, favors are already part of local habits, while in countries like Portugal, Ireland, Great Britain and the States, but also in Africa and Australia, the interest in them is increasing. The types of favors and the way they are given to guests change according to the country and to the habits that are already set in that country. In the States and in England, for example, people use placeholders that are also little gifts for the guests, while the traditional favors used in Switzerland are simple red handkerchiefs. Also in other more ""exotic"" places the tradition of giving gifts during wedding ceremonies is popular: in Malaysia, for example, guests are given decorated hard-boiled eggs, while in Japan, a country where guests are very important, wedding couples usually offer precious gifts called ""Hikidemono"", as well as steamed buns stuffed with beans called ""kohaku manjyhu"". In China wedding couples do not give objects to their guests: they offer cups of tea to the most ancient gusts as a sign of respect. Italian ""bomboniere"" cannot be separated from sugared almonds (in Italian they are called ""confetti""), which accompany all types of favors. To each event corresponds a different color of almonds, and their number can vary, although it always has to be odd. However, this does not happen only in Italy; also in Greece and France, indeed, wedding favors are often accompanied by five sugared almonds or only by almonds."

1,Real Madrid helps save the planet,news-society," The annual Earth Hour took place last Saturday all over the world, when hundreds of buildings of 4,500 cities in 135 countries worldwide switched off their lights as a symbol of the fight against climate change which affects everybody and everywhere. Madrid was one of the cities which wanted to participate in this awareness campaign and give support to the World Wildlife Fund, the entity which promotes the event. Therefore, the most emblematic buildings of the city turned off their lights. Cibeles, the Royal Palace and Escorial Palace amongst others were left in darkness. So, Real Madrid stadium which is much more than a football stadium but one of the most representative buildings of the city, couldn't miss such an important appointment to help make people conscious of the terrible effects of global warming and CO2 emissions. You might wonder why is Santiago Bernabeu so emblematic. I think a little of its history about it might help you. This stadium, previously named Chamartin, is the son of a group of players who moved to a vacant lot next to the old Madrid bullring in 1901 and created a football team. In 1912, they turned yet another vacant lot on O'Donnell Street into the best football pitch in Madrid which was turned into a small stadium in 1924, where the team played for more than 20 years. The president at that time, Santiago Bernabeu,was a very ambitious man and proposed to build a much bigger stadium with capacity for 100,000 fans. Despite the critics which considered this proposal as a Pharaonic undertaking, the new stadium was built on the foundations of the old one and inaugurated in 1947. The new stadium was renamed after the president of the club. The Santiago Bernabeu stadium was refurbished several times - for the 1982 World Cup and once again in the 1990s. But it wasn't until 1998, when the stadium was modernised and gained the acknowledgement of the UEFA who rewarded the Club for its outstanding investment and organisation with the inclusion of the stadium in their list of Elite Stadiums. So, undoubtedly, Santiago Bernabeu is a feature of the city of Madrid and, therefore, attended the worldwide appointment with the Earth Hour. From 20.30 to 21.30, its facade lights, including the billboard with the stadium's name and the Club's centenary dates, and the lights directed at the pitch went off. 30,000 watts on facade lighting and 16,000 watts on pitch light energy were saved after taken part in the Earth Hour."
2,News Ban,news-society," One of the worse things you can do for your positive thinking is to watch, listen and read the News.  I have deliberately not watched the news for over five years now. I believe that all the negativity from the news media, leads people to think that the world is such a dreadful place and that there is a mugger around every corner.  In which case, we should be mugged at least 300 times a year. Friends of mine always states that they have to keep in touch with what is going on in the world and they don’t feel ‘connected’ until they have a coffee and have watched the news on TV.  I just call it an addiction. When I finally gave up watching the news it was like I had tried to give up drugs.  I had the cold turkeys and felt that I was missing out on something.  However, I quickly began to realise that there is more positive stuff going on in the world. Don’t get me wrong there will be more natural and unnatural disasters that we will not have any control over and the most I can do is to be giving of my time, prayer and money to help those made homeless and lost families in need of water, food, and shelter. It is important to help others whenever you can however you can. There will of course be those who say that the world will end in 2012 or that the earth will reclaim what it needs to survive.  They say to expect more disasters and misery leading up to and in 2012.  I’m more optimistic and I tend to throw out that mumbo jumbo stuff as pessimistic nonsense.  There is no doubt that we need to be kinder to the world and each other.   We really don’t need a pending disaster to tell you to love each other as we would love ourselves. The real pain is not being able to tell those people we have lost how we love them. There will always be someone who will tell me what disasters I have missed on the news. I never get over the surprised look on their faces when I say that I didn’t hear about that particular incident. Spending time watching the news is really wasting time. I do believe that we can spend our time more productively than to swamp our minds negative news.  As I say, someone will always find away to bring the negative in to a conversation.  I do turn it around and ask what they are doing to help those in need and how we can work together to make a change to the positive.  It is hard to get someone to look at the positive in every situation when they are tuned in to seeing the negative.  I know that it is hard when you have lost love ones to suddenly start to see the positives.  I just think that we need to recognise that in our grieve, we need to be strong and show respect to those we have lost, by living life to the full and giving to life in the full. I throw down this challenge.  Give up the news for the next 30 days and pay close attention to how you are viewing the world after 30 days.  I can guarantee that you will see more positives in the world than you ever did."
3,"As Japan Recovers, Petya I. Edwards Foundation Sends Charitable Contributions",news-society," After enduring one of the strongest earthquakes on record, multiple subsequent aftershocks, and an incredibly powerful tsunami, survivors in the country of Japan have undergone a horrific and life changing experience that will not be easy to recover from. As the death toll rises, cities lay beneath a blanket of rubble, and survivors continue to search for the food and other resources they need to carry through the rest of their trials, individuals from countries around the world have poured out their hearts and shown their support through donations. Due to the dangerous environment, people are not capable of traveling to Japan to physically help in the rebuilding efforts—though many people would if they had the chance. Instead, those who want to get involved are being asked to send donations of money and other valuable resources through secure charitable organizations. One of these organizations is Petya I. Edwards Foundation, which is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organization located in Dallas, Texas. Dedicated to providing financial and educational assistance to individuals and families who have been afflicted by extenuating circumstances and need a helping hand back to independence, Petya I. Edwards Foundation is contributing the donations it receives to the emergency relief efforts in Japan—a charitable endeavor that certainly falls within the organization's core mission. Money, non-perishable food, bottled water, clothing, blankets, and other non-perishable resources—such as diapers and baby formula—are being accepted by Petya I. Edwards Foundation and sent to Japan as a sign of solidarity, hope, and comfort from the people in the United States. All donations made through Petya I. Edwards Foundation are tax-deductible and appreciated—not matter what their denomination. Whether individuals can contribute five dollars or five thousand dollars, they are providing resources that the Japanese people desperately need. After losing everything—their homes, their families, their friends, and the very lives that they once knew—the survivors of this terrible tragedy need to feel the support of the rest of the world. With the comfort and resources provided by individuals in other parts of the world, those who have already endured indescribable suffering can find the hope and courage to carry on with the recovery process. Every donation counts and every cent will contribute to a better life for someone who just had everything they had ever known pulled from beneath them. To learn more about Petya I. Edwards Foundation and how the organization is helping those in Japan, and how your contribution can help, visit www.pedwards.org or call 214-864-7574. Individuals are also being encouraged to spread the word about the efforts of Petya I. Edwards Foundation and help collect the support of others by joining the Facebook cause ""Help Petya I. Edwards Foundation Provide Relief to Japan."""
4,Justin Singletary: Community Giving,news-society," Justin Singletary—the self-described Real Estate Ranger of Savannah, Georgia—is no stranger to giving to local and national charities, something his clients know full well. A lot of these charities can be traced back to his own military service—his involvement with the Homes for Our Troops organization, for instance. But there are others that are more community-based, and some of them might surprise you. For example, did you know that Real Estate Ranger Justin Singletary has worked with the Big Brothers Big Sisters program in his native Savannah? This community-based mentoring program is one of the most respected youth services in the nation. Essentially what this organization does is encourage and mentor kids—children and youth—by pairing them with grown-up, community volunteers. The ""Littles"" will meet with their adult counterparts regularly, typically two or three times per month, for two or three hours at a time. These unstructured outings revolve around conversations and shared activities—essentially, ways in which the grown-up volunteers can mentor the kids, and let them know that they care. Relationships are formed, and these are truly the building blocks of the program. The Big Brothers Big Sisters program also offers on-site mentoring, wherein adult volunteers meet their Littles at church, school, or community centers, and simply spend time giving them one-on-one focus and attention. The activities may vary, and could include anything from athletics to academic help, but what matters is that friendships are formed, and the lives of the kids (and adults!) are enriched. Justin Singletary is a proud participant in this group, just as he is proud to work with Homes for Our Troops.

5,"Despite Improving Situation in Japan, Still Risk of Radiation Exposure",news-society," The nuclear crisis in Japan may be slowly improving, but we are not completely out of the clear when it comes to radiation exposure. Despite assurances by the U.S. government that there is no real risk of radiation exposure here in North America, fears are continuing to rise over the potential clouds of radioactive fallout (radioactive isotopes) that may travel via jet stream winds and contaminate local areas, especially on the West Coast. Could this really happen? While this is a tough question which experts and authorities are undoubtedly grappling with by the minute, the general answer is yes. If explosions from the damaged nuclear plants in Japan propel radioactive materials into the upper atmosphere, jet stream winds can carry them far and wide, causing cumulative repercussions across the globe. Adding to the anxiety is the general sense that accurate information regarding the severity of this devastating crisis is being kept from the general public, both here and in Japan, to prevent widespread panic. As a result, we’ve seen an enormous demand for the supplement potassium iodine to help protect against radiation exposure, and many West Coast suppliers are now completely out of stock. However, this supplement is not a cure all for radiation-related illnesses, and only protects from thyroid cancer by preventing the thyroid – the organ most vulnerable to radiation — from absorbing radioactive iodine, called iodine-131. The radioactive isotope Cesium-134 has also been leaking from the Japanese reactors in addition to iodine -131, and there is reason to believe that other radioactive isotopes such as Strontium-90 are leaking into the atmosphere as well. It is very important to note that successful thyroid protection with potassium iodine is extremely dependent on timing with regards to such radiation exposure, and even still, will not protect against these other radioactive isotopes. It can also pose problems for people with thyroid issues. Nevertheless, potassium iodine can be an important preventative in this case, but other supplements and foods which are known to remove radioactive isotopes from the body and protect against DNA mutation must be taken as well if the risk of exposure is indeed real. Dangers of Radiation Exposure Radioactive isotope particles, including Iodine-131, Cesium-134, Strontium-90 and others which are present in radioactive fallout, can be inhaled, ingested through radiation-contaminated food and water, and/or deposited onto the skin. Radioactive particles are particularly damaging to DNA, and can easily cause mutations which eventually lead to cancer, birth defects, cardiovascular disease and other life threatening health problems. There are many short term health effects caused by significant exposure as well. Acutely, radioactive isotopes are most damaging to rapidly dividing cells such as those in the intestinal lining, bone marrow, hair and skin, and can cause severe gastrointestinal problems, skin problems, loss of immune and blood cells, hair loss, fatigue, and central nervous damage soon after exposure, depending on the severity. Children are at the highest risk because their cells divide more rapidly than adults. Hope For The Best But Prepare To Protect Our Health It is our hope and prayer that an acute level of exposure, such as what happened with the Chernobyl meltdown, does not occur again in the world. But as Japan’s crisis has pointed out so gravely, we unfortunately live in a nuclear age and therefore need to be prepared to protect ourselves from the related risks if we are going to continue to use this volatile and dangerous source of energy. As a doctor and researcher, I have always been deeply concerned about the health effects of living with nuclear energy. In fact, it was the tragedy of Chernobyl and the subsequent use of pectins to reduce radioactive levels in child victims of this disaster which prompted my original research into the use of modified citrus pectin to chelate radioactive particles and heavy metals.

6,"Rhodesia, The English Village That Was Purpose Built In 1920",news-society," Rhodesia is a small village in the county of Nottinghamshire which is in central England. The English village of Rhodesia shares its name with the country in Southern Africa that was founded by Cecil Rhodes who was a British entrepreneur and politician who was active on southern Africa during the late nineteenth century. The African country has now been reconfigured, split up and renamed Zambia and Zimbabwe. The English village of Rhodesia is around twenty miles from the city of Sheffield. Many English villages have a history that goes back to the Middle Ages and beyond, and a lot of these are mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 which was a survey of land and property of England created for William the Conqueror, who was the King of England at the time. But the village of Rhodesia was established relatively recently, in the year 1920. The village was created to provide a home for the miners working at nearby coal mines, where rich seams of coal had been discovered. These nearby coal mines were the miners worked were the Shireoaks and Steetly Pits. In fact Rhodesia was named after the chairman of the coal mining company that owned and operated the coal mines. The chairman of the mining company was called Mr G Preston Rhodes, who was the chairman of the colliery for many years. So Rhodesia was a specially created village with a specially created name. Indeed even the high street, Tylden Road, was named after the first manager of the Shireoaks Pit. When it was established, the village of Rhodesia had houses only for the miners and their families, and there were no shops. The purpose built houses were pre-fabricated and finished externally with pebble dash. Everything that people needed was delivered by horse and cart to the door of each house. So provisions like meat, fish, vegetables, milk and ice cream where all bought from a travelling merchant. Once a week the residents of the village of Rhodesia would walk along the towpath of the Chesterfield Canal to Shireoaks where they would shop at the Co-op in the town. Then they would walk home with their shopping. The Chesterfield Canal runs beside the village of Rhodesia. The canal is known locally as the 'Cukoo Dyke' and was opened in the year 1777 to transport materials by barge. In the eighteenth century barges sailing on a network of canals were used to transport all kinds of materials around England. Indeed the stone that was used to build the Houses of Parliament, more properly known as the Palace of Westminster, would have passed by the village of Rhodesia, when it was being transported by barge from Rotherham in Yorkshire to London. Today the village of Rhodesia is mainly made up of houses as it has been since it was first built in the year 1920. There around 300 residential properties there now, along with a couple of shops, a chapel, a public house, and a village hall. The A57 road runs beside the village, along with the Chesterfield Canal."
7,China and India Losing Gender Balance Due to Sex-Selective Abortions,news-society," A preference for boys and the availability of ultrasounds for baby sex recognition in China and India is leading to an increasingly serious gender imbalance in these countries, which may bring about a series of other social concerns in the long term. A recent analysis in Canadian Medical Association Journal warns that the male to female ratio in a majority of areas in China and India is likely to exceed the normal 105:100 male to female sex ratio at birth (SRB) by 10 percent to 20 percent in the next 20 years. The analysis pointed out that with the introduction of sonogram technology, the SRB grew to 130:100 in some Chinese provinces in 1992. Data also show a high 125:100 gender disparity in North Indian regions like Punjab, Delhi and Gujarat. While China’s one-child policy is widely criticized by international community for violating human rights and motivating women to have abortions to spare opportunities for having boys, India, the country without such a policy, does not seem to do a good job of stopping women from going to sex-selective abortions. The pattern analysis shows that in both China and India people tend to make sure their second or third baby is a boy if their first or second is a girl. There are concerns over possible social consequences due to the gender imbalance, such as the excess men having difficulty getting married. Experts worry that those who fail to find wives may become psychologically vulnerable, leading to increasing violence and crime. The imbalance will even have an impact on China and India’s economic growth pattern, according to economists. Some point out that as parents feel obligated to earn more social status for their sons, the families with sons tend to have a higher saving rate. The preference for boys may have even influenced families’ consumption patterns and facilitated a boom in some industries such as the property market in China. Many families with boys feel it is highly necessary to buy a house, even though housing prices in many areas have marched far above reasonable or affordable levels. Policy-makers in China and India are making attempts to reduce the imbalance, such as forbidding fetal sex determination. However, people still have a number of ways to find out their baby’s gender before birth. The most essential and helpful method would be strengthening education and reducing the preference for boys that is deep in the culture. Although changes in attitudes towards gender have been taking place in the past 10 years, the high SRB imbalance in the 1990s will still lead to at least a two-decade long overall gender imbalance in China and India. The analysis predicts that people in the two countries will have to wait for several decades to see a normal gender ratio again."
8,Nuclear Radiation Protection Protocol,news-society," As the nuclear crisis escalates in Japan, people across the world but particularly in the US are asking what they can do to protect themselves from exposure to nuclear radiation fallout. Self-medicating with ongoing high doses of potassium iodine is strongly discouraged because of the negative health effects that large doses of this supplement can have on thyroid and overall health. While potassium iodine is useful in the prevention of thyroid cancer from radioactive iodine exposure, high doses are only necessary if there is an imminent threat of acute exposure. It does not protect against other radioactive isotopes that are also present in nuclear fallout. The two single most important compounds that have been clinically and scientifically proven to remove radioactive particles from the body are pectins and alginates, both contained in a modified citrus pectin/ modified alginate formula. In addition there are other botanicals and nutrients that help the body remove radiation and protect DNA . Below is an outline of my recommended protocol for total body defense against all forms of radiation, including nuclear fallout. Protection Protocol and Dosages A prevention and treatment protocol which addresses nuclear radiation exposure requires a multi-dimensional approach, outlined in these key points: If acute radiation exposure is imminent, protect your thyroid from radioactive iodine by taking a one-time high dose of 130 mg of potassium iodine (children take 65mg) no sooner than 24 hours before acute exposure. Iodine lasts in the body for only 24 hours, and taking more than a one-time high dose is not recommended, especially if you have thyroid issues or are sensitive to iodine, unless there is ongoing acute exposure. This supplement works by saturating the thyroid with enough therapeutic iodine, thus preventing absorption of radioactive iodine. Prevent absorption of radioactive particles and remove radioactive isotopes from the body using clinically proven modified citrus pectin (MCP), and a modified citrus pectin/ modified alginate formula. These two supplements contain natural modified pectins, with the latter formula containing additional modified sodium alginates. Pectins and alginates have both been used successfully to treat Chernobyl victims and have been proven to bind to and remove radioactive isotopes such as Cesium-137 and Strontium-90 from the digestive tract and tissues. These formulas have been modified to allow their absorption into the circulatory system, so they can chelate heavy metals and radioactive particles in both the digestive tract as well as in the blood stream. Dosages: MCP/modified alginate formula - start with 3 capsules, twice daily, on an empty stomach, at least a half hour before food. Best taken early morning and before bed. If radiation exposure becomes imminent, increase to 4 capsules, three times a day for as long as there is radiation exposure and for 2-4 weeks thereafter, then reduce to 4 capsules twice daily for one month, followed by 3 capsules, twice daily until there are no traces of radiation readings and damage. Two weeks after starting the MCP/modified alginate formula, follow with a phase two detoxification supplement, which contains botanicals and nutrients such as cilantro, milk thistle, dandelion, selenium, along with sulfur compounds, all of which help the body protect and detoxify from radiation exposure. The use of MCP/modified alginates and a phase two detoxification supplement will help to eliminate heavy metals and toxins as well, which is critical as these harmful pollutants can further aggravate the oxidative stress and DNA damage from radiation exposure. When used withMCP/modified alginate formula, the phase two detox formula will help to support tissue specific detoxification and help the body cope with radiation damage and the intense detox process needed at such times. Dosages: Add the phase two detox formula 3x2/day, with food, 2 weeks after starting MCP/modified alginate formula, and if exposed to radiation, one day after starting MCP/modified alginates. (These dosage recommendations are general recommendations. If you have specific health issues you may want to consult your health provider and modify your protocol accordingly.) Despite all that is going on around us, it is important to keep stress levels to a minimum so that our energy can be used productively to help ourselves and others. For more information about current radiation exposure risks, there are a few websites that are monitoring radiation levels in various parts of the country throughout the day. One of these can be found at www.radiationnetwork.com. Stay tuned for more information as this situation unfolds, and remember to stay calm while keeping yourself and your family healthy and protected."
9,Menthol Cigarette Use Rising Among Teenagers,news-society," The use of menthol cigarettes is rising among adolescents and is ""very high"" among minority youth, a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel said in partial draft report released Monday. Brands like Lorillard's Newport account for nearly one-third of America's $83billion annual cigarette sales, and more and more of those come from minority youth smokers. A draft report by the Food and Drug Administration in Washington found more than half of Hispanic teenage smokers use menthols, and there is a 'significant increase' in white youths smoking them, too. The report is due next week and the FDA has released some draft chapters of the report, but what's been released so far hasn't contained any recommendations about menthol. The report could call for an outright ban on menthol cigarettes or tighter restrictions of some kind. The panel's chairman Jonathan Samet, a professor at the University of Southern California who has studied smoking- related health issues, said ""we intend to provide some sort of overall conclusions and recommendations,"" suggesting the panel won't simply call for more study of the issue. Menthol cigarettes account for about 30% of total cigarette sales in the U.S. The issue is of major importance to Lorillard Inc. (LO) the maker of the leading menthol brand, Newport. The product accounts for roughly 90% of the company's sales. Altria Group Inc. (MO) and Reynolds American Inc. (RIA) also market menthol cigarettes but aren't as reliant on them for overall sales. The FDA was given the authority to regulate tobacco products in 2009. As part of the tobacco law, all tobacco flavorings except for menthol were banned on concerns the flavors entice children and adolescents to start smoking. The law called for an FDA advisory panel to report on the public health effects of menthol in cigarettes. The FDA doesn't have a required deadline or timeline to act on the panel's recommendations. One question the FDA tobacco panel is weighing is whether menthol masks the harshness of tobacco and makes it easier to smoke cigarettes and harder to quit. The tobacco industry has said there’s no evidence that menthol in cigarettes makes it more likely people will start smoking compared to regular cigarettes, and that menthol cigarettes carry the same risks as regular cigarettes. More than 80% of African-American adolescent smokers and more than half of Hispanic smokers ages 12 to 17 use menthol cigarettes. Smoking among teenagers has declined in the past decade. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2009, 19.5% of students in grades nine through 12 reported smoking in the past month, compared with 34.8% in 1999. About 21% of U.S. adults smoke. ""Use of menthol cigarettes if rising among adolescents, driven by a significant increase in the number of white youth ages 12 to 17 who are smoking menthol cigarettes,"" the draft chapter said. Overall smoking among teenagers has declined in the last decade. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2009, 19.5% of students in grades nine through 12 reported smoking in the past month compared to 34.8% in 1999. About 21% of U.S. adults smoke."
10,My President is a good son of a bad family,news-society," ""Democracy is an impossible thing until the power is shared by all, but let not democracy degenerate into mobocracy"" - Gandhi As a Nigerian, before I share my pain with you let it  be known that the followership (all of us Nigerians) is as bad as the leadership and that is because we do not hold the leadership accountable like it is in Europe and America. Starting with a macro economic comparison between Ghana and Nigeria, Ghana foreign reserve is just below 3 billion US Dollars and the GDP of less than 40 Billion US Dollars. On the other hand, Nigeria’s GDP is 320 Billion US Dollars and foreign reserve of almost 40 billion US Dollars.  The euro bond issued by Ghana had a sovereign interest of 6.5% but that of Nigeria was 7.8%. Are you wondering about the wide difference in the interest?  Even though Ghana envies the Nigeria’s bequest of over 200 natural recourses and despite the fact that Nigeria is far richer than Ghana the global financial community has more credibility, respect, and trust for Ghana than the government of my country, the Nigerian government. The holy bible says, ""The hearts of my men are desperately wicked"" the bible did not say hearts of black men but 'men'. In this perspective, the white politicians in Europe and America have the predisposition to be corrupt but majority of them at least have either chosen or compelled to be transparent because the followership holds them accountable. Haven leaved in Europe for many years I now know that the leadership of Nigeria will continue to milk the country dry until the Nigerians themselves say enough is enough as we have seen in the Arab countries recently. Unfortunately, we Nigerians are too timid to embark on a path that will liberate us from the jaws of the clique that has held the country captive for many years. Occasionally we have the brave amongst us like our own Allen Greenspan, the bold central bank Governor, Mr Sanusi Lamido. He has spoken openly without fear or favour against the corrupt malpractices of the lawmakers in the National assembly and the presidency, these are those who should know better. The national assembly senators challenged him to clarify one of his public speeches or be sacked. He bluffed the senators who summoned him to defend his statement that the annual expenditure of the national assembly is massively burdensome on the overall national budget. The senators dug their own pit as he gave his televised defence to the detriment of the committee members whose mediocrity seems to have taken turn for the worse. The ruling party, PDP in the past 10 years or so have brought the economy of the country to its knees. From a rigged election to jailed corrupt party chiefs, speakers and governors. The ruling party has made a governing a do or die affairs as we have seen in recent years as they are the only party that failed to sign the electoral code of conduct. They now hurriedly read the freedom of information bill that has been avoided for over four years with hope of passing it before the election. Do they think Nigerians are fools? What has also characterised the ruling party is the failed Nigerian economy because of policy somersaults, mediocrity, and greed.  These unpalatable national antecedents have eroded the very little credibility the Nigerian state and people have in the international community before the ruling PDP came into power. My country’s economy is now on life support due to the unprecedented colossal looting of the treasury and the non-implementation of the national budget since 1999 How does one justify the National Security Adviser office massive capital budget of $580 million for 2011 whilst the Ministry of Education capital budget is just $399 million?  No one should expect anything better from a clique of mediocre that hijacked the country since the early 90s. My country have spent more than $333 billion on Nigerian roads since 1999 yet our roads have become more deplorable. Federal Road Safety Corp (FRSC) reports put daily deaths on our roads to about 780. That sadly means that there are 780 avoidable deaths on our roads while the politicians fly across the country in private jets and helicopters. We do not need UNO, EU or America to intervene in the man made national political Tsunami Nigeria is experiencing. We are blessed with enormous natural and human resources, therefore the future lies in our hands. Let the good people of Nigeria vote out corrupt politicians that have plagued the country and vote in those who they believe in. The election is next month and the president is vying for your vote again, unfortunately, he is the good son of a very bad family (the ruling PDP). The Holy Bible has it that seeds that falls on bad ground will die; the ruling party PDP is the bad ground whilst the president is the seed. Vote for whom you believe in not a party!"
11,Will the nuclear leakage from Japan influence US?,news-society," Most people worry about how far the nuclear leakage from Fukushima nuclear power plant will spread. Will the radiation leak influence our health, if it comes to New York. By consulting the relevant domestic and international nuclear experts, and nutrition experts, we conclude that: Take New York for example, if the nuclear pollutants comes here with wind, the impact of them on our bodies, after flying over the sea, and traveling thousands of miles, become much weaker, even less than that of the radiation of the vehicle exhaust, home decoration materials, and the home appliances, like cell phones and computers, etc. Therefore we needn’t worry too much about that. Then how to prevent nuclear radiation if it does come to us? If you have to go outdoors, cover your mouth with a wet towel, or a mouth muffle, and to minimize your skin exposure to the air, but it doesn’t mean you must wear many think clothes. air purification equipment. Take a shower every day. Wear a scarf if you go outside. What to eat to prevent the nuclear radiation Many people are talking and worrying about the nuclear radiation leak from Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan, concerning how far the nuclear pollutants will spread. If it do hovers over us, will the radiation leak influence our health? How to prevent it? After consulting the experts and reference books, The following methods have been concluded. Take Vitamin AD Drink more water: drinking water or physiological saline or sugar. Drinking water can speed the discharge of the radionuclide with urine and feces, thus reducing the radiation damage. Scientists found that vegetables and turnips are anti-radiation food. The food with the similar function includes cauliflower, olives, rape, cabbage, mustard, Chinese cabbage, radish, etc., as delicious food on our table, they are rich of antioxidant substances. The fresh vegetables are the body's ""cleanser"". They have a ""secret weapon"" - alkalescent part, which makes the blood alkaline to dissolve the toxins in the cells and then the toxins can be excreted with urine. Eat mung bean sprouts and soy bean sprouts, tomatoes and other fruits, to ensure the vitamin intake. The vitamins have functions on the prevention and treatment of radiation damage. For instance, the vitamin K can reduce bleeding, vitamin B and P can reduce vomiting, nausea, vitamin C can accelerate the regeneration of blood cells and so on. Have food rich in collagen, this type of food is kelp, seaweed, sea cucumbers, animal skin, bone marrow, fungus, etc., because the collagen of the food has a role of adhesion, it can help discharge the radioactive substances in the body. Have some meat: offshore seafood is not recommended Eat more lean meat, less fat, and increase the proportion of vegetable oil. Oleic acid can promote the regeneration of the hematopoietic system, and therefore have the best function on the prevention of radiation damage. Have food with the function of detoxification, such as coagulated pig blood and black fungus. Honey Green Tea: It is recommended to drink some honey green tea. Well, as the nuclear experts says, if the nuclear pollutants from Fukushima nuclear power plant of Japan spead to your city with wind, the impact of them on your bodies, after flying over the sea, and traveling thousands of miles, becomes much weaker, even less than that of the radiation of the vehicle exhaust, home decoration materials, and the home appliances, like cell phones and computers, etc. Therefore, don’t worry too much, and enjoy everyday.

12,Earthquake and Tsunami Preparation,news-society," Do you live in a region that has risks for an earthquake and/or tsunami?  The recent events in Japan, New Zealand, Chile and Haiti have brought to light some catastrophic consequences for these terrible disasters. The Japanese people are currently experiencing tremendous loss of life and destruction of property, and are in danger of a nuclear disaster.  The news coverage of the tsunami rushing through the coastline of Japan, destroying everything in the path of the wave, is overwhelming.  Right now, they are in danger of a core meltdown at one of the power plants. My brother, Jeff and his girlfriend Diane were able to travel to Haiti one year ago after the earthquake.  They volunteered with a project through his church, associated with Mission of Hope, and located about 10 miles northwest of Port-au-Prince.  After arriving in Haiti, they were in shock at the situation.  ""The first thing we saw when we landed was the extreme need for food,"" Jeff said.  He told of long lines where people waited for hours for a meal.  ""People had set up tent cities, and there were thousands of blue tarps,"" he said.  ""The earthquake damage was massive; there was rubble as far as you could see."" Mission of Hope has a school, a church, a medical clinic and an orphanage all established back in 1998.  Jeff was impressed with the operation.  ""It is expanding its orphanage from 60 to 240 children.  This year they will teach 2,600 young people in their school.  It has a clinic open five days a week that treats about 60 patients a day."" FEMA has a great website for earthquake information.  They list:  What to Do Before an Earthquake, What to Do During an Earthquake and What to Do After and Earthquake.  Part of emergency preparedness for a disaster is a proper plan, and to have emergency and disaster supplies on hand.  There are survival kits and storage food available to buy, but here are a few things from the list. Flashlight and extra batteries Portable battery-operated radio and extra batteries First aid kit and manual Emergency food and water Nonelectric can opener Essential medicines Cash and credit cards Sturdy shoes As with any disaster, advanced planning and preparation make the ability to survive much more likely.  It also makes you better able to help others in distress.  Often, there is no way to gather items from a checklist once an emergency has started.  People are already in panic mode, and stores are stripped bare quickly.  Survivalist gear in the home, office, school and grab and go can make you more likely to be safe and relatively comfortable. Our hearts go out to the families of the earthquake/tsunami victims in all the locations mentioned.  Disaster recovery is a long process, and we can learn from this in many ways."
13,When the heart sings and dances,news-society," The second international dance and song competition Art Premier has come to an end in Kyiv. The strict jury didn’t give the grand prize in the singing nomination to anyone, while the students of the choreography department of the Kyiv Children’s Art Academy received the first prize for choreography. Children and youth from Ukraine, Russia, Abkhazia and even remote China danced and sang for three days. The singing contest was held in the Scientist’s House, while dancers competed in the Ukrainian Home. The singing and choreography contests had five categories (A, B, C, D and F). The oldest participants (F, adults aged 19-32) competed for two days in two rounds. Children and teenagers (A, B, C and D categories) vied in one round. On the first day the vocalists sang academic arias. On the second it was Ukrainian folk songs. The dancers performed classical, modern, pop and folk dances. ""The most important thing in the contest is that the children get involved in creative work,"" the singing jury head, Ukrainian National Music Academy Associate Professor, and Shevchenko Prize winner Valerii Buimister told The Day. ""We should be thankful for such enthusiasts as Svitlana Sukhomlynova (head of the charity foundation ""Vivat Art,"" which organized the ""Art Premier"" contest. – Author). This year about 100 vocalists participated in the contest. The oldest group (F) had 17 participants. We decided to allow all of them to sing in the second round in order to have the possibility to attentively listen to them once again, as some of them were very nervous during the first round and couldn’t prove themselves. We were pleased to listen to the participants from St. Petersburg, Moscow and a girl from China, Tsui Tsui, who studies at our Kyiv Music Academy. However, nobody was good enough to get the grand prize…"" Both academic and pop-singers competed in the singing category. The pop-singers were assessed by a jury headed by the Chancellor of the Kyiv Municipal Academy of the Vaudeville and Circus Arts, Professor Oleksandr Chukhinin: ""The pop-singers competition has revealed several bright individuals, but the jury didn’t give the grand prize to any of them. The singers from the Kyiv Leontovych School took the first place — they were the best. At present, we have a big problem with the pop-singing teachers. There are two or three of them in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa and Kherson. The repertoire is also a problem, especially for children. They mostly sing adult songs that are irrelevant for them. Today those who have their repertoire are in the saddle. Pop singing requires quite a lot of money. Parents have to invest a lot into audio records and costumes. For example, Mika Newton has the right to represent Ukraine at the Eurovision-2011, but she will do it at her own expense. Now she has to find the money for clothes, traveling, hotel, security and advertisement… It’s show-business. Today artists aren’t artists but ‘products’… I’m proud of Mika Newton. Professor Ivan Popovych taught her. She’s honest and hard-working. There were a lot of descent Eurovision pretenders. For example, Vania Berezovsky is a very gifted singer; Jamala is very bright as well, as is Zlata Ohnevych. However, the audience made their choice by voting…"""
14,Welfare vs. Charity,news-society," A favorite political tactic of the Left is to shout ""hypocrisy"" every time someone from the Religious Right expresses an opinion regarding welfare that is not in keeping with liberal orthodoxy that endorses cradle to grave dependency on the government. The adhominem attack has been so successful that Christians have been cowered and rendered virtually mute on this and many other social issues. No one wants to be seen as hypocritical, especially those of faith, as being labeled such strikes at the very heart of what makes a Christian a Christian. We believe in the Golden Rule. ""Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets."" (Matthew 7:12 NKJV) We believe in the lesson of the Good Samaritan. (Luke 10:25-37) Helping others is a commandment of our God. So it would seem that the attacks from the Left are well-founded, for if we are against blanket all-encompassing welfare, how can we claim we are helping those in need as God commands? But labels are dangerous and often exploited. Shouting hypocrisy during every debate regarding the ""nanny state"" is a quintessential example of the point. One of the last things the Left wants to do is actually debate the welfare issue, because if they do they invariably lose. Knowing this, they’ve taken to name calling instead of meaningful debate. Hence, if the Religious Right argues against welfare they are hypocrites. The trouble is, the Left purposely misuse definitions hoping no one will notice. In this case they have manipulated the word charity to morph into the word welfare. Two different words with different meanings. Welfare is defined as ""relating to, or concerned with the welfare and esp. with the improvement of the welfare of disadvantaged social groups."" The welfare state, the result of never-ending welfare, is defined as ""a social system based on the assumption by a political state of primary responsibility for the individual and the social welfare of its citizens."" Charity on the other hand is described as ""a gift for public benefit purposes."" And ""benevolent goodwill toward or love of humanity."" Clearly, the words are not interchangeable unless someone is trying to cloud an issue to their advantage. Welfare is a government program used and abused for political purposes. Charity is a private decision to do good. Welfare is a program that has run amuck with no accountability. Charity can be directed as a charitable person deems correct and in keeping with their faith. Welfare is funded by taxes taken from people, mostly against their will. Charity is money freely given. Welfare is directed by Washington D.C. Charity is commanded by the Word of God. Welfare has at its core using other people’s money to buy votes for re-election of politicians. Charity has as its foundation helping those who need help with no thought of personal gain. Welfare administration eats up a substantial percentage of the money in the system, thereby denying much of what could be offered to those truly in need. Charity can be as direct as buying groceries for your neighbor - there need not be the expensive middle-man welfare demands. Charity is and always will be preferable to welfare. But more to the point, is it hypocritical for a religious person to be against government welfare? The ""War on Poverty"" that has spent trillions of dollars without any tangible results, and has basically ensured that generations of those in the welfare class will always be the welfare class; i.e., to ensure continuing checks one must make sure they don’t have income that would take them off the welfare rolls. So there is little incentive to work. In fact, just the opposite. Further, to increase one’s monthly welfare check, people are monetarily encouraged to, for example, have more children they cannot afford and/or raise as they should be raised. The Bible says in Luke 17:2, ""It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones."" Welfare harms children and should be held accountable. Lastly, 2 Thessalonians 3:10 says, ""For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: If anyone will not work, neither shall he eat."" So the issue is not whether a person is poor, but why they are poor. Welfare fails because it employs no such discernment. Conversely, Christian charity offers help to those who are truly in need  - and tough love to those who can and should be working. ""And if anyone does not obey our word in this epistle, note that person and do not keep company with him, that he may be ashamed. Yet do not count him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother."" (2 Thessalonians 3:14-15)"
15,How Do I Get A Greencard?,news-society," Getting an immigrant visa, being sponsored by relatives for a greencard (permanent resident card) or getting a greencard through one's own eligibility are the commonly used immigration procedures to enter the United States. Having a greencard is a proof of being officially granted immigration benefits to live and work in the United States permanently and legally. You can get a greencard either while you are in the US or outside the US. When you get a greencard while physically being present in the US, the process is called adjustment of status. Whereas when you get one while being outside the US or when you are ineligible to adjust status, it is called Consular processing. You can enter the US through an immigrant or non-immigrant visa. Non-immigrant visas are for temporary visits to the U.S. for tourism, study, or work. Immigrant visas allow for Permanent Residence in the U.S. After you enter the US as a visa holder, you can adjust your status to a greencard holder (permanent resident) subject to conditions for certain visa holders.There are different ways to get a permanent resident status. A family member who is a US citizen or permanent resident can sponsor you for a greencard. Else, you can also get one through the Diversity Visa lottery program that is held every year. Approximately 55,000 applicants are randomly selected every year subject to certain eligibility conditions. You can also get a greencard through employment. Here a qualified US employer needs to sponsor you. A person granted Refugee Status or Asylum may also apply for a Green Card. Like there are many ways to get a greencard, the process and procedures vary too. A conditional permanent resident will get a greencard that is valid only for two years. You need to remove the conditions during the 90 days before the card expires,The conditional card cannot be renewed. The conditions must be removed else you will lose your permanent resident status. Form I-751 needs to be filed to remove the conditions. Once removed, you will get a permanent resident card that will be valid for the next ten years. Replacing / renewing the greencard: A permanent resident card is generally valid for ten years, You need to renew it on its expiration by filing Form I-90. The same form is used when you want to change any biographic information on your card i.e if your name has changed due to marriage. The same process is followed if you lose your card and need a replacement. Being a greencard holder qualifies you for citizenship. Permanent resident status is the main eligibility requirement for citizenship. Just as greencard holders enjoy the benefit of living and working in the US, citizenship has added advantages, where you can enter and exit the US without any restrictions and it gives you voting rights too. You can also sponsor your family members to visit the US. The US immigration laws make it extremely difficult to get a greencard for those who entered illegally. Hence it is always recommended to enter the US legally."
16,The Importance of Lighting in Functions,news-society," When your wedding party is taking place at night, adequate lighting is must to provide perfect illumination on your dream day. Lighting at different places of the venue should be adequate to enlighten your function. Different corners of the venue should be well illuminated. Outside at the entry adequate lighting should be done so that the guests can easily enter the venue without any difficulty. You may put lighting over the trees also to provide designed lighting. The passage should be clear and well lighted so that your old guests can easily enter without any problem. Light is an essential part of our daily activities. Just like we need air, water and food to survive we need light in order to arrange functions and parties efficiently. Your specific needs will vary with your situation, but generally, all outdoor lighting systems are exposed to dirt, rainfall and irrigation, even snow and ice. The fixtures are designed to withstand moisture, but calcium and lime deposits; hard water scale and dirt will build up on the lenses, dramatically reducing the light output. Because your lights are in the gardens, they are near the plant material, which grows and changes with the seasons, dropping plant material onto and near the fixtures, and can obscure the intended light output. They are known to generate minimal unwanted heat and this makes them perfect in air conditioned environments. When they are turned on, they always come on with brightens that is unmatched by any other form of bulbs. It is ideal to state that it does not contain any mercury or any other harmful substances. To cap it all, note that it does not emit any ultra violet light. As a result, this ensures that they do not cause any sort of damage like fading to artwork that is placed close to it. Versatility is one of its main advantages since with a track lighting system properly set in your house, you will be able to move around all your light according to your needs without having to worry too much about installation and other problems that might happen when moving other types of light. The outdoor rope lighting has a wide range of uses and the tremendous practicality of the product should well be appreciated. They are easy to use and provide instant illumination. You can hang the rope lights anywhere you want; on Christmas trees, on walls for patterns, across deck railings and other such places. You can also spell out ""Happy Xmas"" and put it outside for all to see during the festival. Many outdoor lighting systems work with a low voltage, a safe and economical way to install garden lighting. However, it does require some work and thought when considering the placement and installation of the cables. If you are not ready to deal with this hassle, a simpler and even still more cost-efficient solution would be solar lighting. Solar lighting has become much more popular in modern days and is constantly being improved and reinvented to be better and more effective. Candles and lanterns are good for short-term use such as parties, but are not meant to be left on for long periods of time and require you to be vigilant in case of a fire."
17,Gis: the new modern exhibition of lifting is in Italy,news-society," The Gis expo is the modern exhibition specialized in lifting (all the instruments and equipments in particular cranes and all the heavy transport in general) is an annual event and the next one will be held from 27 to 29 May 2011 at the Piacenza Expo Fair.

18,Are You Ready?  The Middle East and You,news-society," Most of us have been watching the news coverage of the recent protests, civil unrest and government breakdowns in many of the Middle Eastern nations.  My local newspaper, the Duluth News Tribune, gave an account of the events in Egypt, seen through the eyes of American tourists from Minnesota. For most of the visit, they had a great time.  Touring the pyramids, and cruising from Luxor to Aswan on the Nile River. They returned to Cairo, and heard about the demonstrations happening downtown.  Then they realized all internet and cell phone service was shut down.  They saw army tanks drive into the neighborhood.  The next day, they were told to stay indoors.  Their hosts (niece and her husband) went to a grocery store and saw looting.  The couple began packing to leave. The couple made it to the chaotic airport, and after much trouble, they were able to join a small group of Americans and Canadians.  The group stayed there all night, with the men in the group taking turns standing guard while others in the group tried to sleep.  They were able to be flown out, after some arrangements were made with the U.S. State Department. Emergency preparedness for a disaster can be for many different situations, and these riots point out another reason to be prepared in advance.  Earthquakes, hurricanes, blackouts, civil unrest, tornadoes, pandemic disease, blizzards, floods and unemployment are just a few examples of things that could happen.  Survivalist gear, storage food, water and proper shelter are some of the basics that could help you ride out these troubles, while keeping you safe and relatively comfortable. Also, as mentioned in the story, you need to be prepared to stay in place or evacuate.  You may have to stay at your home, office, school or you may have to grab and go.  It is best to have an emergency plan for these situations, with storage food, water and survival kits designed for different locations.  These supplies can also be a great source for bartering or helping others, if needed.  When chaos hits, people need the basics, but they also crave the things they love.  Candy, coffee, alcohol, cigarettes, household necessities all make great items to stock up on for barter goods.  Hand tools, nails, tarp and other hardware store items are also needed during power outages or emergencies. U.S. grocery stores have a just in time supply of food, enough for two days maximum.  Any disruption of supply chains could cause shortages, especially if people panic.  Just how much food you should stock is going to be up to you.  Also, it is important to consider the shelf life of the foods.  Purchasing long term storage food means less care is needed in rotating the supply.  The longer the shelf life of the food you store for an emergency, the less time you have to spend replenishing and rotating it.  If you buy storage food with a nearly infinite shelf life, you can put it away and forget it. Having emergency survival kits at home, the office, school or grab and go gives you a great advantage during an unexpected disaster.  Should a dangerous situation arrive, this will permit you to remain in place instead of facing crowds of frantic shoppers.  As people panic and get reckless, it is often safer to remain in place.  Once an emergency starts, it is often too late to gather items for your checklist. We live in a beautiful, but sometimes dangerous world.  Just like insurance, we hope for the best but plan for the worst.  There are many more areas to consider for emergency preparedness, such as:  medical needs, security, heating and cooking to mention a few.  Those are topics for another time.  Remember, the most important resource you have is your brain.  We are vulnerable to the dangers of this world, but with some advance preparation, we can learn to help ourselves and others."
19,Who is a Hero,news-society," According to the dictionary a hero is: a person of distinguished courage or ability, admired for his brave deeds and noble qualities. For me this word has a few meanings that may relate to the official definition, but more importantly to me identifies a few actual faces. I have personally been on hundreds of 911 trauma calls where lives hung in the balance off cliffs, open water, frozen lakes and burning structures. I am reminded of one of my very best friends from the Dive Rescue team and our annual ""Ice Diving"" certification. We were required annually to perform two under the ice dives and stay on the bottom for 10-15 minutes to maintain certification. Certified to do what you may ask? Certified to go under an ice shelf where the dead and dying are waiting to be brought home to family and loved ones. Certified to reach deep into an abyss alone as a single diver tethered on a line that is all that separates you in a zero visibility ""black water"" environment from the warmth and safety of the surface and natural air. My good buddy and fellow diver would perform his annual dives with great courage and faith that if anything happened I would be there for him. He was right. Beyond that thought though is where the correlation to the word ""Hero"" comes in to me. My buddy did not like the water much. He performed his dives to do good and to make a difference because he believed then and still does now as a Captain in a full time fire department that saving lives is a worthy risk and comes before personal comfort or safety. Seeing him go into the water year after year in every environment from swift water to under the ice taught me the word hero in a more direct and less glamorous way. Doing the hard thing when no one else is present for a noble cause is being a hero in my book. Performing dangerous missions in training or under real word conditions when you are scared is being a hero. As a Public Safety Scuba Instructor I witnessed this humble behavior for many years and on many actual recovery calls. Never during these events did anyone in my circle use the word hero to define themselves. In fact, tradition is that if you are caught in the news paper or singled out on TV you may be responsible to by drinks, shakes or dinner for ALL those who were on the call. This was just another way of keeping everyone in the mindset that a ""Team"" is more powerful than the individual. Nevertheless these men and women in my book were and are defined as true heroes. Another humble and simple example is the voice of a four year old child to a veteran mother ""you're the hero mom."" Whenever I think of this or contemplate the context of those speaking and hearing it I get a little teary eyed. The little girl is right that her mother is a hero in every sense of the word. Risking it all, committed while aware of the danger and bold to speak out the things she believes in. Often the ""Hero"" will deflect the attention. Some may think this is casual banter and perhaps superficial humility. To me it is the fact that if one acknowledges the hero word, they deny all the other critical participants that were present during the mission, operation, rescue or recovery. Perhaps they just do not want to buy a round of shakes for the team. Either way the dead in many cases are truly the heroes because they voted with their life and the vote was cashed in. As I write this at my desk and in the company of many real bona fide heroes I can’t help but reflect on my long time buddy and fellow instructor in the Urban Warfare Center® - www.urbanwarfarecenter.com - ""Bravo."" He was recognized for valor in Afghanistan at 12,000 feet while he and one other soldier assaulted a fixed mortar position and a bunker successfully. A-10 warthogs had attempted gun runs to suppress the threats, but because of the terrain and conditions they could not deliver their guns or bombs. A-10 pilots of all aviators are never unwilling to drop bombs, this place was hardcore. It finally took an old fashion assault of two guys with courage breathing heavy at altitude to unseat the mortar and the bunker. This kind of hero will say ""I was just doing my job."" In fact as I spoke briefly with Bravo today thats exactly what he said. Doing one's ""job"" is fine when you work at a lumber yard, restaurant or bakery. But when you carry a weapon in hostile terrain ""doing your job"" means killing, saving or anything else required to get you and the others home. It is by its very nature ""above and beyond."" While I sat in the basement of his parents a year or so after he came back from a very violent tour of Afghanistan I learned that he had not told his parents about his medal with a ""V"" for valor. I explained to them that he had been formally recognized for his contribution in a remote region of the world and he should tell them the story. Truth be told he did. He of course left out some of the more weighty parts of it as only another warrior would understand the complexities of taking lives to save them. My father would leave our home in a little city outside of Los Angeles every day for 24 years and strap on his gun and leather to fight an ever increasing wave of crime as a policeman with LAPD. I witnessed this day in and day out knowing that he risked his life each time. This reality was brought home any time a graduating classmate or a partner of his were killed in the line of duty. My dad is one of the most humble and simple men you will ever meet. He would never call attention to himself, especially if it was implied that he was a ""hero."" He caught the number one bad guy on the top ten list in the 1960s and was given a bottle of champaign that sat on our shelf for 25 years. He saved lives and dealt justice to the bad guys. He is one of many of my personal heroes. Heroes come in every color, shape, size, gender and walk of life. It can be the civilian who decides not to sit idly by and let someone else be victimized. It can be a kid saving another kid from drowning. The true mark of a hero is the person who has a steep and deep value system and lives a life based on liberty, involvement and protection of those very rights at the cost of popularity, safety, fortune and even life. To all those ""heroes"" who read this article I (we) at OPSGEAR® - www.opsgear.com - say THANK YOU and may God Bless and keep you always safe. To all those who cannot read this and are forever gone, we think of you and salute you this day."
20,Fundraising Is the Same as Friendraising -2,news-society," In the previous article we took a look at how fundraising is about developing relationships. Long term relationships will help keep both volunteers and donors feeling happy being associated with your non-profit organization. There are many ways to express your gratitude. This is not the same as manipulation. It’s a way to build a strong team by letting everyone know that what they bring makes a difference. Birds of a Feather Ask your corporate donors to network for you. Through business circles of their own donors may be able to lead you to other high-powered contacts. Catch Them Doing Something Right Nothing makes a person feel more valued than their efforts are being appreciated. Let your volunteers who have contributed to the organization feel valued with compliments. It’s a simple thing that is too rarely done but carries a lot of weight. The same principal that works for kids works for adults. Catch them doing something right and mention how they handled it well. Give Volunteers a Feeling of Promotion For your volunteers who have been with you for awhile reward them with a promotion. Maybe this is a chance to give them a fundraiser to run themselves, or a meeting that they chair. This could be a chance to listen to one of their pet projects. Find something that your donor is passionate about with your organization and help them get there. Make it clear that through their commitment and hard work you want them to take a step up. Structure a Healthy Teamwork Atmosphere in your Organization While your charitable organization works on getting your fundraising and advertising in line you will be planning your next step. The atmosphere should be cooperative and not combatitive. According to Chic Hospitality Consulting Services who specialize in people management,"" Managers who encourage employees to use initiative and set higher challenges for themselves achieve more positive results than those who cause employees to compete with each other. Personal accomplishment at the expense of others defeats teamwork and negatively affects service to customers. Managers can win over employees' loyalty and best input by treating them as ""partners"", showing care, listening to them and sharing."" With simple acknowledgement of efforts put in by your donors and volunteers you can strengthen internal and external relationships. The goal here is to keep the workers and supporters of your charitable organization around for a very long time."

1,Balanced Budget: Theory vs Reality,news-society," I've long made a joke that credit cards are evil. But that's not true. When a person who is responsible with their money uses them responsibly, they are not evil at all. Try renting a car or making a hotel reservation without one. Credit cards also offer a level of protection when you make purchases. For instance, if you buy something online, and you're unhappy with it, or it's never delivered to you, you have the option of disputing the charges. It can protect you from many of the possible dangers of purchasing something from an unknown company. The problem is that many of us do not use them responsibly. When my wife went back to school to finish her degree, we were making very little money. We were basically living off student loans and our cards. By the time she got out of school, we had racked up thousands in debt. We were buried with it and finding it difficult to dig our way out. We considered bankruptcy. We went to a credit counseling service, chopped up our cards, and made monthly payments until we were out of debt. It's a liberating feeling to make that final payment on your cards. We haven't looked back. We no longer use them. If we can't afford it, we don't buy it. We have learned the hard way that we're better off without credit cards. It doesn't make them evil. It just means that we're not responsible enough to use them responsibly. Because of our access to ""money"" on our cards, we were spending more money than we were making. We were running a budget deficit every year. Does this remind you of our federal government at all? Since the early 1960s, our federal government has run budget deficits every year except 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001. They spend more money every year than they receive in tax revenues. Many have brought up the idea of a balanced budget amendment. This would force the federal government to balance their budget every year, and eliminate budget deficits. In theory, I disagree with this approach. But in reality, it needs to be considered. Why? It's kind of like credit cards. In theory, credit cards are useful and offer purchasing protections for consumers. But in reality, many consumers use them to buy products they cannot afford. In theory I oppose a balance budget amendment. In times like these when our country is in a recession, or is coming out of a recession, tax revenues to the federal government are down. A balanced budget amendment would force the federal government to reduce services during a time we need them the most. But reality shows us a different picture. If the federal government ran budget surpluses during the good times, we could trust them to make good decisions and allow them to run budget deficits during the bad times. The problem is that our government does NOT run budget surpluses, even during the good times. They just continue to increase spending in good times and bad. They are not responsible with our money, and they need to chop up their credit cards. It's time for a balanced budget amendment. It would be good for our country, and ultimately, good for our economy."
2,It's Time for a Budget Surplus Again,news-society," A showdown is looming in Washington. And it's all about debt. Just to put this into perspective, our national debt stands at about $14 trillion. According to the national debt clock on brilling.com, the debt is $14,107,455,627,940.78, and the estimated population of the United States is 309,976,811. So each citizen's share of this debt is $45,511.33. The national debt is increasing by approximately $4.16 billion per day. To put this simply, the federal government spends more money than it takes in. That's called a deficit. When you do this year after year, it creates a large amount of national debt. Did you know that since about 1970, we've run federal deficits every year except 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001? The politicians in Washington sure like spending our money. The federal government also has what's called debt ceiling. The Congress votes on and sets a national debt ceiling, the total amount of money the federal government can go into debt. In recent years, this debt ceiling gets raised almost every year. Sometimes more than once per year. Last year, the democratically controlled Congress raised the debt ceiling to $14.3 trillion, a political decision to push the next increase after the 2010 elections. We are expected to reach this ceiling within the next month or two. The CBO (Congressional Budget Office) recently reported that we are likely to set a new record this year with almost a $1.5 trillion federal deficit. Studying our federal deficits over the last 25 years, it's been clear that we've run through several groups in control of Congress with various fiscal priorities. Fiscal Conservatives In 1994, Newt Gingrich lead the Republican Revolution, and voters elected fiscal conservatives into Congress, taking control of both the House and the Senate for the first time in many years. First let's look at budget deficits before the 1994 election. These numbers have all been adjusted for inflation. 1986: $429.128 billion deficit 1987: $279.939 billion deficit 1988: $277.808 billion deficit 1989: $260.775 billion deficit 1990: $358.344 billion deficit 1991: $420.108 billion deficit 1992: $438.504 billion deficit 1993: $374.997 billion deficit 1994: $290.576 billion deficit Keep in mind that by the time the new Congress was in place in January, 1995, the budget was already in place for the '95 fiscal year from the '94 Congress. So what happened with deficits during the time that fiscal conservatives controlled Congress? They became surpluses for the first time since 1969. 1995: $227.96 billion deficit 1996: $145.125 billion deficit 1997: $29.04 billion deficit 1998: $89.96 billion SURPLUS 1999: $159.512 billion SURPLUS 2000: $290.772 billion SURPLUS Fiscal Moderates By 2000, moderates and liberals had made significant gains into Congress. While the House and Senate were still controlled by Republicans, they were now controlled by moderate Republicans instead of fiscal conservatives. These moderate Republicans controlled Congress be small margins through 2006. And by 2002, we returned to budget deficits instead of budget surpluses. 2001: $152.76 billion SURPLUS 2002: $186.204 billion deficit 2003: $430.1 billion deficit 2004: $462.56 billion deficit 2005: $347.71 billion deficit 2006: $260.4 billion deficit Fiscal Liberals In the 2006 election, Democrats finally wrestled away control of Congress from the Republicans. Here are the federal deficits we've run during the last few years with Democrats in control. Keep in mind, that like the example above, the 2007 budget was already in place by the time Democrats came into office in January of '07. 2007: $165.24 billion deficit 2008: $455 billion deficit 2009: $1.416 trillion deficit 2010: $1.294 trillion deficit 2011: Projected $1.5 trillion deficit It will be interesting to see what happens over the next few years. Fiscal conservatives now have control over the House, but Democrats continue to control the Senate and the White House. Do you want to know what President Obama had to say about our increasing national debt? He called it a ""sign of leadership failure"". But at the time, he was Senator Obama, and the year was 2006. And Senator Barrack Obama voted against raising the debt ceiling. Back then the national debt was only about $8 trillion. Since then, our national debt has increase by about 75%. That was only five years ago. On this one, I agree with Barrack Obama completely. Our current level of national debt is certainly a failure of leadership."
3,Medicare Fraud and Abuse: The Most Profitable Healthcare Crime in the U.S.,news-society," Medicare fraud and abuse cost taxpayers approximately $60 billion a year. It’s one of the fastest and most profitable crimes in the U.S. The government health insurance program that covers 46 million elderly and disabled Americans is being hijacked by opportunists preying on patients, doctors, suppliers, and lack of oversight of the system itself. According to President Obama, Medicare fraud and abuse is fueling enormous federal budget deficits. He recently explained that we could pay for healthcare reform if we could eliminate Medicare fraud, abuse, and waste altogether. Although completely eliminating Medicare fraud isn’t entirely realistic, curbing the growing crimes could provide healthcare to many more Americans and stop lining the pockets of the individuals, crime rings, and corrupt healthcare providers that steal a huge amount of the half trillion dollars in Medicare benefits each year. The instances of Medicare fraud and abuse are as diverse as they are widespread. One recent high-profile case involved an Armenian-American crime syndicate that stole patient and doctor identities to setup dozens of fake clinics. The operation, which is one of the largest Medicare fraud schemes in U.S. history, resulted in over $35 million in illegal billings. In another Medicare fraud and abuse case, nine hospitals in seven states were ordered to pay $9.4 million in fines for keeping patients overnight after undergoing what is typically an outpatient back procedure. The hospitals fraudulently billed Medicare for the unnecessary services. In still another case, eight nurses in Florida carried out an $18.7 million Medicare fraud scam in which they forged patient files to make it appear that they required home health care services that they didn’t need or receive. Although these are just a few of the many types of Medicare fraud and abuse scams occurring each year, they show the urgent need to be vigilant about preventing Medicare scams. From charging for durable medical equipment (DME) never received to using a deceased doctor’s information to continue to bill patients, common Medicare fraud and abuse schemes include: Advertising ""free"" consultations to patients with Medicare, and then recording and using their private information for monetary gain Offering healthcare services or DME for free in return for a person’s Medicare number for ""record keeping"" Setting up fictitious clinics with people impersonating doctors to steal private   information  and commit medical identity theft is another common Medicare fraud and abuse tactic Using real patients’ data, but without their knowledge, to steal their identities Not adhering to the FTC Red Flag Rules that alert the carriers paying the bills Fraudulent billing for a wheelchair, specialized hospital bed, or other DME is also a form of Medicare fraud and abuse Falsifying claims for expensive procedures is another common tactic, such as the $5.8 million fraudulent HIV infusion scheme in Miami in which a husband and wife team defrauded Medicare by submitting unnecessary HIV injection and infusion claims Remember that when fraud happens to Medicare, it happens to all of us. Don’t let your organization become a victim. Put your employees on the front line to spot Medicare fraud by hiring a healthcare fraud and abuse expert that provides ""Lunch and Learn"" presentations to help avoid, recognize, and respond to Medicare fraud. Visit www.TheIdentityAdvocate.com. or call 310.831.4400 to learn how to prevent Medicare fraud and medical identity theft."
4,How Can I,news-society," Graduate school scholarships are readily available for you; all you've got to do is fill out an application. You need an education to find a decent job so that you can make money and you also need to have money to obtain a decent education to get a good job. It is just a vicious cycle and there actually is no way for you to avoid it. Getting accepted to graduate school is just the start point, working out just how you will pay it off is the other half. Scholarship grants for graduate school can be found. You will find over $60 million in scholarship funds for graduate school students out there for the taking. Most of these scholarships are not going to come knocking on your door. You will need to search for them and do your research. Many university students think they do not have the time to try to find scholarships and grants and so easily throw in the towel and give in to loans. Don’t toss in the towel. Graduate school scholarships are there to help you and help to make finding cash for your schooling less stressful. The key ingredient to locating scholarships for graduate school is to start very early. There is no such thing as commencing your pursuit too soon. College and university are expensive; the sooner you start the better options you'll find and the more likelihood you will have at discovering scholarship dollars that will help handle the expense of your educational costs. Scholarships and grants go quickly, which means you should not put it off too long. The first place students should certainly check out when you are searching for a graduate school scholarship is at the institution that you are planning on attending. Many educational institutions have many different names for scholarships. You should look into anything that has the title fellowship, scholarship or grant. Nearly anything using these names in the title should not need to be repaid and may just be something you are eligible for. Additionally you should be very careful when you find yourself exploring on the web for scholarships for graduate school. You do not want to give out your sensitive information if you don't know that what you are inquiring about is legitimate. To avoid ripoffs and giving your personal details out needlessly you need to check out the Federal Trade Commission’s Scholarship Scams to make certain that you aren't getting drawn into something that is just going to end up causing you more troubles. Universities hold the finest resources for scholarships and grants. Plenty of financial aid offices have directories and lists of associations, families and companies which offer scholarships. Getting graduate school scholarships to pay for your university fees is not at all impossible, you have to do your due diligence and be patient. You'll need to work for this; it's not merely going to land in your lap."
5,Bill C-23 Proposing Suspension of Criminal Records in Lieu of Pardons,news-society," Erasing a criminal record in Canada may become tougher with the drafting and introduction of a new Act into Parliament. Bill C-23, titled ""Eliminating Pardons for Serious Crimes Act"" is the proposed amendment to the Criminal Records Act dealing with pardons in Canada. Serious criminals won't be the only ones affected however; all others will have the waiting period doubled from five years to ten for indictable offenses, and increased from three years to five years for misdemeanors. There is also a three strikes clause which will make anyone with three indictable offenses ineligible for a ""record suspension"", the new moniker for ""pardon"" used in the bill. Record suspension is a term devised to express the government's stance of not wanting to be in the business of pardoning, forgiving, or even relieving anyone convicted of any level of criminal offense. The bill has the aim of getting tough on crime but it also seems to be punishing people who are trying to put an isolated mistake behind them and live as productive citizens once more. Having a criminal record longer leaves an offender vulnerable to further discrimination in the job market and makes travel to other countries more difficult. In effect they are constantly being punished after serving their sentences so one might argue that this is contrary to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Section 11(h) that states that once you are convicted and punished for a crime, you are not to be punished for it again. The place to get tough is in the courtroom. The government doesn't present any reasoning for the waiting period extension backed by statistics showing such a necessity. At the current waiting periods, 96% of the 400,000 people given pardons in Canada have not re-offended so the motive for demanding much longer waiting periods is not aimed at any weakness in the system. Making them wait longer to live full productive lives is surely a negative factor in reducing crime. On the positive side, Bill C-23 allows the National Parole Board to consider a number of factors when determining whether to order a record suspension. The Board may consider the nature, gravity, and duration of the offense. They may also consider the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offense. They may also weigh information relating to the applicant's criminal history. These new rules should give a broader spectrum on which to base decisions. Getting a pardon in Canada should be done right away by those who are eligible in order to avoid longer waiting periods. Getting a record suspension doesn't sound as cleansing and there will be the necessity by the applicant to prove to the Board that it would provide him with a measurable benefit and sustain his rehabilitation in society as a law-abiding citizen. The Board would also have the ability to make any inquiries to determine whether the ordering of a record suspension would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. This would eliminate some loopholes that seem to let serious offenders slip by. The longer waiting periods remain inexplicable; it's a case of fixing something that's not broken and could lead to higher crime rates when frustrated ex-offenders can't find work after several years of good behavior and decide to make money in an illegal fashion. The effort could be better spent focusing on proper sentencing and the swift and effective rehabilitation of those who don't intend to commit crimes anymore."
6,The Church Is Helping Destroy America,news-society," I was raised in a small Midwestern town at a time that now seems like a million years ago. My mother and father were hardworking parents who were devoted to their children. They loved the Lord and conducted their lives according to His Holy Word. They truly ""walked the walk."" Because they were Christians, I was raised in the church. Back then church was more than a once-a-week spiritual comfort stop, it was an integral part of our daily lives. The church I attended was pastored by a remarkable man, Rev. W.J.B. Tate. He was an immigrant from Scotland with a brogue and speaking manner that made the Word come alive each and every Sunday. What drew people to him most of all was that he preached the Word as it is, not as we might wish it to be. He would not go along to get along. The Word of God was not to be compromised. While other local churches were starting to tailor their message to meet the evolving morals of the day, Rev. Tate lovingly preached biblical truths. My mother used to say for years before her passing that she didn’t belong here anymore, that things had changed too much. I found it so sad that a Christian woman would reach the point where she felt she could no longer exist here on earth, but I understood. ""Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. For what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? And what communion has light with darkness?"" (2 Corinthians 6:14 NKJV) So in my later years I have made an effort to understand the path we are on. And, if necessary, affix blame. Not to condemn, but to understand. In my lifetime America has done so much good in the world. But we have also undertaken the business of cannibalizing that which made us good. Some call it social progress. Others who know better weep at what we see. A few examples. We once revered marriage. Now the divorce rate has eclipsed fifty percent. We used to protect children at all costs. Now the national out-of-wedlock birth-rate is at record levels. And so is the abortion rate. Child molestation is all too common, as is all manner of child abuse. Homosexuals are now a protected class, and politicians court their vocal voting block. At the same time those same politicians rightfully decry the epidemic of sexual abuse of young boys by clergy and scout leaders - conveniently ""forgetting"" that almost all the perpetrators are homosexuals. Clearly, these facts, and a multitude of others leads to one inescapable conclusion - America’s societal decline has run amok and is picking up speed. And where are most churches on these and other subjects? They have capitulated. Most will remarry a divorced person, notwithstanding that the Bible says doing so is accepting adultery. ""Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery; and whoever marries her who is divorced from her husband commits adultery."" (Luke 16:18) Many have no problem with abortion and pass it off as a ""private"" matter. In fact, many church women and some nuns can often be seen at abortion rights events despite that God says we are His even before the moment of conception. ""Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; Before you were born I sanctified you; I ordained you a prophet to the nations."" (Jeremiah 1:5) And while God loves homosexuals, He will not accept the act, notwithstanding that many pastors preach tolerance and acceptance of the sin. ""Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God."" (1 Corinthians 6:9-10) The church used to be the spiritual Maginot Line. It held fast at all cost. But now it gives comfort to those who instead need conviction, repentance, and salvation. Too many churches have forgotten the message contained in the above quoted 2 Corinthians 6:14. And in doing so they are helping destroy America and individual souls. The world needs men like Rev. Tate now more than ever. Loving, uncompromising men who preach the truth of God’s Word. Times change, but God’s Word doesn’t. ""Forever, O LORD, Your word is settled in heaven."" (Psalm 119:89)"
7,Timeless Head Stones :Make Prior Arrangements,news-society," It is commonly said that the death can be considered the door for the next part of life. Considering this fact, most are taking up relevant preparations with respect to the final resting place they are going to have with the passage of time. When reaching a certain point in life, most are already considering the choices in deciding the type of grave stone that must be placed in the cemetery with their names. There are indeed many different designs and you can find many people researching the designs they like at prices that are affordable. Checking retailers locally and online and talking to these companies will help achieve the main goal of making pre-need arrangements. Once decisions are made, space can be reserved in a chosen cemetery and the type of gravestone you select may be purchased and set far ahead of the time needed. This is why arrangements are commonly referred to as ""pre-need"". There are many firms taking up these kinds of orders and the only requirement is that you should also introduce one of your family members or friends to the firm so that they will be able to proceed with all the relevant steps required at the particular time without any confusion. You should provide many other specifications including the things that must be written on the grave markers, the font that must be used for writing the required things, along with the height required for the grave as certain cemeteries will allow only certain height and you need to confirm by contacting the cemetery concerns with respect to this information. There are many different materials used by the people with respect to their grave stone such as granite, marble, or limestone. It is best to select the right materials according to your allotted budget so that you can definitely confirm your order without any cost issues arising. Another factor to be noted with respect to the issue is regarding the arrangement that has to be made with respect to the installation of the grave at the time of requirement. Most of the cemeteries will definitely help you with the pre-need installation and in that case you need to give out the prior notification of appropriate arrangements that need to be made so they will not run into timing challenges during the peak time. Cemetery crews are very knowledgeable and experienced so it is best to let them do their job setting on site. If special instructions are needed, it is best to explain these before hand so everything will be taken care of appropriately."
8,How To Celebrate Different Easter Traditions,news-society," It’s always fascinating to watch different traditions around the world being followed on Easter. Every culture and nation has their own Easter traditions as well as customs. Read on to know about the different Easter traditions around the world- USA- in the United States of America yearly carnivals are held for honoring the resurrection of Jesus. The significant highlights of this carnival are music and parade troupes. England- the native of England eats ham on Easter and host special parades so as to glorify the resurrection of Lord Jesus. Churches are decorated with lilies and Morris dancers are invited for dance performances during the party celebrations. You’ll find people dancing to the tune of springtime songs. Germany- Germans celebrate Easter by igniting a fire made from Easter trees. The fire symbolizes an official end to winter and onset of the spring. Poland- Similar to most of the Easter traditions around the world, the Easter traditions of the Polish revolves around the eggs. The natives cut a boiled egg into multiple pieces so that the maximum number of people can have a bite. This act of theirs symbolizes renewal in the house. Russia- The chief Easter traditions of Russians focus on Easter egg decoration. They use nails to crack open the nails. This act of theirs symbolizes crucifixion. Finland- Easter traditions in Finland is a bit different when compared to the rest of the world. To be more specific, they involve less celebration and concentrate more on piousness. Europe- Most of the European countries celebrates Easter Eve either by lighting bonfires in churchyards or on hilltops. Mexico- Pascua and Semanta Santa form an integral part of Easter celebrations here. Pascua is the ceremony of the period from the rebirth Sunday to the following Saturday whereas Semanta Santa symbolizes the complete week on which Easter falls. Brazil- Unlike the other countries, Brazil celebrates Easter in the autumn because of its geographical location. In spite of the different traditions Easter around the world, all countries have faith in the same concept, i.e. the concept of spending quality time with friends and family members and celebrating the rebirth of Spring."
9,Toastmasters in the City of London,news-society," Ever since Norman era, the ""Square Mile"" or ""City"" of London has been the capital's centre for commercial activities and worldwide fiscal dealings. The City is a democratic self-governing entity with its own mayor and is deep in history, tradition, and what can be seen as usual formal practices. One such practice is that the Toastmaster does not put on a red tailcoat, as an alternative he wears a black one. It is believed that the cause for this is that traditionally, a foxhunt could not pass through the city streets and Toastmaster's red coats are reminiscent of mounted foxhunters, it is preferable that the toastmaster retains a less ostentatious appearence. Conversely, this guiding principle leads to a problem of identity. A Toastmaster's work in the city is inevitable at Mansion House (quarters of the mayor) or Guildhall or any of the 40 Livery Halls where official celebrations are normally held, frequently with members of the royal family, government and Heads of State in attendance. Regularly guests at such functions will be dressed in white tie and black tails, equally the Toastmaster, who will no longer be identifiable by his red jacket. A tasteful answer was created where Toastmasters would have a red and white sash over his right shoulder, which represents the colours of the City of London's coat of arms. This way, he stands out, although sometimes he gets confused with the Polish Ambassador! City Toastmasters demand a superior extent of familiarity and protocol than if they were performing further than the City of London. There are scores of fine differences in procedure, for instance, further than the city when introducing a guest spokesman with a post-nominal (eg OBE), the Toastmaster would state ""Pray silence for John Smith, an officer of the most excellent Order of the British Empire,"" but in the City, the Toastmaster only says ""Pray silence for John Smith."" One more case is how the Loyal Toast (""The Queen!"") Is introduced. Out of the City of London, the Toastmaster would bring into play his gavel and remark: ""Would you all please stand... And... Pray silence for the Chairman who will now propose the Loyal Toast"". In the city when we make this period in the meal (ahead of coffee is served) the Toastmaster just taps his gavel three times, not talking at all, and the host will stand and pronounce: ""The Queen!"" Which will be followed by all guests standing up and repeating the exclamation."
10,Peter Orszag's early life,news-society," Peter Orszag, the famous American economist and currently the vice chairman of global banking at Citigroup, has a long professional history, and after being born in Lexington, Massachusetts has ascended from success to success. Prior to his role at the Citigroup organization, Orszag was already involved with the Council of Foreign Relations, acting as a Distinguished Visiting Fellow and often contributing to the New York Times with his own column. Of course, the primary role that Orszag is renowned for is his role under the Barack Obama administration, where he would scrutinize the budget deficit and make key decisions that would change the life of everyday Americans. Orszag has an equally successful educational background, graduating from the Phillips Exeter Academy in 1987 with high honors, and earning an A.B. summa cum laude in economics in 1991, from Princeton University. Furthermore, his educational background boasts a M.Sc. and a PhD in economics, in 1992 and 1997 respectively, both from the London School of Economics. With interests and academic ability beyond the realms of economics, Orszag even has membership to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies of Science, as well as Phi Beta Kappa. In his earlier life, during the early 1990s, he was taught by notorious by renowned economist Alan Blinder of Princeton University, only later to be mentored by Robert Rubin.  This successful academic background, and his involvement with economic studies for so many years has without question allowed him to continue success in later life, becoming a prominent American political figure of the new millennium. After his endeavors in University, Orszag continued his work in economics and soon became a Deputy Director of Economic Studies at Brookings Institution. Here he directed the Hamilton Project, a project which ‘seeks to advance America’s promise of opportunity, prosperity and growth’. This important role expanded Orszag’s portfolio and allowed him to enter the world of real and effective economic work. He worked under this project with the intent to foster economic growth by enhancing individual economic security and embracing government investments. After serving as a Special Assistant to the President for Economic Policy between 1997 and 1998, and as the Senior Economist on the Council of Economic Advisers between 1995 and 1996, Orszag continued his important political role for President Barack Obama as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget."
11,Pardons Are a Privilege Not a Right in Canada,news-society," It may just be that the Canadian justice system could include more people in the process of rehabilitation and reform by seeing that they are guided through the pardon system and motivated to become productive citizens more efficiently. The system for discharging former convictions leaves the onus solely on the released offender to take care of the proceedings. This article will explore ideas that could result in a greater awareness of this privilege and services to assist them. Perhaps there would be less recidivism if loans and counseling were available to make sure everyone has a chance to get their pardon as soon as they are eligible. Those who have been incarcerated or been assessed fines or probation for criminal offences are left with a criminal record that can affect future employment and ability to travel. If there is a job for which you must be bonded, the criminal record will prevent you from being hired. While it is true that most people who managed to get into trouble aren't executives, if they were they wouldn't be able to sit on a board of directors. They wouldn't be able to buy a franchise or obtain a liquor license to open a restaurant or a bar. There is even difficulty enrolling in an education program. There are two respective waiting periods to apply for a pardon after the sentence has been completely satisfied: five years for Indictable Offences and three years for the less serious Summary Offences. The reason that counseling and assistance for getting Canadian pardons should be available for borderline offenders is that it will provide less opportunity for another slip-up that would result in another charge, especially for those who may have some resentment towards society if they feel shut out. It doesn't take much for a flash of temper to ignite some situation out of proportion. Criminals who have been guests of the state for any length of time usually have a different perspective on how they should be treated so there should be a social worker or other third party assigned to notify the offender that the waiting period is up and that assistance is available if the fee is the only problem. It may be that they haven't been told of the benefits of asking for the pardon. There are many pardon services companies in operation to do the work and streamline the application. It would seem logical that the fees on applications collected by the National Parole Board could go back into looking for more people to pardon as soon as possible, even if they have to lend them the money. This could create a greater percentage of former offenders with clear records who are ready to go full steam into any work they like. Moreover, they may need to travel out of the country to work and require a U.S.A. entry waiver to cross the border or go through an airport. Of course a pardon is not an automatic right but a privilege that must be earned. If some flexibility was put into place however, it could make a positive difference in hundreds of lives. Part of building a career is motivation and not everyone can be self-motivated, they often need a hand up."
12,Why do 1 in 5 Americans perceive Obama as a Muslim?,news-society," US President has turned up a hornet’s nest with his suggestion that a mosque be built on ground zero where the twin towers of the World Trade Center existed in New York. Now speculations are rife that he is recommending this probably because he is a Muslim, as his name suggests. According to a recent poll by Pew Research Centre, close to one in every five Americans think wrongly that Obama is a Muslim, which is a far higher number than people who thought the same when he took up residence in the White House. The survey was conducted by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center and its affiliated Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life and was based on interviews conducted before the controversy over whether Muslims should be permitted to construct a mosque near the World Trade Center site. Little idea about their president Only 34% of people polled correctly answered that Obama is a Christian. 43% said they had no clue about his religion, showing how little the Americans knew about the person who holds the privilege of being the ‘most powerful man on the planet’. Most of the people (close to 60% of the respondents who felt he was a Muslim) said their perceptions were largely influenced by media information or mis-information in this case. And this feeling gained momentum once he supported suggestions by Muslim groups to construct an Islamic cultural centre and mosque near the 9/11 terror attack site. The issue about the has also brought to the fore, the underlying and growing religious intolerance of US citizens, who consider all brown-skinned people as Pakistanis, unaware about the diversity of the different cultures in the Asian sub-continent. Xenophobia has become rife in a country which was better known as the land for the free and fearless at one point of time. But post-9/11, people are on the edge and distrust most Asians, which is unfair. Where ignorance is bliss, is it truly folly to be wise? The Pew survey results show how important a role the media plays when it tries to influence people with their perception of reality. With the current viewpoint about Obama’s religion, his political career could see a period of turmoil, since most Americans have a not so favorable view about Muslims. When Obama supported the creation of a mosque on ground zero, doubts started creeping into the citizens’ mind about his religious beliefs, which could have a direct impact on his popularity. He has already faced a lot of opposition on the health reform bill which he pushed through the Senate and the Pew poll shows that now 41% of respondents disapprove of his job performance as compared to 26% who voiced their disapproval in the agency’s March 2009 poll. Following this poll Joshua DuBois, White House faith adviser shared his unhappiness and blamed certain factions in the media and his opponents for creating this wrong impression. ""While the president has been diligent and personally committed to his own Christian faith, there are certainly folks who are intent on spreading falsehoods about the president and his values and beliefs,"" he reportedly said. Now the White House’s public relations machinery will have to work on an overdrive to highlight that Obama was actually born to a Kenyan father and an American mother. He grew up in Hawaii when his father left for Africa, when Obama was just two. He was raised by his maternal grandparents and incidentally his grandfather, Hussein Onyango Obama, was a Muslim. The bone of contention The Islamic educational culture centre which also houses a mosque whose construction Obama supported is actually two blocks away from Ground Zero. This 13-story building is led by the Cordoba Initiative, which is headed by Imam Faisal Abdul Rauf, a cleric with a mosque in New York, who also belongs to an advocacy group that promotes improved relations between Islam and the West. The group aims to educate local masses about the actual teachings of the Islam and showcase that the religion is not fundamentalist in nature nor does it preach hatred. The message that the group wanted to spread is that ordinary Muslim Americans and most Muslims around the world do not subscribe to the terror attacks carried out by a minority faction in their community, under the guise of religion. Ironically, their centre itself has now come in the eye of the storm, with strong opposition from major Republican leaders. Amongst them is former House Speaker Newt Gingrich who claimed that ""Nazis do not have the right to put up a sign next to the Holocaust Museum in Washington. We would never accept the Japanese putting up a sight next to Pearl Harbor. There is no reason for us to accept a mosque next to the World Trade Center."" Obama on the other hand tried to fervently convince his opponents, during an iftar dinner (a dinner which signals the end of a day-long fast during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan) telling that the believed that Muslims have the same right to practice their religion as every other person in this country. And if they wish to build a place of worship and a community center on private property in lower Manhattan, in accordance with local laws and ordinances, then such a move should not be opposed. Bouquets and brickbats thrown in together Obama has found some supporters for his move like New York City Mayor Michael R Bloomberg, who also supported the planned mosque. He described that Obama’s views were ""a clarion defense of the freedom of religion"". But Republicans like former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin asked Obama, whether they should permit the building of the mosque steps away from where radical Islamists killed 3000 people? The mosque is just a symbol now which shows what the general public opinion is about religious tolerance, especially a religion which has unfortunately been linked to most terror attacks to the world over. Co-relating its construction with the perceived religious beliefs or even the religion that the President of United States subscribes is not only foolish, but also counter-productive to his detractors in the long run. Obama’s overtures to the construction of the Islamic center is a positive step in telling the world that the US is not prejudiced against any religion and supports their right to practice it peacefully in the country. One can only hope that his political peers see how this message will help assuage millions who have been trained to believe that the US is a demon to hated and feared and then inducted in terror camps in certain countries. http://www.newscollective.com/blog/?p=3385"

15,Smoke-free Condominiums Become a Popular Tendency,news-society," The Chicago City Council implemented a multipronged clean air decree, which took effect on January16, 2006 and was subsequently expanded on July1, 2008 with a few huge fines for those who do not observe. In spring 2009, a 24-story high-rise apartment block became Chicago’s first smoke-free apartment building. Law officers state that condominium (also called condo) associations have statutory right to make their condominiums smoke free, as well as they are free to ban pets. There is no state or federal right for people to smoke. Thus it was not a surprise that owners of a luxurious 28-unit high-rise on the Gold Coast, decided to become Illinois’ first smoke-free condominium building, by banning all tobacco products on their territory and individual residences Smoke-free apartments and condo buildings are becoming popular, probably because people begin to think about the dangerous effects of environmental tobacco smoke, according to real estate experts. ""In addition to offering healthier living conditions for residents, the vote to ban smoking at 28-unit high-rise on the Gold Coast also fulfils conditions of the Environmental Tobacco Smoke Control (ETSC), a requirement for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED),"" declared Brian Lozell, deputy vice president of DK Condo, the condominium association’s management firm. Valuators state that the resale value of smoke-free condominium buildings is usually higher than buildings that permit smoking. Smoke-free policies also reduce condo associations’ exploitation costs by decreasing cleaning costs and dropping the risk of fire. Current citywide survey conducted by the Chicago Tobacco Prevention Project demonstrates that about a third of all leaseholders in Chicago would be ready to pay more rent in order to live in smoke-free buildings. All these findings concur with an increasing popularity in the Chicago rental market whereunder lessors and property managers are switching their rental properties to non-smoking areas, stated Maurice Ortiz, Chief Marketing Officer of the Apartment People, a leading apartment-finding service. The survey showed that the cost of turning over an apartment at the end of rental contract can be 90% higher as when the apartment has been occupied by a smoking leaseholder. But it is not just the cost savings that attract so much property owners. Environmentally-friendly apartments are simply easier to rent. According to Chicago study there is an increasing awareness among potential renters about the hazards of secondhand smoke, with 88% of those surveyed considering secondhand smoke as a dangerous health threat. ""That awareness demonstrated the desire of people to have a healthier lifestyle, to live, work and rest in smoke-free environments,"" stated Dave Fako, whose company has led the survey involving approximately 400 adult renters. http://www.cigarettespub.com/cigarettes-news/smoke-free-condominiums-become-a-popular-tendency"
16,Assisted Living Residents Reflect On The 50th Anniversary Of The JFK Inaugural Speech,news-society," ""Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans."" The insightful quote delivered by President John F. Kennedy in his inaugural speech fifty years ago on January 20, 1961 seemed as though it was tailor-made to fit the baby boomer generation. Most of these baby boomers now live in Assisted Living Facilities and Skilled Nursing Facilities. Even though the oldest boomers were only fifteen years old at the time, President Kennedy’s words exuded among other things, optimism, a hallmark of the generation. The birth of some 70+ million baby boomers indeed made history, and may even be the reason why they are in their own right, idealists. Born in the post World War II era between 1946 and 1964, the generation grew up in a time of prosperity and reform in the U.S. that gave them the advantage of believing they could make a difference in the world. They questioned out dated authority systems and challenged the status quo. Born of parents who suffered through the hardships of the Great Wars and the Depression era, Boomers quickly discovered that life for them had so much more to offer.  Boomers, well educated and widely associated with privilege, affluence and influence. As a group, they are considered the healthiest, most educated and wealthiest generation. Echoed in the words of JFK, ""Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival and the success of liberty,"" the boomer generation believes in freedom, at home and abroad. Their beliefs in the importance of individual freedom and choice as Americans spurred the generation into making tremendous contributions to various social change such as the civil rights movement, gay rights movement, feminist movement, right to privacy and rights of the handicapped. Over the last five decades since JFK’s inaugural speech, the generation has come of age and the majority of them have affirmed their commitment to establish and preserve these rights. The admiration for President Kennedy extended well beyond a generation of Americans, and never seemed as evident as when I saw his framed photograph on the library bookshelf of a Russian immigrant. The ""puposka,"" as she liked to call herself, had left communist Russia with her elderly mother a few years after President Kennedy’s assassination. I once asked her about it and she said that, ""he was a great leader and his pursuit of liberty was something we continue to strive for as a people."" So many of the inaugural quotes still ring true and hold credence today in our conflicted political climate. Some of the favorites are: ""So let us begin anew -- remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof. Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate."" ""To those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free, we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny. We shall not always expect to find them supporting our view. But we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own freedom -- and to remember that, in the past, those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside."" ""Divided there is little we can do -- for we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split asunder."" Many Assisted Living residents fondly reflect on their fallen hero and his principles that still hold strong today. Some Assisted Living Facilities arrange story telling sessions so that children can learn about their residents' experiences during the times of JFK. Baby boomers living in Assisted Living Facilities have a bonding experience with the children as they are able to pass on their stories and relive the moments of their life through their stories."

18,How To Make Great School Newspapers,news-society," Are you ready to move your school newspaper forward, making it more exciting and interesting than ever before? If the answer is yes, then this article can help you to jump-start your project with the top five things that a good school newspaper should include. News. This one seems like a given; however, it can be tough to come up with good news items. Unless you are writing a student column, try to veer away from world-wide issues, instead focusing on things that pertain to school or will be of interest to readers. Anybody can print an newspaper about a flood in a foreign country; only you can write about the cement being laid for the new gym or have an interview with a new teacher. Always keep an open eye, watching for news tips that involve the school, school activities, or students. Student columns. Okay, it’s easy to realize that very few school students will want to write a column once a week or even once a month; even the most dedicated writers will often find themselves swamped with extra-cirricular activities or simply burnt out of ideas. Rather than have the same students write every month, consider rotating, allowing a wide-variety of aspiring writers to participate. Three columnist sections will let a lot of students experience writing if rotated among classes. Names of columnists can be randomly drawn, allowing everyone an equal experience at writing. Sports. Sports are a big part of any school so, obviously, they need to have some time devoted to them. While winning the biggest game of the season might be front-page news, sports sections can also be devoted to reviews of practices, introductions to players, and even games that are lost. Reach out to even those who aren't interested in sports by explaining what the game is all about and encouraging them to come watch. Photos. Having photos in your paper adds an extra special touch. Not only will they help readers to connect with the stories, but they also make the paper more attractive and more people want to read it. You can choose to just have one dedicated photographer or split the responsibility up with several students. Additional submissions. Try to incorporate as many students as possible for newsletter submission. If you know someone who is good at drawing, see if they would be interested in in doing a comic strip. By having lots of different students submitting to the paper, their friends and family members will be more likely to read. By including a wide variety of other students, adding good content, and trying your best, your school newspaper will be a wonderful success!"
19,Is Smoking a Harmful Behavior for Men and Women,news-society," Smoking cigarettes accounts for between 40% and 60% of the difference in men and women's mortality right across Europe, new research reveals. Alcohol accounts for around 20% of the gender gap. The findings, published in the journal Tobacco Control, highlight the need for public health measures to tackle these harmful behaviors. Women have outlived men in some European countries since the middle of the 18th century, and since the late 1990s, there has been evidence that women in every country in the world can expect to live longer than their male compatriots. The reasons for this difference have been hotly debated; some attribute the gender gap to biology, while others point to men's (relative) unwillingness to seek out medical care when they need it. One area which has been largely neglected is the influence of health behaviors on the gender gap in death rates. In this study, scientists in the UK used World Health Organization (WHO) data on death rates in 30 European countries from the year 2005. They studied differences between the genders in deaths from all causes as well as deaths from smoking-related conditions and alcohol-related deaths. The results revealed that although the death rates from all causes were higher for men than for women in all countries studied, the scale of the gender gap varied widely, from 188 (per 100,000 of the population per year) 'excess' deaths among men in Iceland to 942 in Ukraine. Generally speaking, the gender gap was higher in Eastern Europe; all countries with a gender gap over 400 per 100,000 were in this region. The lowest gender gaps were found in Cyprus, Greece, Iceland, Sweden and the UK, which all recorded gaps of under 230 per 100,000. Smoking accounted for between 38% and 60% of the gender gap in all countries, with the exception of Malta, where smoking was behind 74% of the excess deaths. According to the researchers, variations in the proportion of excess deaths due to smoking tobacco can be attributed to gender differences in the uptake of smoking in different countries in earlier decades. Meanwhile alcohol-related deaths accounted for between 20% and 30% of the gender gap in Eastern Europe and between 10% and 20% elsewhere. However, in all 30 countries studied, the contribution of smoking to the gender gap in all-cause mortality was greater than that of alcohol. The scientists point out that it should not come as a surprise that smoking and drinking are such significant drivers of the gender gap in life expectancy, as these behaviors 'have long been a powerful way of portraying gendered identities'. Furthermore, the researchers note, 'it has been suggested that cultural portrayals of drinking keep shifting to maintain a gendered distinction in drinking behaviors, so that as men and women both modify their drinking behaviors, considerable effort is devoted to constructing men's drinking in different ways to women's drinking.' The fact that young smokers continue to take up smoking and engage in harmful patterns of alcohol consumption suggests that public health measures are urgently needed to tackle these behaviors. The fact that these behaviors appear to be linked to gender identities means that dealing with them will not be easy. 'These behaviors are culturally bound and these cultural constructions of behaviors are partially shaped by and exploited by the alcohol and tobacco industries,' the researchers warn. Looking to the future, the team predicts that the gender gap due to smoking will dwindle in the coming decades. They concluded that it may still be several decades before profound changes in gender differences in smoking in some of these countries are reflected in a smaller contribution of smoking-related deaths to a reduced gender gap in mortality.

20,TV Allures Smokers Into Smoking,news-society," Brain areas associated with smoking an Esse cigarette are activated when smokers watch an actor light up on screen If your New Year's resolutions include a plan to give up smoking, you might want to avoid the TV and steer clear of movies for a while, too. Scientists have found that simply watching movie stars take a drag on a cheap cigarette is enough to spark a pattern of activity in smokers' brains that mirrors the act of lighting up. This response to seeing smoking on screen is thought to make cravings more intense for those who are trying to quit a habit that kills 5 million people worldwide each year. The researchers scanned the brains of smokers and non-smokers while they watched film stars puff on a cigarette. The scans showed that specific parts of the brain went into action, but only if the person were a smoker. The particular brain areas were involved in planning and coordinating movements in the person's smoking hand – as if the brain were preparing itself for the physical actions required for smoking. Other brain circuits that dealt with urges and rewards also flickered into life when smokers saw actors light up on screen. At the end of the study, it was the smokers who had the most active reward circuits who said they craved a cigarette the most. The work provides fresh insight into the challenge smokers’ face when they try to quit, but so far there is no good evidence that watching movies that contain smoking scenes actually reduces a person's chances of kicking the habit. The finding, reported in the Journal of Neuroscience, builds on previous research that found smokers were more likely to fancy a cigarette after watching films that included smoking scenes. ""When a smoker sees someone smoking, their brain seems to simulate the movements they would make if they were having a cigarette themselves,"" said Todd Heatherton at the Centre for Social Brain Sciences at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. While former smokers might be able to avoid some social situations that could tempt them to smoke again, the ubiquity of movies and television makes it hard to escape the occasional smoking scene, the researchers said. ""In our daily lives we constantly get impulses to do things and often we don't know where they come from. If we can identify how something like a movie can affect us, then perhaps it will at least help us deal with it,"" Heatherton said. He and his graduate student, Dylan Wagner, invited 17 smokers and 17 non-smokers to watch the first half hour of the 2003 Ridley Scott movie Matchstick Men while their brains were scanned by functional magnetic resonance imaging. The researchers chose the film because it features smoking prominently, but lacks scenes of sex, violence and alcohol use. When smokers viewed the smoking tobacco scenes, there was greater activity in part of the brain called the intraparietal sulcus and other structures that play a role in perceiving and coordinating physical movements. Reward circuits in a brain region called the dorsal anterior cingulated cortex also lit up. None of those who took part knew the study was looking at smoking. There are 1.2 billion smokers around the world, more than 900 million of them living in developing countries. Researchers at Harvard School of Public Health estimate that there were 4.83m premature deaths in 2000as a result of smoking, mostly from heart disease and lung cancer. Last year, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that smoking scenes in movies made adolescents more likely to smoke. Although smoking scenes have become less common in recent years, around half of popular movies included smoking in some form in 2009, the organization said.

1,Illegal Workers And Identity Theft,news-society," Identification theft is a rising downside all through the United States and the world. As many as nine million individuals on this country could have their identities stolen every year. One source of identity theft, though not the one one, is the observe of illegal workers utilizing someone else's Social Safety Number to obtain work and housing. Usually, the identities used are of kids or the very elderly, as a result of these people aren't prone to discover that their identities are being used elsewhere to help somebody get a job. If the Social Security Administration's records do not match employee data, that employee's Social Safety incomes will probably be dispatched to a ""suspense file."" These information have been round since 1937, and by 2004, accounted for nearly six billion dollars in wages. This money got here from more than 2 hundred sixty million W-2 types that did not match the information that they were supposed to. Theft from unlawful staff is the most seen cause for this to happen. Over ninety percent of cases of identification theft are resulting from this reason. Nevertheless, you could additionally discover it taking place if a employee has changed names without reporting it, or other information issues have occurred. While nearly all of identity theft by undocumented employees is finished in an try to get a job, some incidents are more sinister. Bank fraud is one other very common motive someone – whether legitimately in the country or not – may attempt to steal your identity. Since a federal immigration reform in 1986, employers have been required to maintain the SSN and other info of any employee on hand. Because of this all illegal immigrants who're attempting to get a job that doesn't pay underneath the desk have to search out some way to give a valid social safety number – and that number could also be yours. Lately, the Legislature held an interim meeting to discuss this problem, after which, the Bush administration announced a brand new coverage to attempt to curb this problem. However, this coverage is present beneath litigation, and has been briefly positioned beneath a restraining order until its validity under the Constitution might be proven. Until the federal government is able to take an appropriate step to curb identity theft by undocumented staff, there are a few things you are able to do yourself. Ensuring that each one your personal paperwork have been shredded, using a contemporary cross-reduce shredder, is one technique to maintain your identity safe. As well as, watch out what kind of info you set out in public, and maintain a close eye on your private identification – driver's license, Social Security card, etc. - at all times. These methods will assist guard against conventional id theft – the kind that can involve bank fraud and wreck your credit. Nevertheless, there's not lots you can do to stop somebody from randomly selecting your SSN in an try to get a job. Until more appropriate laws comes into being, there's little we can to do protect ourselves from that problem. Thus now you understand more about Illegal Employees and Identity Theft."
2,13th Zodiac Sign Ophiuchus Generates Excitement For Assisted Living Facilities Los Angeles Residents,news-society," Astronomers from the Minnesota Planetarium Society have found that because of the moon's gravitational pull on Earth, the alignment of the stars has been pushed back by about a month. According to conjecture, star signs were created some 2,000 years ago by tracking where the sun was in the sky each month. Not to be confused with the science of astronomy, which studies actual planets and stars, the astrologists amongst us concentrate on horoscopes. Horoscopes are determined by the position of the sun on the day you were born and how it lines up with the stars. ""When astrologers say that the sun is in Pisces, it's really not in Pisces,"" noted Parke Kunkle, a member of the group's board, especially now because of the gravitational pull. A 13th constellation, Ophuchicus, has been added to the Zodiac calendar and most of the dates for the ""signs"" we’ve so long associated with our birthdates, have, according to the Minnesota Planetarium Society changed. This has generated excitement and quite a bit of hype for Assisted Living Facilities Los Angeles residents and those in other parts of the nation. Whether or not people believe that Zodiac signs really determine personality traits, the interest generated among my colleagues upon hearing my article topic, confirms that  many people not only know their astrological sign, but they identify with many of the attributes. Yikes, does this means the latent, fiery temperament and radiant warmth of a Leo may be extinguished?  That the lion will no longer attract people because of their frank, open, honest and endearing likeability? The change may leave the optimistic, intellectual, straightforward, freedom loving Sagittarius rigid and restless. The archer may find him or herself unable to hit the bull’s-eye and become disillusioned. The earth’s newly discovered skew could actually be good news for the former conflicted Pisces fish. No longer will they suffer the internal struggles of their souls eternally swimming against the current in opposite directions. All kidding aside, this celestial shift and addition of Ophuchicus in the zodiac calendar could cause an identity crisis for some people. The many seniors who rely on astrologers to reveal what their futures hold could become victims of greed. Assisted Living Facilities Los Angeles staff have informed their residents of possible scams and fraud situations that could arise due to the Ophuchicus hype. Plenty of seniors have been victim to zodiac hotline fraud cases. Unsuspecting seniors call these hotline numbers to get their fortunes told while their credit cards are charged exhorbitant fees. In order to prevent such cases many Assisted Living Facilities Los Angeles have security measures put in place so that they can monitor and supervise their residents to prevent them from being swindled. At one time or another, many of us have secretly wished to know what the future holds in store for us. The yearning for such information has existed for as long as human beings have been able to speculate and hypothesize about events to come. It is a curiosity that fuels ongoing interest in the vague prophesies of French prophet, Nostradamus more than half a millennium after his ""Centuries"" forecast was penned and makes today's newspaper incomplete without an astrology section. Many religions lay claim to have knowledge of the future but their predictions are about eternity, not tomorrow. Yet, it is the tomorrows, about which we are most imminently interested in. There is no evidence indicating there is a mystical cure for this insatiable thirst to know future events. No astrologer contemplating the distribution of the heavenly bodies, no shaman pondering the configuration of chicken innards, no fortuneteller examining the topography of a client's palm can do more than guess at tomorrow's contents. Still there is a large segment of our society, which believe that our lives are ordered by the stars, the gods, the fates or perhaps other people with occult powers. Every spring the Chamber of Commerce in a small community on the outskirts of Chicago sponsors a ""Fortunetelling Day"" at a local shopping mall. They invite tellers to perform and set up booths for them, then bus in senior citizens for a day of shopping and fun. The fortune tellers charge five dollars a reading and each earns several hundred dollars for their day's work. When a bunco detective suggested that the event be discontinued because of the probability that the tellers were inviting exploitable clients to visit their fortunetelling parlors and then fleecing them, his recommendation was rejected. ""Fortunetelling is legal in that community,"" he was reminded. Not only that, but ""Fortunetelling Day"" is one of the most popular events of the year. Fortunetelling and astrology continues to hold fascination for many, with the attitude that, ""I don’t necessarily believe in it, but what can it hurt?"" Well, actually plenty. One mother and daughter fortune telling team of East Peoria, Illinois, are still free and are assumed to be somewhere in Europe. They were charged with swindling fifteen women out of $600,000. Additional victims are known to the police but those victims refuse to press charges or testify in court. Most were too humiliated and embarrassed at being so gullible. Undoubtedly, there are other, unknown victims who for the same reason will not admit their involvement with the fortunetellers. One of the victims, a widow who agreed to testify, was swindled out of over $200,000 in cash and jewelry. The fortunetellers also got her to buy them a $30,000 Cadillac DeVille. The second largest loser was a woman taken for $180,000. Like the others, most of the victims were elderly although there were several college-educated professional women in their twenties and thirties among the victims. The moral of the story if you choose to indulge in fortune telling and horoscope reading; be aware that fortunetellers and astrological advocates with smoky voices surrounded by candles, potions, magic balls and charms, may not be the best source to determine if you’ll find happiness, or if you’ll have enough money left at the end of the month to pay your electrical bill. Possibly not. For hard-core horoscope enthusiasts, the following is the new astrological calendar: Capricorn:  January 20 - February 16 Aquarius:  February 17 - March 11 Pisces:  March 12 - April 18 Aries:  April 19 - May 13 Taurus:  May 14 - June 21 Gemini:  June 22 - July 20 Cancer:  July 21 – August 10 Leo:  August 11 - September 16 Virgo:  September 17 – October 30 Libra:  October 31 - November 23 Scorpio:  November 24 – November 29 Ophiuchus: November 30  – December 16 (the new one) Sagittarius:  December 17 – January 20 You can check the new astrological calendar to see if your zodiac sign has shifted and/or if you are now an Ophiuchus. If you think Ophiuchus is a tongue twister it has also been known as Serpentarius."
3,"2012:  The Theories, The Prophecies, The Aftermath",news-society," The thought of the year 2012 brings to the minds of many images of gloom and doom, death and destruction, and the potential reemergence of mankind from its ashes.  In the last few years there have been countless books, movies and television specials discussing what the authors believe will happen on December 21, 2012.  After investigating all of the available evidence, I have come to my own conclusion as to what will happen on that highly anticipated date. Before I jump to the punch line and tell you what I believe, let's spend a few minutes investigating some of the prophecies that have been associated with the 2012 event.. And, take a look at as some of the theories describing what is believed will happen. The Maya created a number of different calendars to record the passage of time.  One of them is called the ""Calendar Round"".  We learned about this calendar from a book, known as the Dresden Codex.  It was spared the burning frenzy of the early Christian priests in Mexico.  The Calendar Round is made up of two separate calendar systems used by the Maya.  The Tzolk'on or 260 day Sacred Calendar and the Haab, the 365 day vague calendar.  When combined they form a new calendar that measures 52 years. The Calendar Round can only distinguish 52 years then starts repeating itself.  The Mayans needed a more refined dating method.  To ensure that dates could be identified over these extended periods, the Maya devised the ""Long Count"" calendar.  We became aware of the Long Count through the study of various stelae found in the ruins of many abandoned Mayan cities. The Long Count identifies the number of days that have passed since the beginning of the last Great Cycle.  A great Cycle has a length of 13 baktuns or 1,872,000 days (5,125.36 years).  Once completed, like the odometer on your car, the calendar resets itself to 0 (zero).  The accepted start date of the current Great Cycle, as proposed by Sir J. Eric S. Thompson, is August 13, 3114 BCE.  By adding 1,872,000 days to August 13, 3114 BC we arrive at the date December 21, 2012 - the ""end of the Mayan Calendar"". While the Mayan Calendar provides us with a date for its completion, some researchers believe that other prophecies support the end of a great cycle is fast approaching.  According to the Hopi Indians, as reported by White Feather - a Hopi of the ancient Bear Clan - to a minister named David Young in 1958, these are the signs of the end times: ""The Fourth World shall end soon, and the Fifth World will begin. This the elders everywhere know. The Signs over many years have been fulfilled, and so few are left."" ""This is the First Sign: We are told of the coming of the white-skinned men, like Pahana, but not living like Pahana men who took the land that was not theirs. And men who struck their enemies with thunder."" ""This is the Second Sign: Our lands will see the coming of spinning wheels filled with voices. In his youth, my father saw this prophecy come true with his eyes -- the white men bringing their families in wagons across the prairies."" ""This is the Third Sign: A strange beast like a buffalo but with great long horns, will overrun the land in large numbers. These White Feather saw with his eyes -- the coming of the white men's cattle."" ""This is the Fourth Sign: The land will be crossed by snakes of iron."" ""This is the Fifth Sign: The land shall be criss-crossed by a giant spider's web."" ""This is the Sixth sign: The land shall be criss-crossed with rivers of stone that make pictures in the sun."" ""This is the Seventh Sign: You will hear of the sea turning black, and many living things dying because of it."" ""This is the Eight Sign: You will see many youth, who wear their hair long like my people, come and join the tribal nations, to learn their ways and wisdom."" ""And this is the Ninth and Last Sign: You will hear of a dwelling-place in the heavens, above the earth, that shall fall with a great crash. It will appear as a blue star. Very soon after this, the ceremonies of my people will cease."" ""These are the Signs that great destruction is coming. The world shall rock to and fro. The white man will battle against other people in other lands -- with those who possessed the first light of wisdom. There will be many columns of smoke and fire such as White Feather has seen the white man make in the deserts not far from here. Only those which come will cause disease and a great dying. Many of my people, understanding the prophecies, shall be safe. Those who stay and live in the places of my people also shall be safe. Then there will be much to rebuild. And soon -- very soon afterward -- Pahana will return. He shall bring with him the dawn of the Fifth World. He shall plant the seeds of his wisdom in their hearts. Even now the seeds are being planted. These shall smooth the way to the Emergence into the Fifth World."" The signs, over the years, have been interpreted as follows: The First Sign is the arrival of the white man with his guns.  The Second Sign is of the pioneers' covered wagons.  The Third Sign is of longhorn cattle.  The Fourth Sign describes the railroad tracks.  The Fifth Sign is a clear image of our electric power and telephone lines.  The Sixth Sign describes concrete highways and their mirage-producing effects.  The Seventh Sign foretells of oil spills in the ocean.  The Eighth Sign clearly indicates the ""Hippy Movement"" of the 1960s.  The Ninth Sign was the U.S. Space Station Skylab, which fell to Earth in 1979.  According to Australian eye-witnesses, it appeared to be burning blue. The Hindu Yuga cycle has also been linked by many as supporting the December 21, 2012 date.  According to Hindu Tradition, the length of all life here on earth is described as one day in the life of Brahma, the god of this universe.  When Brahma awakens, the universe appears.  When he sleeps, it disappears.  It is said that one day in the life of Brahma lasts for 4,320,000 years. Each day in the life of Brahma is broken down into ages or yugas.  They include:  the Satya Yuga, the Treta Yuga, the Dwapar Yuga and the Kali Yuga.  Without going into a lot of detail regarding the math that supports these ages, it is believed that the Satya Yuga lasted for 1,728,000 years, the Treta Yuga, for 1,296,000 years and the Dwapar for 864,000 years.  It is also believed that we are now in the Kali Yuga.  The Kali Yuga is to last for 432,000 years.  At this time, Brahma will again slumber and our world (what we know of as our universe) will disappear from existence. Similar to the Long Count of the Maya, each Yuga has a particular characteristic.  The Satya Yuga, for example, can be roughly translated as the ""Age of Truth"".  It is sometimes thought of as the Golden Age of Man.  During this age, goodness and high ideals ruled supreme.  Human intelligence and consciousness were at their peak.  After 1,728,000 years of enlightenment we entered the Treta Yuga.  During the Treta Yuga, there was a fall in man's spiritual consciousness.  Moral and ethical ideals began to decline. As we moved into the Dwapar Yuga, man's level of consciousness was now 1/2 of where it was during the Satya Yuga.  It was during the Dwapar Yuga that man began using what he knew for his own personal comfort regardless of its impact on others.  According to the texts, during the final age, the Kali Yuga, man experiences a total loss of spiritual awareness.  Trapped in spiritual darkness, we can only comprehend our physical bodies and the objects within our physical world. Meaning ""Age of Vice"", the Kali Yuga is characterized by strife, discord and contention.  Evil and dishonesty has replaced the truth found in the Satya Yuga.  In the Hindu Text, the Vishnu Purana - thought to be written somewhere between 800 and 300BCE - we find a detailed description of the Kali Yuga.  Here are a few excerpts from this document. ""The minds of men will be wholly occupied in acquiring wealth; and wealth will be spent solely on selfish gratifications. Women will follow their inclinations, and be ever fond of pleasure. Men will fix their desires upon riches, even though dishonestly acquired."" ""The kings of Kali Yuga will be addicted to corruption and will seize the property of their subjects. Then property and wealth alone will confer rank; falsehood will be the only means of success. Corruption will be the universal means of subsistence."" ""Princes, instead of protecting, will plunder their subjects; and, under the pretext of levying customs, will rob merchants of their property. In the Kali age everyone who has cars and elephants and steeds will be a Rájá: everyone who is feeble will be a slave."" Based on society today, it seems as if we are well into the energy dynamics of the Kali Yuga. Prophecies derived from the Book of Revelation in the Bible have also provided ammunition to the 2012 debate.  Talk about Earth changes, the 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse and the Anti-Christ have added fuel to the fire of this already hot debate. A number of theories have emerged to explain what will happen at the end of the Mayan calendar.  The outcome (according to supporters) fall into two major camps.  These camps are as different from each other as day and night.  The most popular theories promoted are apocalyptic in nature.  They foretell of dramatic events which will virtually wipe mankind off of the face of the earth.  If I had to pick from these scenarios, the most likely outcome would be that we would blow ourselves up.  Nuclear weapons, a troubled economy and the growing threat of terrorism, all add to the stress and pressure governments face.  It only requires one badly played card before we are all potentially toast. Other popular theories include the Rapture which is found in the Book of Revelation.  According to this theory, the Rapture begins with ""the saved"" being taken up and off the Earth.  In the movie ""Left Behind"", these individuals just disappear, leaving the unworthy behind.  Once saved, Armageddon can begin in full force.  A war between good and evil follows and finally Jesus, flying in on his cloud, will return to end the fighting.  Associated with this theory (although not supported by fundamentalist Christians) is the belief that it is not Jesus who brings about the end of Armageddon, but aliens.  It is these same aliens who transport the worthy off the planet and save them from Armageddon. Additional end time theories include: the appearance of Planet-X (sometimes referred to as Niberu), solar winds, giant asteroids and even a magnetic poll shift.  Each of these potential events could end life on this planet. Switching theoretical sides, there are theories of a calmer and more transcendental nature.  According to some, on December 21, 2012 our planet will enter into what is called the Galactic Alignment.  This astronomical configuration is said to happen once every 26,000 years based upon the precession of the equinox.  Due to this astrological configuration it has been said that our planet will be aligned with the center of the galaxy.  This will cause our chakras (the energy centers within the body) to open, thus allowing the free flow of universal energy into our bodies. Similar to this theory is that the beginning of a new calendar cycle will usher in a new age.  It is often likened to the ""Age of Aquarius"" as a time of peace, love and understanding.  This shift would not be instantaneous.  Instead, changes to our consciousness and collective conscious would commence.  This shift would lead to a new, better and harmonious life here on Earth.  No one has identified how long this process would take, only that on December 21, it will have begun. The final theory associated with 2012 is that of ascension.  The Rapture describes saving individuals from an upcoming worldwide catastrophe.  In this scenario, the person is present on Earth one minute and gone the next.  Ascension theory is something like presented in the TV series ""StarGate"".  The character Daniel Jackson ascends and becomes one with the Ancients.  The concept of spiritual ascension is associated with a number of spiritual beliefs and practices.  Through self transformation, we as humans would no longer need our physical bodies and will transcend into a higher plane of being.  Proponents of this theory are unclear if ascension will happen December 21 or if it is the process of ascension will begin on that date.  In any case, this one sounds pretty good to me. The question I am most often asked when talking about 2012, is what will really happen to us.  Based upon my research to date, this is what I have deduced.  Starting bright and early on December 22, 2012 the sun will come up, we will rise from our slumber and we will begin a new grand and glorious day. You might ask how I came to this conclusion?  I am happy to share that information with you now. Let's return to the Hopi Prophecies.  According to their prophecies, it is the fulfillment of the identified events which will indicate the beginning of the Fifth World.  Compelling as they are, like the prophecies of Nostradamus, we are left with the question... Are we making assumptions about their true meaning?  What has been suggested as the fulfillment of the prophecies, is on face, value very persuasive but we will never know for sure. There are also problems when you factor in the Hindu Yugas.  The Kali Yuga is said to begin on the day Krishna died in 3100 BC.   The 3100BC start date of the Kali Yuga does make you contemplate its connection with the dates given for this cycle in the Mayan Calendar.  What many 2012 supporters do not tell you is that the Kali Yuga is identified as lasting for 432,000 years.  If you subtract the number of years that have passed since the start of the Kali Yuga, we still have roughly 427,000 years to go until this Yuga ends - and the universe as we know it will disappear. The math does not add up to any time in 2012. Over the centuries, prophecies derived from the Book of Revelation have been interpreted and re-interpreted to rationalize many of the difficult time periods we have encountered.  Is the Book of Revelations talking about what is going on now?  It could be.  But it could also have been describing the emperor Nero who banished John, the author of Revelations, to Patmos.  Over the years, this same text has been used to predict the end of the world numerous times. Finally we come to the Mayan Calendar.  The date of December 21, 2012 was determined by Sir J. Eric S. Thompson and is referred to as the Thompson Correlation.  As you may recall, Thompson stated that the current Great Cycle commenced on August 13, 3114BC.  This date has been generally accepted as the most likely start date of the cycle.  However, Thompson is not the only one who has proposed a start date.  If you add 1,872,000 days to some of the suggested alternative launch times , dates for the end of the Mayan Calendar have ranged from the year 1734 AD all the way through to the year 2532 AD. As you can see, there really isn't anything that directly supports the December 21, 2012 date.  It is really just a bunch of smoke and mirrors.  The net effect has been that many of us are afraid of what may, or may not, happen on that date!  If you are worried that the world is coming to an end, let it go.  Take a deep breath and open yourself up to contemplating a bright future ahead.  Before I go, I would like to ask each of you for one thing.  When you open your eyes on the morning of December 22nd, think of me, this message and say thank you. © Copyright Body, Mind & SoulHealer – soulhealer.com 2011. All rights reserved."
4,Tobacco Growers Triumph Over Results on Tobacco Control,news-society," Tobacco growers expressed triumph over the result of a recent world convention on tobacco control which was conducted in Uruguay and which supposedly resulted in the protection of the tobacco industry against too restrictive guidelines in the production of cigarettes. At the same time, the Philippine Tobacco Growers’ Association (PTGA), thanks to its president Winston Uy approved the Philippine delegation to the convention led by Trade Undersecretary Zenaida Maglaya for being able to persuade delegates from other countries not to depart from the true intensions of the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). Other members were from the Department of Health, Department of Agriculture and the UP College of Law. The Philippine delegation assisted at the 171-nation conference in Uruguay where guidelines on Articles 9 and 10 of the FCTC were discussed. The Philippines were against the proposed guidelines which were created to ban the use of particular ingredients in the production of cigarettes. Department of Trade and Industry instead was in favor of the regulation on the use of tobacco ingredients and even supported scientific evidence for the ban of any tobacco ingredient. Tobacco growers declared that an irregular and without any scientific base ban on ingredients will lead to a prohibition of blended cigarettes in the Philippines. ""This action would have an essential effect on tobacco manufacture, and would negatively affect tobacco growers, producers, retailers and affiliated industries,"" Uy stated. Speaking favorably of the Philippine delegation, the PTGA chief stated that it was very convincing for FCTC when speaking to delegates about the true intentions of the FCTC, which is to regulate the usage of tobacco ingredients and not adopt a complete ban on tobacco ingredients. Guidelines suggested by FCTC would have prohibited the usage of burley that is mainly grown in Philippines and is used in cigarette production. ""We are satisfied with the results. Our members became united in order to oppose the suggested guidelines,"" stated Andy Reyes, president of the Philippine Association of Tobacco-Based Cooperatives (PATCO). ""It better for the FCTC delegates to remember that the treaty intends to control the usage of tobacco, and not to eliminate tobacco industry,"" stated Uy. PTGA also charged anti-tobacco advocates of being hypocritical and lying, stating that they were under-represented in the Philippine delegation ""First of all, the debates in Uruguay involved governments so what is the ground for accession of the anti-tobacco organizations in the Philippine delegation?"" Uy asked. ""These anti-tobacco advocates haven’t grudged before when the original Philippine delegation consisted of the Department of Health, Department of Trade and Industry, and the UP College of Law Foundation,"" concluded Uy. http://www.cigarettespub.com/info/tobacco-growers-triumph-over-results-on-tobacco-control"
5,Levels of Nicotine Increase with Each Puff,news-society," Nicotine increases gradually in smokers' brains rather that spiking after each puff, according to a research that is aimed to find new ways to help people stop smoking. ""The nicotine increase in the brain was gradual over several minutes,"" Dr. Jed E. Rose of Duke University, reported at the online edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ""Researches have found out that the level of nicotine in the brain is increasing about seven seconds after each puff, but almost no measurements were taken until now,"" Rose declared in the interview. ""We were amazed to find that the level of absorption was much different from what one commonly hears,"" stated Rose, who leads the Duke Center for Nicotine and Smoking Cessation Research, a part of the university's School of Medicine. Rose used brain scanning images in order to measure the nicotine levels in 13 heavy smokers and 10 people who smoke from time to time, a sign that they were not addicted to nicotine. Maximum brain levels of nicotine were attained in 3 to 5 minutes, and increased slower in heavy smokers that in casual ones, the researches found. ""This slower rate was attained from nicotine persisting longer in the lungs of heavy smokers, which may be a result of the chronic effects of smoke on the lungs,"" Rose stated. ""Now that we clearly know that there are not these increases that were supposed, researches may be better able to elaborate new methods and ways to help smokers obtain what they need from tobacco products, but in a way that doesn’t cause addiction,"" Rose declared. For example his laboratory is working on a mist inhaler that delivers nicotine without any combustion. Still remains one question: Why do some people become addicted to tobacco products and others don’t? According to researches the difference in the level of nicotine increase in the brain doesn't explain this. This research was sponsored by the leading tobacco enterprises Philip Morris International and Philip Morris USA. The researches stated that enterprises hadn’t the role in carrying out the research or analyzing the results. Dr. Rose’s data corroborate his earlier work on blood levels of nicotine, and ""the brain is what really matters in this entire situation"" declared Dr. Kenneth A. Perkins, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh, who also investigates why smoking causes addiction. The supposition was that at a critical effect of smoking a doze of nicotine with each puff, then another doze with the next puff, and so on, Perkins declared. ""He is demonstrating that, at least when you look at the blood and brain concentration levels, what is going on is much more successive. Clinically, I am not quite sure what to do with this,"" Perkins, who haven’t participated at the Rose's research, concluded. http://www.shop-smoke.com/articles/levels-of-nicotine-increase-with-each-puff/index.html"
6,Six Steps to Successful Fundraising With Craft Shows,news-society," Although it requires a little more time and organization than a basic raffle or car wash, fundraising with craft shows is an excellent way to raise funds and raise awareness for your organization. Craft shows are also a great way for community organizations, schools and churches to reach out to their communities while raising funds. In today's economy with companies shutting down and unemployment on the rise, a lot of people today in all age ranges are getting into making & selling their crafts as a way to make money due to job loss supplement their unemployment or to supplement disability and retirement income. Many crafters are actually trying to build a business by showing at craft fairs too. Fundraising with craft shows take a little bit more effort, time and organization to set up but if you have a large enough organization to delegate out the different responsibilities, the end result is a lot of fun, meeting new people and raising funds and awareness. How do you get started? Follow these steps to a successful craft fair fundraiser: First, you need a place for people to set up. Craft fairs can be set up virtually anywhere that has level ground and is easy for visitors to move around in and for vendors to get set up in. Unlike flea markets, craft vendors often have items that may not fair well in inclement weather and their displays are a lot more organized and professional than you'd see at a typical yard sale or flea market. If you're planning an indoor/outdoor event, a paved lot is ideal so vendors can set up outdoor canopies with sides to protect their craft items. But it's also a great idea to offer some indoor or covered spaces as well, especially if some of your vendors require electricity for their displays. High schools often make use of as much space as possible; gymnasiums, auditoriums and even hallways if they're wide enough. Churches may have large social rooms and outdoor parking lots and local communities may use areas of parks or community halls. If you're a new organization without your own space, call around to different places that have large rooms and see what they charge to rent space. Depending on the place and your organization, you may be able to negotiate a discount. If you have a lot of 8-10 foot spaces available, fill them all up by charging less. If you charge too much, you may not get all your spaces filled up. If this is your first event, you might want to make this first year a special and either offer free space or a token $5.00 per space to get the most vendors. Other options would be offering a free space if the vendor brings his/her own table and $5.00 if you provide the table for them. You could also charge $5.00 if the vendor requests electricity. DonТt get greedy by trying to make money off the tables! Your organization will have other opportunities to raise funds at the event without gouging vendors for money to set up. Visitors want to see a lot of vendors when they come to your event. The more crafters, the more traffic, which equals more money raised. Advertising for vendors should be started as soon as you know where you're having the event and how many spaces are available. The earlier you get those ads out, the faster you'll fill up the spaces. Advertise heavily so you (1)get enough vendors; (2)get enough visitors! Event Lister (www.eventlister.com) is one of the most popular online services where vendors go to find places to set up. Locally, be sure to advertise to the local community with email, newsletters, flyers, and local newspaper ads. If your organization has a Facebook page and Twitter, use it a lot. Besides the main Facebook page, have your members post about the event on their individual Facebook pages too. All of your advertising should include a Crafters Needed statement and contact information. As soon as the advertising is out there, you want to be ready for the crafters to sign up. You should have your tables designated by number or letter or even section if it's a large area. Once the vendors send in the application, you assign them a space and write their name in that space. You can then call or email them back with their table assignment or you can appoint someone for the vendors to contact the day of the event about where they're to set up. As a vendor, I'd prefer knowing all of that ahead of time so I can go directly to my spot and start setting up without disturbing the event organizers. You want to have packets made up ahead of time for your vendors outlining certain conditions for the event; i.e., rain or shine, nonrefundable deposits if they don't show up, any liability claims or statements that are important, parking accommodations, setup dates and times and most importantly, directions to the craft show location. You want to make your event as organized as possible for the vendors. They're the ones who are going to make you money because once they've committed to being at the show, they're going to tell their friends and family and their clients. Word of mouth will always be a wonderful advertising resource. When a vendor contacts you about setting up, simply get their email or mailing address and send out an application with where to send the deposit - if you're charging for tables and space. The information you need on the application is: Their name Address Phone Email Website (if any) What type of craft item they're selling How much space they need Are they bringing their own tables or will they need them provided Do they need electricity When you receive a vendor application Once you receive this information or you get this information over the phone, you can assign them their space. Of course, if you're charging for the tables and spaces, that's your first way of fundraising with craft shows. But it doesn't stop there. Here are some ideas for raising the most funds with your event. Sell Baked Goods and Other Food. Many organizations set up tables filled with home-made baked goods and candies. If your location has a kitchen or food stand, sell sandwiches & drinks. You can give your vendors a special ticket for free coffee or drinks or even offer the vendors a free or discounted lunch. Have a Raffle. A great way for vendors to really showcase their crafts is to have a raffle. This can be optional or it can also be used as an incentive to set up. For instance, the fee for a table or space can simply be a donation of an item to be raffled off. Or you can advertise that it's an option for the vendor to donate one of their items. As you're setting up the tables or marking the spaces for the show, set aside an area specifically to set up the raffle items. Set a bag or container next to each item and sell raffle tickets to visitors as they enter. Vendors are also encouraged to participate in the raffle by buying tickets to try and win other vendors' items. Raffles are great fundraisers, especially when you have a wide variety of items on display. Fundraising with craft shows is also a fun and creative community outreach event for various organizations and churches to raise awareness and reach out to the community. You can have special brochures or pamphlets made up to hand vendors as they come in. Or better yet, once the show kicks off, you can have someone from the organization visit each vendor personally. Have them pick up a business card at each table to add them to a special mailing list or follow up with a thank you letter for participating in the event. If you get enough crafters to set up and they all have a great day because lots and lots of people showed up, the vendors would be more than happy to participate in another event and it could even become an annual fundraising event!"
7,Is 15th March the apocalyptic day for Facebook?!,news-society," One of the essential things that came along in the 21st Century and a thing that has altered the humanity and our aspects of life is unquestionably the social network named Facebook.  At one time people agree to share their personal life with unknowns from all around the globe, put their thinking, their concerns and affections on the net, with an aim to talk with familiar and unfamiliar persons.  Facebook, since the day it has came along, has been connecting faraway relatives that live in distinct parts in the globe, aids find your classmates that you haven’t seen them for lots, lots years, hides lots new born loves, but in the same time is a explanation for cheating, divorcing, having the wrong idea…  The idea is that thanks to the mass hypnosis, caused by Facebook, the network has close to 500 millions effective users, concerting to the statistics and the last information that has been broadcasting on the net is that Facebook is going to be close up on 15th March! This information has caused a terror into the world of the network.  Except the pragmatic side of this innovation, the network has caused lots people attached from it, attached from spending their valued time looking at the PC and thinking of some unfamiliar people rather then thinking of them selves.  ""Weekly world news"" was the Web site that brought out this information on Saturday, January 8th, and the stated was followed by about 10 000 comments. Concerting to this page, the builder of the network, Mark Zuckerberg has announced in a press conference outside his Palo Alto office that Facebook has went out of command, that has been causing his life too disturbing, the craziness is broadcasting all around, so he has agreed to close up the page and bring his life back.

8,"Arizona shooter Jared Loughner-obsessed with mind control, monetary policy",news-society," In an all too familiar scenario Jared Loughner, the man behind the recent slaughter in Arizona, was a United States military recruit obsessed with mind control and apparently extremely obsessive-compulsive or under some sort of mind control himself. Not surprisingly mere hours after the shootings the Huffington Post, ABC, and just about all of the mainstream media sources had Loughner's deranged and rambling You Tube videos on clear display. One of these mentions how he was a United States military recruit at MERPS in Phoenix. There have also been reports that he might have been deployed in Afghanistan. Already people are lining up to take advantage of the situation politically, characterizing the shooter as an anti government conspiracy nut. The reality of the situation is that the war on terror is not about men in caves and never has been. The war on terror and the Patriot Act, closely examined, appear to be aimed squarely at the American people.  As the plans to implement a complete Police State intensifies, and the county's disillusionment with two illegal wars deepens, Attorney General Eric Holder announced in an interview just two weeks ago who the real terrorists are. From the Dec. 21, 2010 Interview: ""The threat has changed from simply worrying about foreigners coming here, to worrying about people in the United States, American citizens -- raised here, born here, and who for whatever reason, have decided that they are going to become radicalized and take up arms against the nation in which they were born,"" he said. What was uppermost on his mind, however, is the alarming rise in the number of Americans who are more than willing to attack and kill their fellow citizens.  What I am trying to do in this interview is to make people aware of the fact that the threat is real, the threat is different, the threat is constant,"" he said. And while it is not certain we will be hit, the American people, he told ABC News, ""have to be prepared for potentially bad news."" This amazing prescience by a Government official in charge of our security hasn't been seen since Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld noted before 9/11 how America would not be willing to make the needed strategic changes without another ""Pearl Harbor"" style event to galvanize support. The American public has not been as interested in the FED and the criminal banks that it  fronts for since the days of Andrew Jackson. For example, Fox news recently interviewed the makers of the cartoon short, the American dream, a satire that mentions facts never before heard on any of the main networks. How ironic that with a grassroots anti- FED movement gaining steam and a new Congress on its way in featuring Ron Paul, the FED's greatest detractor, as the new head of the banking committee that oversees the fed, we have what surely is the first crazed lone gunman with a penchant for monetary policy and theory. From Jared Loughton's You Tube Channel ""Firstly, the current government officials are in power for their currency, but I'm informing you for your new currency! If you're treasurer of a new money system, then you're responsible for the distributing of a new currency. We now know — the treasurer for a new money system, is the distributor of the new currency. As a result, the people approve a new money system which is promising new information that's accurate, and we truly believe in a new currency. Above all, you have your new currency, listener."" ""Thirdly, I know who's listening: Government Officials, and the People. Nearly all the people, who don't know this accurate information of a new currency, aren't aware of mind control and brainwash methods. If I have my civil rights, then this message wouldn't have happen.  In conclusion, my ambition - is for informing literate dreamers about a new currency; in a few days, you know I'm conscience dreaming! Thank you!"" In the coming weeks and months as the economy continues is descent and the calls to end our worthless Fiat controlled currency increase, the average American has now been predictively programmed to associate  the ramblings of the deranged flag burning psychopath who shot a congresswoman and murdered a judge and an innocent girl who was born on 911.  Who says we don't know anything about mind control?"

Microwavable trays, ultra grip jar openers, address books, calendars and ornamented trinket boxes. Then of course who could not use wrapping paper and ribbons at Christmas? Christmas fundraising Options There are still opportunities to be had for the school fundraising campaign at Christmas. Instead of feeling like everyone is spending money on gifts and won’t have extra money left over, simply combine the two ideas."
10,The four battles of Monte Cassino,news-society," One of the most meaningful places of World War II was Cassino, which was the set of various battles between the January and May of 1944. Cassino is one of the major places of the Second World War; no wonder that many students visit it: visiting the war museum of the city and the abbey of Monte Cassino, indeed, you can look into some important moments of the Second World War. Four battles took place in the city of Cassino and near the abbey of Monte Cassino between the January and May of 1944. The intention of the Allies was splitting the Gustav line -  a series of fortifications that used to divide Italy in two, the Allies on the South and the German on the north, and which crossed Cassino – to be able to assault Rome and join the allies that had remained near Anzio after the operation Shingle. The German troops had arrived in Cassino on the 14th October of the preceding year, under the guidance of Austrian colonel Schlegel, in command of the Panzer Göring division. The colonel warned Gregorio Diamare, the abbot of Monte Cassino, telling him that that area was going to become the core of the German resistance, and thanks to this warning many treasures that were kept in the abbey could be put in a safe place, being brought to Vatican with 120 trucks (8th of December). The people who lived near the Abbey, too, were evacuated, and the Germans fortified the city of Cassino through trenches, minefields and so on. Visiting the museum of Cassino you can learn something more about this chapter of the Second World War. Cassino was an important point of the German defense and a strategic place to reach Rome, and in order to be able to break through the Gustav line the Allies attacked the city many times. The first two battles, which took place between the 12th of January and the 12th of February and starting from the 15th February of the same year, were unsatisfying for the Allies, and resulted in the destruction of the city and the abbey. After the attempt of the Allies to conquer the city, indeed, the first battle of Monte Cassino ended with the Germans’ victory, while the second one was characterized by the bombing of Monte Cassino, which had become a target of the Allies as it was believed to be occupied by the German troops. Due to this false assumption, Monte Cassino was bombed for hours in the morning of the 15th of February, until it was reduced to pile of rubble. The bombing also caused many deaths and damages among soldiers and the civilians that had sought refuge in the abbey, but the area was still in German hands. During the third battle, which began on the 15th March of 1944, the whole city of Cassino was razed to the ground through bombings, which caused many deaths and wounded people not only among civilians, but also among English and Nez Zealand soldiers, and the same day the English troops launched an attack but were immediately stopped by Germans. The assaults went on until the 22nd of March: although the Allies had won not even the third battle, the casualties of the Germans had been heavy, and the Allies began to get ready for the fourth battle, which took place between the 11th and the 19th of May. In the Museum of Cassino you can find many images and information about this battle, which ended with the victory of the Allies, who succeeded in conquering the area and in putting an end to a notably bloody chapter of the history of the Second World War."

A report covering European innovation and startup scene has termed Europe lagging much behind America. Molly Guinness of DW-EARTH.DE experiences which the conference participants blamed more than-cautious buyers, directionless federal government spending, bureaucracy, and language complications for Europe's tech venture capitals remaining relatively little. Listed here are a few excerpts of what European business owners and innovators claimed within the conference as lined from the report: Europe's vicious circle: Fewer Buyers - > Fewer startups; Fewer startups - > Fewer Buyers ""I know rather a couple of businesses that moved towards the valley just mainly because they discovered cash there,"" claimed Sarik Weber, a German entrepreneur who runs the get started-up incubator plan Hanse Ventures in Hamburg. His business offers cash and recommendation to new businesses. ""The entire Silicon Valley ecosystem is according to 40 to 50 several years of entrepreneurs constructing their businesses carrying out exits extremely effectively and then reinvesting this cash back in the ecosystem,"" he extra. ""It is what actually fosters the European startup scene. Once we get fantastic exits like Skype or people, these folks reinvest their funds into European start out-ups and we've got to create that."" Although European governments commit a lot more on study and advancement than their American and Japanese counterparts, industry experts say thatÂ tax incentives and subsidies are usually not accomplishing nearly anything to encourage private-sector traders. ""The point out is doing its task, but do the personal investors have ample self-confidence to invest additional in exploration and advancement?"" said Pierre Monhen, who teaches innovation policy with the United Countries College in Maastricht, the Netherlands. ""There is actually a a lot more cautious perspective in Europe than inside US."" Government's misdirected priorities similar to startups and innovation Johan Staeul von Holstein, who has most just lately founded MyCube, a social networking startup dependent in Singapore, thinks innovation might be encouraged with judicious tax reforms. ""There's as much cash as it is possible to probably think about round,"" he explained. ""It's just that the mistaken individuals are sitting within the funds. Politicians should understand the benefit of entrepreneurship and innovation and growth and by offering huge tax advantages to business owners making their own selections and putting huge quantities of cash from the arms of entrepreneurs: that would modify the entire process in 24 hrs."" A much more critical issue is cultural attitudes and unhealthy tips, according to Tariq Krim, one among Europe's most productive business owners. He create Jolicloud, a company that would make a Linux-primarily based working technique which is often installed on any personal computer. He adds that investing on innovation is misguided, and tends to visit a few massive corporations instead of numerous little ones. In 2008, France, for example, invested 99 million Euros ($131 million)Â in a fresh search engine known as Quearo, which was supposed to get a European response to Yahoo and google. Considering then, fundamentally very little has happened and the venture appears to become dead. ""They ought to have fairly give income to 20 begin ups,"" Krim claimed. ""It has being a aggressive condition about tips."" Language Complications and their answer Freddy Mini, who runs Netvibes, a start off-up that creates customized dashboards to the World-Wide-Web,Â pointed out that American organizations automatically have a leg up, as they have a far more culturally and linguistically homogenous work and buyer foundation than their European counterparts. In other terms, he famous, European companies should rent specialists for each corner of the continent. ""The primary recommendation is, forget your culture -Â get for the culture of the nation where you are living and retain individuals in the floor,"" he stated."

13,Why CSR alliances with local government is more important than a weak COP16 pact in a new age of austerity,news-society," As expectations for a solution still at an all time lows the dust settles on the latest round of climate negotiations at COP16 (UN Climate Change Convention, Cancun) with world , it is timely for CSR practitioners like everyone else to reflect on how we are all doing ‘our bit’ for the cause. As a prompt, ponder on this quote for one moment: ""National governments have their national [sustainability] policies, but after all it is local governments who have to implement these policies"" (UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-Moon, 2009) For many, local councils are pivotal to the delivery of sustainability as every aspect of their role shapes how people live their lives – from democratic elections to education, and planning and waste collection. Climate adaptation too, whether it is in relation to building controls (energy efficiency) or flood defences (emergency planning). This sentiment was recently reinforced by the European Union’s Committee of the Regions which went as far as to conclude that global efforts to tackle climate change are destined to fail unless local authorities are given a greater role. So, now ask yourself this question. ‘Am I confident when my company did stakeholder mapping and issuing scoping to craft our climate strategy that we fully recognised the vital role of local government in adaptation? If the answer is no, then you cannot possibly be a CSR leader. To make matters worse, this is a terrible time for companies to sideline local government in the fight against climate change. In a new age of austerity, national spending cuts mean that investment in local adaptation efforts is being squeezed at the very same time that public scepticism over the robustness of the science of climate change in on the increase. Wise CSR leaders may choose to ignore the COP17 jamboree in late 2011 and instead take the opportunity to forge new alliances with local councils that are both good for business resilience and the planet. One example is helping to establish low carbon trade zones with land use planners, such as that in Baoding, China, which has assisted 20,000 local people being employed in solar panel and wind turbine production. Another example is agreeing to contribute toward a carbon compensation levy when constructing new office buildings, such as that in Milton Keynes, UK, whereby instead of investing in carbon-neutral new premises the developers fund local schemes such as insulation for older homes which are much less energy-efficient. So what is holding your business back in this kind of engagement? Your low awareness of local government? Your lack of faith in working with town hall managers? Or is just your short-sighted CSR approach? To get yourself back on track, why not contact one of the 138 world mayors who signed a climate pact in advance of COP16 to show national leaders how easy it is to do a deal if one really wants to. I am sure your advances would be warmly welcomed."
14,Will Health Care Reform Be Repealed In 2011?,news-society," That is the question, in a bid to flex their new won muscle the first attack of the year by the Republicans will be on the Healthcare Reform Bill passed last year. But can the bill be repealed or is it just for political show? The reality of the bill being repealed is practically zero. Many Republican opponents feel it is just part of a ploy to tie up Congress until the next presidential elections. Republicans, particularly from the fiscally conservative wing, emboldened by their victories in last November's elections and, as promised, will tackle the healthcare reform bill. With control of the House (242-193) and with a vote scheduled for January 12 it is very likely the reform will pass at least the House. Fighting back Democratic leaders warned against the uproar that will follow repealing a healthcare provision that closes a coverage gap in the Medicare prescription drug program for seniors (the Donut Hole). Senate Democratic leaders wrote in a letter to John Boehner, the incoming House Speaker ""Taking this benefit away from seniors would be irresponsible and reckless at a time when it is becoming harder and harder for seniors to afford a healthy retirement."" Besides writing letters the Democrats are preparing other counterattacks. Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt., said he will try to force the House to vote separately on the Medicare drug benefits and other popular provisions, including one that allows adult children to stay on their parents' coverage until they turn 26. That could put Republicans in an awkward bind. In actuality full repeal of the health care law is still not likely. The House vote is just the first and the easiest step, the Democrats still control the Senate by 53 to 47 and most likely the re-form bill will not get through. Should it get past the Senate, President Obama still has the last veto and there are not enough votes to override it. There is also the fact that with no replacement plan in the wings this political strategy could backfire on the Republicans so it is not without some risk. The most likely scenario will be that both parties will drag the issue into 2012 and hope for their candidate to win the presidential election. ""It's not going to be easy; it's going to be a long, hard slog,"" said Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, an early leader in the health care repeal drive. The quick thumbs-down vote by the House will have ""tremendous utility and value,"" King said, but it may take electing a Republican president in Obama's place to accomplish the overall goal. In the mean time the Obama administration is not going to be detoured and is still moving forward putting the law’s framework into place for covering more than 30 million people who in the past were uninsured. Finally, we have the courts. Challenges to the constitutionality of the health care law are working their way toward the Supreme Court. Opponents say Congress overstepped its authority by requiring most Americans to carry health insurance, effective in 2014. The case may take a couple of years, and it could change whatever the Executive and Legislative branches come up with. Either way the American people again are just the pawns."
15,Missouri's Proposition B is Bad for Business,news-society," ""Shall Missouri law be amended to: -require large-scale dog breeding operations to provide each dog under their care with sufficient food, clean water, housing and space; necessary veterinary care; regular exercise and adequate rest between breeding cycles; -prohibit any breeder from having more than 50 breeding dogs for the purpose of selling their puppies as pets; and -create a misdemeanor crime of ""puppy mill cruelty"" for any violations? --It is estimated state governmental entities will incur costs of $654,768 (on-going costs of $521,356 and one-time costs of $133,412). Some local governmental entities may experience costs related to enforcement activities and savings related to reduced animal care activities."" Yes: 995,368 51.6% No: 934,340 48.4% Measure Passed via Voters Missouri's Proposition B was passed by voters last Nov. 4th as a way to be ""humane"" to dogs in breeding mills. Note, there is already a law that regulated the industry at a state-wide level, and compliance was high with a few bad apples who were tried in court accordingly. This law does nothing to prohibit harm that isn't already covered, plus it is bad for business because it restricts it and harms free trade. First, this proposition does nothing to prevent abuse from occurring at facilities. Missouri's Animal Care Facilities Act (1) already prescribes the minimal amounts of care and area for dogs and cats within the state (2). Failure to comply with these regulations from this law typically include loss of license, business closure, and any fines or penalties applicable for not complying with the law. Through Missouri's Operation Bark Alert, compliance is already relatively high, and the staff are well-equipped to handle the burden the regulations are placed on businesses. By limiting the conduct of business upon those who are otherwise following the existing statues, this new law violates property rights and hinders the free market from functioning at its peak efficiency. Any dog owner who now owns more than 50 breeding dogs will either have to find a new home for those animals or kill them in order to comply. As these animals belong to the owner, only the owner should make these choices, not voters. No sensible breeder will expand beyond what their business can handle. As Proposition B forces a restraining device on business purely because they are ""too large"" it hinders the free market from operating well. In an industry that has little barriers to entry, dog breeding is very competitive. Those breeders who are able to raise quality animals at a cost consumers are willing to pay should not be punished because they want to expand their business. They should be encouraged, especially with the economy still in a downturn. For each dog a breeder acquires they will have to buy the appropriate amount of food, shelter, and medical services necessary to improve their service. This money goes back into the local economy, mostly helping retail stores, veterinarians, and other small-businesses with increased sales. The state and local governments then benefit from increased sales and income tax that is generated through increased business. Though this law was passed by voters, it is not conductive to the free market, nor does it punish those who harm others or another person's property. Following through with this law will damage the breeding industry, and will prevent business from expanding. Missouri State Senator Stouffer (1), has proposed legislation that would repeal the law, but here I will have to respectfully disagree with using the legislature to void this proposition..."
16,Alternative energy is the way of the future,news-society," Alternative energy is derived from natural, renewable resources, such as wind, solar and water. Not to be confused with the fact that alternative Power the only thing that is lost at the end of the global warming, global leadership, eliminates the dependency on foreign energy will create millions of jobs (Yes, also in the band of rust) and keep our lives by means of the twenty-first century. Adour Global alternative energy indexes only businesses that are mainly in the field of alternative energy and companies that alternative Power edge to their main business is excluded.The use of alternative energy is no longer a mystery in our daily requirement for power. discover what alternative energy is and how it can help to save money and the environment. but the true potential of this title unsaid.Solar has gone from $ 254 per watt in the 1950s to about $ 4 today. It suggests that people go to old methods of extracting energy and consumption in exchange for alleged cleaning methods such as wind, water, solar, nuclear, giant batteries, methane gas, maize (corn) oil, etc.. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) is the national trade association of solar energy Power plants using renewable and sustainable energy sources are not burning fuels in the production of electricity, so a reduction in the emission atmosphere-. some people see of alternative energy as a joke, and I think in particular wind power generation is also occasionally. Windmills have been proposed for power now obtained from natural gas. This type of energy derive their power constantly flowing natural energy and contain examples of hydropower, solar energy and geothermal energy. Renewable means in such a way that its existence is not permanent. Renewable energy sources, such as biomass, small hydro, solar, wind, geothermal, tidal power and photovoltaic systems, can give you a wider free control. The first of these is the huge investment and federal law amendments which are necessary for the smart grid of renewable energy. While we are making progress in finding new and renewable energy, we are more than halfway to our goal to move away from our dependence on the oil industry. Wind energy is long as weak and, thanks to the location driven, impractical has been cancelled. Wind Turbines have a role in the new generation sustainable providers.Now it is important to point out that tidal, wave, solar energy and wind energy requires almost no provisional energy, as opposed to coal, oil, gas, biomass, hydrogen and all the others.""Alternative"" energy sources wind, solar, water are all good, but they do not seem to confirm our addictive nature. Global warming is a big factor in the rise of the alternative Power. alternative energy is not only cost effective and necessary for the foreign policy is also required for the domestic policy, with a view to promoting a sustainable environment and in order to prevent global warming and global catastrophe that global warming is advanced. Global warming or not, we still need to clean this wreck of a planet. read more about existing alternative energy technologies as good as what the future energy sources can help you to efficiently power from your home or business. Living off the grid is a term used to describe people who are looking for alternative sources of energy to install and do not bind to the traditional electric power stations. Alternative energy is the way of the future. alternative power is a future idea whose time is over."
17,"All the negative sides of meat eating, according to PETA",news-society," From day to day large number of people decides to stop using meat in their meals. There are countless and different reasons for doing that. People stop eating meat because they think that is better for their own health, some of them feel sorry for the animals, some think that could help ending the world hunger… there are so many reasons that are so hard to think off for someone that is not a vegetarian. PETA - People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is the largest animal rights group in the world. People that work there are trying to develop the people’s conscience when it comes about the animals. They are trying to convince the public that animals have their right to be treated equal as every other living soul on the earth. According to PETA, these are some of the main reasons why should people leave meat off of their dishes. •	We live with our pets and we take care of them like they are members of our family. Maybe we are treating dogs and cats as our friends, but the truth is that farmed animals are every bit as intelligent and capable of feeling pain as the dogs and cats. The people from PETA put the accent on the value of their lives. They look at them as individuals that also solve problems, experience fear and pain… Only in America more that 16 billion animals are killed every year for food. These animals have been abused, genetically manipulated, put on drug regimens that cause chronic pain and crippling, transported through all weather extremes, and at the end, killed on a terrible ways, like they are protagonist in some shooting games. •	The vegetarians are defending the thesis that vegan foods provide all the nutrients that people need for their healthy living and there is no need to eat meet. Besides all the healthy ingredients in the vegan food, there is no saturated fat in them, any cholesterol or contaminants that are found in meat, eggs, and dairy products. These guarantees protection from heart disease, diabetes, obesity, strokes, and several types of cancer. The immune systems are stronger and as they say, on average, vegetarians live 10 years longer than meat-eaters. •	The members of PETA also pay attention to the dangerous meat-processing machines and they claim that not only the animals have been abused in this process. The number of workers that endure crippling injuries and the ones that have even lost their limbs—or their lives is very big. •	PETA claims that factory farms pollute the environment for many miles around them. People who live and work nearby is fighting with chronic sickness, brain damage, poisoned waterways, elevated cancer rates and even death plague. •	According to PETA raising animals for food is extremely inefficient.  Animals eat a lot but only a fraction of the calories are returned in the form of edible flesh. This whole process steals the food from the hungry people in the world and if stops the process of intensively breeding farmed animals and grew crops to feed humans instead, we could easily feed every human on the planet with healthy vegetarian foods.

18,"And who is more important, Assange or the documents?!",news-society," Apparently just a particular number of people have heard about the name Julian Assange earlier - the ones that were familiar with WikiLeaks, or that were curious about ""the biggest cyberpunk in the world"", but these days his name is filling the media world-wide, speaking about the potential danger that he may be.  The amazing raise of his popularity began few days ago when his web page, WikiLeaks, has brought out over 250,000 secret contents from U.S. embassies world-wide and has discovered all kinds of salaciousness for world leaders, but actually, who stands in the background of all these ""hidden object games"" and who has the ability to know all this things? The name Julian Assange these days has been related so many times with the name of the Agent 007, James Bond.  No one has the information where he is, or doesn’t want to say.  The rumors say that he is every day in a new state, sleeping on aerodromes or in hotels, but signing in with a fake name.  His cell phone and his Laptop computer are coded so no one can follow his step.  He makes atypical public appearing using them to speak about exemption of the press, censoring, and fact-finding reportage. This Australian has reputedly gone to six universities - he learned physics and mathematics, but philosophy and neuroscience too.  After becoming 16, Assange started hacking and succeeded to go into the schemes of many significant establishments in Australia, but these days he states that he is not ""modern"" so his work can’t be called hacking.  He is best known as the representative and editor-in-chief for WikiLeaks, and has won respective journalism honours for his function there.  This web page was based in 2006 and thru the years its database had arisen to more than 1.2 million papers.  This media brings out submissions of otherwise untouchable papers from anonymous informants and leaks. The US authorities are attempting to show Julian Assange as a ""Public Enemy No.1"", the President Obama and the people around him are attempting to keep from further leaks, equalizing them to terrorist plans of attack.  They propose similar intervention as the manner of prosecuting Al-Qaeda, and also there are calls for physical elimination of Julian Assange.  But in any case, unusual thing is that the international law enforcement system has found an asymmetrical manner of prosecution.   Assange is damned of a criminal behave, but this behave is not related with what he is actually celebrated for, it’s about rape and sexual assail. These are the accusations that have made the Interpol announce a general search and supply an international arrest warrant. The entire story has many incompatibilities, how is it available one man to have so much ability, and why no one doesn’t speak about the papers and the data that is so life-threatening according to WikiLeaks, but entire attention is around Assange?!  It seams that the real story is yet to come… For more informations visit our site http://www.playhiddenobjectgames.org/links.php"
19,Interviewing Techniques For The Journalist,news-society," At some point in your career you will have to interview either a professional person, local resident, or a celebrity. Your interviewing techniques play an important part of getting the information you need to build a story. The harsh reality is once people know you are a journalist they can be very sceptical of you. As we are sometimes seen as busybodies who can’t mind their own business or as liars. Before you get straight to the interview it is important to build a rapport with the person you are interviewing you need to get them to trust you, and this must be genuine as people can tell when you’re faking. One of the ways to build a rapport is to get to know the person you are interviewing. I was once assigned to go and interview a manager at a local day care centre for the elderly. This centre was closing down due to lack of funding. Before I got straight down to my questions I would get to know her as a person first. I’d ask her questions like ‘how was she doing,’ ‘what was she doing before this job’, I even ended up knowing what her favourite pastime was. Because of this rapport building I was able to get a lot more answers out of her concerning the day centre, as she was comfortable in talking to me and I ended up with a good story.  When building a rapport please be mindful that you must maintain a professional attitude and to use your discretion. There are many different types of personalities that you will come across in your journalism career and you will have to adapt to each individual accordingly. After the rapport building stage comes the questioning and there are two types of question methods opened and closed. Opened questions are what’s, how’s, why’s, and where’s this will give you a more elaborate answer. Closed questions begin with ‘are you’, ‘is it true’, or ‘do you have’ these questions will give you less of an elaborate answer and you want to avoid asking them. However if you do begin with a closed question you can always get the interviewee to expand on them for example:- Journalist: - ""Are you bored today?"" Interviewee: - ""No,"" Journalist: - ""Can you explain why you’re not bored"" The Journalist began with a closed question but ended up with an open question to get a more detailed answer. As well as the questioning it is important to remember that you have to control the interview. If the interviewee starts talking about something else bring them back to you the topic. Journalist: - ""Why is red your favourite colour?"" Interviewee: - ""Because it a fiery colour and blue is also another nice colour I like it very much."" Journalist: - ""Why else is red your favourite colour,"" Notice the Journalist did not entertain what the interviewee said about the blue colour in fact it was dismissed and the attention was brought back onto the red. Only if the answer is relevant to your story should you allow the interviewee to continue to another topic. One final thing remain confident and enjoy the interview. Don’t see it as a chore you can meet some very interesting people along the way. Also meeting people is a great way to build contacts they may know someone you might want to get in touch with for your next story who knows. At the end of the day they’re the ones that you need to help you build your story."
20,So You Want To Be a Journalist,news-society," After ten years in journalism I still find it a very exciting and rewarding career. Not only do you get to see your name in print but your articles could help certain members of the public, they look to you to inform them of what is going on in the world they are living in. Though exciting and rewarding getting into the industry can be very tough, and unfortunately in this business it can be more about who you know than what you know. Now a days the average celebrity can be seen as a ‘journalist' if their given their own column to write. However if this is a career that you really want to do go for it, and go for it all the way. I knew that I wanted to be a journalist from the time I was in college so this is what I did. I firstly went to a volunteering company to see if they could find me any work in that field, as this would help me gain experience. The more experience I gained the more it would help me be a better writer and learn about different writing styles. Sure enough they did and I ended up writing for their newsletter and magazine. I would strongly recommend that you try and find some experience with a newspaper or magazine whether online or print. As not only would you gain experience but it would look good on your CV for potential employers. I then went to university and I qualified with a Bachelors Arts Degree in Journalism. Is it necessary to go to university? Yes it is, the reason being you can get a better understanding about this line of work, and you will be taught by professional journalists. If you want to go into broadcast journalism you would need to know about television production. There are many universities and courses out there that do journalism. After university here comes the tricky part, finding a job. As hard as it is please do not get disheartened if you don't find a job straight away as this field is a very competitive market. With all my experience and degree it took me a year to find a job as a junior journalist within a local newspaper and then I moved onto magazines as a feature writer and worked my way up to editorial position. One last thing joining the National Union of Journalist can help as this organisation gives you regular updates of what is going on in the media and you can get to network with professional journalists. To conclude get experience, do a course in this field and never give up on your dream. If you are destining to be a journalist go for it and push through those barriers until you land your dream job."

1,"Up to 200,000 Deaths in UK caused by Airborne Pollutants",news-society," A report published last week suggests that long-term exposure to air pollution may have been a factor in up to 200,000 premature deaths in the UK during 2008.. Research by the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants (COMEAP), an independent advisory group of experts reporting to the Department of Health, found that human-made particulate matter, primarily from road transport, accounted for the loss of 340,000 years of life every 12 months. The report concluded that air pollution was responsible for the equivalent of 29,000 premature deaths a year, but COMEAP stressed that along with other factors, air pollution was likely to have taken an average of just under two years off the lives of 200,00 people. Removing just one microgram per cubic metre would increase life expectancy by around 20 days, COMEAP said, adding that if it were possible to remove all human-made particulate matter, the UK would see a six-month increase in life expectancy from birth. Professor Jon Ayres, chairman of COMEAP, admitted that expressing the effects of air pollution numerically is fraught with difficulty. But he stressed that poor air quality was having a direct impact on life expectancy. ""The report clearly shows that particulate air pollution continues to have a significant effect on health in the UK and, importantly, that reducing concentrations of this pollutant would lead to significant gains for public health,"" he said. The report comes just days after the release of a new Air Quality Strategy for London, which drew criticism from green groups who claimed it did not do enough to cut the high levels of pollution in the capital that have drawn repeated reprimands from the EU. Campaigners Environmental Protection Agency UK said today’s report demonstrated Mayor Boris Johnson’s strategy must be much tougher on airborne pollution or risk subjecting Londoners to further health problems. ""This shocking new report is unequivocal about the massive impact that air pollution has on the health of the UK public. It is high time the issue was taken seriously – action to mitigate pollution must be prioritised immediately,"" said James Grugeon, Environmental Protection UK chief executive. ""In light of this new evidence, which suggests thousands of Londoners are dying premature deaths every year due to air pollution, the Mayor’s decision to scrap the Western Extension of the Congestion Charge and delay the implementation of Phase 3 of the London Low Emission Zone looks even more deplorable."""
2,Make New Friends the Easy Way,news-society," A method for making new friends without being afraid Have you ever watched small children, say 3-6 years old at a play park? They don’t necessarily know each other and yet within five minutes, you will probably see them talking, laughing and playing together. ""Ha!"" you say. ""They don’t know what it feels like to be rejected!"" That is true enough, but they could teach adults a thing or two about how to make new friends. First, you need to forget your fear, or act in spite of it. Sure, you may get knocked back a few times when  attempting to make friends, but is that such a bad thing? It might be embarrassing at the time, but you don’t want to be friends with everyone, because you don’t have things in common with everyone. So, people who reject you are just not your type of people. Move on! In making new friends, it is better to listen more than you talk. People like other people who make them feel good. If you take the time to listen to the other person – and I mean really listen, not just hang on, bored, until it’s your turn to speak – you will be rewarded by more people wanting to become your friend. Don’t interrupt them and don’t worry, you will soon have your turn to speak and if listening well, you will have much more to talk about as you will be able to pick up on the information you were given. You can ease the process of making new friends along by asking the right questions. You can show you were listening well by asking questions that are linked to what the other person has just talked about. That demonstrates to people that you are interested in them and they will like you all the more for it. Be prepared to compromise and to not openly voice your opinions if they are in opposition to those of the people you are talking to. You will have many, many years of friendship in which to air your views when you know people better. The time to do that is not on a first meeting or early in the developing relationship. Making new friends also involves making an emotional connection with the other person. If you are friendly and open and you talk about your interests and those of other people with enthusiasm, you will be able to do that. Remember the little details of what people tell you and be able to talk about them and ask questions which convey your interest. That will take you much closer to making new friends. Appear confident yet not arrogant. Stand up straight and make comfortable eye contact, so that your body language conveys that confidence too. Project your confidence and comfort in your voice, banishing the quiver and not speaking too loudly or too softly. Add emotion and enthusiasm to your voice and people will want to listen to you and talk to you. This is vital if you want to make new friends because without having conversations with the other person, you cannot hope to be friends with them. The knack behind making new friends is in putting the other person at ease. To do this, you need to have the confidence to be yourself and to listen to other people and appreciate their views. If you can do this and express and interest in other people, you are well on the road to making new friends."
3,Customers Like Newport Non-Menthol,news-society," Convenience store retailers have found initial trial levels of the new Newport Non-Menthol cheap cigarettes to be about average, with much of the initial consumer interest attributed to temporary pricing, according to an exclusive CSP-UBS Tobacco Survey. ""Most customers buying Newport Non-Menthol don't have a strong loyalty to another brand and are trying them because of the price and the Newport name recognition,"" one retailer stated. ""After the buy down expires, only those customers that have developed a loyalty to the smoking brand will continue to buy them."" Retailers ranked the trial level at an average of 5.1 on a scale of one to 10, according to the survey, which included 108 retailers representing more than 15,000 convenience stores. Trial primarily was attributed to the temporary $1.65 buy down, which is set to expire in January. About 76% of respondents said they didn't feel Newport Non-Menthol would sell as well when the buy-down ends. The drop will be predicated on the amount of discounting removed and when. If moved in line with other Newport discounting, sales will fall by 66% minimum."" Lorillard declined to comment on the survey. ""We do not comment on future marketing and/or promotional plans for any of our brands,"" a company spokesman said, adding that it is also too soon to comment on how Newport Non-Menthol is doing as it only entered the market in November. UBS tobacco analyst Nik Modi, however, explained that now was a good time to begin tracking Newport Non-Menthol sales. ""While we realize it's still too early to make an ultimate assessment on the success of Newport Non-Menthol, we wanted to pursue this survey in order to create a point of comparison for future surveys."" A majority (89%) of respondents said Newport Non-Menthol users switched from other brands, with the remaining 11% saying they were new customers. Retailers also ranked expectations of initial repeat levels at a little below average, at about 4.4 on a scale of one to 10. ""It appears that it will pull from Pall Mall and some of the low-ends for now,"" one retailer stated. ""It could also pull from Marlboro and Camel, if they keep emphasizing that this is an introductory price on a well-known brand-name extension."" Most respondents characterized the overall in-store execution of the launch as good (38%) or excellent (16%). ""Product was available the day they said it would be; there have been no out-of-stocks or shortages,"" one retailer said. ""The sales have been very strong, which I expected with the deep discount."" However, not all retailers were happy with the launch, with 30% rating it fair, and 17% rating it as poor: ""Some stores struggled to get reps in upon launch. Many stores had advertising placed in unauthorized positions not following instructions agreed to by the account manager."" An area of optimism for Lorillard is that it newest cigarette appears to be drawing from other non-menthol smoking brands, such as Marlboro and Camel, and not from the core users of Newport Menthol. Although 78% percent said Newport Non-Menthol was competing with the core Newport product, 77% said they did not believe Newport Non-Menthol was confusing the core Newport customer. ""Most trials are not from menthol customers; it is Marlboro and Camel customers trying it,"" one retailer said. ""The good news is that Newport Non-Menthol is largely incremental to the Newport franchise with minimal cross-over consumption,"" Modi told CSP Daily News.

5,The Great Man in Medical Lab Coat,news-society," The usual picture of a scientist for all of us is a person who has a long white hair, with beards of the same shade and wearing thick eyeglasses. But do you know that there will always be an exception in every general rule? Yes, you read it right! Brian Cox is a physicist and a genius of his generation but is quite a different image of a typical scientist. He does not actually wear medical lab coat at all times. Probably, he just uses it while inside the laboratory room, having those experiments running through his hands. But, I am sure you are a little familiar with his name. It is because he used to be a musician and not a scientist. It’s just that he pursued Science as well as Doctoral in Philosophy in High Energy Particle Physics only at the verge of his being a rock star. Being a musician, he actually has the UK Chart topped. That makes him stand out from the rest of the nerd- looking scientists out there. He is even called by some as a professor who seems to be so nerd yet even cooler than you. If he wears a coat, that would be coat and tie in order to push respect on the part of the ones to whom he deals with. Yes, he is a rock star but he is a professional physicist as well. Unlike any other people in medical lab coat, Cox teaches as well in a prestigious University of Manchester, where he handles Particle Physics. He has a lot of contributions in the field of science and if you are going to look at him, he would appear to be a typical boy next door, a rocker and a campus crush in the school where he teaches. But would you believe if I will tell you that he is a science communicator with the BBC? Yes, with the British Broadcasting Corporation! For the information of everybody, he is also holding the same post in European Organization for Nuclear Research, which is considered to be the world’s largest Particle Physics centre. He also authored books about correcting some inconsistencies regarding relativity. Indeed, Professor Brian Cox is a young and cool scientist. You know friends, before I thought that all scientists are eccentric-looking, with all the test tubes in their front, with a smoky effect. Such a funny imagination! It is because Brian Cox made me shift from that previous perception as regards the people in their respective medical coat to a more liberal and open-minded one. I am expecting that as times passes by, more and more Brian Cox-style will sprout and invade the scientific field. For sure, it will be fun and exciting!"
6,Wright Video Game Addiction,news-society," Brick-Breaker: Video game addiction I used to feel so superior to people who played video games for hours on end…wasting their life away indoors, staring at a screen, avoiding real human interaction. What losers! Uh, yeah. Not quite. I sure don't feel that way now that I've had a taste – well, a large meal – of the game Brickbreaker on my blackberry. I don't know how I got into playing this game. I didn't even know I had it on my Blackberry and all of a sudden I am addicted to Brickbreaker! I have not played video games since my dad gave me a roll of quarters and took me to the backroom of the bookstore in my childhood neighborhood that had the first PacMan. Me and Atari were pretty good friends, but I hadn't been remotely interested in video games until about 2 weeks ago when I found Brickbreaker. I read this article about video addiction (http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2010/mar/21/tom-bissell-video-game-cocaine-addiction) and have heard my boss Dr. Judith Wright speak on this topic many times but I always thought I was above this! It really is an addiction – there is no morality in it…it is just very easy to get hooked! One game was not enough for me; I had to play until I could get a higher score. It made no sense, except that I could connect this to the personal development work I've done in recognizing my ""soft addictions"". I know that I started playing when I felt like I really couldn't control some of the events that were happening at work, where I was feeling incompetent – at least I could feel competent and successful at Brickbreaker. However, I really do get know how there are chemicals that are released in my brain that keep me playing game after game even though it is not really fulfilling. The other problem is that I've wasted about 4 hours in the past week playing this. 4 hours may not seem like a lot, but it really is – that is 4 hours of sleep that I have been complaining about not getting, a social outing with a friend that I can't find the time for, or writing the blog that I committed to writing last week that I couldn't fit into my schedule! I really empathize with the author of that article, and see how easy it is to get addicted. It is no big sin, just something to be very aware of. I'm looking forward to our Soft Addiction Solution weekend tomorrow to help me understand more about my brain chemistry and how I got so addicted to Brickbreaker. I think it's pretty phenomenal, and if I can understand that, then I will be able to understand how I've gotten addicted to other things like moods and thought patterns that I'd like to be free from."

8,"If You Become a Teacher, Think About This...",news-society," Teaching is one of those professions that enables you to shape the future of your country and the world as a whole by influencing the next generation -- the people who are going to run the country when we're gone. If you can think of a more influential role in society, then I'd love to hear from you because as far as I'm concerned the messages that we send to our students today are what's going to ultimately shape everything tomorrow. So, here's the thing. Young people are incredibly easily influenced -- human psychology proves that the thoughts of the young people in our society can be very easily moulded depending on the environment in which they are based. As a teacher, you have an exceptional chance to pass on the message to the next generation. What I mean by this is that as a teacher you are not only teaching the subject that you are also teaching Outlook. I can remember my youth and the teaches that had a profound effect on my life. There was this one teacher who has sadly since passed away but he had a massive effect on my life and how I view things. The reason he was so influential was because he just had an easing energy and passion for the subject that he teach and he proved to me that I could overcome any obstacle that I put my mind to. Here was a guy who managed to take a high school team all the way to the national finals in athletics without any budget whatsoever. He also organised a massive trip to 24 lucky students to take part in an expedition in the Yukon Territories in northern Canada -- he had no budget to play with, he had to organise us as a group of people to raise money to take part in a trip. I was a vision that he had a couple of years before he eventually make that happen -- everybody said he was crazy at even trying. His actions and achievements made me realise that if I ever want to achieve something I just need to take one step in front of the other and constantly move forward. Even if things don't go my way, I still have to move forward -- that's exactly what he did, that's exactly how he achieved a mass of things that he achieve -- and that's the message that he passed on to me through his actions. So as a teacher you are given a platform on which you are a hugely influential person. Eager eyes and ears sit in front of you and wait your message if you can say it in such a compelling and powerful manner than your message will be soaked up like a sponge and you will shape the future of these young bright eyed students. I think a lot of teachers nowadays are missing the passion that this great teacher of mine hat. I think I must have had around 50 teachers teach me in my lifetime -- I only ever saw this passion in one or maybe two teaches. So I bet you, if you are going to become a teacher think about what message or sending and project that message in a passionate and thought-provoking manner and influence the youth of today so that they make the best of tomorrow when we are long gone."
9,What Makes a Good Teacher?,news-society," So just the other day I was in a conference and the discussion was all about what it takes to become a good teacher and we spent the best part of three hours discussing this and so I thought I'd write a very quick blog post or article to cover what we discussed during a conference because I think it was an interesting discussion. Teaching is profession whereby you can be as knowledgeable about the subject matter as you like but if you cannot communicate that knowledge in a way that people understand then there's absolutely no point in being a teacher. Teaching is all about putting ideas and theories and methodology across to students in a way that they understand and are happy to learn. So what's really important when you become teachers to understand basic human psychology. For instance not many people are very much interested in mathematics problem but if you bring that into a real-life scenario whereby the students can relate then all of a sudden everybody is interested in what you have to say -- and of course that's the number one priority if you're a teacher everybody needs to be interested in what you have to say. But more than this the conversation then moved on to the subject of sense of humour which is a very interesting argument beakers somebody was trying to why you that a sense of humour just didn't have any role in the classroom and that having a laugh or teaching should be should be forbidden. And I'm from a very different perspective on this beakers I remember teaches that I had back in the day; I remember the ones that would crack their face if they laughed and I remember others that I thoroughly got on well with and had a joke with. And I have to say I learnt a lot more from those that I got on well with And that's basic human psychology -- it's very similar to buying habits; we only buy from people that we feel we can trust. Human beings are inherently an emotional being -- we like to think that we are logical beings the instances occur every single day to prove that role. We buy from a motion, we date from a motion, our decisions are made by our emotions and yet we justify everything from logic. So therefore it stands to reason that we are going to get on better and resonate with a teacher that we are in some way and emotionally attached to -- in other words if we like our teachers we stand a much better chance of learning from The last point was raised in a meeting was that of resourcefulness and preparation beakers in a classroom environment where there is limited time to get information across there needs to be structure and preparation to make sure that no time is wasted and that the curriculum is seen through. Teaching is actually quite an art form and if I look back at the best teaches that shaped my career I remember those that I got on well with -- the organised, prepared, understood human psychology and how to get things across in this simple fashion that the whole class could understand -- and this is what makes a good teacher, it has nothing to do with how knowledgeable or not you are on the subject matter."
10,News Industry in Egypt,news-society," Egypt News industry has been growing ever since 2005 when the industry was opened to more private sectors after government reforms. The changes brought about policies that have opened greater entrepreneurship and private media growth. Ever since, media accessibility has by far come a long way when it comes to delivering the news to the Egyptian people whether it will be through printed forms, live broadcasts or through electronic news update. The Media Public Free Zone delved the country into a better news industry when news delivery came to be available in various forms like the internet. Egypt used to be known as the Arab World's media hub and with these newest developments ever since it was created in 2000, Egypt now ranks the fourth among the different Middle East and Northern Africa countries that have the freedom of speech. Private broadcasting companies have now been more adamant in reaching the Egyptian people after the government has fully supported their undertaking through tax incentives. Likewise, the government encourages the private sectors to deliver better and reliable news for the country's growth and development. The support made by the government resulted to more than half of Egypt's News industry to be owned by private media companies. Print news for Egypt has now become more widespread with more than 500 news publications available on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. Broadcast news, on the other hand, are more available towards the Egyptian people as compared to other Arab countries with five independent television broadcasters. Meanwhile, news via the internet is readily available through dial-up connection, which is accessible and free for the country's citizens. In addition, the government has continued to work its way up with other foreign sectors in developing better Arab-language content available over the internet. Egypt News has since come a long way to when it first started. Still, it continues to grow and develop in hoping to be able to deliver more reliable and first hand news. Both the government and the private sectors are continuing to find ways in which they could both improve their programs and implementation for the welfare of the country and its people."
11,Online Teacher Certification Programs,news-society," Online teacher certification programs are becoming very popular up-and-down the United States because people who want to become teachers no longer have to actually attend the physical classroom, instead they can actually learn from the comfort of their own home through the power of a computer and an Internet connection. The system works through what is called webinars. Webinars and allow you to see and hear a teacher in a virtual classroom and it is just like being in a lecture theatre because you can see the white board, you can hear everything that he or she is saying and there is all sorts of interactive features — including things like questions. These programs aren’t considered any less valuable than off-line teaching programmes so therefore you won’t be in a disadvantaged position because you took an online training program as opposed to an off-line training programme. Online teaching certification programs cost pretty much the same as an off-line teaching certification program and the payment process is very similar. Lots of online teaching certification programs allow you to make a down payment upfront and then pay off the remaining balance after you have become a teacher and on a monthly basis. This makes the whole course a lot more affordable and accessible for the majority of the population who don’t necessarily have a four figure sum that they can put upfront for the training. I do have a word of warning about online to justification programs that and that is that if you want the kind of person who can motivate yourself and work on your own then this may not necessarily be the right course to you. It takes a very special type of person to be able to learn through all webinar and motivate yourself to do the required homework. The length of the online certificate shall program is exactly the same as the off-line program and comes in at about one year. During this time you’ll be able to study in your own time because of the distance learning nature of the course so if you do happen to have another part-time job or other daily commitments then the online program may be a better alternative to the off-line program. Once you’ve completed your online certification you will then be examined for the grade and course that you wish to teach. Many prospective teachers don’t know exactly what they want to do at the start of the course, so therefore there are many teaching professionals on hand to help advise the direction of your career and this will help you understand exactly what it is you want to teach and at what level. The final thing I’ll say is that you can apply to any number of online certification programs risk-free — they will give you a complete assessment and you won’t have to pay a penny for it. So I recommend that you apply for a couple of programs, communicate with the organisers and then choose which one takes your pick. Finally, I want to wish you all the best in your endeavour to become a teacher in the US!"

13,BAT Plans to Lay Down Illicit Tobacco Products,news-society," The sale of illicit tobacco products is affecting gross total of the legitimate manufacturers. A jump in illicit tobacco products imports in South Africa over the past 18 months is decreasing sales by legal manufacturers and under the influence of British American Tobacco (BAT) is funding an information campaign which will underline the correlation between illicit tobacco products and organized underworld. ""The sale of illicit tobacco products caused an increasing concern due to its link to arms trafficking. It is not just about the influence on legitime volumes, gains and tax proceeds,"" stated, Fay Kajee director of the corporate and regulatory affairs of the BAT South Africa. But the influence on legal sales was essential. Kajee stated that the campaign, which is costing it R8.5 million, was also directed at protection of the share of the market. BAT has approximately 85.7 % share of legitimate cigarette markets in South Africa. ""We have faced volumes decrease as sales of illicit trade have increased to about 20% of all sales. This corresponds to the international norm of 6% to 12%."" For the past three years sales of legal tobacco products have decreased from 25 billion cigarettes in 2008 to 21 billion this year. Within the same period the sale of illicit tobacco products has increased from 3 billion in 2008 to 6.3 billion this year. Thus it can be estimated that one in five cigarettes is illicit. The calculated annual earnings loss to the government constituted R2.5 billion in delinquent taxes more than half of the cost of the package of cigarettes goes to excise duties and on value-added tax. Legal sales of cigarettes by the tobacco manufacturers produce about R10bn profit for the government. ""The loss in profit from illicit sales was about R1bn. Illicit tobacco products are very profitable as they are light and can be quickly distributed,"" stated Adrian Lackay, the spokesman for the SA Revenue Service. Kajee attached the increase in the sale of illegal tobacco products to the occasion, and namely the fact that supplies from Zimbabwe might be run into the country easily, without taking into account the government’s efforts. Financial pressure on consumers has also lead to big demand for cheap tobacco products. ""Illegal tobacco products were predominant where there was a significant demand for cheap products, it was not only street vendors who sold them, but also different retailers, bars and other establishments,"" Kajee said. Illicit tobacco products are considered those which are brought into the country as contraband in order to avoid tax. Any tobacco products which are sold for less than R13.50 for a package should put on guard. http://www.cigarettespub.com/info/bat-plans-to-lay-down-illicit-tobacco-products"
14,Green Christmas,news-society," Festive season goes Green by Siobhan Louw The ‘green movement’, ‘global warming’ and ‘environmental degradation’ are not concepts you would routinely associate with the festive season, but the Green Life Market are hoping to get people to see things a bit differently this year. Surrounded by the festive sounds of traditional Christmas carols being played on instruments made from recycled materials, visitors to the day and night Christmas market will browse stalls which have on offer a wide selection of natural, organic and eco-friendly gift ideas, products and solutions. The motivation for Green Life Market is a strong desire for environmental change; they are actively looking for meaningful ways to counter the serious environmental threats to our human race, including climate change, global warming, environmental degradation and resource depletion. For Hein Richards, the brain behind Green Life Market, the solution to combating these problems is about ""renewing our minds and changing the mind-sets and value systems that underlie the environmental threats rife in today’s society."" ""Increasingly, people identify with brands as an extension of their own values and beliefs,"" says Richards.  Changing the way that people think about what is important to them, and how they live in relation to such values, will get them to align themselves with living a greener lifestyle; a far better choice for our environment and ultimately our race. Green Life Market see their role as a driving force that will ""educate consumers about healthy and ecological lifestyle choices. We feel that today people exercise their right to vote with the way in which they consume and spend; we simply seek to encourage a more conscious consumerism."" The bottom line to their approach is that ""we need to learn to do more with less—both less stuff and less impact on the environment."" Green Life Market serves as an opportunity to put this theory into practice and make ‘smarter consumerism’ a reality.  ""We are up for challenging ourselves and business owners, our suppliers, product developers, designers, and public authorities to an even higher level of thinking, aspiration, and performance."" Christmas shopping is just one opportunity to make this happen.  By giving consumers a new way to enjoy the outdoors and the festive atmosphere leading up to Christmas, Green Life Market hope to inspire their visitors to challenge there consumption, to encourage them to make wiser purchasing decisions which will protect them, their families and ultimately the environment.

15,Smoking Ban in Public Places Continue to be Violated,news-society," A long time after the ban on public smoking came into force, people in Assam continue to suffer in silence while smokers continue to puff away their cheap cigarettes, breaking the law with impunity. In offices, both government and private, smokers have encountered little restraint from authorities and flouted norms much to the dismay of non-smokers, who are aware of the health risks, not to speak of the inconvenience caused. People now are more alarmed after a pioneering study revealed that passive smoking is responsible for deaths of innocents, a figure that is quite large in India. Recently, in a respected survey carried out globally, it was revealed that passive smoking results in 600,000 deaths every year. The number of such deaths is growing in developing and underdeveloped nations where ban on tobacco smoking in public spaces is less implemented. Speaking to The Assam Tribune, Dr AC Kataki, director of Dr B Borooah Cancer Institute warned about the danger from second hand smoke, describing it as a very serious threat to non-smokers. ""There is more carcinogen in passive smoke compared to what the smoker consumes, and therefore the effects are more dangerous,"" he remarked. It is very common for passive smokers to develop a range of diseases, including respiratory and other ailments. Some non-smokers can have even cancer after prolonged exposure to passive smoke. The problem is more acute in cramped spaces like offices and also restaurants because second hand smoke lingers on for a longer time. Many public transports in the State also do not still have mandatory no-smoking signs. Among the most vulnerable sections affected by second hand smoke are pregnant women and children. The recent survey carried out in 192 countries stated that passive smoking is particularly dangerous for children, who are at a higher risk of sudden infant death syndrome, pneumonia and asthma. Dr. JN Sarma, head of Paediatrics, GMCH underlined the need for concerted action so that the threat of second hand smoking can be curbed. Researchers concluded that passive smoking had a large impact on women, killing almost 281,000 worldwide. This is due to the fact that in many parts of the world women are at least 50% more likely to be exposed to cigarettes smoke than men.

16,NHS Locums and the Great Healthcare Debate,news-society," The recent criticism of the increase in the amount spent on locum doctors by the NHS over the last two years and the subsequent speculation over whether or not patient care has suffered as a direct result has served to underline the importance of ensuring high standards in the medical recruitment industry. Amid all the wrangling between unions, healthcare bosses, politicians and front-line staff, that most pertinent and worthy of questions ""Was it worth it?"" is perhaps the only line that can be drawn under the debate. The money has been spent. So what then of the services rendered? With the spectre of healthcare cuts looming overhead, this climate of heightened scrutiny surrounding the use, and indeed, performance of locum doctors, nurses and other specialists is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. The merits of it are threefold. Firstly, an increased demand for the very best professionals and expertise. Secondly, a thrust towards a more responsible, structured and consistent recruitment market. And thirdly, and most importantly, an assurance to patients that their healthcare providers are seeking top quality staffing solutions - both temporary and permanent - from top quality staffing providers. The 19th Century American physician Oliver Wendall Holmes once wrote ""Put not your trust in money, but put your money in trust"". In the business of healthcare, these are words to be ignored at one's peril. At its most extreme, in no other sector can a financial decision result so directly in a life/death defining outcome and this is the key reason why the debate over increased expenditure on locums has gathered such momentum. For healthcare providers in need of finding expert manpower, often at short notice, it ultimately boils down to placing trust in an agency that not only understands their needs but is also able to offer them the highest quality candidates available. The NHS is facing a staffing shortage. The debate about increased expenditure on locums will continue, drawing ever more attention to their role in the system. Regardless of this, the bottom line for healthcare providers is that there are temporary posts that need filling. Do it right and you get a professional and flexible workforce. Do it wrong and it is not just reputations but lives that are placed on the line."
17,Conference Facilities Provided by Good Conference Centres,news-society," The right conference facilities can make all the difference to your guests' experience and ensure that everything goes smoothly. Corporate meetings require high levels of professionalism on the part of service providers. Most event venues provide a number of conference facilities in terms of ambience, location infrastructure and customer service. What You Should Consider While Choosing Conference Facilities Appearance is key: Delegates will start forming opinions from the moment they arrive. So it is essential that your event venue gives the right image from the very beginning. Check the conference centre's website for photographs or, if possible, visit in person and take a look around. With a bit of research, you can find a stunning conference venue for a great price. Amenities are essential: Make sure the amenities are effective and suit the needs of your conference. Check if the event venue provides high-speed internet access, LCD projectors, multimedia, telephone service and appropriate sound systems. These have to be properly placed and in the right quantity, especially if there is an issue of large group accommodation. Electrical equipments play a key role in ensuring the success of a conference. These of course will depend on the agenda of the event. For instance, if meetings are scheduled with people who are not physically present at the venue, you will need high-quality video conferencing services. Catering cannot be Ignored: Catering services are an important facility to be considered. You could find an event venue that offers a variety of cuisines from across the world. The service provider should be aware of religious and regional restrictions specific to the guests. Staff and Services: It is important that the staff is courteous and competent. Without this, even the most beautiful and well equipped conference centre will not be able to satisfy your needs. The staff will assist you in making arrangements as well as conduction sessions. If the staff is active, efficient and supportive, your conference will run smoothly, even if there are last minute changes that need to be made. Extent of Stay: Sometimes conferences may span more than a day and it may not be feasible to travel to and from the event venue daily. Many conference centres are located in hotels or are near resorts. Size does Matter: The event venue must be neither too large nor too small. The room layout will need to be flexible, depending on the purpose of your meeting. Getting There: The conference centre must be easily accessible by road. If the guests are arriving from different cities, the city in which the conference centre is located should be well connected by road and rail. Budget: Conference-centres are usually categorised as budget, prestige and premium. Factors like location, arrangements, services and amenities offered by an event venue will determine the price. However, always remember that prices are negotiable. You can also look for special and festival deals and packages offered by the conference centre management. You can get great deals when you plan and book in advance. If you require large group accommodation, you may be able to negotiate a discount or agree on a package that offers you great value for money. The right conference facilities will help you achieve your goals from a conference. Whether you are hosting a one day meeting in an office or a national or international convention requiring large group accommodation facilities, the importance of selecting the right event venue cannot be overstated. Ultimately it is all about bringing all the elements together to create an effective meeting scenario that runs smoothly and makes a good impression. The first step could be to check out the websites of various providers of conference centres and facilitates. You could consider a personal check of the venue and a test run of the equipment to be on the safe side. This is what can make all the difference between a good conference and a great one."
18,How to Meet New People,news-society," The pace at which technology is moving, coupled with the skills of talented entrepreneurs, is one area that has helped people connect with each other so much easier than ever before.   Facebook, which now has over 500 million active users, and in any town in any country there will be hundreds and thousands of people for you to connect with, is great for making connections with people, but facebook focuses more on networking with people you already know. But, what if you have moved to a new town, or country?  What are the options available to you, if you want to meet new people? Your Work If you work for a company with several employees in it, there is a good chance there will be people of a similar age group whom you can make good friends with.  Have lunch together, attend as many company activities and outings as you can, network with other departments whenever possible, and always make a personal visit to a department or a colleague rather than a phone call.  If they don’t have nights out, perhaps organise one – as simple group email is all that is required. Flat / House Share For those who can’t afford their own place, flat or house sharing is a great way to meet new people, especially in cities or large towns.  Make sure you select house mates who are in a similar position to yourself, regarding age, status, etc.  This is a sure way to make sure you’ll not have to spend lonely nights watching TV!  Check the property section of local newspapers for suitable adverts. Join a Local Gym As well as keeping fit, joining a gym will allow you to connect with a lot of local people.  Attending the classes is always a good place to start, and their socials.  If they currently don’t organise socials, ask them if they would, or organise one of your own by preparing a simple poster and posting it on their notice board. Search the Local Forums Most large towns and counties will have their own forums and many will have a personals or friendship section.  Find out which forums cover your area and place an ad.  You might be surprised by the response you get and like with anything you do online, exercise caution and always arrange to meet people in a safe environment. Join Social Networking Sites Another quick way for meeting new people quickly.  There are several ‘friends’ sites that are established - some are stronger than others depending on the town, city or country.  Use the search engines for finding the strongest ones in your area.  Most of them allow you to upload pictures, create your own personal profile and contact is always made through the site so your personal details are never revealed.  Some sites organise group events or for those less outgoing, one to ones are popular.   The ‘friends’ sites are a quick way to meet new people and another avenue for you to use, in addition to the above.  Generally, the more effort you make contacting people, the greater your chances of success will be.  Most people rely on others to make contact first – don’t let other people control your future!  Identify those people who catch you eye, or have similar interests, and make contact with them as soon as you can. Dating Sites Of course if you want to meet a member of the opposite sex, the above suggestions will work, but you also have the use of many tried and tested dating sites.  Most are subscription based, but there are also those that are free to use. Meeting new people shouldn’t be difficult if you try at least some of the above methods."
19,Knowing More about Audio Visual Services,news-society," The T3 Gadget Awards, hosted on October 11, 2010 in London, pulled in thousands of fans. Amidst the cheering crowd, Apple's iPhone 4 won the Commuter Gadget of the Year award. But image this event without any lighting or sound. Would the crowd be as excited and the event as successful without lighting, sound effects and video presentations? Tips on Selecting Audio Visual Services The AV equipment that you choose makes a huge difference to the success of the event you are planning as well as to your budget. So, you need to know a few critical things as you begin your journey in planning an event. •	Minor details: Every minute detail of such things like batteries, cables and media outlets matter when you're the layout of the audio visual installation at an event site. •	Know the audio visual equipment that will be used: You have to be sure of the equipment you will be using. Moreover, you must at least have some basic idea of the working of the equipment whether it is a computer, an LCD screen or a projector. •	Consider the size of the location: Select the AV equipment on the basis of the venue's size. A larger locale or a crowded venue will not be a success without amplified voices while a smaller one will not need this facility. •	Assess the venue: Ensure the conference venue is acoustic treated to avoid sound distortions like reverberations. Basic acoustical infrastructure like wall panels that absorb sound and curtains with the right thickness for windows ensure this. Similarly, the venue should ideally have carpeted floors and ceiling tiles that make it acoustically treated. AV companies usually have experts to advise you on cheap temporary solutions for such problems. •	Plan placement and number of audio visual equipment: AV equipment should not be placed near sources that could disturb clarity. You need not have quantity to ensure quality. A few microphones could produce the best sound with proper volume control. •	Know the event: Decide the types of audio visual services and equipment to be provided on the basis of the kind of event. For an informal event, use megaphones or a wireless sound system for greater flexibility. For formal occasions, a wired PA system which generally has limited mobility is more suitable. •	Plan the audio visual system: Find a corporate event management company that does careful monitoring of every little detail that could affect costs as well as functioning. Will the audio visual system at the venue integrate all audio visual services being used or will separate systems be needed for each piece of AV equipment are key factors to be considered in the planning stage. •	Prepare for problems: There are always chances of a system or power failure. Be sure to have backups. Ability to provide audio visual services that can ensure the show goes on despite technical failures can make or break reputations in corporate event management. Audio visual services play a vital role in the success of certain events. Effective AV equipment can change how smoothly a meeting, conference or sales presentation runs. Depending on your needs, you can just hire some AV equipment, like a projector, for a day or get a corporate event management company to plan the entire event. Hiring a professional company has numerous advantages. For starters, you may not be as abreast of the latest technological developments in this field as would an expert. Moreover, the audio visual services company would be able to provide technicians who are skilled in the use of the AV equipment. When you get audio visual services from a professional, you should definitely check their track record. Companies that have experience in corporate event management would not only be able to provide you better services, but also bring down the cost of hosting the event through their expert suggestions. Do not think of getting in touch with the audio visual services company at the end of your planning stage. Get the corporate event management company involved right from the beginning of planning. Such experts would be able to help you with conceptualising and organising the event as well as getting the best AV equipment."
20,"Top 10 Tips for a Green, Sustainable and Eco Friendly Christmas",news-society," Here are top 10 Green Christmas tips that will help you to save money, reduce your Christmas carbon footprint and have a more eco friendly and sustainable noel. Don't forget to turn off your fairy lights Fifteen per cent of household electricity is wasted by leaving TVs, Hi-fi's and other appliances on standby – costing each of us an average of £37 per year – Make sure you turn things off when your're not using them. In general lighting accounts for 15% of household electricity, and Christmas tree lights left on for 10 hours a day over the 12 days of Christmas produce enough carbon dioxide to inflate 12 balloons - so make sure you get energy saving light bulbs for your house, and at Xmas, try some solar powered fairy lights for some winter sparkle without adding to your carbon footprint. Christmas cards An estimated 1.7 billion Christmas cards are sent each year in Britain, the equivalent of 200,000 trees, and around 1 million Christmas cards are thrown away every year. I try to send recycled Christmas cards (but you could make your own, or send texts or e-cards instead). After the big day, make sure your Christmas cards don't go to waste – take them to a Woodland Trust recycling point. You can buy recycled Christmas cards from charities and donate up to 20% to less fortunate people at the same time. Recycled wrapping paper There's no point recycling rubbish if you don't buy recycled products! It's estimated that 83 square kilometres of wrapping paper end up in our rubbish bins each year, that's enough to wrap up Guernsey, so make sure you use recycled wrapping paper, and try to wrap presents with ribbon or string instead of cello tape. Candles Paraffin candles are made from petroleum residues so neither do your health or the environment any good. Soy, beeswax or natural vegetable-based candles are better because they biodegrade, are smoke-free, and so more eco friendly. Deck the halls with real holly Instead of spending money on artificial Christmas decorations that won't biodegrade, let nature decorate your home. House decorations can be made from organic, recycled and scrap materials. Try popcorn, dough, cinnamon sticks, bows, gingerbread, holly, seasonal berries, ivy and evergreen branches – once you have finished with them, you can put them in the composter. Christmas trees If you've been wondering which is better, the simple answer is that real trees are the more eco friendly choice. Although artificial trees last for many years they are made from metal and derivatives of PVC, which requires large amounts of energy to make and also creates by-products such as lead which can be harmful to both the environment and human health. The average life of an artificial tree is just 6 years and given that they are not naturally biodegradable they will potentially pollute a landfill site for many years to come. Most artificial trees sold in the UK are now made in Taiwan and China and so have additional energy costs associated with transport. Real trees are carbon neutral, absorbing as much carbon dioxide as they grow as they will emit when burnt or left to decompose. They are also a wildlife habitat and a naturally renewable resource, and generally feel much nicer in your home. They can be planted in your garden after Christmas, and even used again next year. In 2006, six million Christmas trees took pride of place in British homes and offices. Of these only 10% were recycled and fewer than 5% planted to be re-used next year, so... Tree Buying Tips Buy from a small-scale sustainable grower and/or make sure the tree has Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) accreditation; you can go to www.soilassociation.org/christmas for a list of producers. And choose a tree with roots so it can be replanted. If replanting isn’t an option most local councils run Christmas tree recycling schemes. Contact yours or go to www.letsrecycle.com Or this year, why not start growing your own? Be battery wise Families can get through a lot of batteries, particularly at Christmas. Batteries contain toxic chemicals, don't biodegrade and are difficult to recycle. Instead use rechargeable ones. Buy an organic turkey 10 million turkeys are eaten every Christmas. If you can, try to make sure it has been reared in humane conditions. Organic turkeys taste better too. Try to buy your Christmas food locally, shopping at farmers markets or buying direct from the farmer is far cheaper than buying organic in the supermarket. Think of the benefits – the taste of chemical-free food, the reduction in food miles and CO2 emissions, and reduced dependence on oil. Buying locally produced food also boosts rural jobs. Recycle your unwanted presents Unfortunately everyone receives at least one unwanted gift at Christmas. I often recycle my unwanted presents to charities. Local hospitals and hospices are often very pleased to receive unwanted smellies to give to patients. Give a charity or environmentally friendly gift Sponsor an animal or give a membership to a charity or environmental organisation for Christmas. With a little planning anyone can give presents that are thoughtful, original and make a difference to the environment too."
