1,Best Treats for Cats,pets," Our furry friends are members of the family, so of course, we want to reward them with treats – often whether they’ve done anything to warrant them or not. Cat treats are popular items, ranging from food to catnip, and are available everywhere in many varieties. However, you must understand the nuances of cat treats so you aren’t feeding your pet anything harmful – and so you don’t turn your cat into a choker. From commercial cat treats to homemade treats, we’ll talk about what treats you can feed your cat and the best practices for doing so. Types of Treats Cat treats come in several styles. If your cat is a fan of dry food but doesn’t eat wet food, you can get dry treats to keep his palate comfortable and familiar. Inversely, cats that do not prefer dry food can be given wet treats. Some wet treats are in pouches, while others can be served in long, tubular containers. How often should I feed my cat treats? Most of the time, cat treats do not provide much nutritional value, if anything at all. They’re simply delicious. But because many cats can develop a taste for them, they may want their treats more than they want their normal food, which can leave them vitamin and nutrient deficient. To combat this, you should make treat-giving a semi-regular occurrence, or use treats as rewards. Most cats need about 200 calories per day to maintain their weight. If you add too many treats, they’ll start to gain weight, which can be unhealthy for your kitty. Don’t feed your cat treats every night after dinner or before bed. They may associate the time with the food, which can cause them to beg or meow until they get their treats. Give your cat a few treats two or three times a week, and be sure to keep the bag out of reach – many curious and persistent kitties have gotten into cabinets and onto shelves to tear the bags open and eat until they can’t move! If you’re trying to train your cat, give them treats after every success. When they give you their paw to shake, when they play dead, or when they stand up and bat at the air, give them the treat – but beware that you accompany the treat with a verbal command, else you’ll end up with cats who perform their tricks without being prompted and expect treats all the time! Additionally, if you have to put your cat through an unpleasant experience, it’s a good idea to reward them with treats to help calm them down. You can give your cat treats if you just took them to the vet or if they had an operation (but check with your vet first!), clip their nails, bathed them, relocated homes, and more. Cats are creatures of habit, and if there is a disruption in their routine or space, they become anxious or upset. Treats can help take their mind off the change. Can I give my cat human food as a treat? You should be aware that some kinds of human food cannot be eaten by cats, and is toxic. Don’t feed your cat snacks like chocolate, grapes, and raisins, and don’t prepare any food for your cat with onions, garlic, or chives. You can, however, give your cat light helpings of cheese, cooked fish (salmon, tuna, shrimp), cooked meats (chicken and beef, bacon and ham), and the like. Always consult with your veterinarian to determine what’s safe for your cat to eat. What are good treats for cats? The best treats for cats will do more than simply taste great. Some treat manufacturers deliberately add nutrients to benefit the cats. For example, treats made from the organic chicken will provide ample protein for your cat. Some treats will have no preservatives, artificial flavors, artificial colors, or additives, which can promote the overall health of your cat. Others will have a single ingredient, which ensures that your cat isn’t ingesting anything dangerous. Additionally, treats that promote dental health are very beneficial. These treats are designed to help fight tartar, promote oral health, keep a cat’s teeth strong, and prevent decay. You’ll have to be diligent about the rest of your cat’s diet, though, to ensure that their teeth aren’t suffering too much from other foods. Is catnip a treat? cat chewing stick Cats get into shenanigans with catnip. Photo by Fernando Vega on Unsplash. Yes, catnip is a treat! Many cats love to ingest it, lick it, or roll around in it. They’ll veg out and relax, or they’ll become very hyper and dart around, playing with everything in sight. But like all treats, it’s important to not overdo it with catnip. Don’t give it to your cat every day, and don’t use it too much at once. And be sure to keep the container or bag closed and out of reach, or your kitty will try to find a way to steal it! Real Meat jerky treats (beef, lamb/liver, chicken/venison, fish/venison) Wild Meadow treats (beef, chicken, duck, turkey) ORIJEN treats (lamb, tundra, six fish, regional red, original) INABA Churu treats (chicken by itself or with cheese or crab, or tuna by itself or with salmon) Vital Essentials treats (Ahi tuna, chicken breast, chicken giblets, chicken hearts, duck liver, minnow, rabbit bites, wild Alaskan salmon)"
2,EFFECTS OF CREMATION ON THE ENVIRONMENT,pets," EFFECTS OF CREMATION ON THE ENVIRONMENT Now more than ever, we should be paying careful attention to the impact we have on the environment. This can stretch from how we manage our energy and resources in daily life all the way to how we care for our pets after they’ve passed away. Many individuals like to cremate their pets; it’s a popular option that allows the pet to stay with you in an urn or box and be placed on a mantle or in a display case as a commemoration. However, atmosphere emissions can be a problem. This is why eco-friendly options like aquamation are good choices. You can keep the remains of your pet at a greatly reduced impact on the environment. Cremation has been used for decades, so it’s no surprise that the compound effects have finally added up and taken a toll on the environment. Consider the environmental impact of cremation and aquamation if you are looking for pet afterlife services. Cremation Emissions During the cremation process, the flames can reach more than 2000 degrees Fahrenheit. The impurities from the fire are somewhat controlled in crematoriums, but they do not adequately filter everything. As a result, the smoke rises into the atmosphere and has a negative impact. The carbon dioxide emissions are also problematic – they result in nearly 7 million metric tons of emissions each year. Mercury is also emitted during cremation, although generally only from those who have fillings in their teeth. It is not nearly as widely emitted as carbon dioxide, though, and is less common during pet cremation. Additionally, it is possible for radiation that has been administered to the body, such as to those who suffered cancer and underwent chemotherapy, to have adverse effects on the environment – and on the workers who operate the crematorium. Cities have placed limits on how long some crematoriums can run their fires and for how long. This is meant to minimize the impact on the environment as much as possible, but no matter what, noxious fumes and dangerous emissions will still get through. The more that fire by cremation is used, the more toxic emissions are released into the environment. Over time, this contributes to air pollution, ozone damage, and more. The quality of the air we breathe is extremely important, and you can do your part to help correct the environmental impact of cremation by considering options other than cremation by fire. Aquamation: Alternative to Cremation While cremation by fire has long been used as the predominant way of transforming the corporeal remains of a pet, aquamation has recently become more common. It’s a water-based cremation style that essentially creates next to zero emissions from the body of the pet. This kind of flameless cremation also drastically reduces the emissions that come from the facility itself. During aquamation, a process known as alkaline hydrolysis occurs. The body of the pet is placed in a pressurized container that contains water and potassium hydroxide. The container is heated to a little over 300 degrees Fahrenheit, which is about six to seven times lower than the heat used in cremation by fire. The high pressurization prevents the water from boiling, though. After a few hours, the body will be broken down into its component parts of amino acids, sugars, salts, and bone remains. These remains are crushed and compacted into dust. The wastewater is then disposed of into water treatment facilities. However, the excess water can also be used as fertilizer, which is another great way to give back to the environment. If you’d be interested in growing a garden, it can be comforting knowing that additional remains from your pet helped make that a reality. Further, the electricity needed to run the aquamation process is much lower than cremation by fire, as well. Saving power is a wise environmental move, of course. The more companies that use excess power on a grid, the more likely it is for the grid to be overloaded. Overuse can lead to rolling blackouts or forced blackouts, which are specific outages to try and control the distribution of power.

In addition to aquamation, there are other green burials that you can consider for your pet. Some companies have created biodegradable pods that you can place your pet in that will allow both to return to earth as they break down. You can also elect to have your pet placed in a reef. This option is relatively new; an environmentally safe concrete reef can be populated with the cremated remains of your pet, and marine life will form on it. This helps the environment continue to thrive and grow, as many reefs have suffered damage due to oil spills, garbage, and water pollution. Deciding on an Afterlife Process Essentially, if you want to make sure that your pet returns to nature and does not have a negative impact on the environment, you can look into processes besides cremation by fire. Don’t worry – the processes still allow you to have a proper send-off, a funeral, and more. You can also retain the urn with the cremains of your pet, so there is never any doubt that your pet will stay with you after it has passed away. Consult with your family to determine what you think is the best option. Prices for aquamation, green burials, cremation, and reef burials will vary, and you should be mindful of your finances when making a choice. You should also do some research to see more about the environmental impact of cremation if you are hesitant about using cremation by fire as a way to retain your pet’s remains."
3,Blog posts 5 Useful Tips on How to Clean Fish Poop in Tank,pets," One of the most important aspects of owning a fish tank is keeping it clean. This means removing fish poop and other waste materials regularly. If you want to keep fish as home pets and you can't clean fish poop in tanks, look for the best waste remover, water changer, and gravel cleaner near you. In this blog post, we will share with you five tips on how to clean fish poop in your tank quickly and easily. This is by far one of the best methods to get rid of fish poop in your tank. All you need to do is make the water level drop in your aquarium by temporarily removing some of its water. You can then scoop out all the waste that has gathered at the bottom into a bucket with another container underneath it to catch any excess water (if there are live plants in your tank). You can also use an air compressor or a regular hair dryer (used for this purpose only) to blow away any dead leaves and uneaten food particles near the surface before refilling it back. When done properly, performed once or twice in a month, this helps reduce organic build-up and decreases the frequency of water changes. A handy fish tank vacuum is an attachment you attach to your aquarium's filtration system. It gets especially designed to suck up all kinds of debris, including fish waste and uneaten food. You will need to place the fish poop vacuum in either of two ways: •	Attach it directly into the outlet tube that leads back into your aquarium •	You can attach it through another smaller tube that runs parallel with the main filtration/pump tubing before reaching the water return valve. This ensures that almost all waste material inside your tank gets sucked out. Cleaning tabs are small packets of detergent designed to be placed in the gravel or inside your filter cartridge, where they dissolve slowly to clean away organic waste without depleting oxygen levels in the water. Since these tabs are tiny, it is best you remove any larger fish like Koi and goldfish when you use this type of product. You can then temporarily put them back into your aquarium after removing all the poop. Make sure that the cleaning tab packets do not contain harmful chemicals, since fish could easily swallow them by accident. A siphon is an easy-to-use tool for removing waste from your fish tank, but make sure there are no living plants or fish inside before attaching it. This is because the siphon sucks up everything around it, including your fish's tank mates. It works by sucking up waste into a vacuum hose that leads outside of your aquarium where you can then discard it without polluting the environment. Even if there are plants and fish inside your tank, you can still use this tool since most of them cannot survive underwater, anyway. Just be sure to feed them before using the siphon so they won't get sucked inside as well. Using baking soda is another good way on how to clean fish poop in a tank. It acts like an organic magnet attracting all harmful bacteria floating around in your aquarium water, which causes poor water quality and causes fish to get sick. Once most of the bacteria go, your water becomes purified and clear again. Baking soda is also very cheap and easy to find in most supermarkets or local grocery stores. Just make sure you never mix baking soda with any other types of cleaner since this could release toxic fumes that are not only harmful for your fish, but for you as well!"
4,Service Dogs Against Anxiety and Depression,pets," Can a cat's purring or a dog's tail wagging help us if we suffer from anxiety or depression? In some cases, the answer is yes. ""Pets offer unconditional love that can be very beneficial to people with depression,"" said Ian Cook, psychiatrist and director of the Depression Clinic and Research Program at UCLA. If you have a cat or dog at home, you will agree that they are not only excellent roommates, but often unwitting therapists. Several studies have confirmed that pets help lower blood pressure and relieve stress. For those suffering from anxiety and depression, animals are often a great help in coping with the day and the difficulties that are encountered on a daily basis. This is true for both adults and children. How can dogs help manage depression, anxiety and stress? More than other animals, dogs are particularly attuned to humans, their behaviors and their emotions. While on the one hand they are able to ""learn"" many of the commonly used words, on the other hand they have a high sensitivity to the tone of voice used, body language and gestures. And as happens with the best of our human friends, a faithful dog can look you in the eye, catch an emotion and try to understand how you feel and what you think (doing their best while waiting for the next walk or meal, of course). While most people who own a dog are very clear about the joys of having an animal friend, on the other hand some are not well aware of the enormous physical and mental benefits that far outweigh the pleasure of company. Only recently has a number of scientific studies begun to explore the benefits of the link between humans and animals. The American Heart Association has linked the presence of an animal friend (especially the dog) to a reduction in the risk of heart disease and an increase in lifespan. The studies also revealed that: Those who have a dog are less likely to suffer from depression than those who do not. People who have dogs show lower blood pressure in stressful situations. A study also found that people with threshold hypertension experienced a drop in blood pressure levels in the five months following the adoption of a dog in a kennel. Playing with a dog or cat can increase serotonin and dopamine levels and consequently allow for greater calm and relaxation. Anyone who has a pet has, compared to others, a lower level of triglycerides and cholesterol. Patients who have suffered a heart attack tend to have a higher survival rate if they have an animal friend. Those over 65 who have a pet have about 30% fewer medical visits than those who don't. One of the reasons for the therapeutic effects is that dogs satisfy one of the basic needs of the human being: contact. Even criminals locked up in prison have shown long-term behavioral changes after interacting with the dogs. Caressing, hugging and in general touching the beloved animal friend can quickly calm and comfort us when we are anxious or under stress. The company of an animal can also relieve a sense of loneliness, and many dogs can also help us get healthy exercise, all of which are essential for alleviating depression. Psychiatric Service Dogs Dogs can improve people’s daily life with just their presence and contact, but they can actually do much more than that. Dogs can be trained as Psychiatric Service Dogs to assist people with physical or mental impairment, such as depression, PTSD, anxiety, panic attacks and other mental conditions that affect daily life. They play a key role in helping improve their lives, making it easier for them to do stuff they won’t be able or would find it very difficult to do alone. Dogs trained to be Psychiatric Service Dogs learn to carry out a great variety of tasks, such as turning on/off lights, help their handler get some space in a crowd if feeling overwhelmed, or even guide the handler away from the crowd to a more isolated spot, alerting of a upcoming panic attack, so that the handler can take medication, use body pressure to calm down the handler (deep pressure) and even help their handlers discern hallucinations from reality. Some tasks PSDs perform are requested by their owner, but some others are cued by the situation and environment, and their execution rely in part on the dogs best judgement. The incredible thing is that dogs are so smart that if thought in the right way they can learn all these tasks at home with their family, with just the guidance of an experienced instructor. Service Dog Training School International proved this already with their online service dog training courses, which have received much praise by the students enrolled in the courses and have successfully trained thousands of professional service dogs. All you need is commitment and love."
5,5 Ways to Care for your Aging Dog,pets," Just like humans, dogs age too. They start to experience many of the same things that we do as we age. Things like joint problems and mobility issues are prevalent in older dogs. For example, their bones start to lose their elasticity and become brittle, so they can start to break much easier than they would have in their younger years. Their joints, hips, and knees can start to become stiff, and they may have a hard time getting up or moving around. Still, there are several things that you can do to help an aging dog remain mobile and comfortable. Dogs need their daily dose of energy! Even for aging canines, getting a high-quality meal is super important. While it may be tempting to feed your aging dog some table scraps now and then, that isn't something you should do. Instead, make sure you are feeding them high-quality foods that are specifically designed for aging dogs — and make sure they have plenty of fresh water every day. Just like people, a good exercise routine is vital for keeping older dogs healthy and mobile. Brisk walks around the neighborhood is an excellent way for an older dog to get the exercise they need without causing them any harm or discomfort. Keep in mind that older dogs need just as much exercise as younger ones do, so don’t let them get too sedentary over time. They need a good balance of activity and rest to keep them feeling good. When canines get older, they need more attention from professional veterinary specialists. Sometimes, aging dogs have digestive problems, while others have issues with their skin and coat. With these issues becoming more frequent, being in touch with your veterinarian is necessary. With Petcube Online Vet, you can get online professional help from a team of certified veterinarians. Since 60% of vet visits could be just a chat, you get peace of mind that your aging dog’s potential problems can easily be clarified and reviewed online. Unless your dog shows some severe symptoms, online veterinary can be pretty efficient, both for your canine and you. Things like mobility and comfort are essential when it comes to aging dogs. Dogs can start to experience joint pain as they age, which can cause several mobility issues. Your job as the dog owner is to provide comfort to your dog and ensure that they have a comfy place to lay down and sleep. Your dog might also benefit from using an orthopedic or a memory foam bed. For aging dogs, health issues are more frequent and sometimes severe. While checking up with an online and on-site vet is necessary, preparing yourself for unexpected vet bills can be a brilliant idea. With an Emergency Fund by Petcube, you get a $3,000 safety net for unexpected accident-only vet bills. You won’t ever be faced with a choice between your pet’s life and vet help costs. Other than that, insurance for pets is one of the best ideas to make sure your fur friend is safe and sound no matter what. Final remark Your senior or aging canine friend needs a unique approach, and you need to be knowledgeable and attentive all the time. Follow the mentioned steps to give your pet what they deserve in their senior years. After all, it’s always kind to do your best to do everything your dog needs to live a genuinely happy life."
6,WHY A DOG IS A GREAT CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR CHILDREN,pets," A pet could be a great Christmas present for children or elders, especially a puppy dog, so cute and a great companion and source of entertainment. There is a number of reasons why a puppy dog can be great for children, here I have listed 5: Responsibility. By taking care of their dog, feeding, providing water, grooming, cleaning after him, children can understand the meaning of being responsible for something, and along with it, feel a sense of importance and satisfaction which comes with fulfilling one’s duties. Patience. Dogs have a personality of their own, and a will of their own, especially if they are puppies and have not been trained yet. This means that they could chew on furniture, pee indoors, literally bring havoc onto a house. It requires a great deal of patience to not get angry, to not yell to the dog, and methodically train the dog good habits, so that all the family can happily coexist together. Empathy. Just like humans, dogs can feel emotions and pain; they feel upset if we yell at them or if we are angry at them, they feel lonely if we do not interact with them for a prolonged period of time. By witnessing the dog’s emotions, children can learn to empathize with them, and to recognize and react to the same emotions in humans or other pets. Socialization. Dogs need a lot of attention and affection, by learning how to interact with their dog, children can learn the skills of socialization, applicable also to humans. Moreover, dogs are basically social magnets, when kids are out taking the dog for a stroll in the park, they are certainly going to attract a lot of attention from the other kids, and this can help shy kids with striking up a conversation and making new friends. Health. Dogs love playing and running, they need to be taken out every day, sometimes more than once a day, and this is a fantastic way for children to exercise, and get some fresh air outdoors, instead of being stuck inside glued to their tablets, mobile phones or video-games. Plus, children who grow up with a dog are less prone to develop allergies. Most importantly, dogs are a real source of fun and joy, they are faithful companions, they are not judgmental, they stick by their owners/family, they make you feel loved and protected. I would not want to grow without the joy of having a dog friend around. Dogs are although a life commitment, one cannot just acquire a dog, and then abandon him because he does not meet some idyllic and not very down-to-earth expectations. And dogs should be treated right, they should be fed well, groomed, get their vaccinations, cured when needed and cared upon. That said, it is also important that dogs are trained, so that they can fit better in the family environment, that they are not dangerous for children and strangers, and that they can be safely taken out in public to share more time with the family even outside the confines of the house. The training can be done together with the kids under the supervision of an adult, this way the gift will not only be the dog, but a lot of quality time to spend with the family, having fun training the cute newcomer. Letting the children join in the dog training, will also help them build a strong bond with the dog, help the kid understand how to communicate with the dog correctly and effectively, how to interpret the dog’s behaviors. Choosing an online training course might be the best option, as it allows the training to progress at one’s own pace, fitting better into a busy family life schedule, and giving the possibility to review more than once the training materials to better fix the teachings to memory. A good example is the SDTSI’s Service Dog Puppy Training 101 Course, which teaches puppies all the basic skills they need to become good mannered and obedient dogs. Service Dog Training School International employs only positive reinforcement training methods, which makes training lots of fun. In the end, it is not really important what present you get for your kids for Christmas, what they need is love and friendship, and in my opinion, dogs embody both."
7,Why dogs are humans’ best friends?,pets," The friendship between dogs and humans has ancient origins and was born spontaneously when wolves approached our species in search of food resources with a lower expenditure of energy. This millennial relationship continues to the present day and the relationship has become more and more solid. ""The dog is man's best friend"". We have always been used to using this definition and thinking that it is ""normal"" to live with him and that he is part of our life. But how did this friendship start? How far back must we go in time to understand what is the path that dogs and humans have made together in the course of history? In recent decades, theories on dog domestication have changed a lot and, in some cases, have completely revolutionized what has always been believed. In fact, man has always been considered the only and absolute protagonist of this process and a passive role was attributed to the dog. The most common theories were that some wolf adults had been captured and subsequently reproduced in captivity, or that they had collected pups and raised them. Among the first scholars to question them, highlighting their gaps and critical points, there were Lorna and Raymond Coppinger with their book “Dogs. A surprising new interpretation of the origin, evolution and behavior of the dog "". According to their thesis, the domestication process is not based on a direct action towards the wolf but, more generally, on the environment: the abundance of food coming from human settlements in the form of leftovers, would in practice create a new ecological niche suitable to be occupied. In other words, some wolves would have spontaneously approached us for the possibility of finding food resources with a lower expenditure of energy. These subjects would then begin to reproduce independently from each other giving rise to a new subspecies different both for physical and behavioral traits. In particular, the most relevant feature was that of having a shorter ""escape distance"". This means that the first dogs, although not yet properly domesticated, tolerated the proximity of human beings more, tended not to run away from their sight and took a short time to get closer. The first great alliance However, before talking about friendship, there is still a question we need to ask ourselves. Why have we accepted this presence? Having a diet partly similar to ours, the dog could have been considered a competitor, chased away or even preyed upon. In reality, it did not behave as such and on the contrary it probably showed characteristics of some usefulness. But, although we have always thought first of all to guard and protection activities, or to aid in hunting, in reality probably the first great task that the dogs took on and which turned out to be important was linked to their role as ""scavengers"", who cleaned up waste in our settlements. In societies such as those of 15,000 years ago (or perhaps more), where there were no sewers or other disposal facilities, the accumulation of waste and biological remains around the camps could prove dangerous both from a health point of view and in attracting others potentially dangerous animal species. Those societies that therefore accepted the presence of dogs could have a concrete advantage in health and safety. One of the first reasons for this ancient friendship, then, could be based more on the eating habits of this species than on other performative skills. Workmates, but not only Once it became a regular visitor to our villages, an accepted presence, the dog was not only able to show us all its qualities and intelligence, but it can be said that it has contributed to change us and change the course of our history. And in fact, between 15 and 40 thousand years ago, the dog was the first ever to make us understand that coexistence with different species was not only possible, but even advantageous. All the others came thousands or perhaps tens of thousands of years later. In the current technological age, where we have machines for any purpose, we tend to forget the importance of domestication. However, it would be enough to think that some species have speeded up transport, favored trade and connected distant peoples to each other; others have made it possible to cultivate large plots of land and feed entire populations; still others to be able to cover and warm up in the coldest climates. In short, much of our progress depends on domestication. In this process the dog not only acted as a forerunner, approaching us spontaneously and showing us not to be dangerous, but he accompanied us by staying by our side and in many cases providing us with precious help. He helped us in defense, in hunting, in leading the herds to pasture and in protecting them. In short, he did not behave simply as a friend, but as a member of a group, in which to take on a role, tasks and for which to sacrifice himself if needed. And today? This millennial relationship continues to the present day and, although modern life is very different from that of our ancestors, the bond with dogs does not seem to have weakened. They have come to live in cities and in our homes; they come with us to many places and even on vacation; we dedicate part of our time to them by purchasing increasingly targeted services: from the veterinarian to the educator, from sports to leisure activities. But how has our relationship with this species evolved? Even if those activities that they have carried out for millennia are no longer so widespread, dogs have been able to readjust themselves to our contemporary society in many ways and the role they have assumed demonstrates their friendship as perhaps we had never before been able to understand. New activities As we refined our knowledge, we learned how to teach them extremely complex activities. These range from social utility in assistance to civil protection in rescue and search, or in the army and law enforcement. In these activities our friends give us every day proof not only of their incredible intelligence and adaptability, but of knowing how to carry out their role as a real mission, demonstrating the self-denial and the capacity for sacrifice that only those who nurture a deep bond are able to prove. Service Dogs One of the most important jobs that dogs can take on nowadays, is that of a service dog. There are many types of service dogs, and they all share the same purpose, helping and supporting people with health and/or mental disabilities. Service dogs are trained to use their strong capabilities to perform incredible tasks, such as sensing oncoming seizures and alerting their assisted or others who could help, pushing or pulling wheelchairs, stopping self-harming behaviors, helping discern reality from hallucinations, and the list could go on a while… What’s most amazing is that many types of service dog can be trained directly at home by their owner, with the help of professional guidance. The bond between the dog and owner helps the training being more effective and successful, and at the same time training together helps tightening the bond and getting stronger synergy. There are many professionals who provide service dog training services both online and offline, among them Service Dog Training School International which provides online training courses for service dogs, psychiatric service dogs, therapy dogs, diabetic alert dogs and other dog training courses which show us just how lucky we are to have dogs in our lives as our companions, and how much good the bond between our species has brought, is keep bringing and will bring."
8,How many diverse types of service dogs and what they do?,pets," Humans have identified dogs as their loyal companions since the dawn of time, and many leading past civilizations, recognizing their enormous potential and abilities, have raised dogs to the status of deities, like Anubis for the Egyptians, Xolotl for the Mayas tribe, and Cerberus for the Greeks. Even now we are often awe-struck by the incredible new abilities we find out in our dog friends, like the ability to sense and alert of oncoming epileptic seizures, the ability to smell low and high blood sugar levels, and according to a research of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Durham University in the UK, dogs even have the capacity of smelling COVID-19 on people with a successful rate of 94%. Dogs might not be deities, but they definitely have some superpowers. And what is most heart-warming, is that dogs use their “powers” every day to help people in need, making their life safer and easier to get by. Share America estimates that in 2021 approximately 500,000 registered service dogs are helping people, and they seem to be nowhere to enough, as more families are applying to get their own service dog and are stuck in long waiting queues. Although I like to call them superheroes, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) defines service dogs as “dogs that are individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities.” Service dogs help both people with physical and mental disabilities, and there are various types of service dogs, each trained to conduct different tasks, according to the condition of the assisted. Here I have summed up 8 different type of service dogs, and what they can do. Guide dogs are the eyes of blind and visually impaired people, they help them travel safely and confidently through familiar environments as well as foreign ones. The handler will tell the guide dog where to go, and the service dog will navigate him/her safely, avoiding obstacles, alerting the handler of doors and steps in the way, as well as low hanging tree branches or other objects in the way which could harm the handler, finding pedestrian crossings when necessary to cross the street, and leading its handler to cross only when it is safe to do so. An interesting characteristic of guide dogs is that they are trained to obey their handler but are also trained to disobey him/her! It is called “intelligent disobedience,” meaning that the guide dog can refuse to carry out a handler’s command, if it feels it is unsafe, and would cause harm to the handler. Like stepping out onto the street when there is oncoming traffic. Labradors and Golden Retrievers are usually employed as guide dogs, and they start their training very young, when they are just puppies. At first, they learn just the basic commands, such as “sit,” “drop” and “stay,” then they spend around six months learning how to behave in public and busy environments without getting distracted from their job. After that they start the real guide dog training, which usually takes 6 months to 1 year, finally they are paired with a handler with whom they will train with, until they are ready to be on their own. Hearing dogs are the ears of deaf and hearing-impaired people. They are trained to alert their handlers of common sounds, such as alarm clock, doorbell, mobile ringing, baby’s cry, smoke alarm, or other important noises meaningful to the handler. To alert, they would make physical contact, by nudging with their nose or pawing. Many hearing dogs are also trained to lead their handler to the source of the noise, or in some cases, where the source of the noise is dangerous and could harm their handler, they would lead away from it to a safer location. Although hearing dogs are trained to be attentive to certain sounds, they are also trained to tune out all unimportant background noises and stay focused on their jobs, especially when outside, where busy street noises could be scaring and overwhelming for untrained dogs. Hearing dogs can also be taught respond to Sign Language cues, when they are to assist people who are non-verbal. Most hearing dogs are small to medium size mixed breeds, although people tend to prefer Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, Poodles and Cocker Spaniels for this job, still what is really important is that the dog is very attentive to sound, has a steady temperament, is friendly and people-oriented and has the ability to stay focused on its job, to become a valid hearing service dog. Mobility service dogs are trained to assist physically disabled people with mobility issues, ranging from milder issues like poor balance, to more severe ones, like the impossibility to ambulate without a wheelchair. Apart from providing love, affection and company, mobility service dogs can do a lot to help their assisted, they help their handler maintain his/her balance while walking or going up and down the stairs, can pick up and carry objects, open and close doors, drawers and cabinets, switch lights on and off, and even pull the wheelchair, although it is suggested that the dog pulls only for a short amount of time, and not as the only traction, but along with the handler operating the wheelchair. Usually, medium to big size dogs are chosen to be trained as mobility service dogs, as their tasks require a bit of physical strength. Prioritized dog breeds for this job are Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, German Shepherds, Bernese Mountain Dogs and Poodles. Psychiatric service dogs (PSDs), unlike the service dogs listed above, are not meant to assist people with physical issues, but to help people with mental health disorders. This does not make them any less important, and their job is actually somewhat trickier, given the difficulty of identifying the cues of the disease presenting itself, like hallucinations, anxiety, or panic. Psychiatric service dogs can offer their services to people affected by post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and social phobias. They are able to prevent or reduce anxiety and panic attacks, as well as emotional meltdowns by distracting the handler, or applying physical pressure to provide comfort and help the handler calm down. They can warn people around to give you space, and fetch medications, as well as alert others if they feel their handler is in danger. For people who suffer of hallucinations, PSDs are extremely helpful in helping them discern what is real and what is not, keeping them anchored firm to reality. Seen how psychiatric service dogs’ job is not only ruled by verbal cues coming from their handlers directly, but it is mostly triggered by the cues coming from the handler’s body language, changes in attitude and feeling, or from the environment itself, it is important that psychiatric service dogs train close to their handlers to identify, understand and memorize the cues of oncoming attacks, and be able to respond more efficiently. Dog of any breed can be trained to become PSDs, what is important is that the dog is sociable, attentive, able to focus on its job, and has a steady temper. For this reason, many people decide to train their own dog or a newly purchased dog they feel a connection with, as their PSD. There are many PSD training courses available both online and offline to choose from. Diabetic Alert Dogs make use of their enhanced sense of smell dog superpower to detect radical changes in blood sugar levels, too low or too high blood sugar levels, and alert their diabetic assisted to check their sugar levels and if necessary, take medication. They can also alert others if the situation gets too critical. It is still not clear whether the diabetic alert service dog can scent a difference in the smell of the breath or sweat or body odour, it is anyway a great superpower to have. Allergy detection dogs, like diabetic alert dogs, use their super sense of smell, 2,000 times more powerful than human sense of smell, to smell and detect any trace of allergens which could harm their handler. The most common allergens are nuts, peanuts, wheat, milk, eggs, shellfish, latex, and certain chemicals used in cleaning detergents. The allergy detection dog is sometimes required to do a room sweep to detect any trace of the allergen, or to smell hot or cold food. Some allergies are so severe, that just a small assumption of the allergen would cause anaphylaxis, and in the worst-case scenario death, if not cured promptly. Allergy detection service dogs with their presence offer additional security to people affected by severe allergies, helping them live their lives with more ease and a higher feeling of safety. Autism Service Dogs often offer their services to autistic children, but adults affected by autism can be assisted by an autism service dog as well. When assisting children, autism service dogs are beneficial in helping with them with social interaction, to build up confidence. They also help preventing the kid from wandering, can prevent or placate emotional meltdowns, and can stop repetitive and harmful behavior. Through their daily interaction, they encourage verbal communication, sensory stimulation, and focus. Dog breeds more adapt to be trained as autism service dogs are Golden Retrievers, Labrador Retrievers, Labradoodles, Great Pyrenees, Old English Sheepdogs. Seizure Alert service Dogs assist people affected by epilepsy in a number of ways. They alert others when a seizure occurs, to protect their assisted, they soften their fall by placing their body between the seizing subject and the floor, and when the subject is lying on the floor, the Seizure Dog will lie next to assisted to prevent injuries. Although there is no scientific proof or understanding, Seizure Alert Dogs seem able to recognize when a seizure is imminent, and alert before it starts its devastating effects. This makes them even more precious and useful. Might just be another of dogs’ mysterious superpowers we know so little about."
9,"Service Dog, Companion Dog, Therapy Dog, which dog can best support a Child with Autism?",pets," It depends. There is no right answer to this question, it depends on the child and its family situation and expectations. Families who need their child to be accompanied by its dog friend at school and at medical facilities, might opt for a service dog or a therapy dog, while families who are looking for a dog to assist their child at home, providing emotional comfort and stimulation might consider a companion dog instead. Let us have a look at the characteristics of each dog category, to get a clearer understanding of the benefits they can provide and the cost they require. SERVICE DOG Service dogs are dogs extensively trained in a variety of tasks to support people with disabilities. They are trained according to the specific needs of the person they assist and receive a service dog certification, which grants them entrance in all public places. (At least in the US according to the ADA, you might want to check your local regulations on this topic.) Specifically, to autism, service dogs can be trained to prevent and stop emotional meltdowns, to stop repetitive and self-harming behaviors, to warn if the child is wandering off and help in the search if the child gets lost. Get: A number of organizations provide fully trained service dogs to diagnosed autistic children, however the cost is exceedingly high, around $40,000-$60,000, and in some cases dogs have been reported not being able to perform all the tasks for which they were paid. Some charities and no-profit organizations also can provide service dogs free of charge, although their waiting lists are long, it can easily take 2-3 years of waiting, and application criteria are quite narrow. Train: There are both offline and online service dog training schools offering training courses to train home dogs or newly purchased dogs to become efficient service dogs. Total training usually requires around one year, and prices can vary greatly, from a few $ dollars to thousands of dollars. Service Dog Training School International, for example, offers their service dog online training course at $399. Training your own service dog can be a better solution then purchasing one, because of a number of reasons. For starters, during training the parent handler and the kid will be able to establish a deeper bond with the dog, resulting in better performance on the dog’s end and better understanding of the dog abilities and reactions on the handler’s end. When training, the kid will benefit of sensory and verbal stimulation, and will exercise his/her ability to focus on an activity for a longer period. Breeds: Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever, Labradoodle, Great Pyrenees, Old English Sheepdogs. THERAPY DOG Therapy dogs are good tempered dogs trained to provide affection and support in therapeutic settings. They are trained to feel mood shifts and to act to comfort their assisted. Unlike service dogs, therapy dogs are not trained to perform incredible tasks, and do not have legal right to public access, but offer autistic children invaluable emotional support, help with social engagement, promote cognitive and emotional growth, and provide unlimited and unjudgmental companionship. Get: Therapy dogs can be purchased from reliable breeders and trainers, and their price can vary a lot, average price is around $10,000, including dog purchase and training expenses. Train: Majority of people would choose to train their own therapy dog with offline or online training courses, as it requires less effort and less time than training a service dog. Training costs are between $500-$5,000. Breed: Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, Poodle, Pomeranian, Pug. What is most important is the temperament of the individual dog, and not the breed itself. COMPANION DOG Companion dogs do not perform specific tasks, they just provide comfort as pets. Like any other pet dog, they are still required to be good-mannered, especially when in public, achievable with basic training. Although they are not trained to do anything specific to support autistic children, their only presence provides constant comfort and happiness, and give children in the autistic spectrum the opportunity to experience friendship, while it is usually quite difficult for them to bond with their peers. According to multiple studies, the presence of companion dogs helps autistic children sleep better, interaction with them helps stimulate verbal skills, and taking care of their dog friend brushing and feeding makes them more aware of responsibilities and life routines. Get: Companion dogs can be purchased by any reliable breeder or trainer. Pricing varies according to the breed. Train: No specific training is required, although it is recommended that the companion dog, like any other dog, gets good manners and obedience training, to behave well at home and in public. This type of basic good dog citizen training courses can be found online or offline at local dog trainers, and their price can space between a few hundred dollars to a couple thousand dollars. Breed: Golden Retriever, Saint Bernard, Labradoodle, German Shepherd, Bernese Mountain Dog, Samoyed, Beagle. In conclusion, we can affirm that service dogs are the best trained and are the best solution for families that can afford it economically and with timings. Therapy dogs and companion dogs are definitely a faster and cheaper option, although the assistance services they can provide are more limited if compared to service dogs. One should consider what type of assistance the kid really needs to make the right decision. Contacting the doctor or service dog organizations for advice, can help providing a professional insight."
10,Choosing a Veterinarian for Your Dog,pets," From the time your dog is a little puppy, you are the center of his universe. You are the source of his food, his affection, and any other care he needs. Great! Unconditional love is one of the top reasons that most of us get a dog to start with. But your veterinarian should be right there at the top of the list for favorite people for both of you. Choose a Veterinarian You Both Agree On I had a beagle mix that I adored from the time I was three years old until she died of heart disease during my teens. I lived in a rural area where we had a limited number of veterinarians who saw dogs. When our regular vet retired, there was only one other choice. That doctor ended up being the only person my dog ever bit in her life. In retrospect, I know I should have made the effort to take her to another doctor It wasn’t just that she didn’t like him. I didn’t really like him either. He had an odd disposition and didn’t really take the time to talk to me or get to know my dog. (Honestly, I think the white patent leather shoes put me over the top!) I’ve learned a lot about dogs since then, and about what it takes to keep them healthy and happy. More than once, I’ve relied on the relationship with my vet to help me make decisions or get what my dog needed fast. If you wait until your dog needs a veterinarian for an injury or illness, you might end up in a jam. Make a concerted effort to find somebody you and your dog both feel comfortable with. Go for regular checkups and for vaccinations. Get to know them, and give them the chance to get to know your dog. Some tips for finding the right veterinarian for your dog include: Ask your friends, family, and coworkers for recommendations This works especially well if someone you know has an older dog who has been going to the same vet for years. Don’t just ask them who to go to; ask them why they recommend them. If they made their choice based on which practice is closest to their home or the one that charges less, it might not be the best choice for you. Instead, ask for a lot of recommendations and look for names that you hear repeated from a variety of resources. Choose the right kind of veterinarian Some clinics have multiple veterinarians while others are single-veterinarian practices. Others have multiple veterinarians. Some specialize in small animals while others specialize in large animals. Make sure you get a veterinarian who specializes in small animal care with a lot of experience treating dogs. If there are multiple doctors in the practice, ask about their policy for assigning appointments. Do they switch between doctors to suit their schedule? It’s better for you and your dog if you can see the same doctor each time you visit. Of course, you want the option for fast emergency care from whomever is available if it’s ever needed. The same is true for any technicians or assistants working in the office. What are the staff’s credentials and to what extent do they provide care for your dog? Get a list of their services and read online reviews The rule of thumb for reading online reviews is to always drop the best one and the worst one. The ones in-between are more likely honest reviews from actual customers. You can learn a lot from them, not just how well other people like them. A lot of times, people talk about the services they received or the special products the clinic provided them with. You might find out more about the list of services they offer from those talked about in reviews than from the services page. One example of this is when my dog developed liver disease, her vet recommended putting her on a low-protein diet. Although the office didn’t keep the food in stock, they took care of ordering it and keeping it available once she started eating it. The thing is, when I first started taking her there, all I needed were her regular vaccinations. I didn’t realize how beneficial some of their other service would be. Now, they handle things like her dietary needs, providing supplements, and clipping her nails. While grooming and bathing aren’t an option here, some clinics have in-floor bathing for dogs that are seniors and/or ill and can’t climb a ramp or steps. It’s also helpful for dogs that have conditions which make it painful or uncomfortable to be lifted. Cleanliness Is Next to Dogliness Even if your dog has a penchant for dirt, mud, and anything with a repugnant odor at home, the vet’s office should be clean. This is the place where your dog and others receives medical treatment. It’s just as important to protect him from potential germs and viruses as it is for people. Pay attention to whether the floors and other surfaces appear clean, and whether there is a bad odor that says cleaning isn’t a priority for them. Find Out About After Hours Care Some injurie or conditions require immediate care. What should you do if your dog gets ill or injured in the middle of the night? Some clinics provide after-hour care but you should expect to pay more. Others might take turn about being on call with other veterinarians in their area. Make sure you know what to do if your dog needs help that can’t wait. Special considerations for an anxious pet Some dogs get anxious about going to the vet no matter how much they like the veterinarian. If anxiety is a problem for your dog, talk to the vet about possible causes and solutions. Sometimes dogs act anxious because of an underlying illness. If your dog is just the nervous type or they’ve had a bad experience at a vet’s office before, ask your vet if it’s okay to just bring your dog in with you for a visit. Many offices are limiting customers from coming inside during Covid, but that, too, will eventually change. It might help to get your dog used to going to the vet’s location when there isn’t any invasive interaction between him and the medical staff. There are many ways to help reduce anxiety in nervous dogs. For one, give your dog a comfortable bed of his own where he will feel safe. Sometimes feeding your dog the wrong balance of protein and carbohydrates causes anxiety. Talk to your new veterinarian about choosing the right food for your dog. Also, limit your dog’s treats to healthy snacks that don’t have any chemical ingredients. There are lots of decisions to make that will affect your dog’s health and well-being. The most important decision you will make is in a veterinarian who will guide you throughout the lifelong process."
11,How to save a dying kitten?,pets," Are you a cat lover, especially kittens with their cute and sweet looks and innocent voice? So how to save a dying kitten? You should know that cats are able to hide their suffering and discomfort, so you should rely on your eye to watch out for signs of a kitten dying. This article will help you understand how to save a dying kitten by getting medical help, and learn about the different signs and symptoms that suggest a cat's weakness so that you can make the appropriate plan to save its life. Part 1 Get medical help 1 Get a cat box. If you do not have a cat transport box, you should look for a suitable box to put the cat in; Choose a crate that's large enough for the cat to feel comfortable standing and moving around, but not too big to slam into the walls. Cover the box so that the cat cannot escape. Dig holes in the sides of the box for the cat to get fresh air. Place a towel or old piece of clothing in the box to make the cat feel safe, and to absorb urine or vomit. 2 Keep the cat warm. Newborn kittens are not able to regulate their body temperature in the absence of the mother who is warming them, so you should wrap the box in a towel or blanket to keep the kitten warm. Just make sure you don't block the ventilation holes you made on the sides of the box. • The cat itself can be wrapped in a towel or an old piece of clothing for extra warmth. • Be careful not to cover the cat's head if you wrap it in a towel to warm it to allow it to breathe, just as you did with the ventilation holes if the box was wrapped. 3 Locate the nearest veterinary clinic. The cat needs veterinary attention immediately, so you should look for the nearest emergency veterinary clinic so that the vet will check it and make sure it can be saved from death. An emergency veterinary visit costs a higher fee than a regular veterinary visit. Type in the search engine ""veterinarian"" or ""veterinary clinic"" and then type the name of the city in which you live. Or enter the postal number of your city in the search engine with the word ""veterinary clinic"". Try contacting a pet shelter to have the administrator recommend a nearby veterinary clinic. 4 Take the cat to the vet. The cat that you put in the box must be taken to the vet, and be aware of the sounds of groaning and meowing that may be issued during the car trip, which is indicative of its discomfort in the car. So there is no need to waste time adjusting its position in the car, but rather faster than transporting it to the vet. Make sure to wrap the cat in a towel or soft clothing while driving carefully and not moving the box suddenly so that the cat does not roll inside it. Some cats calm down when they look out the car window, while others are not affected by it. Try both positions and see how the cat behaves. Part 2 Helping a dying cat 1 Resuscitate the cat with CPR. CPR is intended to stimulate the heart and breathing, is performed in unresponsive patients, and is suitable for both humans, cats, and a large number of other animals. Only perform CPR on the cat if there is no clear breath or pulse, and in the meantime have someone call the vet or call them yourself if you are alone in the situation. Remove obstructions in the cat's airway. Rely on your finger to remove any obstructions in the cat's respiratory tract, and hold it with its head tilted forward and down in case there are fluids in its mouth, throat, or lungs so that gravity stimulates the exit of these fluids. Put your mouth around the cat's nose and mouth and inhale 3 puffs of air. This is enough because the cat's lungs are small and do not take in much air. Be careful while doing this and remember that there are diseases that can be transmitted from cats to humans; Keep the air flowing every 20 seconds. There is no need for chest compressions in the event of a heartbeat, and only pulmonary resuscitation if the cat is not breathing. Check the cat's chest for a heartbeat. Begin pectoral thrusts on the cat's chest by placing it between the ring finger and thumb. Do this as if you were squeezing the cat's chest behind its bent elbow. Check your heart rate every minute. Do not continue CPR for more than 5 minutes. This means that the cat has already unfortunately died. 2 Bleeding control. If the cat suffers a cut or a deep prick, you must first control the bleeding and stop it immediately. It's the same as you would yourself, the goal is to clean the wound and stop the bleeding until you take the cat to the vet for sutures to close the wound. Clean the area around the wound with water and an appropriate antiseptic solution. • Use a piece of clean gauze to apply pressure to the wound. After cleaning its edges, keep applying pressure for 5 to 10 minutes without lifting the gauze to examine the wound; It just causes the bleeding to continue. Wrap gauze with a bandage when the bleeding stops, then take the cat to the vet. Try to limit the cat's movement so that it does not cause re-bleeding or tearing of the bandage. 3 Control the temperature of the cat. Kittens are prone to hypothermia and therefore need the warmth of the mother cat. You must warm the kitten if the mother is not present or you cannot warm her for any reason; Place the cat in a box furnished with a rag or old clothing, and add soft towels and bottles of warm water. Newborn cats are not able to regulate their body temperature, but rather rely on the mother for that. Do not use a hairdryer or a heater to heat the cat directly, or you will cause harm to it as a result of excessive heat. 4 Watch out for kitten wilt syndrome. Some kittens wilt to death before weaning, despite the mother cat taking care of them. There are some conditions that cause kittens to wilt and die, so it is important to pay attention to the symptoms of this syndrome early to save the kitten's life. Take a cat that you suspect has progressive wilt to the vet to assess its chance of survival. Some of the causes of kitten wilt syndrome are: Birth defects, Obstructed delivery, Environmental factors, Blood type inconsistencies between the mother and the cat, Postpartum delivery, The low weight of the cat, Bacterial, Viral or parasitic infections, Dehydration Exaggerated temperatures of the birthing environment. Part 3 Recognize the signs and causes of a dying kitten 1 Watch for signs of inactivity. Kittens are lively, curious, and love to play by nature, and sleep for a long time like children, but at the same time, they are very active and active during the waking period. If the cat is lethargic, i.e. sleeps all day or is not active while awake, this is a sign that something is wrong. Take your cat to the vet immediately for a diagnosis. 2 Monitor your cat's eating habits. Kittens, especially newborns, need to eat about every two or three hours, so if the cat refuses to eat for several hours, this is a sign that something is wrong. Kittens cannot go without food for several hours and usually, this indicates an upset stomach or a worse condition. Take the cat to the vet for an examination. 3 Check the cat's vomit. Kittens spit up constantly, like babies, and sometimes vomit, as a sign of their urgency to eat and breastfeed. As for the cat vomiting constantly, it is a sign of illness and the need for proper treatment. Some recommend giving kittens anti-vomiting medicines from those available to buy without a prescription, but do not do this to a small cat, but take it to the vet to examine it and give it the medicine, or else risk its life. 4 Protect your cat from bacteria and viruses. The immune system of kittens is very weak, and they lack antibodies in the event that the mother is not breastfed as a result of depriving them of the antibody-rich colostrum milk; As a result of the lack, the cat becomes immune to it and thus becomes vulnerable to bacterial and viral infections. Take the cat to the vet immediately if you notice lethargy, diarrhea, or vomiting to treat it."

14,Why Dog Owners Should Invest In A Treat Pouch,pets," Many first-time dog owners do not realize the importance of having a treat pouch. Regardless of whether you are training your dog or not (which you likely will), you should invest in a good treat pouch. Having a treat pouch will allow you to bring all dog-related necessities with you when you head outdoors. Most treat pouches have also been designed to make space for your everyday items! Here, I will share the 3 benefits of having a treat pouch: When you are training your dog indoors, you can use a bowl to hold the treats. However, if you bring your dog outside, it is terribly inconvenient to bring along a bowl or a packet of treats that you have to constantly hold onto. A treat pouch will come in handy in this scenario. You can put the treats in the treat pouch, and when you give a command, you can quickly reach for the treats to reward your dog. Some owners may argue that their trainings are done indoors, so purchasing a treat pouch is a waste of money. That could not be further away from the truth! You can plan to have most of the training is likely to be done indoors, but you are also likely to also have a few impromptu training sessions outdoors. For example, if you want your dog to sit down next to you beside the bench, you are going to give it the command ‘sit’. After it sits down, if you have a treat pouch (containing treats) with you, you can reward it for obeying the command, making it more likely for your dog to obey you the next time you give the command. However, if you do not have treats with you, you are unable to provide the reward for your dog. With a lack of positive reinforcement (treats), your dog will be less likely to obey you, especially in public spaces. The reason being, if you only reward your dog when it is indoors, it may contextualize the commands as only applicable in the indoor setting. Your dog will also have no motivation to obey your commands if it knows that it will definitely will not get a reward for obeying. A treat pouch used to be what was named: a bag to hold treats. However, most treat pouches have evolved from only containing treats to including a whole array of stuff. Most treat pouches are big enough for you to put dog toys (like balls and tug-of-war ropes) in it. They also include rings that you can hook things like a collapsible bowl to use when you are outside. Majority come with poop bag dispensers so that you do not have to hold a roll on your hand. A handful of them include poop bag holders just in case there are no bins nearby. Some treat pouches include additional pockets to put your daily necessities, such as your wallet, mobile phone, keys, and cash. A few even have a slot for your water bottle to ensure that you stay hydrated as you walk your dog! In summary, treat pouches now can hold much more than just treats. They can hold your everyday items, dog toys, and even water bottles, allowing you much more convenience than before! Which brings me to my next point…… In the past, when treat bags are only used to hold treats, you will have to make space if you want to bring other items. For example, if you want to bring a water bottle, you will have to either hold it on your hand (terribly inconvenient) or put it in a sling bag. Poop bag dispensers are stand-alone objects that has to be carried on the hand or attached to the leash. If you bring along wallets, keys, and other necessities, you will either have to bring a small bag or stuff everything in your pockets and hope they do not fall out. Treat pouches now can make your life much easier by holding everything you may need for an outdoor trip in them. This will make outings with your dogs much more convenient than packing things in different bags and having a hard time digging them out when you need them."
15,4 Ways To Prepare Fruit Treats For Your Dog,pets," Fruits contain many nutrients that are useful to dogs. For example, most berries are high in antioxidants which can help dogs build a robust immune system, and melons help maintain vision health. While plain fruits are enough for your furry friend, why not make the fruits a little tastier and more interesting for both of you? Here, I will introduce 4 different ways that you can prepare fruit treats for your dog. Ice Cubes with Fruits This method is suitable for dogs who do not like to drink water, ensuring that your dog drinks some water for every treat it eats. Things you will need: Knife Ice cube trays or molds Water Fruits How to prepare: Use the knife to cut the selected fruit into small, bite-sized chunks. Put 1-3 pieces of fruit into each ice cube/mold partition (depending on the size of the partition). Add water until about 3/4 of each partition is filled. Freeze for at least 3 hours. Remove from tray/mold and serve to your dog. Recommended serving size in one day: 3-4 ice cubes Frozen Blended Fruits This method is suitable for dogs who had some or most of their teeth removed as they can eat the treat by continuous licking. Things you will need: High water content fruits: Bananas, peaches, watermelons, etc. Water Blender Ice cube trays or molds How to prepare: Put the fruits (one type or a combination) into the blender. For every cup of fruits, put about 1/3 to 1/4 cup of water. Blend until you get a puree. Pour the blend into the ice cube tray/molds. Freeze for approximately 3 hours. Remove from tray/mold and serve to your dog. Recommended serving size in one day: 2-3 ice cubes Roasted Fruits This method is suitable for picky dogs who like to have strong-tasting foods as roasting makes the fruits taste sweeter. Things you will need: Bigger fruits: Apples, pears, strawberries, etc. Oven Parchment paper How to prepare: Cut the fruits into half/quarters/one-eighth (depending on the size of the fruit used). Place the cut side on the parchment Roast the fruits in a preheated oven at approximately 400°F for about 10-25 minutes (depending on the size of the fruits). Place to cool before feeding your dog. Recommended serving size in one day: 1-2 pieces of fruit Gummy Fruits All dogs can consume gummy fruits. Things you will need: Xylitol-free gelatin* Fruits Juicer (to make fruit juice) Saucepan Molds Knife (optional) *Important: Dogs cannot consume artificial xylitol, so check the ingredients in the gelatin packet before use. How to prepare: Get fruit juice from the fruits using the juicer. Pour the fruit juice and the xylitol-free gelatin into a saucepan and heat it on low-medium heat until the gelatin is fully dissolved. For how much gelatin to use, refer to the package. Remove from heat and pour into molds. Leave to cool in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. When the gummies have solidified, remove them by using the knife to separate the gummy from the mold gently. Alternatively, pushing the bottom of the mold or knocking the mold at about 45° against a surface. Recommended serving size in one day: 1-2 jellies Precautions to Take Note Dogs can be allergic to certain fruits, so monitor your dog after you feed it fruits. If it shows any signs of discomfort or illness, bring it to the local veterinarian immediately. When selecting fruits to make the treats, remember to screen for unripe, over-ripe, and moldy fruits. The nutritional content of these fruits is different from ripe fruits and can make your dog sick. If there are removable seeds and skins, a rule of thumb is to remove them. For example, apple and watermelon seeds can cause digestive issues in dogs."

The Benefits Of Dog Grooming dog grooming perth is essential for both your dog’s good looks and his health. However, doing these tasks at home may be complicated, so you might want to consider the benefits of professional dog washing perth With proper dog grooming northern suburbs, you can eliminate mats, ticks, fleas, shedding, and stop other severe health conditions developing that you may have had no idea about. So, fret no more because we are giving you an in-depth look at how important and beneficial regular grooming is. Detection and Prevention Going to a professional dog groomer northern suburbs will benefit your dog very much so. It’s the best way to detect any problems that your dog might have, and early detection is very important as if you catch it early treatment is likely to be shorter and easier — of course depending on what it is. Our dog grooming quinns rocks will look for rashes, lesions, inflammation, lumps, or infections that any normal dog owner could miss. You’ll be able to prevent any major health conditions or catch an underlying problem, which you might have had no idea about. Image for post Maintaining a Healthy Coat and Fur Maintaining a healthy coat and fur for your dog means that you have to groom them frequently. They can’t just jump into the shower and clean themselves as we can. Plus, it’s not even ideal to give them a regular bath. Regular bathing will cause their natural oil to fall out, and it will also damage their coat. What you can do is brush them. Any responsible and seasoned dog owner will know that brushing your dog benefits them greatly. It will help to avoid mats in their fur. They can make the hair knot up, or pull on their tight skin, which will cause them discomfort and pain. Mats can also cause ulcers and abrasions. Brushing will bring out the natural oils in the fur and remove any dead hair, dirt, and dandruff. Your dog will have a healthier shine to their coat and will also feel healthy themselves. Whilst brushing your dog is great it is also useful to comb them through with a fine comb as this can reveal fleas that you may not be aware of. Taking Care of their Nails When it comes to grooming, you must not forget about their nails. Uncut nails can lead to joint pain, as it means the dog may not be walking with pads in alignment. This is quite a common problem in dogs. Trimmed nails will keep them from curling, and will stop germs from getting stuck in there. If you do decide to do this, invest in some proper nail clippers that are made especially for dogs. This will make cutting their nails much easier and will also make it less painful for your dog. If you are nervous about this ask your vet for advice. Benefits of Regular Grooming and Brushing Having a well-groomed, clean, and nice smelling dog around the house means that your house will be less likely to have bad odours gathering in your home. Regular grooming also causes less shedding from your dog. You don’t have to vacuum clean your house every day if you keep up with the grooming. You’re also eliminating and preventing fleas and ticks from settling in as well. The best part is, a good brushing session will make you bond with your dog, and who doesn’t love creating good memories with their dogs? Positive Behaviour The most important part about regular dog grooming is that it affects your dog’s mental health as well. A good looking, good smelling dog with a nice haircut will make your dog feel This can affect their mental state and thus their behaviour as well. Come to Bubbly Paws #1 Dog Groomer In Quinns Rocks"
18,How to help a stray dog,pets," Being an animal lover all my life and taking care of pets it just breaks my heart when I see a stray dog wandering the streets, especially in the cold months. I always wonder if they are lost, mistreated, or worst abandoned!  I had captured a few stray dogs myself and luckily found the owners but sometimes we take that risk although we know nothing about the animal.  We have our good intentions but if you don’t know what to do or who to call it can be frustrating, especially if you have a sick or injured animal. One of the reasons why stray dogs end up lost is because they aren’t wearing a collar or any tags. Unfortunately, other reasons are abusive or abandonment situations but we won't touch upon that in this post. Most owners who take care of their dogs will always have a collar but sometimes owners don’t provide the right collar for their pets and get loose. In this article, I will give some tips on what to do when you see a stray cat or dog. Safety first when catching a stray dog When you are outside and see a skinny, malnourished dog it can be devastating. If you have a big heart and want to get the stray dog off the streets you must proceed with caution. These animals are unpredictable because they are scared or starving, and maybe aggressive. If you are close to home, get a leash, blanket, and some food. Use a calm voice to coax him to you're car, make no sudden moves, and make sure that they can see you at all times. Call Animal Control for strays It’s always a good idea to call in the experts. If you are not able to hold down the dog or he runs from you, call the Local Animal Control Agency. Leave your name and phone # and inquire how long it would take for them to arrive. Give the exact location of the area that you last saw the stray dog. It is advisable to do this whether the animal is injured or not. Bringing Home a Stray Dog If you bring the dog home, try to keep it from the other pets.  Check to see if the dog is infested with fleas; if he is, you’ll want to use some sort of flea control. If you can keep them in the garage, backyard (weather permitting), and with a smaller dog in a shed with blankets, then this might be a better option than your house. Wash your hands after handling the stray, and clean up his waste immediately. If he is not being aggressive keep him in a separate room in your house. This is temporary until you are ready to take him to the shelter to get him checked out. Take the dog to the local shelter Most of the shelters in Myrtle Beach are overcrowded and can’t provide the space and medical needs of our furry friends. Especially after the holidays where the perfect fur-ever Christmas present isn’t so “fur-ever” – sad but true. You can keep an eye on the dog by going online at the Horry County Gov website. They take photos of the stray dogs that come to the shelter so anyone who lost a dog will be able to check and see if their pet is there. That is the first place a pet owner will come to look. Micro -Chipped Stray Dog You could also ask the shelter to scan the animal in case it was micro-chipped. More pet owners use this method and lots of pets have been found this way. The chips are harmless and last for years. My neighbor had one years ago, and I thought it was a pretty nifty gadget. If you have lost a dog and don't want to get Miro-chipped, which may be beyond your budget. They have GPS Tracking for dogs. Promote stray dog online Thankfully social media comes through when dealing with lost and found pets. I belong to several groups myself and it does a world of good when saving dogs' lives. I see a lot of posts on Facebook Groups photos of abandoned dogs and the location. People just love to share information about lost dogs and it's two thumbs -up when the announcement comes in when they are found! Thanks for being a fur-friend! Kathy T."

1,The Importance Of Spending The Extra Cash On A Larger Rabbit Hutch,pets," Everyone knows that large rabbit hutches are much better for rabbits than small ones, but apart from the obvious (having more space) - what are the real reasons why you should invest a bit more in a larger hutch for your furry little ones? Why spend the extra cash? Firstly, more space means more exercise room. One thing you need to make sure you provide your rabbits is that they have enough exercise and play room to move about in. Not only is getting enough exercise essential to their health, it also helps keep rabbits happy & mentally healthy as well. In fact, ensuring that your pet is physically fit as well as mentally fit is key to giving them a long, happy life with you. Don't scrimp on those extra few yards of space, give your rabbits as much as you possibly can and they will love you all the more for it! Both the RSPCA and the Rabbit Welfare Association and Fund (RWAF) both recommend a bare minimum hutch size of 6ft x 2ft but the bigger you can make it the better. Obviously if you are keeping rabbits indoors then space within the house is usually the limiting factor, but outside should allow for a larger rabbit hutch. Speaking of outdoors: Is it better to keep rabbits outdoors or indoors? Does it even matter? Actually, you can keep rabbits indoors or outdoors. It doesn't matter in itself - but what does matter is that whatever location you choose for the hutch, that you ensure certain critical things are catered for. For example, keeping rabbits indoors is great for rabbit wellbeing as you can control the temperature & humidity with no harsh weather conditions to have to protect your rabbit from etc. However space is limited (usually) and it can get smelly & noisy at times. Keeping rabbits outdoors on the other hand, you can have a much larger hutch for your little furry ones to eat, sleep and exercise in - but you'll need more consideration to keeping them warm, sheltered and protected from natural predators which lurk in the big, scary outside world. Outdoor hutches are usually more expensive than indoor ones too - as they have to be much sturdier and protective, plus are generally larger in size than their indoor counterparts. Given the above, it is usually considered better to have large rabbit hutches outdoors than a smaller cramped one indoors. Provided you can give your rabbits a safe, warm & sheltered environments to sleep and rest in, the larger exercise and play areas will benefit them greatly. Plus, outdoor hutches are often higher/taller as well making it easier for rabbits to hop and jump about as they love to do! Another advantage of having a larger rabbit hutch is that it's much easier to accommodate more than one rabbit. It is generally given that you should always keep 2 rabbits together as they love company and are actually highly social animals. If a rabbit is kept on their own, they can get bored and lonely just as we do. Having a big hutch will certainly help with this as well as things won't get cramped inside like they might with a small hutch. Why even use a Rabbit Hutch? What about other alternatives like cages? It's true that hutches are the most common and most popular of housing for domestic rabbits, but there is a reason for this and it's not just because of convention. Far from it, in fact hutches are highly customisable, often coming in modular sections that allow you to design and build your own hutch design to suit whatever needs you require for your rabbits. Comfort is often much higher with hutches compared to bare-bone cages and offer much warmer and more sheltered living conditions. You don't want your rabbits to get too hot or too cold during weather extremes throughout the year, so having that sheltered sleeping section that keeps them snuggled up and cozy in the winter and keeps the hot sun off of them in the hot summer months, is definitely the way to go. This is actually another benefit of large rabbit hutches, as there is more room for ample amounts of bedding material for them to snuggle into when its cold, as well as plenty of air space within during the hotter months to keep them cool. In summary: A larger rabbit hutch equates to happier & healthier bunnies all round. So go on - splash a bit of extra cash and give them a bit more space!"
2,Dog Owner Must Know Facts About Dog Food,pets," Dog food is specially designed and manufactured for consumption by dogs, their owners and related canines of varying breeds. Dogs are typically considered to be obligate carnivores which have a carnivorous lean towards meat. Because of the high nutritional needs of dogs, their diets should contain the necessary components for healthy growth. Dog food also contains ingredients to assist in controlling or reducing the signs and symptoms associated with common diseases like arthritis and cancer. A lot of research has been conducted to better understand the relationship between nutrition and health. Since humans tend to consume diets that differ significantly from their own body structure and requirements, understanding this is crucial for dog owners. Nutrition is important to all animals, whether they are domesticated wild or farm animals. Dog food is designed so that it contains the right balance of nutrients to give its canine and human counterparts a chance to maintain a healthy body and to avoid disease. It is common practice in some countries, especially among people of Asian origin, to feed their dogs raw foods. The dog food that is usually fed to dogs includes vegetables, fruits, grains, cereals and some milk products. However, these are only a few of the sources of nutritious food available to pet owners. There are also alternatives available to those who prefer homemade dog food. Most dog owners prefer to purchase food from the store since it is more affordable than feeding their dogs raw foods. However, there are also people who opt to cook the food at home and use commercially available dog food recipes to make it. The homemade diet has become very popular in recent years. Since many commercial dog foods contain artificial flavors and preservatives, there are those who prefer to go for a healthy homemade diet. This is because commercial dog foods can often contain chemicals and ingredients that can be harmful to the canine. Dog food recipes vary depending on the breed and gender of the dog. They are not only made for convenience but to ensure that your dog receives all the needed nutrition to keep him healthy. Some of the most commonly used recipes include: beef, lamb, turkey, goat, chicken, fish, duck, rice, peas, beans, corn and whole grains. Dog owners should keep in mind that the quality of dog food should match the nutritional need of the dog. In case you find your dog has an allergic reaction, it is always recommended to contact your vet immediately. The Best Food For Dogs There are many recipes out there that are perfect for your dog.

The first thing that you must remember when feeding your dog different types of food is to understand the differences between dog foods and human foods. Since dogs can not eat things like meat, fish or dairy products, their main source of nutrition is usually canned food or dry kibble. The best type of food for dogs is also the one that contains the most of these nutrients. It is important that you find a product that contains a high amount of protein, carbohydrates and vitamins. Many of the products that contain protein are considered to be a higher quality than other food types. The first thing that you should remember about choosing the best food for dogs is that it has to be easy to digest. A dog should always have some sort of meal or snack prepared for him. Make sure that the food is easy to chew on and is tasty as well. There are many people who prefer to feed their dogs canned dog food. If you are not sure which type of food is best, there are many recipes available online that will help you figure it out. There are several websites that sell different recipes for you to choose from. However, if you do not know how to cook, you can always buy a ready-to-feed dog food that contains all the ingredients that you need to prepare the dish. Remember that you should not add too much water to your dog's meal. You should also make sure that you do not overfeed your dog. As long as you are providing them with the proper amount of nutrients in the right amounts, you will soon see that your canine friend is eating the right food. In addition to the types of food that are best for your dog, you should also take into consideration the season and the time of day that you feed your dog. Dogs need a lot of protein throughout the entire day. You should consider a diet that provides them this in addition to other nutrients such as the vitamins that your pet needs.

3,Pet-Friendly Restaurants in Myrtle Beach,pets," When leaving your dog is not an option we take them with us, they are part of the family, right? So what happens when you get hungry or that friend needs to talk to you – immediately. There are plenty of restaurants around town and you normally can choose half a dozen in a 2-mile radius but what about the dog? Luckily for pet owners, there are dozens of pet-friendly restaurants in Myrtle Beach. The restaurant industry is now allowing more pets into their establishments and is becoming quite the trend for most pet owners. A report on Pet business states that “seven in 10 Millennials own a pet—more than half (56 percent) are dog owners while 36 percent cat parents”. I remember about 10 years ago I was visiting a relative in Florida and she used to foster small dogs. This dog that she brought along was a Shih Tzu that sat in the back seat. I didn’t mind until we ended up in the parking lot of a trendy lunch spot by the Intracoastal. I thought we were getting food to go but we sat at an outside table under a huge awning. The whole time I was thinking someone is going to say something about her dog. Nobody said anything- they even brought a water bowl for cocoa while the waitress took our order. An older couple commented on how cute the dog was. I said to Maggie, dogs aren’t allowed in restaurants, she said, this one will. It was my first experience with a pet-friendly restaurant. I thought it was a bit odd at first but I really liked the idea. So, if I ever decided to get a dog I would know where to go on vacation – Florida. But times have changed in the 15- 20 years as more millennials own pets. The restaurant industry can only see this as a plus to a very trendy niche. If someone wants to sit with their pet and have a quick bite then that is one more customer that is more likely to come back. How does one know if they are a pet-friendly restaurant in North Myrtle Beach? Sometimes owners will put up a sign or they see other dogs in the patio area. On the flip side you always get the Non-pet lovers (do they exist- yes!) Maybe they don’t hate pets but they are not thrilled to eat with them in a public place. There are allergies to consider, and accidents may happen as well. All pet-friendly restaurants in Myrtle Beach have an outdoor patio area for pets and their owners, so if someone is allergic to dogs they can opt to sit inside. However, why should the non-pet person have limited options? Also, the employees should wash their hands after petting a dog for cleanliness and hygiene. If the dog suddenly has to urinate it’s up to the owner to take the dog for a walk to relieve the animal. The worst-case scenario is an aggressive dog that will not be so friendly to the other patrons or their fur-babies and injure someone. It’s a difficult decision to make for most owners of restaurants but US laws leave it up to the owners to decide to make their establishments pet-friendly. Its also up to the restaurants to have a Pet Policy put in place. Not all pets are created equal, some dogs are yappers, like to jump or beg for food. Don White, the owner of Tru Mission K9S, recommends “teaching your dog a “relax” and or a “place” command for restaurants”. You could email or call him to explain this easy to use dog technique. Who wants to have an uncontrollable animal while trying to eat a meal that they are paying for. Etiquette Pet Rules: Keep your animal leashed at all times. No barking, jumping, or begging No Eating off their owner’s table Enter the side of the restaurant to the outside patio area- no inside of the restaurant Pets should be wearing the current vaccination tags Bring your own food dish and water bowl. Health codes prohibit pets from eating and drinking from restaurant dishes and glasses. The restaurant should keep hand sanitizer near the dog-friendly area If you live in another part of the country you could look up pet-friendly places in your own city.

4,Keeping your dog's nails quite short is significant for their smooth mobility.,pets," If the nails of your dog get excessively long, your dog can run the risks of hitting them, which could result in torn claw or even worse. Regardless if it doesn't occur, it will be uncomfortable for your canine to stroll around with hooks that are too long. If you hear your canine's paws hitting the asphalt or floor with each progression, they likely need trimming. Vet vs. You You can take the course of going to the vet, and in fact, a few pet owners do this. Nonetheless, setting off there can be expensive. Regardless, it's something you can undoubtedly learn and do. If you want to maintain your dog's paws all alone, you have to decide whether to settle on a nail dog grinder or opt for a clipper to get the job done. Dog Nail Clippers vs. Dog Nail Grinders Dog Nail Clippers There are two types of dog nail clippers that you should know if you prefer the clipper--the guillotine clipper and scissor-type clipper. The guillotine clipper has a circular opening with a sharp edge that crosses through it to deliver a fast and exact cut. This device takes into consideration clipping your canine's nails at a consistent and even movement however doesn't generally function admirably on thick hooks. This instrument can sometimes cause your dog to feel the tension on the nail. If you need to utilize force, then this isn't the right trimmer for the work. Scissor-type clippers can be more efficient for trimming nails that are thick and solid. Likewise, with the guillotine apparatus, utilizing them requires a consistent hand. One needs to look out for the snappy of the nail since, supposing that you scratch that, your canine may relate nail trimming with torment. Utilizing a little scissor instead of an enormous one can give you ideal control. Ensure they are sharp, not dull. The advantage of utilizing the clipping method to manage your little guy's nails is that if they are of the frightful sort, you can quickly trim a couple of paws, praise them and give a treat for good conduct, and afterward trim another nail or two later in the day. Dog Nail Grinders Dog nail clippers can be very compelling, even though utilizing a grinder requires the job regularly. Nonetheless, numerous canines are very relaxed around the device. Researching this strategy may demonstrate the equivalent of your textured buddy. Before putting resources into a nail clipper for your dog, converse with other people who utilize the same method and ask their feedback about the most suitable rotary tool for your dog's nails. A grinding device can give a smoother finish to the nail than the trimmer and functions well on thick nails. When working with canines that have dark nails, there is less possibility of hitting the speedy since pet owners feel that they have more control in the trimming cycle. It is more slow than cutting, and a few canines don't care for the vibration of the apparatus. Something critical to know is that the grinder warms up and can make the nail hot, causing torment if you are not cautious. Which of the Two is Better? Both the clipper technique and the grinding strategy are viable approaches to trim the nails. Continuously have a styptic pencil close by to stop bleeding if you hit quick. Present them a treat for this situation and don't overemphasize it. When nestling your pet on the lounge chair while viewing a film, make a habit of rubbing your dog's feet and controlling the nails simultaneously to desensitize them to contact."
5,6 Tips on Choosing a Shelter Dog,pets," 6 Tips on Choosing a Shelter Dog I have had many dogs growing up as a child and then later into adulthood. We always favored a shelter dog vs. a dog breeder. A full breed meant you had to have deep pockets and seeing what happens to animals due to overcrowded shelters just breaks my heart. However, each option means gaining a loving relationship with your fur-ever friend! But for this article, I will give some important tips on choosing the right dog in your local shelter. 1). Commitment- When adopting a shelter dog, you should be fully committed, it is sort of like having another member of the family, and in return will give you unconditional love every day. But make sure that you are a good fit for your canine companion- each dog has its own personality! 2). Skip the puppy (if you can) Yes, puppies are adorable but require lots of training and are basically just like babies. So, if you have the patience and young kids (who love puppies) then go for it. I prefer older dogs because they have developed personalities already and will not pee on the rug. Most puppies are quickly scooped up in shelters leaving the older dogs left behind and end up being euthanized. Adult dogs make great pets too. 3.) A perfect match- Every dog is different in size and personality. Make sure you know the breed that is suitable for your lifestyle. Small dogs tend to yap a lot, while other dogs like to be walked 5 times a day. If you are not up to going to the dog parks on a daily basis but prefer the couch- get a lap dog. For instance, a beagle mix is a hunter breed and likes to be outside with his nose on the ground. A young Aussie has a lot of stamina and energy. Some are high maintenance breeds- do the research on breeds first. One of the many reasons dogs end up in shelters is because they cannot handle their dogs who are unmanageable to them. 4). Training- If you adopt a dog then training is essential to having a well-behaved pooch. It can become a nightmare if you do not know how to properly train your dog. Dogs are smart and if you have the time you can teach your dog not to jump on people or drag you down the street when taking a walk. Be repetitive, consistent, and set boundaries. Dogs must know what to expect of them. So, if you have the funds you should invest in a dog training school- it pays off in the end. Lack of training is another reason why dogs end up in shelters. 5). Everybody on board- If you have a family with kids then it is wise to go down to the shelter together to agree on a dog that the whole family likes. No surprises. You should have to agree that everyone should do their share in taking the dog out for a walk, feeding, and training. Take turns. 6). Adding another pet- If you adopt a dog and have another at home, it is always wise to let them spend together in a neutral place like walking them together in a park. Do not expect them to be friends - it will take some time until they are used to each other. Feeding them together with keeping a leash on both that way they know there not a threat to one another. Dogs end up in shelters for many reasons. One of the major ones is because of economic reasons but also because people move where animals are not allowed,  divorces happen, old age and children can suddenly become allergic. Whatever the reasons are dogs are the ones to suffer but we have the power to help them. Luckily, there are many non- profit animal rescues in our communities that heavily promote dogs that need a home. They do fundraising, use social media, and other means of advertising. They are the true advocates for these precious animals and work hard to find the right home for them."
6,Three Aspect That Changes Dog’s Personality,pets," Different life events and habits tend to influence the personalities of different people. Surprisingly, dog’s personalities tend to change in a similar manner as they age. Although personalities may vary from species to the other, most dogs will become less active and less curious over time. Dogs can change significantly depending on their daily interactions and reactions to various situations. It is so amazing how dog’s personality traits change largely with routines. Primarily, the personalities of dogs are affected by three distinct aspects, including their age, changes in personalities of their owners, and the quality of their relationship with people. Since dogs’ bodies and brains change as they age, it is relatively sensible to conclude that their personalities do change. In this article, we will explore dogs personalities, how they change over time, and changes that dogs go through. Here we go. What is a dog’s personality? At its core, personality explains the usual behaviour pattern of an individual and the stable characteristics that make the individual different from others. Mostly, the personality traits are defined by how an individual perceives and interacts with the world around them. For instance, you may find some dogs are quiet and steady; others are active and lively, while others are nervous and sensitive. As you think deeper about personality, you may end up being confused because there seems to be no universal definition. When examining a dog’s personality, it is important to explore beyond their breed. If you understand your puppy personalities, the potential of misunderstanding your furry friend in the future is minimal. Generally, dogs tend to share the same personality traits with their owners. Nevertheless, puppyhood has a significant influence on a dog’s personality. Do dog’s personalities change over time? If you are a dog owner, all you do with your pooch, especially before the age of 6, gradually influences their personalities. Like humans, dogs also have moods and personalities. According to the study by Michigan State University, dogs’ personalities change to a larger degree, just like our personalities change when we go through substantial life changes. William Chopik, who led the study, says that canine’s personality traits influence how they feel for their owners, their biting behaviour, and even chronic illnesses. Most of the significant changes in pooch’s personalities are as a result of nature versus nurture. For instance, dogs that survived obedience classes and training tend to have positive personalities. What are some of the changes that dogs go through? As your dog grows from puppyhood to old age, they go through a lot of changes. These changes are the primary reasons for various personality traits. Puppies tend to bond with humans, especially their guardians, much like children do. Like teenagers, dogs get severe difficulties when they reach adolescence. It is during the adolescence when you have to take your pup to obedience classes and training lest they will turn aggressive. Usually, dogs are supposed to be exposed to socialization from an early age. If your dog fears significantly, the chances are that it didn’t interact with people and other dogs as required in the early stages, below 16 weeks. Some changes, like a dog being aggressive, will depend on how they were grown up. The good news is that you can change your dog’s behaviour because most dog traits tend to blend with the owner’s personalities. There are seven distinctive dimensions of dogs’ personalities, which will vary depending on their early age lifestyle and experiences. Here are some of dog’s personalities. Reactivity - how the dog responds to new objects and perhaps a new environment Fearfulness Activity Sociability - you dog’s ability to initiate friendly interactions with humans and other pups Responsiveness to training Submissiveness Aggression Note that these personalities may vary significantly in different breeds. Conclusion Dogs have personality and also understand language. Remember that your dog’s personality will primarily depend on you and how you nurture it. It is good to pay attention to their needs so that they can grow to remain worthy friends."
7,Dog’s Diet,pets," A well-balanced, nutritious diet is vital in keeping your dog healthy and happy. However, with many available diets, selecting the right diet for your dog can present a significant challenge. Domesticated dogs are primarily carnivores, but they tend to be omnivores in dieting. However, when deciding on what diet to give your furry friend, it is ideal to consult with your vet.

8,"Agnes, my Chihuahua",pets," On July 11, 2020 my Apple Head Chihuahua dog passed away. Her name was Agnes. She was nine years old. I found her dead about 10 PM. I was about to go to bed but immediately knew there was no need to go to bed. When I found her dead in the kitchen, I knew that I wouldn't be able to get any sleep so I stayed up most of the night. I adopted Agnes on August 27, 2013. My ex-friend and I were out looking for me a Chihuahua dog. As she put gas in her Durango, I made a decision. I decided that if the dog I found was a female, I would name it after my late mother. My ex-friend and I went to a woman's house who runs her own rescue service. She only had one Chihuahua and it was a female. Agnes had short and dark brown fur. I eventually bought two more Chihuahua dogs. Both dogs are hyper so I keep them in my basement. It wasn't until I bought those dogs that I truly appreciated what a great dog Agnes was. Agnes was one of the sweetest dogs around and she wasn't one bit hyper. After getting my two new dogs, I learned how special Agnes was. Agnes was a bit on the hateful side when I adopted her but she soon grew out of it. When I took Agnes to a vet in 2017, I learned that she had a heart murmur. Because of a mental disorder, I hear voices from time to time. As an ice cream truck drove through the subdivision where I live, I heard a voice. The voice told me to buy an ice cream and eat it while standing over Agnes's grave. I did so but it tore me up pretty bad. Yes I hear voices sometimes but don't worry. The voices don't tell me to hurt people. I have a mental disorder but I'm not a psycho. When I adopted Agnes, I got the Holy Grail of dogs. As far as I'm concerned, she was the best dog on the planet. She loved me and the feeling was mutual. She loved to sit in my lap a lot. Some friends invited me to stay overnight at their homes a few times. When I would come home after being gone all night, Agnes would start hopping around and yelping because she was happy to see me. I usually sleep on my couch and she slept on the couch with me. I decided to sleep in one of the bedrooms. Agnes was in the living room and she started howling at 3 AM. She was unhappy because she couldn't spend the night with her Daddy. After her howling woke me up, I got her and let her sleep in the bed with me the rest of the night. I have no wife or kids and Agnes was the closest thing I had to a daughter. Her death has broken my heart and I sure do miss her. She was my baby doll and I owned her for almost seven glorious years. I thanked the good Lord for letting me have her. I was a lucky man."

12,Training Is a Must for Puppies to Reach Their Ultimate Potential,pets," Opting to train your puppy is recommended in order to avoid a variety of issues down the road. There are several details that you should take into account prior to embarking in this type of training with your puppy, so that you can ensure everything goes according to plan. At What Week Should Puppy Training Begin? Contrary to popular belief, training a puppy within the first month of him being born is not adequate. Veterinarians have mentioned that puppies have short-attention spans, but that they can certainly benefit from training to a meaningful extent when they are eight-weeks old. What Type of Training Is Appropriate for Puppies? At the aforementioned age, puppies can begin to learn several simple obedience-related commands, including ‘stay,’ ‘down,’ and ‘sit.’ With consistent training, these commands will become engraved in them forever. There are more than a handful of benefits that accompany these commands. A puppy that has been trained how to ‘sit’ can become patient when food is being served to him. Training your puppy how to ‘stay’ can prevent him from running out of your vehicle’s door. If your puppy knows the ‘down’ command, then you will have no issue in helping him calm down when things are out-of-hand in your space. Furthermore, veterinarians suggest that potty training your puppy should be conducted when he has sufficient control of bladder and bowel movements. This takes place between week 12 and week 16. What About Advanced Training for Puppies? Veterinarians agree that advanced training a puppy before turning six-months of age is not a good idea. As previously mentioned, puppies have a short-attention span, so they cannot be bombarded with advanced training at week eight or week 16. Nevertheless, training your puppy with the aforementioned commands can actually make advanced training an easier task for him when the time for it comes. Should Training Differ with Outdoor Puppies and Indoor Puppies? If one stops and thinks about it, training should not differ, no matter if you have an indoor puppy or an outdoor puppy. Even though their daily activities might differ to some extent, the same training will come in handy in either case. Puppies Are Not Made Equal It is common to note puppies not learning at the same rate. Puppies are not made equal. Learning comes easier more to some than others. Nevertheless, they learn if one is consistent and patient with them every time. When frustration on your part becomes apparent, taking a break is suggested. Importance of Rewards According to veterinarians, rewarding your puppy with a treat after he nails a command is vital for him to continue to prevail. Puppies are very intelligent. Once they begin to engage in the training and rewards begin to be granted to them, they will know their role and thus know what you expect from them. Dog Training Is a Must for Puppies to Reach Their Ultimate Potential Puppies are energetic and have a mind that is more than ready to be molded at the appropriate age. Bypassing this type of training would be unfortunate because it would prevent your puppy from reaching his ultimate potential, hence why dog training is an activity that veterinarians around the globe highly recommend."

14,What to Expect in The First Months of Having a Puppy,pets," So, you've got yourself a brand new, four-legged, bundle of joy. Congratulations. The next few months are going to be full of love and memorable experiences with your new puppy. But, it's also going to be a lot of work too. The first three months of owning a puppy are very important times, and there is much you will need to do in order for your puppy to grow into a happy and healthy dog. So, what responsibilities does a new pet owner have to contend with? Well, let's talk about that. ***Training and Exploration our new puppy's brain is at its peak during these young months. They absorb everything that they experience, like a sponge. That being said, these first few months are crucial for their development. You should allow your puppy to explore new things, encourage them to be curious, and of course, you should start training them to follow whatever rules you put down. -Potty Training Take them outside frequently, to do their business, then reward them whenever they eliminate outdoors. Avoid scolding them if they are eliminated in the house. Scolding will only scare them or confuse them and it can actually hinder their learning process, rather than encourage it. You'll often read about rubbing their nose in their mess to teach them that it's unacceptable, but this is a very poor method of training. Showing your puppy that you are happy when they go outside will be more than enough encouragement for them, and with time, they will learn to go outside, instead of indoors. -Chewing Try to remember that If you don't want them to play with certain things or chew on certain things, take the object from them and replace it with one of their toys or a chewy bone instead. It's understandable that sometimes you will grow irritated when they chew on things they shouldn't. It's a bummer when your puppy ruins a nice pair of shoes. But as mad as you might be with your puppy, do not scold or get angered at them. Puppies do not understand the anger and they will not learn in healthy ways from this method. Reward and encourage them when they chew on their own things. Your puppy will love being rewarded and encouraged. They feel happy knowing that their owner is happy too. -Teaching Tricks Perhaps you'll want to teach your puppy some fun tricks. The best time to teach them is within the 3 month mark. Teaching them simple commands can take some time and repetition, but they'll enjoy learning and they will be fairly quick to catch on if a tasty snack or belly rub is a reward. ***Socializing Another aspect you absolutely want to focus on is socializing your puppy. When a puppy is young, it can become very excited and jump up on people or even playfully nibble. Then, there is also dealing with other dogs as well. Getting used to new surroundings can be scary, uncertain, and unusual for them. Patience is a must and so is getting them familiar with other humans and other dogs. Take them to dog parks to help socialize them, enroll them in a doggy training course, or visit a friend's house who has a dog that wouldn't mind some company. The quicker you get your puppy used to other people and other dogs, the safer they will feel. They will also grow to not be leery of others, which can be a wonderful asset when they're older. It can be difficult if your puppy grows into a big dog that doesn't get along with other people or with other dogs. It can make social events stressful for you, your guests, and even your dog. So, getting them used to lots of outside exposure is very healthy. ***Health Care The first few months of a puppy's life is going to require a lot of vet visits! You should consider getting them spayed or neutered, they'll need a few different shots, and they'll also need preventative medications for fleas and heartworm. And this is just if everything is normal and your puppy is healthy. Jumping on these medical issues quickly and keeping them up to date is crucial for the longevity of your pet's life. Good health care is required all throughout their lives and should always be kept up to date. ***Conclusion So, this is what to expect during the first few months of your new puppy's life. Try to remember patience. Little puppies do not learn as we do and sometimes it can take a long time for them to understand something or learn a new rule. It will take encouragement, repetition, and lots of love and understanding. But, you will make some beautiful memories together and there really is nothing sweeter than that bond between a person and their puppy. Congratulations on the newest furry member of your family, and good luck."
15,The Importance of Pet Care,pets," It’s a given that pets are a major responsibility, and providing care is an essential part in the bonding between pet and owner. We all understand that pets provide us unconditional love, during good, bad times and are used therapeutically. As loved a pet is and regardless of how smart they maybe, they just cannot take care of themselves, that is where you, the pet owner step up and provide the care they need. Whether it be taking them for regular check-ups at the Vet, providing a proper diet, taking them outdoors for exercise or just pampering them with beautiful sleeping quarters and run of the house, it is up to you to provide each aspect. The following are some tips on caring for your pet, they may seem common sense but essential to their well being. These days, obesity doesn’t only affect people, our pets are susceptible to overeating and add the lack of outdoor activity or exercise, and this can lead to a very unhealthy pet. This perpetuates to a pet becoming more inactive which can slow them down mentally and physically. This makes them more prone to illnesses and all they end up being totally inactive and quite dull. To prevent your pet from being obese, engage them in games in activities which can keep them active and running frequently. This will improve their heart rate and keep all their aspects engaged. In addition to ensuring your pet remains active, supplement this with a balanced diet. In order to be strong and healthy, animals need to be provided with a healthy diet that meets all their nutrient needs. A healthy diet will have many benefits on your pet, for instance, they will have a shiny coat, healthy skin and a generally good appearance. Their immune system will also improve by a large extent and they will be less prone to getting ill. Ensure that their diet also contains fresh, clean, water. This is often underrated since people assume that animals can find their source of water anywhere. This puts your pet at risk of drinking contaminated water which can be dangerous for your pet.  Always make sure high quality grade pet food is picked. Environment is an important factor, so ensure that they are provided a safe place. It is good to let your pet go out and roam around but please ensure that they do so in a safe place. This will ensure that they do not come into contact with unsafe areas that may be breeding germs or that may have poisonous spills. Your pet may also accidentally get run over by a car, so please ensure that they go out either in a safe closed environment or while supervised. As we go see a Doctor or a dentist frequently, if not then we should, your pet should be taken to the vet regularly. It is of absolute importance that you take your pet to see the veterinarian on regular occasions. Going to see a vet will help you to identify any ailment early, this kind of early discovery will ensure that you can contain the illness before it can get much worse. It will save you and your pet a lot of discomfort, in addition to helping you with any treatment constants. Regular check-ups are also great just to see how your pet is generally fairing. We normally understand that our pets are our companions, but this should also be reciprocated. Animals, especially house pets, love feeling cared for and taken care of. For instance, cats love being stroked and held, while dogs love playing with their owners. Small caged birds like to sit on your shoulder, possibly even groom you and peck at your ear lopes, meaning they like to roam free once in a while. Your pet, therefore, needs to feel this love and affection from you, which will keep them in a good state of mind. The best thing about pets is that they reciprocate the same amount of love that you give to them, and therefore, it will be a win-win situation. There are many more ways to care for a pet than mentioned here, but I see these as the core components to ensure the health, safety and well being of your pet. If you have other ways or methods used to care for your pets then please drop us a line. Our pets are our friends and companions, providing unconditional love, attention and support, I think they expect the same from us."
16,Tips on keeping your bird happy and healthy,pets," Actually its my daughter who is the bird pet owner, and she does a wonderful job of keeping her birds happy and healthy. There is no actual science behind it, but she just knows that the following points keep the birds in a happy safe place. We know this because the birds are in good spirits, feathers strong and colourful, diet is stable, accommodation big enough and they get plenty of exercise. We have two Green Cheek Conures in the house, their names are George now 2 years old and Willow about 1 year old. They are a male and female bonded pair, who are very playful and affectionate. They also speak, being able to say hello and peoples names. They do tend to get loud, and their diet consists of pellets and fruit (the fruit can be dry) seeds and nuts. According to wikipedia the following are some facts about the Green Cheek Conure which is a parakeet. The green-cheeked conure (Pyrrhura molinae) is a small parrot of the genus Pyrrhura, which is part of a long-tailed group of the New World parrot subfamily Arinae. This type of parrot is generally called a conure in aviculture. It is native to the forests of South America. We spend time with the birds and this seems to make them happy, almost like they are extended members of the family. Bonding and socialization seems to be a very important aspect, although these two birds seem very domesticated, having been with us since birth. To some degree these birds are exotic, and are handled on a regular basis. Neglecting their psychological and emotional well-being can lead to all manner of destructive behaviors like feather picking. This doesn’t happen, as for at least an hour or two a day, she handles and plays with her feathered friends to fulfill their social needs. This helps keep them well adjusted and feeling good about life. A fresh, balanced diet is crucial to the health of the birds. As mentioned earlier the birds have a good balance of pellets, fruit seeds and nuts. Feeding fresh foods not only ensures the birds are getting the proper vitamins and nutrients, but also exposes them to new and different things, which keeps them excited and mentally stimulated. They have plenty of water as well. They have pretty good accommodation as well, as we can’t be with them 24 by 7. We have made sure they have a comfortable and entertaining place to live while the family is away. This started with choosing the appropriate cage for the size and species of bird. Filled the cage with plenty of enrichment’s (perches, toys, and other cage accessories) to keep our feathered pals engaged. The birds are much like the younger children in the family as they can grow bored with the same old toys. So we collect various cage enrichment’s that are periodically switched out to keep their large cage environment sufficiently stimulating. The birds can actually say a few words, which is entertaining, in fact, the birds learnt very quickly because they bonded with my daughter. Teaching our feathered friends tricks is great for their brains, but it’s also great for our overall relationship. The training sessions were short, fun, and consistent, and we didn’t expect too much too fast, but there was a gradual progression. With a little patience and lots of practice, our birds were entertaining our friends and family in no time! Birds, like all of us, need exercise! In the wild, birds fly, forage, and stay on the lookout for predators. These everyday necessities provide plenty of exercise. However, birds in captivity do not have these opportunities. As a result, we have made a concerted effort to provide our birds with enough physical exercise. Providing them with physically challenging toys (ropes and ladders, for example), playing games, allowing them plenty of play time outside the cage, and teaching the birds tricks are all ways to make sure George and Willow get the physical stimulation that is so important to their well-being. It would be great to hear from you if you have a special bird in your life. How do you keep him or her healthy and happy? Tell us in the comments section!"
17,Caring for our Dwarf Rabbits,pets," It seems very much like a menagerie at our house, with lots of different pets, from dogs, cats, birds to rabbits. Noah would have been proud. In this post I would like to introduce you to our newest members to the family. This time we are looking at two dwarf rabbits, Jeallybean and Jam. We find the dwarf rabbits as the most adorable and likable of our household pets. Mainly because of their temperament as they seem to get along with all the other animals, after the visit to the Veterinarian for their shots. There is a period of caring and wary, adapting with their new environment and neighbors, normally around 3 months. We know the dwarf rabbits adapt perfectly to a life within a house, as we have a big backyard and the rabbits have their own hutch, but they would fit well even in an apartment. It is best to get a hutch or cage of adequat. size (with a solid pavement and walls of rabbit-proof metal wire, for example). Prepare the bottom of the cage with hay or soft wood shavings (besides being ideal as padding, hay is fundamental in the rabbit’s diet) Put the cage somewhere appropriate (as an example, rabbits love to chew, so beware of electrical wires!!!), and out of potential harms way from other animals which may not be as friendly as those within their own household. We have also prepared a litter tray (rabbits always use the same place as “toilette”). Created a hideout in the rabbit’s cage (wooden boxes will do just fine), placed some food such as vegetables (this is fundamental) basic diet for the rabbits, some snacks and definitely water. A dwarf rabbit requires constant attention, as it necessitates a lot of care, so it normally has the run of the house, which means plenty of exercise. Please don’t consider giving one as a gift to your kids as if it were a “toy”, because the rabbit is easily scared and a number of them have died of heart attacks because of a bad scare. The dwarf rabbit, however, really loves company, it’s important always finding time to spend with them to get familiar. Too many hours of loneliness, make them nervous, sad and, as a consequence, aggressive. Anyway, we love Jellybean and Jam, they are a most welcome addition to our household. They are also good company and get along with the other pets. They give us lots of joy and satisfaction. If you have a dwarf rabbit, share your story and pictures with us, we would love to hear from you. Enjoy!"
18,Taking care of our new Kittens,pets," We have more additions to our house hold menagerie, I would like to introduce you to Tango and Cash. Two mischievous kittens who happened to wonder into our backyard and we immediately connected. Actually the connection occurred between my daughters and the Kittens, before I entered the picture, but someone has to buy the food and provide shelter. So you could say that the kittens were orphans, but no longer, now they are part of our family, and can stay for as long as they like. They have free range of the backyard, and are separated from our dwarf rabbits, Jellybean and Jam. At the moment we have to be very careful that there is no interaction at this stage with George and Willow our Green Cheek Cinnamon Conures’ more on their progress in another post. For now we are all getting to know each other. Ensuring that the kittens were checked for intestinal parasites, so we brought a fresh stool sample to the Veterinarian so they could prescribe medication to kill most of the intestinal parasites. Our Vet is beginning to know us quite well these days. As we had their eyes, ears, teeth and gums checked as a precaution. At the time the photo was taken, we estimate the kittens to be about 3 months old, if any of you reading this post have a keen eye, could you let us know the breed of cat they are,  all we are getting is that they are a couple of mixes in there, so not one predominate breed. At the moment we are trying to get the kittens used to be handled, that is via stroking and grooming at least once a day, but the kids are doing this more than once I can assure you. After advice from the Vet, we took a good look at their eyes, ears, mouth, paws, nails, skin and coat. As we would like to find problems early before they become serious. Anyway, we have been taking care of Tango and Cash the best way we can, and that involves a lot of love and attention. Another factor is nutrition, so we provide a protein rich and energy filled diet. They have a very healthy appetite, as they can eat up to 3 – 4 times daily. The kittens have taken a liking to canned kitten food, it seems to mimic the natural diet both in consistency and formulation. We are trying to mix this up between canned and dry foods, its trial and error for us at the moment, but I’m sure we will get there. We understand that this is likely to change from 6 months, less feeding but with more quantity, and we will cross that bridge when we get to it. Right now we are interested in getting to know Tango and Cash, and them us, paying particular attention to the social aspect of the kittens, as we don’t want them to fear being around people. So we are actively involved in the process, and ensure the kittens have proper development whether they remain with us or not. As mentioned previously we have quite a few pets, dog, rabbits and birds so ensuring they all get along is a very important aspect that we take seriously. We understand that some dogs cannot decipher a cat from a rabbit and we have both, but daisy our shiatsu terrier doesn’t seem to mind. Regardless, proper inter-species interaction, and overall behavior requires hands-on, responsible and sustained social development which we think includes the following; Time outs for bad behavior, although I think we only used this once Ensuring they are rewarded for good behavior, usually with treats, this happens very frequently Exploration of boxes, paper bags, newspapers, etc. Litter box training Petting them frequently and providing them with toys. Redirecting them when they start to bite or scratch. Introducing them to extended families and friends. Grooming at least once a week. Exploring areas around the house. Anyway, I wanted to share the new additions to our household, so  welcome Tango and Cash, if you are willing to share your experience with kittens, it would great to hear from you, just drop us a line."
19,"Dedicated to the Companionship of two lovable Pet dogs, Peppi and Bella",pets," The original purpose of the pet dedicated site was to remember my two best companions Peppi and Bella. Two dogs who went through the birth of my children, construction of a new house, a happy marriage and then the divorce which followed. It could be said that I had my own “Marley and Me” period. At each stage they remained with me until after 14 years, of true dedicated companionship, I had to make the heart breaking decision to take them out of their and my misery. I don’t want to make this a sad story, although it was devastating, and I’m sure anyone who has experienced this understands where I am coming from. Instead I like to remember them via snippets of stories, and there are many, as you can imagine with experiences that were 14 years in the making. These two lovable rouges where born (they are brother and sister) on a 10 acre lot in the outskirts of Western Sydney. Born on a property of my then girlfriend, later to become wife and then ex-wife’s family property was a litter of up to 8 pups, which had the run of the joint. There is no one breed, so I think the term mutts seem to be in order. Peppi looked predominately German Shepard and Bella I think was more Doberman, but there is likely to be a whole host of breeds there. It mattered nothing to me, as they were beautiful, playful and disrespectful pups, and that remained throughout their life. Maybe it was me, but I think they loved each other, much more than they ever loved me. They looked after each other, as you would expect from a brother and sister, looking out for each other when they were up to mischief. When I did get married, the pups moved from their lot on 10 acres to a modest rental property closer to the city of Sydney, they adapted perfectly, but an adventure was never far away. They had free roam of the rental, with plenty of food, water, security and walks, we tried to help them adapt to their new environment as best we could. And adapt they did, becoming more and more adventurous as they got older, as you would expect. I imagine, that my story is no different to the millions of other pet owners out there. Each with their own stories, I just took a step by dedicating a site not only in their memory but for all other pet owners who would like an avenue to read and view stories. Contribution from others who are attached to their pet companions is always welcome. As time went by, looking back so very quickly, the pups grew into medium sized dogs, and from my part I was always one who wants dogs, especially medium sized dogs to remain outside the house. They dug up the gardens, planned their great escape every few months and they provided me with nothing but headaches. Refilling the soil in the garden, patching the holes in the fence and walking the neighborhood to get them back home. I did finally get them chipped, so at least when they were found I would be contacted, and that happened way too many times, and it wasn’t cheap either. It all mattered nothing now, and I would do it again, but their lose has been painful. Taking them for walks, was a real joy, and they kept me fit, because there were two, relatively big and strong dogs, walks was more of a run, drag, run, it was tiring. I think we all enjoyed it, they were always willing to go for their walks as they would meet other dogs. It was more the adventure of their escapes I think they enjoyed more, which annoyed me no end. Regardless, they were always treated well, and they remained with me to the very end. When I did divorce, the dogs were left with me, no question, which I was very appreciative. During this very bleak period of my life, my focus was on my children, who I love dearly, shout out to Emilia and Sophia. I do have another two children, as I remarried, but, Emilia and Sophia were my focus during this time. They grew up with Peppi and Bella and attended the vet with me when the time came to say goodbye, so their history of the dogs is as vivid as mine. When the girls were not with me, then my focus was on the dogs, they gave me direction, and not to dwell on the situation. They had to be taken for walks, fed and had to be attended to, that is bath time, so they did take my mind off other things. I must admit this wasn’t evident to me at the time, but as I reflect that is exactly what it was, a greatly appreciated and lovable distraction. As mentioned there are many stories about life with Peppi and Bella, and would be more than happy to share them with you should you be interested. I would be happy to oblige, as I would like to hear your stories of your beloved pets, type doesn’t matter, as these days we have birds, rabbits, cats and dogs roaming the house. There is a story regarding how Peppi and Bella got their names, I think Bella would be obvious, but I bet you won’t guess how Peppi got his name. Anyway that is a story for another occasion. I hope you enjoy the Pet Dedicated site, it is a memory to companions, who kept me on my toes, got me through a very difficult period, and this is one that I cannot give up lightly. As their companionship left a profound mark on my life. They offered reason, responsibility, adventure, health and helped me become a handyman with the number of times I had to patch holes around the home. I welcome you to share your stories, as we remain dedicated to our pets."
20,Reasons Why Dogs Become Aggressive,pets," You may have noticed cases of your dog suddenly showing signs of aggression or rather becoming aggressive and threatening to bite. Such nasty behaviors and signs of aggression by your dog may be frustrating. Well, if you have no idea why your dog gets aggressive all over a sudden and growls around, this article is tailored for you. When handling dog aggression, it is very critical to evaluate the reason why your dog gets aggressive and the root cause of this. Having known the cause of aggression, it places you in a better position to combat and rectify this nasty behavior. Let’s walk you through some of the commonest causes of aggression in dogs. Some ailments cause dogs to become aggressive. If you have recently noted your dog changing behavior all of a sudden, then this is a key indicator that it has a serious illness. It may desist from horsing around with friends. If it is developing a quick temper and begins to lash out, this means your dog is becoming aggressive due possible illness. Frustration in dogs is sometimes called redirected aggression. It often stems from a dog not being able to get something they want. Your dog will then exhibit frustration in other ways. They may go to the extent of releasing these frustrations at the expense of humans or commonly the pets around it. The point here is far much different from desirable protection that our dogs give us and our families. Rather, it is when the dog becomes extra-vigilant and dangerous on a particular territory. In situations where it is becoming a threat around when it used to be in a normal state, it indicates that your dog is getting aggressive. Your dog may be in normal situations, being friendly and approachable. If it starts barking and snapping at practically everything in sight, it means it is getting aggressive. Leash aggression is often targeted by other dogs. It stems from cases where your dog is restrained by their leash and is not able to react or defend from perceived threat. Where dogs coexist in groups, they tend to naturally develop hierarchy for the pack. These include first eating habits, or being the lead on napping. Where lower pack members disrupt this unique order of coexistence, the leading team will try to restore order by displaying aggression either by snapping or growling. Anxiety in dogs often results from changes in the environment they are exposed to. In retaliation and response, they exhibit aggression. Furthermore, anxiety in dogs might be caused by the entry of a new member of the crew or when relocating to a new home, and sometimes a new member of the human family. Dogs are naturally aggressive in possessing the things they love or “own”. They tend to defend their resources and territorial ""ownership"" by exhibiting signs of aggression such as snapping or growling. It goes without saying that aggressive dogs may at times snap back at others or growl to defend their resources. Such cases have to be checked since it can grow gradually and escalate to extreme physical attacks. Fear is the most common reason why dogs exhibit signs of aggression. For instance,  if a new dog comes to their territories, they are gripped by fear and they respond through vicious attacks. Lack of proper socialization and negative experiences in the past are known to cause aggression in dogs. If they feel in danger, a dog will exhibit signs of aggression in an attempt to defend themselves. In conclusion, It is important to know the causes of aggression in dogs before seeking solutions to combat. Our pets should be in healthy conditions and harmony. One should always note that dogs naturally get aggressive. This is their response to unwanted conditions and threats."

1,Things You Need to Consider Before Adopting a Dog,pets," The loyal nature of dogs makes them the perfect pets, whether you have a family or not. However, most of the time, people rush into adopting dogs only to end up being overwhelmed with the responsibilities, which are physical, emotional, and psychological. If you have been considering adopting a dog, this article shows you some of the essential factors you should not ignore. Your financial situation The kind of care that dogs need requires a lot of financial ability. You not only have to consider the costs you’ll have to pay for the vet visits, but you must also include the dog’s meals in the budget. The costs will range depending on the breed and age of the dog you decide to adopt and can even go higher if the dog needs special care. Make sure you’re in a stable financial situation before proceeding with dog adoption. Dog’s nutritional needs and safety Make sure you learn about different types of dog foods to differentiate the healthy ones from junk foods. Learn about the proper rationing and how to combine the different foods to ensure the dog gets all nutritional needs fulfilled. You could do some research online or talk to a vet. You should also set a conducive environment for the dog by making sure that the home is safe. Remove any small objects that the dog could swallow or any loose wires that could harm the canine.

You will not only brush your dog’s teeth and cut its nails; you will also bathe the dog regularly. Buy grooming tools, including brushes and shampoo, suitable for your dog. Remember that different breeds have different types of fur, which means that you will have to choose the appropriate grooming tools, especially brushes. Your time constraints Apart from food and medical care, dogs also require attention and affection. You will, therefore, have to spend a lot of time with the dog as you bond, train, and even live together. Failure to do this could lead to aggressive behavior from the dog, and that will result in unpleasantness for everyone in the home. The dog could start chewing items like shoes and couches and will give you a harder time when training. Your family members The people who live in your household will also be affected by dog adoption. And their opinion should also be considered. Factor in the primary caregiver of the dog if you spend most of your time outside the home. Talk to your family members to make adoption easier when the dog arrives. Have clear guidelines on the discipline boundaries you will implement for the dog. Adjustment period Your dog will need time to adjust to the new living conditions, and it may take longer for him to get comfortable. Practice patience and give the dog as much time as necessary until they are fully comfortable with the new surroundings. Make sure your home doesn’t have any wild animals that could confront the dog, such as skunks or raccoons, to help with adjustments. You should also consider neutering or spaying to prevent breeding. Make sure you can walk the dog regularly as you let him socialize with other dogs."

4,All you need to know about Saddles,pets," The first thing a new equestrian needs to know about is the different tack pieces. They need bridle, girth, horse halter, saddle pads, and, most importantly, the saddle. The horse and the rider both need to listen to each other. The horse must understand the commands, and the rider must feel the slightest movements of their partner. Saddles are designed to ensure close contact and perfect balance for the rider and let the horse move comfortably. Before you pick a saddle for you and your horse, you need to gather proper knowledge about saddles. You need to know about saddle types, their functions, whether they fit you and your horse, leather types, brands, qualities, and many more. It is essential to have thorough knowledge about saddle types before you buy a saddle for your horse. So let's talk about it first. Types of Saddle: General Purpose Saddle: Beginner and intermediate riders usually use general-purpose or All-purpose Saddles. Riders who have just bought their horses and practicing different kinds of riding will find it perfect. These saddles can be used for most disciplines and is an excellent choice if you prefer to purchase just one saddle for different riding activities. General-purpose saddles are sturdy. They have flaps that are cut forward. It can be used for basic jumping, dressage and hacks, and even for hunts with small jumps. It provides the right balance for the rider, but these saddles have no pads at the front for the knee. Training schools prefer to use this saddle as they can be used for different types of riding and riders of different skills. But you must remember that these saddles are not perfect for competing in all disciplines, and the rider cannot shorten up stirrups as needed for showjumping and evening. Although you may use it for dressage, it won't be very comfortable as it pushes the rider's position forward. Dressage Saddle Dressage saddles are for advanced riders who regularly take part in competitions and need to ride for long hours. These saddles have a deeper seat with a U-shaped curve. It provides a better balance for the rider. They have straight flaps, and they are made from lightweight, thin material. The rider gets closer leg contact and makes more precision moves. Jumping Saddle Jumping saddles or close contact saddles are used for jumping and hunt seat equitation. Jumping saddles have forward flaps, with ranging degrees of rotation. It can ease a rider's leg position in the shorter stirrup length, which is essential for the jumping position. The Padded knee rolls make the two-point or half-seat position more comfortable. The seats are relatively flat compared to dressage or all-purpose saddles. Jumping saddles push the rider slightly forward into the two-point jumping position to help him while jumping over fences. It has a flatter seat, and saddle flaps are much more significant. It can give the rider more support. The extra padding in front of the flaps provides stability and protects during jumps. Hunting Saddle Hunting saddles are used by riders who regularly go hunting in the countryside. Hunters might need to jump over large hedges—that’s why these saddles are designed to push the rider's weight back in the saddle. Made from durable leather, these saddles have low cantle and pommel, which makes jumping more comfortable during hunting. Western Saddle Cowboys usually use these saddles. It has horns at the front of the saddle to balance when the other hand of the rider holds the reigns. It is comfortable and sturdy for riders who spent long hours on horseback and need to perform sharp turns. Treeless Saddles If you have horses that have backs difficult to fit saddles, you can use a treeless saddle. Riders who are uncomfortable with a full saddle can also use this. These saddles provide the rider closer contact with the horse. The saddles are made from leather and foam padding. It has a smaller pommel and cantle, which is made from lightweight fiberglass. But the saddles are not as secured as others. So the riders must also use a breastplate. Do I need a dressage saddle? You can use a dressage saddle if you think you are getting marked down for the position. Otherwise, you can use a general-purpose saddle. Saddle Fitting Different measurements have to be taken care of to find the right saddle for both you and your horse. First of all, the rider needs to decide on the type of saddle he wants to buy. Then you need to take the appropriate measurements of the horse-his withers, back length, etc. you need to consider the body structure of the horse as well. How to Measure the Withers: To measure your horse's withers, you will need a wire, paper, or cardboard and a marker. Once you have the tools, Bend the wire over the horse's withers. Lay the cable 2"" behind the horse's shoulder blade and bend it so that it lays over the withers against its skin. After that, remove the wire and lay the wire onto the paper and trace it around the inside section of the cable. After tracing the, you will get the measurement for the withers. It will also give you the gullet measurement. Every saddle comes with a specific gullet size, and it will help you to find a saddle that fits your horse correctly. Measure Back Length: The saddle should be perfect for the horse's back. Saddles are usually made to fit the majority of horses. But if your horse has shorter back, it may require a specialized saddle. In that case, measure from its withers to the last rib bone. Any saddle that is shorter than its back measurements will also fit. Just make sure that it is not too long for its back. Otherwise, it will cause annoyance and discomfort to your horse. Body Structure of the Horse: You will need to consider both wither measurements and body structure of the horse to determine the gullet size you need. Gullets of different sizes are designed for different horse body types. For example, for Pony gullet size is 5"" – 5.5"", for narrow Build 6"", for average Build 6.5"", for Wide Build 7"" and for Draft horse, its 8"". Saddle Size for the Rider At first, decide the style of riding, and then you need to measure yourself. One way is to measure your weight.

5,Best practices for pet-sitting,pets," The success of your pet-sitting business is dependent on the best practices of the industry. As a pet-sitter, you need to practice the following: Are you booked? Learn to how and when to say ""Sorry, I got engagements"" You need to learn to say no when you are booked. As you gain experience in this area, you will realize that you don’t really need to accept every request you get from clients – sometimes you need time to organize yourself as well as serve other clients without feeling overworked. Know your limits and the maximum requests you can take in day without compromising the quality of care you provide as well as your own wellbeing. Have you ever noticed that you are more prone to mistakes, like leaving your keys in the car or forgetting to lock your doors, when you overbooked or short on time? You might also endanger the safety of the dogs you are supposed to walk down the walkway. You don’t know everything. Know what to accept and what to turn down There is a list of pet-sitting assignments that you should kindly reject either because you are not sufficiently experienced in them or they are not fitting to you, or both. Honesty is perhaps the most important virtue you should apply in every good practice, including knowing what you can deliver and what you can’t. While it is tempting to try to impress every client by accepting every request they make, some pets and some services can put people or the pet in danger. For example, if you are not experienced with aggressive pets, or you lack training in this area, an overly aggressive dog can be a real danger and you would be better off without going out with such a pet. Imagine the implications of a pet under your custody biting or seriously injuring a person or another pet. The financial, physical, and professional consequences could ruin your business. Put your wellbeing first It is easy for you to get immersed in this business and forget everything about your health – this is a bad pet sitting practice. Regardless of how busy you are, remember to set aside some time for yourself, eat healthy, go for yearly checkup, exercise, and have enough sleep. Some pet-sitters would prepare food in advance – a quick and sumptuous balanced meal or a huge tumbler of a nicely prepared smoothie – to avoid skipping meals or dashing into fast food joints while on a tight schedule. Diet aside, you also need to be mindful of your working hours and weather conditions. Extreme heat or cold is detrimental to your health and that of the pet. Consider scheduling accordingly, either planning alternative activities, like indoor play, or planning for walks when the weather conditions are conducive. Besides your physical health, be wary of your mental health as well. Compassion fatigue and burnout are some of the top threats to the mental health of workaholic folks and you don’t want to go down that road. If these issues go unaddressed for a long time, they will begin to dent your pet-sitting professional and business. Always try hard to be the best of yourself. Create a strong and reliable support network Like any other industry, the pet-sitting industry comes with a bunch of unique challenges. You need to surround yourself with people who are privy of these struggles and the daily joys that come with pet-sitting. Network with pe-sitters locally and far to take advantage of conferences and other useful material. There is nothing you will encounter in your pet sitting professional or business that has never been encountered by other pet-sitters elsewhere. Summary For you to deliver best pet-sitting services, you need to adhere to the best practices. Don’t shy away turning down requests that you are unfamiliar with or lack proper training. Know the maximum requests you can take in a day or week. Also, don’t forget about your health. Networking with other professionals will help you gain access to vital information you probably never knew."

7,Why do cats eat mice? Should we let them?,pets," Why do cats eat mice? Should we let them? A cat and a mouse are inseparable. We are confirmed by all fairy tales, cartoons, jokes, advertisements, and literature. In our heads, the cat and mouse are a duo inseparable like a black cat and bad luck. There are a lot of myths about cats. Is this another one? Not this time! This stereotype finds confirmation in reality. However, this is not friendship, but a fragment of a larger food chain. Why do cats eat mice? The answer can be found below! Cats are not vegan Cats are 100% predators. Yes, even the stove lying alternately on the sofa or on the radiator is deep in the heart of the hunter and should eat meat. Even in him, instincts will always prevail and will never be completely extinguished. And what about a leaving cat! Most of his free time goes hunting for various victims, mainly mice. An adult free-living cat eats about 10 mice a day. Why did the mutters ""get caught"" on these rodents? There are good reasons for this. Why do cats eat mice? Taurine is found in mice. In these small rodents, there is up to five times more of this amino acid than, for example, in beef. And it so happens that it is necessary for the functioning of the cat's body. Do you already know the answer to the question: why do cats eat mice? Their meat is simply the healthiest for them. Without taurine, a cat cannot function properly and small kittens can grow properly. Its deficiency is a risk of serious ailments and even death of a cat ... A perfect meal In addition to the necessary taurine, along with the mouse the cat receives a properly balanced meal. The size of the victim perfectly satisfies the cat's appetite - cats do not eat in-store, they are able to eat only as much as their small stomach can fit. The mouse seems just right. Cats eat whole carcasses, leaving nothing behind with a small rodent. In this way, they also quench thirst, because the purses take most of the water they need from their meals. Mice allow you to provide a little carbohydrate that was found in the mouse's digestive tract. Cats shouldn't really take more coals than their victim's digestive tract. The stomach is still the most-left and uneaten piece. More than just nutrients ... In addition to being a well-balanced meal for a cat, their attractiveness increases due to the fact that the mouse tends to ... run away. If it didn't, then who knows if cats would be equally interested in cat food then."
8,An Interview with TrustedPals Founder Places Pets First - 3/2019,pets," An interview in March 2019. It’s easy to see the opportunities in the pet insurance market. Pet medical care is a major expense. And owners are treating their pets more like a part of the family than ever before. They’d do anything to keep their pets safe and well – they’re no longer pet owners, they’re pet parents. When Manny Rivera, creator and head of marketing of TrustedPals Pet Insurance Program, says ""we don’t want to leave a single pet behind,"" he means that from the perspective of an insurance professional – and as a pet parent. With the backing of Marsh, and Zurich North America acting as the insurance carrier, it’s safe to say that the program is in good hands. But Rivera knows there’s more to pet insurance than financial stability. ""Cats and dogs are treated more like children than pets these days – and you wouldn’t treat a child the way some insurers are treating cats and dogs,"" Rivera continues. ""We want to provide the best pet insurance that lets them get the care they need, without delay – just like a human would."" Looking after every whisker We have just one simple plan, rather than offering different levels of cover which make it harder to tell what’s covered – and what’s not – under each plan. ""Cheaper doesn’t always mean better,"" says Rivera. ""Sometimes it sounds like you’re getting more than you really are. For example, no plan covers pre-existing conditions, but not every plan provider thinks about whether a pet’s been cured or not – which we don’t really think is fair. With our plan, if a pre-existing condition is fully cured, the same condition would be covered if it crops up again."" And then there are injury-only plans which only look out for one set of problems and leave pet parents high and dry if their pet falls sick. We don’t want to put humans or animals in that situation. It’s not fair to offer products that do half the work and leave pets in a sticky situation. We want to make sure that if they ever need help, they get it from a licensed vet they feel comfortable with. Our plans are comprehensive, with coverage for examinations, treatments, surgeries and prescription medicines – so they get back on all four paws, sooner. Playing fair Like all insurance products, TrustedPals plans have exclusions, but Rivera has made sure these are clear as day to customers doing their research. Pet Advisors are experts at educating pet parents to understand every aspect of the scenario. For people who’d rather look for themselves, there’s a comprehensive FAQs section on the website, which tells them key details about the plan, and answers many questions about pet insurance in general. We think it’s only fair that pet parents know exactly what they’re buying, and exactly what they can expect. And when you put our plan side-by-side with other plans in the market, you’ll see the difference across the board. Going further and giving back Pet parents understand that there are pets less lucky than their own out there – and so do we. Major hurricanes and other natural disasters can displace hundreds of thousands of pets at once. While it’s important that families have a plan in place for situations like this, in a crisis things can change quickly. And pets can lose their way. That’s why Rivera set up the TrustedPals donation program – we’re giving away 1% of our profits to help pets affected by natural disasters find new parents. And we’re sending out free pet tags for all the pets who have our plans, to help reunite them with their owners if they can’t find their way home. ""TrustedPals is all about the connection between pets and pet parents,"" explains Rivera. ""It was important to us that we looked beyond the insurance product and found other ways to help pets every day."" ""You’d expect the best for any other member of your family,"" he concludes. ""Why should you expect less than the best for your pet?"""
9,Why pet insurance – and why now?,pets," ""Marsh hasn’t been involved in the pet insurance market before,"" says Manny Rivera, creator, and head of marketing of TrustedPals Pet Insurance Program. ""But we’ve been watching it grow, particularly over the past few years, and we’re now excited to be entering it with our TrustedPals program."" Premium volume has risen in the USA by over 20% each year for the past three years, while 60 million households own a dog, and 47 million a cat,. But overall, less than 1% of pet owners have insurance for their furry friends. It’s challenging to address the issue of relatively low uptake since pet insurance isn’t a product that’s sold — it’s bought. And that’s where Rivera sees the gap in the market, an opportunity to meet the needs of people who don’t see a cat or a dog as ‘just’ a pet, but as a member of the family. With that in mind, creating a program that followed the pack simply wasn’t an option. ""We saw the chance to develop the best pet insurance product on the market, a plan that doesn’t sacrifice quality or benefits at any price,"" explains Rivera. ""Some insurers will force customers into picking out certain deductibles, co-pays, or limits. We’re not doing that. We’ve created options for every budget so that no pet is left behind."" Alongside a very different take on pricing, we also wanted to lay the foundations for a new way of thinking about pet insurance as a whole. We’re not pet owners – we’re pet parents. Rivera comments that there was nothing on the market ""that felt like it met the needs of today’s buyers, the people we consider to be pet parents, rather than simply pet owners."" As pets become more humanized, he believes it’s time to introduce a more human approach to pet insurance. If things go wrong, pet parents need to know that family members with fur will get the care they need, just like they or their children would from their healthcare insurance. ""We don’t want anyone to be put in a situation where they have to make a difficult – impossible – decision about their pet’s health,"" Rivera explains. And he knows the concerns only too well from personal experience. It’s worth every cent to know that our pets make full recoveries, but insurance plays a crucial part in getting them back to normal and cared for in the long-term. But what’s the best way to get pet parents on board? Reaching the market Affinity partnerships will be a crucial part of TrustedPals’ distribution model, and the program will soon launch as a voluntary workplace benefit. ""I can’t stress how important our partners in these areas are,"" comments Rivera. But D2C channels will also act as a major route to market, in something of a break with the traditional brokered and affinity-based models. Rivera has created a best-in-class digital experience backed by Marsh’s own Bluestream platform to allow pet parents to quote and bind new plans without direct support - in just two minutes. Although no matter which route they sign up through, they’ll have access to our exclusive Portal. Here, pet parents can manage their pets’ plans and make claims in moments – plus there are lots of new features on the way, like our AI Pet Advisor, Ella.  And interactive tools to help them find and rate vets, groomers, and more in their neighborhood. Plus, Rivera has a global vision for TrustedPals. This means that before too long, it won’t only be pets in the USA having all the fun. ""Our Bluestream platform means that, unlike our competitors, we don’t have to start from scratch or redo work as we expand the program,"" he explains. Being able to deploy the experience quickly in other territories is a key advantage in a fast-moving market. How will we know when we’re successful? Talking strictly business, our success is tied to sales, revenue, and growth. But, in the case of TrustedPals, Rivera thinks there are more important things at stake – people’s pets. If we can help them have the absolute best lives possible, he says, we’re doing things right. ""We’re a partner with purpose,"" he continues. ""We’re donating 1% of all profits from the program to help pets find new humans after natural disasters. If we can do that, that’s as much of a demonstration of our success as the financials."" How many pets have we helped, who couldn’t help themselves? How many pets have our donations supported after their lives have been thrown into turmoil? And how many family lives have we restored to normal after a pet has an accident or falls sick? When we can start to answer these questions, we’ll have a real handle on the success of TrustedPals."

11,600 million dogs,pets," Alex Pacheco is often described as the Father of the Modern Day Animal Rights Movement in the United States. As co-founder of both the world’s largest animal rights organization (PETA) and the world’s largest non-profit animal adoption organization (Adopt-A-Pet), his 30-year track record of victories for animals is arguably unequaled. He has received many awards, ranging from induction into the Animal Rights Hall of Fame to The Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award, though his favorite is being voted Crew Member of the Year by the Sea Shepherd. From an early age, Pacheco was outraged by social injustice, and very motivated to fight against it. He grew up in the Midwest, watching the Vietnam War on television and becoming passionate about defending democracy against communism. Too young to enlist and in high school, he wrote to the CIA asking if he could become an agent. They wrote back saying he was too young and don’t call us, we’ll call you. He then applied to the FBI and was accepted to work at FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C.  Just days before leaving for Washington, he was talked out of it by his two mentors, Father Thomas and martial arts expert Steve Adams. It was the year of The Concert for Bangladesh, and they convinced him to instead pursue his other passion: helping impoverished children. Accordingly, he enrolled in the Scholastic Program for Ecclesiastical Students and for the next year studied to become a priest while living with three priests and seven brothers. After one year in the Ecclesiastical Program, he took a behind-the-scenes tour of a large slaughterhouse, where his passion for defending animals was unleashed. Witnessing the brutality firsthand, he dedicated himself to defending the most helpless of all, and within days he founded the activist organization The Ohio Animal Rights Committee at Ohio State University, and in the first month he received his first three death threats from trappers and hunters. Since then his commitment to defending animals has incited violent opposition and death threats in many shapes and sizes, from an angry man waving a loaded .44 handgun and screaming for Pacheco while in the PETA office, to anonymous packages mailed to Pacheco, containing written death threats atop the blood-soaked body parts of mutilated animals. Over the years he has received so many death threats in the line of duty that he stopped counting early on. In 1979 Pacheco left college to work as a crew member aboard the Sea Shepherd under Captain Paul Watson on the Sea Shepherd’s first whale protection campaign. Sailing across the Atlantic Ocean, their mission was to ram the world’s most notorious pirate whale-killing ship, the Sierra. Before embarking on the voyage and in anticipation of the ramming, the bow of the Sea Shepherd was fortified with tons of concrete. In the end, both ships were sunk in Portuguese waters. Prior to the sinking and while the crew was still in Portugal, Portuguese authorities confiscated the passports of Watson, Pacheco and a few others to prevent them from leaving the country, pending possible prosecution. To avoid capture by the Portuguese Border Patrol and under the cover of night, Pacheco swam across the border into Spain, hitchhiked to Madrid and spent three days in an airport waiting for a passport and a ticket to London, where he then worked with Ronnie Lee, founder of the underground Animal Liberation Front. Pacheco was later named Sea Shepherd’s Crew Member of the Year. While in England, Pacheco also worked with the British Hunt Saboteurs Association, disrupting hunts and physically clashing with up to 40 hunters at a time, who hunted from horseback and used whips to strike the saboteurs; some saboteurs were scarred for life with whip scars across their entire face. When Pacheco’s visa expired, he returned to the U.S. and moved to Washington, D.C. to become a lobbyist for animals, where he also organized the first animal rights civil disobedience training sessions in the U.S. In 1980 he co-founded PETA and for 20 years served as Chairman of the Board, specializing in undercover investigations, litigation and lobbying, before leaving in 2000. The campaign also led to the American Medical Association commissioning a study by Harvard University on how to defeat the animal rights movement. The study described Pacheco as ""a national folk hero to the animal rights movement."" In 1989, a secret Animal Research Action Plan by the American Medical Association called for divide-and-conquer tactics to counter PETA and other animal groups. After the plan was leaked, the AMA publicly acknowledged their plan and boasted about budgeting $21 million to carry it out. The Silver Spring Monkey campaign fueled an unprecedented amount of activism and a flood of national media, with activities ranging from illegal break-ins into animal laboratories, to peaceful protests and civil disobedience which continued to rise for almost two decades. In the process, Pacheco was arrested over 60 times. Spearheaded by Pacheco, the campaign produced numerous precedents, including: The first and only laboratory animal case to reach the U.S. Supreme Court. The first and only arrest of an animal experimenter for cruelty to animals. The first and only criminal prosecution and conviction of an animal experimenter on charges of cruelty. The first termination of a federal research grant because of cruelty. The first and only confiscation of animals from a laboratory. Introduction of federal legislation, signed by over 100 members of Congress, to force the federal government to terminate funding for the laboratory and to release the Silver Spring Monkeys. In addition, fifty-five U.S. senators, ranging from Senator Jesse Helms and Senator Barry Goldwater to Senator Ted Kennedy, signed a joint statement calling on the government to terminate funding for the laboratory, end the experiments and free the Silver Spring Monkeys. Pacheco was called to testify as the lead witness before Congressional Hearings by the U.S. House Subcommittee on Science, Research and Technology. He was called to testify as the star witness for the State of Maryland in the criminal trial and prosecution of animal experimenter Dr. Taub, in State of Maryland vs. Dr. Edward Taub. The campaign paved the way for passage of federal animal protection legislation – the 1985 Amendments to the Federal Animal Welfare Act. In 1991 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against the Silver Spring Monkeys, and in defiance of Congress the NIH immediately killed half of the surviving monkeys and the conflict continued. Apart from the Silver Spring Monkey case, while Chairman of PETA, some of Pacheco’s most significant accomplishments came from the wide range of roles he played in helping convince many of the world’s largest corporations to dramatically improve their policies concerning animals. From leading a high-profile three-year successful campaign against the world’s largest corporation at the time, General Motors -- in which Pacheco destroyed his own GM car by setting it afire in public during a press conference in downtown D.C. -- to his undercover work in the Texas oïl Fields owned by Exxon, his track record of victories for animals is remarkable."
12,Causes and Effects of Dog Anxiety,pets," Anxiety disorder in dogs can be caused by an illness, previous stint at the rescue center, separation among other causative agents. The disorder is characterized by a dog tucking himself between his legs, being reclusive, avoiding eye contact, among other signs. The effects of an anxiety disorder include inappropriate elimination, development of destructive behavior, and aggressive vocalization. It is recommended you seek the advice of the veterinarian. If your dog tucks between his legs so often or seems restless most of the time, or he avoids eye contact and prefers to retreat in his kennel, there is a likelihood he has an anxiety disorder. Of course, these behaviors don’t always mean anxiety disorder is the case. That is why you need to seek the advice of the veterinarian if you observe your dog acting that way. Other than the aforementioned indicators, an anxiety disorder can be manifested by these signs and symptoms: Destructive behavior Spontaneously elimination (bowel movement and urination) Excessive licking Displacement behavior (air sniffing, lip licking, yawning) Excessive licking Passive escape It is perfectly OK for a dog to display these behaviors once in a while. But when it becomes a common occurrence, you know there is something to worry about. Sometimes it can be obvious to you what is the cause behind these changes and sometimes it can be hard to the point of requiring the veterinarian’s attention. Dog anxiety can be caused by many factors some of which may be at play at the same time. What causes Dog Anxiety? Here is why your dog may be anxious: Dogs are like kids and everyone else: they almost always react to separation, sometimes irrationally. If your dog is always attached to you, as it is always the case with most dogs, he is likely to freak out if left alone or with an unfamiliar caregiver. He may develop separation anxiety in the process, destroying your furniture and howling uncontrollably as a result. Separation is one of the top causative factors of anxiety disorder in dogs. Most dogs end up at rescue centers after abandonment or mistreatment by former owners – those are not nice experiences. The experience from traumatic situations and separation coupled with unpredictable routines or sudden changes in the environment may cause anxiety. A behaviorist, the veterinary version of a psychologist, can be of great help in helping the dog erase the traumatic experiences. Sometimes fear reactions and anxiety go hand in hand and a disease may be behind them. Illness-induced anxiety occurs spontaneously, suddenly turning a normally settled dog into an untrusting and restless fella. Diseases and conditions such as Hypothyroidism (failure of the thyroid glands to secret right amounts of hormones), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), loss of vision or hearing, and Thyrotoxicosis (autoimmune disorder affecting the dog’s thyroid glands) can be causative factors. Effects of Dog Anxiety Here is what anxious dogs do: Aggressive vocalization: They resort to unreasonable howling and whining most of the time. Note that uncontrolled barking doesn't pass as an indicator of anxiety disorder Destructive behavior: They scratch and bite soft surfaces like leather and sponge off furniture and other property Inappropriate elimination: They urinate everywhere including unwanted places like inside the house Conclusion An anxious dog can be a destructive one. Like any other pet, dogs are prone to be destructive when battling an illness or disorder like anxiety. To understand the real cause of the anxiety, you need to take him to the veterinarian. In most cases, training from a behaviorist –the veterinary version of a psychologist – is all a dog needs to recover."
13,Major Key Considerations to choosing a Dog,pets," A dog is considered as man's best friend since they make such a good partnership. The initial challenge is always arriving at the ultimate decision of picking an ideal pet. People have different selection criteria as they embark on a search to find a dog that matches a particular personality. Some pet owners' decisions are influenced by their past experiences with certain dog breeds. It might be a daunting task if you lack a wishlist or guideline to help you pick the ideal pet. Undoubtedly, there are a number of factors to consider when picking a pooch and this article aims at shedding some light. Let us look at a number of factors you need to consider when choosing the right dog. Affordability People go through a lot of trouble to land on the ideal pet and financing is one of them. Pet owners who want rare or pure breeds have to part with a good amount of money. You need to look at the affordability of a certain breed dog so that you check whether it's within your budget range. Motive and purpose may influence the dog's price. For example, if you want a dog for security reasons you should be prepared to pay more since such dogs have gone through special training and feeding programs. Getting a pet adds to your list of responsibilities which implies that you can cater to its expenses comfortably. If you just need a dog companion you could visit rescue centers and pick one that aligns with your personality, tastes, and preferences. Sex You also need to pay attention to the dog's gender before you make the ultimate decision to own it. If you want a much stronger and larger dog then pick a male. If you want a docile pet that is much easier to train a female. If you decide to pick a female purebred then you have a chance of owning a litter of puppies later which might benefit you financially. However, it should be clear that regardless of the gender both female and male dogs can be neutered. Breed There are pet owners who are after a specific breed and it is a wise decision to deal with a reputable registered breeder. Working with a registered breeder drastically reduces the chances of falling victim to unscrupulous individuals who are after making profits. People look for a particular line of god breed in search of a certain personality. Some professional breeders offer guarantees contracting to take the dog back if it doesn't suit your personality. At times it takes a small description of what you want and the professionals will sort you out. Age Age is always an issue when purchasing any form of an asset due to the longevity and life span factor. There are advantages and disadvantages to owning a puppy and a much older dog. A puppy will give you the chance to get involved in its upbringing as you make valuable memories. On the other hand, having an already mature dog sets the pace and requirements for you. An older dog has already defined characteristics such as size, height, and behavior. You also get conversant with its background history which allows you to adjust accordingly in terms of the medical expenses, accommodation requirements, and training required. The average lifespan of a dog is ten years make a sound decision to avoid remorse later. Size You need to be cautious about the size due to accommodation requirements and mobility issues. There are pet owners who love smaller sized breeds while others prefer the large breeds. The decision here solely lies with the pet owner due to individual taste and preference. However, small-sized dogs are much more preferred for households with children than larger breeds. Larger breeds tend to consume and shed more compared to smaller breeds. The above-mentioned considerations will help you make a sound and ideal decision on the kind of dog you need. Remember you are getting yourself into a lifetime commitment to take care of the pooch that should be considered as family. Get equipped with these vital factors and land on a best friend for life."

This article is dedicated to helping you manage the separation anxiety in your pet dog. Ways to Reduce the Separation Anxiety in Your Pet Dog You need to be sure that your dog is suffering from separation anxiety before you start managing the condition. The signs and symptoms that the canine depicts could be caused by some other condition or disease. The following are tell-tale signs and symptoms of dog separation anxiety. · Bad potty habits Your dog should be trained enough to manage its urinating and defecating. Be wary if the pet only displays bad potty habits whenever you separate from it. · Moody behavior when you are preparing to leave Your pet is most likely very calm and cuddly when you are settled at home. If it starts barking and howling whenever you are getting ready to leave or have already left, it probably has separation anxiety. The barking, howling, and other signs of distress are always consistent as long as you stay gone. Other distress behaviors include chewing and biting on household items. · Escaping attempts Your dog may try to escape through windows and doors when you leave it. The plan is to always trail your scent and find you wherever you go. Pacing uneasily and obsessively Drooling, panting, and salivating way more than usual: (Flannigan & Dodman, 2001) 6 Easy Ways to Reduce the Separation Anxiety in Your Dog This appeases your dog and wears it out as well. The pet will be struggling to keep awake as you leave. It will also be too excited to throw tantrums. Separation anxiety could be a monster that you created with too much touching and eye contact. Don’t keep bidding your pet farewell anytime that you are leaving. In fact, don’t overemphasize your returns after long absences. Dogs are easy to train, and you should teach it some independence. Let your dog associate your absence with nice things. That way, you won’t always fight when you are about to leave it alone. Make sure to take the treat away immediately you leave. Taking the treat away upon your return serves to reinforce the association of your absence with treats. Let’s face it; some pet owners experience separation anxiety as well. If you are one of those, then say bye to your dog long before leaving. Just make sure you don’t call for attention at the moment of departure. Medicate your dog in case of strongly undesirable symptoms. Training your dog out of separation anxiety will definitely take more time than you may desire. What do you do if the anxiety symptoms are too destructive to your home or the pet’s safety? Well, you must use calming drugs from the onset as you continue training the pet. Roll it out of the meds as the training starts working effectively (Thielke & Udell, 2015). Be calm, firm, and assertive Your dog is an emotion detector, and it can smell weakness. Be the grown-up between the two of you. Therefore, be confident and assertive even as your pet tries barricading you in the house. You just need to know the temperament of your dog. Always tae care of it for the well-being of your pet and emotional support. If symptoms persist, seek medical help. References Flannigan, G., & Dodman, N. (2001).

19,How To Choose The Right Dog Food To Optimize Your Dog's Health,pets," There are so many dog foods on the market it can be a little tricky to know what is the best dog food for your canine. There are a few factors to consider when thinking about Fido's dietary needs including his age, his size, his breed, any medical conditions such as diabetes or obesity, your budget, and any other personal preferences such as natural or organic dog food. How to choose the right dog food? Read on for some handy hints. Labels and Ingredients. These days in most countries the ingredients of the dog food have to be printed on the label. Your dog needs a diet high in quality proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Ambiguous words like meat-meal can mean almost anything and are often euphemisms for animal leftovers and by-products such as skin, hooves, and the like, which your dog will have problems digesting. Labels list ingredients in order of weight, so the first ingredient will be the one with the largest percentage in the food. A good quality dog food will list meat or protein, such as fish or eggs, as the first ingredient. Be wary of foods that list meat-meal, corn or wheat, as the primary ingredient. Age of dog. The age of your dog is probably the most important consideration, as dogs have varying nutritional requirements at various times of life. Puppies need mushy high-calorie foods, while senior dogs require fewer calories. Many senior dogs are starting to lack some teeth, so softer and smaller foods become easier for them to handle. The age of your dog will also determine how many times per day he will need feeding. Most breeders will give you a list with your puppy's dietary requirements but here is an approximate guide: 6-8 weeks old. These puppies need feeding 3-4 times daily with high-quality food containing calcium, protein, and plenty of calories. 2 months. Some breeds can now be reduced to 2 feeds per day. If in doubt consult your breeder or vet. 3-6 months. Puppies in this age group need 2 meals daily. The emphasis should still be on quality. 6-12 months. Your puppy still needs puppy food until at least his first birthday. Some larger breeds need puppy food for a considerable time longer. Generally, after 9 months of age, you can switch to 1 meal daily. Check with your vet as to whether this a suitable plan for your own dog. Some owners prefer to feed their dogs 2 meals daily for life, to reduce the risk of bloat. These dogs should have their dietary requirements assessed and then split in 2 to avoid overfeeding and obesity-related issues. Amount to feed. The amount you feed your dog will be dependent on the age, level of activity, size, gender, and whether or not they are overweight. A pregnant or lactating female will have her very own dietary requirements, which your vet will be able to assist you with. If you are unsure whether your dog is being underfed or overfed consult your vet. A quick visual should give you some ideas. If your dog has a waist they are in the correct range. If their ribs are protruding they are too thin. Most dog foods list a rough guide as to the amount your breed of dog would require. You will then need to consider whether Fido runs 5 miles daily, or can't get off the floor, as to whether he would need more or less. As an approximate guide, a small dog like a Yorkie or Chihuahua, weighing less than 10 pounds, would need between 1/3 to one full cup of dried food daily. A dog weighing between 25-50 pounds, such as a Beagle, would consume between 2.25 to 3.75 cups of dried food daily. A Labrador or Golden retriever would require 3.75 to 5 cups of dried food daily. Mastiffs and Great Danes will be eating you out of house and home, with a whopping 5 to 8 cups of dried food daily. Organic and natural dog food. Many dog food experts claim that natural and organic dog foods provide many health benefits for your dog. The main health advantages appear to be: Shinier coat. Less digestive upsets, and a better ability to absorb more nutrients out of the food. Fewer allergies. Reduction in ""doggy breath"". Increased energy. Whole grains, oats, and barley are generally used as fillers instead of corn, wheat, and artificial products, which many dogs have problems and allergies too. You are going to pay more for these organic foods so you should ensure that they are certified organic. Various choices include organic grass-fed bison, and organic chicken, turkey, and beef. Homemade dog food. Homemade dog food is always going to be a great alternative for those who are not time challenged as you will know exactly what your dog is eating. Better still, homemade food can also be a lot more cost-effective as most leftovers are suitable foods for Fido. There are a few exceptions including potato skins, onions, chocolate (which is poisonous to dogs), and milk (which gives many dogs diarrhea). Garlic is a great addition to both boosting immunity and helping with the eradication of fleas. Homemade food can consist of vegetable stocks, soups and perhaps even meat on sale from the grocery shop. Eggs are always a great addition as a high-quality protein that dogs can metabolize. Let's not forget that dogs are traditionally scavengers so there is absolutely nothing wrong in feeding them your sensible leftovers. Additionally, by feeding your dog this way he will be reaping the benefits of a varied diet. Whole grains, brown rice, oats, and pasta can all be used to bulk out the meal. Diabetic dog food. The diabetic dog requires a diet high in both fiber and complex carbohydrates to gain better control of the blood glucose levels. Diabetic dogs need to be fed a pretty consistent diet to ensure there are no huge fluctuations in the blood sugar levels, which in turn affects the amount of insulin needed. The diabetic dog is better fed dry food as it will generally contain more fiber. There are many commercial and vet supplied diabetic dog foods to select from. The diabetic dog will be fed at strict times in accordance with the vet. These times will revolve around the dog's insulin injections. Any questions or issues concerning diabetic dogs are best raised with your vet. Dog food storage and hygiene. Dried dog food should be kept in the original packaging and then enclosed in an air-proof container. This will stop humidity affecting the food, and will also ensure that you are not feeding the local rodents. Your dog's water supply should be changed daily. Water and food bowls should be cleaned on a regular basis. Stainless steel bowls are great for ease of cleaning. When preparing dog meals using raw meats, you need to be particularly careful to adequately wash your hands and equipment when finished. Raw meats can carry Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for food poisoning, which is easily transmissible from hands and work surfaces. Conclusion. Selecting the right dog food for Fido is based on many factors including breed, size, age, activity levels, medical conditions, budget, and personal preferences. A good quality dog food will label meat as the primary ingredient. Dog foods listing fillers such as corn, wheat, or meat-meal as the major ingredient should be avoided."

1,How To Get a Dog To Come When You Call,pets," You're at the park with your dog. You've tried calling and calling him/her, but they won't listen. Instead of coming to you, the dog runs away or continues playing. It's frustrating and sometimes even embarrassing because people around are looking at you. Eventually, after chasing them around and running around in circles, you manage to get them. But it should not be so difficult - a dog should obey what you say to them. If you're in a similar situation where your dog doesn't come back after calling them, we're going to look at dog recall tips to help you solve this problem. Call, Don't Yell One mistake people make is that they yell instead of calling calmly, especially when the dog has done something wrong. What these people don't know is that the dog will associate the call with a negative thing. Your precious animal will be confused and won't come to you due to the fear of getting punished. What should you do instead? If he/she doesn't come back the first time, call them by name again. Do it cheerfully. When your dog turns around, sit down on your haunches and go on calling, enthusiastically and happily. Doing all these will encourage your animal to come. And when he finally comes, don't reprimand, but praise warmly. Let Coming to You Be the Best Choice for Your Dog If a dog is not answering and responding to your call, then he/she may be chasing after something more interesting. Therefore, think of ways to make coming back to you more exciting. One excellent way is having their favorite toy in hand. When you call them, your dog will know that you're giving them a fun item to play with, and they'll come. Another way is keeping a bag of tasty treats. As you continue with the recall training, you'll eventually be able to call your animal without over-relying on toys or treats. Let the Call Be Not Always About Stopping Fun One thing about dogs is that sometimes they behave like stubborn and over-excited kids. If you only call them when it's time to stop enjoying themselves, they're soon going to realize that it's not the best thing for them. Naturally, they'll want to keep enjoying themselves. The best solution for this is to call them when you're out having fun. Call your dog, and when he/she comes, say ""good boy/girl,"" give them a treat or a scratch on the ear, and release them to continue playing. Do this several times and leave when it's finally time to go. The key here is dissociating your call with the end of having fun. With enough recall training, they'll listen. Never Punish If He/She Doesn't Come Straight Away Punishment is a common reason why many dogs don't go to their owners after being called. Therefore, you should try to avoid it as much as possible. If you always punish your precious pet when they take too long to respond or come, they'll perceive your call as that of punishment. Therefore, they'll never do it. Be positive any time your dog responds and comes back, regardless of how long they take. These are some of the best tips when it comes to dog recall training. Remember to exercise patience during the whole training process. Don't expect him to grasp everything within a day or two. It may take several days or even weeks, depending on various factors. The best thing is that if your dog learns to respond to a call, grasping other advanced commands will be easier."

4,Pros and Cons of Dog chewing on animal bones vs. Artificial Bones,pets," Dogs love to chew, and this is very natural. If you don’t give them anything to chew, they may even end up chewing anything they find before them. Chewing is an instinctive activity for dogs; they should, therefore, be provided with bones to chew. However, some of these dog bones are dangerous, while some are great for their health. But how can one be sure about their safety? This can be done by reading through this article. Below are some Pros of dog chewing on animal bones: Animal bones are a great source of both calcium and phosphorous. They can find phosphorus from the meat on the bones, and they can find calcium from the bone. However, they don’t contain carbohydrates, and this comes as a blessing because dogs are also supposed to maintain a healthy weight when chewing bones. When puppies get the right ratio of both calcium and phosphorous, they can develop in the right way. Chewing bones gives psychological benefits to dogs. Therefore, if you present your dog with the right bone, then it can be one of the best chews for your dog. This helps in providing dogs with essential fatty acids, enzymes, fiber, and antioxidants. That is why you will see that several home diets have recommended meaty bones for dogs. Chewing bones provides dogs with an excellent way to exercise their teeth as well as gums. This means that it will not be easier for tartar to build in their teeth; hence, you will not need to have frequent visits to the dentist. Cons Chewing bones can crack the dogs’ teeth. You should, therefore, avoid giving your dog frozen bones as this may fracture their teeth. Additionally, when it comes to digestion, there is some difficulty with bones. And this is where the dog’s stomach acid will come in. Pros of dog chewing on artificial bones They help in promoting health chewing; in addition to that, they are not likely to cause dental fractures in dogs.They are very durable and can always be reused; you, therefore, don’t have to look for a new one every time your dog needs to chew. It helps in stimulating the natural behavior of dogs. When dogs move from one place to another, trying to put the bone in position so that they can chew it properly, their natural behavior becomes stimulated. This can also bring a lot of psychological benefits to them. With artificial bones, you don’t have to worry about your dog being choked. This is because the dogs cannot break then into small pieces. Cons of dog chewing on artificial bones Compared to animal bones, they are completely non-digestible; they are therefore very likely to cause intestinal obstruction. Because dogs are likely to struggle and swallow the bones, they may end up swallowing them, and this may come as a health problem to them. Many dogs would always prefer to chew animal bones. While this may be a cheaper option, it is not always the safest option for dogs, and that’s why most of them don’t like artificial bones. When it comes to choosing the best bone for your dog, you should first look at what your dog is comfortable with. As we have discussed above, some dogs don’t like artificial bones, so you won’t get your dog an artificial bone when you know he likes animal bones."
5,What You Need to Know About Canine Deafness,pets," Did you know that deafness in dogs can happen at any time? It is most apparent when your dog stops reacting to common events: the doorbell ringing, the sound of you pouring his food for breakfast or calling his name to come. While deafness can be a hard thing to think about in your dog, the good news is that it doesn't mean he can't still live a high-quality life and do all of the things that other dogs do, or even the things he used to do. It just means a change in approach to how you care for him, now cognizant of his hearing disability. It is estimated that about 5 to 10 percent of dogs in the United States suffer from deafness, either in one ear (unilateral) or both ears (bilateral). So, what causes this? Deafness can be either inherited or acquired. Hereditary deafness can be either cochleosaccular or neuroepithelial in origin. Cochleosaccular is the most common cause of deafness and is associated with coat color patterns. It is usually seen in dogs with the piebald color genes or merle color gene. It can cause deafness in either one or both ears and is seen more in association with blue eyes and a white coat. This type of deafness can be first seen between 1 to 3 weeks of age. Neuroepithelial deafness is not associated with coat patterns. It usually impacts both ears and is typically seen around the same age. Acquired deafness can be caused by numerous factors. Some medications can be toxic to the ears. Generally, the deafness caused by these drugs is permanent, but some animals may regain hearing over time. Many older animals develop deafness. It typically starts with the loss of ability to hear mid-level to high-level frequencies and eventually leads to the inability to hear any frequency. How to Tell if Your Dog Has a Hearing Problem Typically dogs that are bilaterally deaf from a young age are easy to recognize. They may not listen when called, be hard to wake when sleeping, or not acknowledge when you arrive home. Unilaterally deaf dogs, or dogs that become deaf later in life, may be more difficult to diagnose. A dog who is deaf in only one ear may have difficulty locating where a sound comes from and will typically orient themselves towards the good ear. Living with a Deaf Dog Deaf dogs can live normal lives but need to have a special dedicated owner. Deaf dogs are not suitable for families with young children as they can be startled easily. They should never be allowed to be off leash in an unenclosed area, and their owners must be willing to learn a new language. To learn more visit http://phoenixvetcenter.com today!"
6,The Pros and Cons of Using E-collar vs. Leash,pets," When it comes to choosing a training method, many dog owners are often confused about whether to opt for dog training collars or traditional leashes. While both have their pros and cons, which we’ll discuss in this article, it’s essential that when deciding on a dog training method, you consider what will work for both you and your furry friend. Dog e-collars, also called shock collars, are used by trainers for curbing certain unwanted behaviors like food aggression in puppies. Individuals also use them to ensure their dog stays close when not on the leash. These devices keep dogs safe and eliminate negative behaviors. The working mechanism behind them is that one’s pet will associate a negative behavior with an uncomfortable shock from these collars. Are e-collars Safe? The concern in many dog owners is whether or not these collars are safe. Well, dog experts claim that approved shock collars are safe. Therefore, they’ll only deliver enough shock to correct your dog’s unwanted behavior without harming him. Plus, many of them come with different reinforcement methods such as beeping and vibrations. Below are some of the Pros of using e-collar training: Distance Training With this collar, you don’t need to be necessarily at home to train your dog. In as much as they’re used for boundary control, individuals can also continue training their pets even when they’re at work. For instance, if your dog barks loudly until neighbors are distracted, one can purchase shock collars for barking. Fast Results In most cases, it’ll only take a few shocks before your dog improves their unwanted behavior. After that, you only need to vibrate or beep the collar for a warning. Plus, most will keep your dog safe within a restricted distance without limiting your pet’s freedom to romp around. Different levels of intensity Like we’ve said earlier, many of these collars come with a beeping or vibration warning before the actual shock is administered. Furthermore, they have settings in which one can adjust shock levels. Below are some of the cons for using e-collars while training your dog: Shock and Fear Because of the shock, some dogs may develop a fear of situations, objects, or people. Also, even though one can control the intensity of shock, many people still are afraid of this type of reinforcement as it can be negative at times. No Dog Rewards Whenever your dog corrects a particular negative behavior, it’s always wise that you reward him for the good job. But, these collars don’t provide such opportunities. So, even though they’ll stop that behavior, there will be no reward. Why Traditional Leashes May Be Better Well, many dog owners still prefer the leash dog training method for some significant reasons. For instance, one can operate the leash gently, so there is no risking psychical harm. Also, your pet can’t walk far away from you. Hence you can keep them safe at all times. Again, leashes strengthen one’s relationship with their pets since they can reward them whenever they’ve corrected a negative behavior, either verbally or by offering treats. And as they don’t need to be charged like e-collars, one can use them without worrying about power. But, a significant drawback of leashes is that individuals can’t use them when they’re far away. They have to be close to their pets. Final Thoughts Whether you opt for shock collars or leashes, remember that your main goal is to help your pet. So you should consider a training method that’ll work for him or her. Ensure that you’ve weighed out the pros and cons of each method before settling on any."
7,What to Look for in a Dog Friendly Apartment,pets," It can be tough finding an apartment when you have a dog.  Although many apartments accept pets, not all of them are great places to live with a dog. To separate real ""dog friendly"" apartments from those that simply tolerate dogs, it's important to visit the apartment, preferably with your dog, look at the facilities, and ask questions. Your visit will probably start at the apartment office.  It's a great sign if the staff welcomes your dog - even better if they have dog treats on hand - and absolutely great if the staff brings their own dogs to work! Look for places around the apartment where your dog can do his business.  A great, dog-friendly apartment will have poop-bag dispensers nearby.  Look for water bowls in public areas, and ask how often they are cleaned (dirty water bowls can spread diseases). Walk your dog through the building and see if he is bothered by anything.  Dogs hear about four times as well as humans, and their sense of smell is 10,000 times as good as ours!  Noises and smells that you might not even notice can be very unpleasant and even traumatic for your dogs. As you walk around, see how other residents react to your dog.  If you encounter other residents with dogs, ask how they like the apartment and facilities. Check Out the Area Look for places where you'll enjoy walking your dog.  This might include restaurants or coffee shops with outdoor dog-friendly seating, and nearby parks or walking trails.  Ask if there are any dog parks nearby. Check to find the closest veterinarians.  While you might prefer to take your dog to your regular vet, it's great to know that there is help nearby in an emergency. Apartment Restrictions Most apartments charge an additional cleaning deposit if you have a dog, and may even charge a monthly fee. Some apartments limit the size of the dog, while others don't allow certain breeds.  The most commonly restricted dogs are: American Pit bulls Rottweilers Akitas Cane Corsos Bull Mastiffs Dobermans German Shepherds Malamutes Huskies Chow Chows Wolf Hybrids The apartment should ask for your dog's vaccination records as part of the application process. That's a good thing, because it means that they are looking out for all their dog residents!  In fact, it should be a red flag if they don't ask for your vaccination records. There are many apartments that want you and your dog to be welcome.  Don't settle for a place that just ""tolerates"" dogs!"

9,Teaching Your Dog to Settle,pets," Want a dog who will settle down quietly when you're enjoying your refreshing cup of coffee in the local cafe? Here's how to teach your dog to chill. As the owner of a full of life Springer Spaniel I love my dog’s energy and joyfulness.  But as much as I love his enthusiasm, for both mine and his sanity, it’s important that he can also settle down and relax. Having a dog that has learnt to relax is very important.  And teaching them to do this on cue provides space for both of you.  When you're busy doing things at home such as making dinner, cleaning, working or even entertaining guests the last thing you want is your dog being under your feet. And if like me, you love your dog to join you when you are out socialising, then it’s really important that they learn to settle and relax in any environment. Any dog can be trained to settle on cue. Some laid back dogs will learn this very quickly whereas more exuberant or young dogs may take a bit more time.  As with any training don’t rush, take your time and remember consistency is key. Your goal is to have a dog that will lie down in any environment, relax and not get distracted by what’s happening around them. 7 Steps To The Perfect Settle Start the training at home where there are no distractions for you or your dog.  As your dog progresses you can take the training up a notch by going outside the house where there’s more going on. Start by having your dog on a leash.  Place your dog’s bed or mat next to where you are sitting.  Start by dropping treats onto your dog’s bed so that your dog associates the bed with a treat.  This will encourage them to come to the bed.  When your dog get’s on to the bed, say nothing and drop very small treats on to your dog’s bed.  Do this without saying anything or making a fuss. Gradually start looking for more relaxed behaviour.  For example if your dog is in a sitting position reward lying down.  If your dog has started in a down position, reward if they drop a hip to one side, put their head down on their paws, sigh or lie flat out.  Depending on your dog they may go through all these positions or go straight to lying flat out.  Reward whenever they demonstrate a more relaxed position. If your dog doesn’t come to the bed or just sits there staring at you, then reward even smaller moves towards what you want.  For example if they are pulling on their lead reward them when they release the pressure, if they are staring at you reward them for looking towards their bed.  Be patient and look for small responses to start with.  Your dog will eventually get the idea. As your dog becomes more settled space the rewards out so they have to stay longer in the relaxed position to get the reward.  Spacing should be built slowly by a few seconds at a time and over a number of training sessions.  If you want to add a voice command to this behaviour wait until they are effectively giving you a relaxed position and then add your command such as ""settle"" as you are giving them the treat. Once your dog can settle in a quiet environment consistently then start to add in distractions.  You can start by changing the environment, so test in another room of your house or out in your garden. Alternatively get a family member or friend to help by creating a distraction.  Ask them to start by walking past your settled dog.  Reward your dog for staying relaxed. When your dog stays relaxed with the person passing in walk increase the distraction by your helper doing more energetic movements as they go past.  If your dog becomes unsettled or gets up stay quiet and ignore them until they have resettled and then reward. If your dog struggles with the higher intensity then reduce the level of distraction and then build back up again slowly.  Remember we are always aiming to set the dog up for success. Always ignore any unsettled behaviour when training.  If your dog becomes over-excited or fidgets don’t give them any eye contact, use your voice or touch them.  If you’re able, turn your back until your dog settles down again and then reward. Once your dog is able to settle at home it’s time to progress to the great outdoors.  On your walks find a reasonably quiet area to start where you can sit down and follow the same guidance as before. Make sure at this stage your dog is on a short leash so that they are close to you and under control.  If someone approaches your dog and they start to become unsettled then politely let the person know that you’re training your dog and not to interact with them until they have settled back down. As the behaviour becomes more and more established your dog will learn to settle in any environment of their own accord. Before you know it you will have a dog that will happily take a nap even in the noisiest, most exciting environments and you will be able to enjoy your social life without having to worry about hanging on to your dog."

Find an airline that will work with you: Contact the airlines that fly to your proposed destination, select one and then check with them to confirm that they will accept your pet on the day and flight that you prefer. This will allow you to see if this date works, or how you can work around their flight times. As soon as you get on the plane, ask a flight attendant to confirm that your pet is on board. That way, if there's been any mix-up and it has not been loaded, you have a better chance of getting something done about it. Some airlines will allow you to carry small pet carriers with you in the main cabin, but only if it will fit under the seat in front of you. Visit the vet prior to the flight: Your Veterinarian must be consulted well before your departure date. They will give your pet a full check up and advise you on any potential problems and can also assist you with questions or concerns that you may have. Make sure you have all the required documentation, as noted when you contacted the consulate of your destination. Limit food intake the day before travel: Although they may initially disagree, your animal's potential for a comfortable trip can be increased by limiting their prior food intake. Prepare your pet for its journey by reducing the quantity of food the day before flying. Allow for normal water access as dehydration is a serious danger. Make sure to walk your dog before you go to the airport and before check in, which should be 1-2 hours before the flight. Equip your pet's carrier or crate with the vital necessities: The big day has arrived! While your pet is out of your sight and care, make it as easy as possible for airline staff to care for them. Your animal's travel crate must meet the airline's standards and be large enough for the pet to lie down comfortably turn around and stand freely in. Mark the crate with ""Live Animal - This side up"" and include your name, address and telephone number. At least two water bowls and dried food must be attached to the top of the carrier in case there are any flight delays. Any medication that is used for your pet must also be recorded with the name of the drug, the time and directions of administration."

15,Answering Your Animal Cruelty Questions (Save Animal),pets," Being a pet owner is a wonderful opportunity to find unrequited love. There is just something about owning a pet that can bring out the best, or worst, in people. An animal is a huge responsibility and it is up to the pet owner to ensure that their animal is receiving quality medical care, food, water and attention. When these situations are not being met then animal cruelty is the result. It is a sad state of affairs when animals are not receiving the help and care that they so desperately need. There are many animals that need love and attention that are simply not receiving it. It is our job as the owners to see to it that animals are not abused and left neglected or roaming around on the streets as stray animals. This article will cover the basics of animal cruelty and hopefully by the end you will be doing your part to stop this travesty. What are some of the laws that govern animal cruelty? There are many laws that govern people who own animals as pets or livestock. The law ensures that people must take responsibility for owning an animal. The animal should receive proper nutrition, water, and medical care when necessary. Should these laws be broken then the proper animal protection agencies of that area can step in and levy fines, arrest and take the animals away from the owners. There have been cases where offenders have spent prison time and faced stiff penalties and national censure such as in the cases involving dog fighting. Is having too many animals considered animal cruelty? There is such a thing as having too many animals. It can come in the form of hoarders or breeders. It all depends on whether or not the animals are being cared for properly. Hoarders do not realize that they are harming their pets. They erroneously accept that they are the main ones fit for thinking about their creatures. Having too many animals in many cities is against the law because having too many may limit the ability to care for the animals in the proper way. Breeders will often house several animals so that they can make money on the puppies. The animals are kept in cages that often damage the soles of their feet in such a way as it makes it impossible for them to walk properly. They are often not cared for nor provided with the proper medical attention.

They fine the breeder for having a) too many animals to be able to care for properly and b) not taking proper care of the animals. Some cities limit the amount of pets that any one owner can possess in a household. This applies to breeders as well.The reproducer can be fined and face conceivable jail sentences on the off chance that they infringe upon these laws. In the case of bad breeders, what happens to the animals? In the case of bad breeders who are improperly caring for their animals the animal welfare unit will seize all of the animals. The animals are then placed in foster homes, put up for adoption or will be euthanized if they are in too bad of shape. It is a sad condition that any animal should have to be put down just because someone did not care for the animal properly. https://www.animalninfo.com/"

17,Why We Should Feed Wild Birds,pets," Birds are essential to our environment. Throughout the world, birds are essential in dispersing seeds for plants which provide food, not only for other animals but for humans as well. These plants also provide medicine, timber and recreation. Birds travel long distances and assist in germination. Birds play a vital role in keeping the balance of nature in the world. Birds play other roles within ecosystems as well. They are a natural way to control pests in gardens, on farms, and other places. Loss of habitat for wild birds continues unabated and natural nesting sites and food resources continue to dwindle. To assist in stopping the decline, the most significant way we can contribute as a people is to restore natural habitat in our own backyard. We need to take an active and responsible role in managing our bird habitat. If you manage any kind of property, you are managing habitat for wildlife. Some Reasons for this decline are loss of habitat, environmental degradation, seasonal changes, change in weather, global climate change, inadequate forage, and so on. Wild birds have a comparatively high metabolism rate that needs food on an everyday and consistent basis. Several birds die throughout the winter, throughout droughts, cold spells, prolonged rains, and other conditions that cut back the provision of forage resulting in stress, weakness, reduced resistance to illness and parasites, and starvation. Feeding wild birds promotes population sustainment when natural food is difficult to find. There are many reasons why people feed wild birds. Some of these reasons include observing or studying nature around them, entertainment, relaxation, or just trying to provide support to bird populations in your area. The list can go on. As mentioned above, many of our wild bird populations are declining. Although bird communities in urban environments are regularly dominated by some exotic and common species like Rock Pigeons and House Sparrows, a shocking range of native birds have adjusted to life around humans. The American Robin can thrive in many habitats which include grass lawns with an abundance of earthworms. The California Quail and Abert’s Towhees find suburban plantings an acceptable substitute for native arid land habitats. Gulls, vultures, and crows get plenty of food at garbage dumps and along roadsides. Hummingbirds, chickadees, sparrows, finches, woodpeckers, and other birds take advantage of wild bird feeders. Even wild birds such as hawks and owls find increasingly safe nesting sites and sufficient prey in our towns and cities. The growing awareness that several wild bird populations are declining has generated a necessity for a brand new form of wild bird feeding. One that goes further than human-focused motivations in taking responsibility for the health and welfare of their local wild bird populations. The most significant thing we are able to do as a people is to restore the natural environment on our own property. We can do this by adding natural landscaping with native plants that offer shelter and foods, take away all alien, invasive plants, increasing natural and artificial nesting sites and offer a supply of fresh water. We can take an effective role in managing your environment and all of the wildlife that lives in it. Feeding wild birds responsibly will generate a greater holistic view of their local wild bird populations in addition to other local wildlife. If you own or manage a property, you are responsible for all the living organisms that occupy it either as transients or permanent residents. You are by definition a habitat and/or wildlife manager."

2,Keeping Your Dog Safe While Traveling In A Car?,pets," Whether you are planning on a long road trip or just a short drive around the corner, traveling in the car with your much-loved pooch should be a great deal of fun for both you and your dog. With some pre-planning and being aware of the dangers you can keep both your dog and the occupants of the car safe whilst being out and about. This article will provide you with some great tips and ideas about the best way to safely transport your dog and to decrease the risks inherent when riding in the vehicle with your pet. A suitably designed crate can be a great choice to ensure your pet's safety during a trip. However, it is very important to pick the right size crate for your dog and one that is designed for car travel. A crate that is made from aluminium and vinyl reinforced with fiberglass are much more preferable to many other types as they are much stronger and durable. You should also pay attention to the layout of the crate to make sure your dog will be comfortable and importantly have plenty of airflow. A crate that also has lots of insulation from the heat will ensure that your dog is comfortable. Quality is often a much better choice over cost when you and your dog’s safety is at risk. You can also get crates these days with wreck bags to make transporting your dog even safer as they provide an additional layer of protection in case of a car accident. While a crate can be a great choice some dogs will find it distressing to be locked up in a container and want to have more freedom to sit on the seats in your car. A well-designed quality car harness for your dog can often be a good solution. These days you can get all types of dog harnesses designed to restrain your dog's movements in the car to keep them safe. One that securely harnesses your dog and then snaps into your seat belts are a viable solution. Shop around and I'm sure that you will find one that fits your size dog. Going for a trip with a dog in the car is like travelling with a child. Even if it is not a particularly long trip it is advisable to stop every couple of hours to let them get out of the car, walk around and take care of business. While this adds time to your trip it makes sure that the whole experience for both you and your dog is much more pleasurable. If you've got a vehicle with power windows, then it is quite simple for your dog to open them by pressing on the switch with their paws inadvertently. You may believe this can be comparatively benign, particularly if your pet loves to stick her or his head out of the window, however, overexcited dogs have been known to leap from moving cars which would be horrific. There is also the concern that they could accidentally trigger the window mechanism while they have their head out of the window which could cause damage to their throat and face. Dogs require frequent access to water. This is even more essential when on a road trip where the temperature inside a car on a hot day can be excessive. You never know what may happen, the car may break down for example or you may get delayed for other reasons and so it always a good idea to have some water and a dog bowl handy in the trunk of your car. The very best approach to make sure you have water available would be to keep a bottle in the car as part of your emergency kit. A bowl can also be fine, but at a pinch, allowing your dog to drink from your cupped hands is just fine and in my experience the dog has no problem doing that. You should also be aware that often there are local laws that ensure that your dog must be suitably restrained while they are in a car. Certainly, most states don't allow the dog to be sitting in your lap while you are driving and never leave you dog in the car for extended periods during the warmer months. With a little thought and preparation travelling with your dog can be a great experience for all concerned."

4,Coconut oil for the dog: 4 application tips for the natural home remedy,pets," Coconut oil has many beneficial effects on the dog. It not only helps with grooming but also keeps annoying ticks and fleas away. How to use coconut oil for dog exactly, you will find out in this guide. Coconut oil in dogs: positive effect in many areas From hair care to oral hygiene, coconut oil is not only popular in the kitchen. The coconut oil is also suitable for animal care. The big advantage: The coconut oil is a natural product, so it does not harm your dog when it licks it - unlike chemicals with controversial ingredients. Because of the long transport distances, coconut oil has a serious climate impact. If you buy one, it should be certified organic. Also, less is more! Coconut oil for fur and paws of the dogs The paws are very sensitive in dogs and can be cracked. In winter, they are heavily used by road salt on the roads. In summer, the heat of the asphalt affects the dog paws. The coconut oil protects the paws from the weather, prevents injuries and keeps the paws supple. Application: • First, rub a hazelnut-sized amount of the oil on your hands and then massage your dog's paws with it. Coconut oil also helps with dry and flaky skin and cares for the coat. With regular use, it gives shine and makes the coat supple and combable. In addition, it eliminates unpleasant odors through the pleasant coconut fragrance. Application: • Depending on the size and length of your dog's hair, use a pea-sized to a walnut-sized portion of coconut oil and spread it over the animal's coat Coconut oil as natural protection against parasites Coconut oil is a natural means of external protection against ticks, mites, and fleas. In India, coconut oil has long been used to repel ticks and other insects, and initial studies on humans have been successful. Since coconut oil is free from toxic additives, no side effects are known. The protection makes possible the contained lauric acid. The unique fatty acid complex also works in already infected animals, as the lauric acid attacks the chitin armor of the pests. Preventively, the coconut oil prevents the parasites from settling in the dog. Application: • When you start treatment, rub your dog with a pea-sized walnut-sized amount of coconut oil before each walk (depending on size). Pay special attention to those regions that prefer ticks: the face, the ears, and the stomach. • After the walk, you should still inspect your dog for ticks. • After several weeks of use, it is sufficient to rub the dog only two or three times a week. Tip: Ear mites can also be treated with coconut oil. Add a cloth to liquid coconut oil and wipe your dog's ears with it. Protection against internal parasites Worm infestation in pets does not necessarily have to be worrying. Rather, the parasites challenge the immune system of your animal and strengthen it. If your dog is healthy, he can cope well with the burden of worms or other intestinal parasites. For the following symptoms of parasite infestation, it may be helpful to help your pet with coconut oil: • Weight loss • Anorexia • Diarrhea • Vomit • Itching around the anus • bloated stomach The oil is worming if the infestation is not already too advanced. In addition, it creates a worm-deficient intestinal climate in which the parasites do not feel well. The antiparasitic effect is strengthened by supporting the intestinal flora and in turn mobilizing your dog's own defenses. Coconut oil is therefore suitable for treating initial symptoms as well as for prophylactic use. In contrast to medical cures, it keeps your animal's body in balance and you can safely use it for a long time. If the symptoms do not improve quickly, it may be a severe worm infestation or other illness. In this case, be sure to additionally visit a veterinarian. Application: • Depending on the size, supplement your dog's food with about 1/2 to 1 tablespoon of coconut oil. • For the oil to be fully effective, it is best to treat your pet for several weeks. Coconut oil for the treatment of injuries in dogs Coconut oil is also suitable for wounds: • The fat layer of the coconut oil supplies the skin and can protect wounds from external influences such as dirt. Make sure that the wound is dry, so you do not bring any additional germs into the wound. • In addition, the oil soothes the itching and can also help your dog optimally with surgical wounds. In addition, it reduces scarring. • Unlike creams with chemical ingredients, it does not harm your pet when it licks the oil. Therefore, coconut oil is even suitable for injuries in the mouth. • Coconut oil can also treat bad breath. Just add a teaspoon of coconut oil to your dog's food."
5,How Do You Remove Cat & Dog Hair from your Carpets?,pets," Having a cat or dog in your home can be very rewarding and it adds to the enjoyment of day to day living. They offer companionship, improve fitness, reduce stress and can help improve your social life. Unfortunately, there are some minor downsides, of which includes the cleanliness of your home. Shedding hair can be a hassle if it builds up on various surfaces throughout your home such as sofas, bedding and of course carpet. Not only is it a nuisance, it can also cause allergy and other health issues. Attending to the problem should and keeping your house as hair free as possible requires regular cleaning, however getting the hair out of carpets can be challenging! Professional carpet cleaning is a sure-fire way to remove the hair, however in-between professional help, there are a number of ways to attend to it day-to-day. Dampen Cleaning Utensils If you have hardwood flooring or tiles, instead of dampening the floor directly, dampen your broom or mop applying it to the floor. The everyday mop will be transformed it into an efficient, damp hair-magnet. Grooming Glove Remember that grooming glove you impulsively purchased from the pet store once, and have never actually used? Well now is the time to use it - on armchairs, couches and smaller mats where you can really apply pressure to the area you’re working with. A Toothbrush for Smaller Crevices Old toothbrushes that are worn out can be great cleaning accessories for reaching hard, narrow crevices. Ideal for upholstery seams, smaller domes and buttons on the cushions that require a more intricate cleaning process, an old toothbrush will be your best friend for really getting every single strand of hair. Baking Soda Baking soda is a fantastic product for using after you've gotten rid of the pet hair – it helps to tackle the residual odors left in those particularly hair-dense areas, or a rug that the dog has slept on every day and night for the past decade. Sprinkling a little baking soda, gently rubbing it in and leaving it for 20-30 minutes, when wiped away, has a magical ability to refresh an area of carpet and instantly reinforce all your prior hard work. Rubber Brooms When dealing with tile, wood or linoleum floor, rubber brooms are a brilliant upgrade from your everyday household broom. Rubber also acts as a magnet to attract pet hair and quickly latch onto clumps, breaking through those seemingly endless layers. Using a rubber broom will work particularly well on hardwood as it means you can scrap having to deal with the aftermath left by a damp broom (extra wiping and drying). Hand Vacuum Cleaners Hand vacuum cleaners save you time and energy, requiring no set up. They’re easy to use, lightweight to hold, and allow for instantaneous hair-removal as you see it – particularly if the dog or cat decides to use one of the ‘forbidden’ couches or rugs that you've managed to deter them from up until this point of betrayal. Lint Rollers Sticky lint rollers are your best friend when it comes to a quick, fuss-free ""hair removal"" session. They’re great for smaller areas, and not quite as effective on larger patches of carpet - as the sticky area of the roller can be quickly consumed by the first surface layer of hair. Every small bit of maintenance helps to keep overall pet hair at bay. Adhesive Tape As lint rollers can be dearer and less effective on larger patches, strong, industrial-grade packing tape can work wonders. A great game for the kids, have them wrap the tape around the palm of your hand and trick them into thinking they’re in competition to accumulate the most pet hair on their sticky tape. In no time, you could have larger rugs and carpets looking significantly less hairy than before! Dampen Your Carpet or Rug An underrated hair-removal tricks is that of moistening your rug and then sweeping the pet hair into damp clumps, prior to getting at them with the vacuum cleaner. Dampening the hair makes it a lot easier to sweep it into a pile. This can make larger sections of carpet much more manageable to deal with - just be careful to not overdo the water usage. Carpet doesn't dry quickly, without assistance, and wet carpet will lead to smells, mold & even mildew. Slightly damp is all you need to kick this trick into gear – and get rid of that hair! If you’re still feeling out of your depth, a professional carpet cleaning team have the skills, experience and equipment to bring your carpets and rugs back to life. Choose a dry-cleaning company as they use a process with minimal moisture compared to steam cleaning, meaning you’ll be able to get back on your carpets within an hour."

Scientists report that people who pet their cats experience an increase in Theta waves, a brain wave pattern that decreases your feelings of anxiety. Petting your cat, even for a few minutes, releases a healthy dose of positive ""feel good"" hormones such as Dopamine, Oxytocin, Prolactin, and Seratonin. The good feelings work both ways and benefits your cat as well. Their soft fur, gentle vibrations, and happy purr will melt your stress away. When there is a lot of static electricity in your home, you could cause mini shocks to your cat. If this happens try massaging them instead. Cats like occasional solitude. They don't need to stick to you like glue 24/7. Spending time alone is underrated, yet it is vital to recharge. Treat yourself to five minutes of solitude every day. If your cat joins you, that's good, but no phones or other human distractions. A cats' tail is a mood barometer. Loosely upright while walking signals confidence. A tail that flicks toward you means ""Hello, my friend."" Whipping the tail from side to side or thumping it on the floor signifies agitation. A lightly twitching tail conveys relaxed alertness while a puffed up tail indicates total freight. Schedule regular play sessions with your cat. Kittens, and young at heart cats, are most active at dawn and dusk. They are wired genetically to do their best hunting and play stalking during those times of the day. Buy some Peacock feathers and tie them to a flexible pole, then get your cats' attention. Feathers are usually too much temptation to resist. Your kitty will soon be running, jumping, and performing acrobatics to catch those feathers. Give your kitty a weekly hands on petting session. Scrutinize their entire body looking for lumps, bumps, sore spots, or changes in fur or skin. The more often you do this you will learn a lot about your cats' health. Make sure you check their eyes, ears, and mouth. In this way you will get to know your cat and will be able to catch a problem early. Your cat has been your side kick since kittenhood so how about a daily dose of pampering? An easy way to do this is warm up a small blanket in the clothes dryer for 5 to 10 minutes, then drape it over your cat during chilly nights. You can do the same for an arthritic cat to help improve their blood flow and ease muscle aches. There are also heated bed products on the market that you can purchase. For success in the litter box, fill the box to a depth of three inches. Don't use perfumed litter (most cats hate flowery scents). Clean out the box every day and wash the box once a month with warm, soapy water, letting it dry completely. Never place the box near their food or water bowls, kitties do not like to eat by their bathroom spot. Sprinkle a teaspoon of Kelp Powder on your cats' food. Or try a standardized capsule of Lecithin mixed with their food. Both help speed up your cats' metabolism and break down fats. Your cat is a carnivore and therefore fares best when real meat tops the ingredients in their food bowl. Select brands of cat food that list real protein such as turkey, chicken, or lamb as the first ingredient. Avoid brands that list cornmeal or other grains first. By adding a splash of tuna juice or salt-free chicken broth to their dry food will give your feline a saucy feast. Your cat may spend extra time savoring these special extras and delightful aromas during their post meal grooming. If you happen to be a yogurt lover, give some to your cat. A tablespoon of plain low-fat yogurt once a day provides calcium, a dose of ""good"" bacteria and some extra liquid (yogurt is mostly water). Lastly, put your cats' bed near a source of warmth. Near a sunny window or by the fireplace or next to a heat vent. Spend some time with your snoozing friend and pamper yourself with quiet time as well. It's good for the soul!"

At the same time, when looking for the best dog food brand for your pet, you should know that Meals For Mutts is a great option! At first, you might not be too happy about needing to buy toys for your bird.

All pets need to be stimulated, especially birds, which are quite smart. There are a few important reasons why you should consider investing in Bird Toys.

Most pet owners opt for this solution when they want to make sure that their birds do not fly away or go potty all over their belongings. Yes, it can be a good option, but only if you take the time to interact with them every single day and offer them an alternative when you are not around. Another important reason why you should consider opting for the right toys would be the fact that birds can get depressed. If you keep them locked up and they do not have anything nearby to keep them stimulated, they will start behaving aggressively towards their owners and themselves. They might try to damage their cage, hurt you when you get too close to them and even pluck their own feathers. The good news is that all of these unwanted scenarios can be easily avoided. The best part about it is that you do not have to spend a fortune on toys. Simply pick a few, two or three that you switch every week so that your bird does not get bored.

9,"Getting ""Catitude"" with Feline Facts",pets," Live with ""Catitude"" and you and your cat will live together more peacefully. Part of ""Catitude"" is understanding that you can solve some of the things that bother cat people and their cats. For example: Guaranteeing your house never smells like cat. Two simple ways to prevent litter box odors other than cleaning them every day, is to sprinkle baking soda in the box when you clean it or adding some litter. Baking soda is not toxic to cats and it will help keep odors at bay. Another good idea is to try odor removing crystals. This odorless, eco-friendly product comes in sachets of volcanic zeolite formed into crystals. Simply hang the sachet near your litter box. Also remember kitties don't like dirty boxes so clean often. Another question often asked is ""Should I serve wet food or dry""? The main difference between the two is water content. Canned food has more water. Owners often feed dry food thinking it will help keep kittys' teeth clean. That is not necessarily true as cats don't often chew their food. They tear, shred, or swallow it whole. Although Vets question the dental benefits of dry food, most agree cats are healthier when they drink more water. The water in the wet food can help prevent urinary tract disease and help reduce the work load of the kidneys. The reason wet food isn't a slam dunk over dry? Studies show a positive link to wet food and thyroid gland problems. So the bottom line is wet food and dry food are pretty equal for dental disease, wet food is better for urinary health, and dry food for thyroid health. You could try feeding them a small amount of wet food morning and evening and free feed their dry food. They seem to regulate their food intake on their own and you won't be bothered by a hungry kitty at all hours. Sometimes owners think they have a finicky cat. They might not be. If they suddenly refuse to eat the dry food they have always liked, and prefer the wet food maybe it's a health problem. It could be your pet has sore teeth or another dental problem. Some signs would be pawing at their mouth, turning their head to one side as they eat to avoid chewing on the painful side, or refusing to eat. If your cat starts drooling or has loose teeth take them to your Vet. Ruining your furniture can ruin even the best of relationships. Their are ways to solve this problem. First: make their favorite spot undesirable. Apply double sided sticky tape to the area or drape it with fabrics they don't like to scratch. Next: try directing them to a stable scratching post placed in front of the blocked area. If your cat is a carpet shredder, use a horizontal scratcher too. Finally: when you catch them using the post, praise them or a kitty treat can't hurt. Kitties and hairballs go hand-in-hand. No-one likes cleaning up hairballs but you can help prevent them. Hairballs are simply fur trapped in their intestines from grooming with their sandpaper tongues. Cats are avid groomers so they swallow the hairs and they end up in the stomach. To keep the hairballs from forming, brush your cat often to prevent them from ingesting the loose fur. If your kitty still seems to have a lot of hairballs check with your Vet to avoid a possible problem. Understanding these simple facts about your pet will increase your ""Catitude"". You and your cat will be more comfortable and happier together."

11,The Perfect City for Pets and People,pets," Like most dog lovers, I try to take my dogs with me everywhere I go. Running errands, walks, road trips, dining, and work. Ok, maybe not the last one but that’s not my choice. When I moved here in 2015, I was surprised to find what a dog friendly town Savannah, GA is. The number of places my dogs are welcomed is amazing! With its rich history, squares, cemeteries, shops, restaurants, and walkability there is an abundance of things to see and do in Savannah. Whether strolling along the river or walking the historic streets, my Dachshunds, Trixie and Mickey, like nothing better than getting around Savannah, taking in new scents and making friends with people and pups. Between the squares, 22 in total and Forsyth Park, there is no shortage of places to let Trixie and Mickey exercise, play in fountains, or lay in the grass enjoying the day, one of our favorite activities. There are also two great dog parks, one within downtown limits and another just a short drive over to Daffin Park. The dog park at Daffin is divided into a section for smaller dogs and one for larger dogs. There is also a mile and a half walking circuit around the perimeter of the park and lots of area in between to exercise your dogs. It’s not just the squares and parks, either. There is always something do to with dogs in Savannah. In May, the Humane Society of Greater Savannah hosts a Dog Carnival, a fun event for humans and canines. Events includes dog races, a ball pit, photo opportunities, food trucks, and vendors from all over the area, with all proceeds benefiting the Humane Society. Each October brings two more big dog events, Oktoberfest, which includes Dachshund, or WIENER DOG, races among other events, and Wag-o-Ween. Wag-o-Ween takes place the weekend before Halloween and is exactly what it sounds like, trick or treating for dogs. Instead of humans dressing in costume, owners dress their dogs in costumes and visit local participating business for trick or treating, raffles, a costume contest and lots of fun. The best part is proceeds go to local area pet rescue organizations. We also enjoy taking in the historical cemeteries, especially Colonial Cemetery, which is in the heart of downtown and Bonaventure Cemetery, a few miles east from downtown. Colonial is a much smaller cemetery compared to Bonaventure, but both are pet friendly and provide a fascinating glimpse into Savannah’s past. Bonaventure sits on a bluff overlooking the Wilmington River, a beautiful spot to enjoy the view and surroundings. Among Savannah’s offerings is the variety of restaurants and coffee shops. I have yet to come across one with outdoor seating that doesn’t welcome dog patrons. Several of the coffee shops downtown have dog treats from the local Woof Gang Bakery and some restaurants even have ""doggie dishes"", food especially prepared for dogs. It’s a nice treat for the canine family members, enjoying another meal together. Last on the list should be a stop at one of the five Woof Gang Bakery locations in the downtown area. This is truly a jackpot for dogs and yours will think he’s gone to heaven. Woof Gang Bakery specializes in treats, foods, accessories, and everything your dog could possibly want or need, plus a few things for you too! Each shop has a few different product lines, so you may find yourself stopping in more than one. If anyone is looking to take a vacation with their dogs, Savannah, Georgia is the perfect spot. We look forward to seeing you and your pups around town."
12,Communicating With Your Cat Fun Feline Facts,pets," If you are a cat person understanding your cat is important to you. People bond to their pets and, although they can't talk, we can communicate with them. If your cat licks you, it is a sign of affection. He or she is saying they feel totally safe around you and they consider you a family member. They are reinforcing these feelings by cleaning you as their mothers did when they were kittens. Another way to communicate is for you to understand ""Tail Talk"". When you learn this communication tool you will be able to tell what your cat is feeling at a glance. A happy feline holds their tail high and walks with confidence. If your cat is annoyed they will twitch the end of their tail. When the tail is lashing back and forth watch out. This means they are throughly ticked off and are about to attack you. Your cat is trying to say ""I'm angry leave me alone"". It is wise to never pull your cats tail, it can cause permanent damage. Pulling on the tail can over stretch or tear nerves and can cause temporary (or permanent) inability to walk or chronic pain. Your cat needs their tail for balance. When walking on narrow surfaces, such as a fence, it acts as a counterweight. Owners have always asked ""Does my cat love me?"" They send you signs of their love in subtle ways. If your feline looks at you and slowly blinks their eyes, it is their way of showing you some love and blowing you a kiss. Your cat would love it if you say ""I love you too"". By slowly blinking your eyes back at them is a way of telling them that you love them too. Pet owners often falsely think cats are very independent and don't mind being alone. Felines are very social animals and can form a strong bond with their humans. Your cat could be so attached to you that being away from you will cause separation anxiety. It will trigger extreme nervousness and troubling behavior. Scratching doors or window frames is their way of soothing themselves. Some signs to look for are over grooming, refusing to eat, or using excessive vocalization when you leave. You can help soothe your cat by giving them plenty of toys, cat trees, and window perches. Windows are ""Kitty TV"" for them and keeps them entertained. This might ease the anxiety of your leaving. Some owners leave a TV on so the kitty can listen to human voices to break the silence of your home. There is an age old question ""Are cats smarter than dogs?"" Cat owners will say yes. Cats have 300 million neurons in the area of the brain that is associated with intelligence, processing, planning and more. Dogs only have 160 million neurons in the same area. As to learning, cats and dogs are about equal. Cats can vocalize more than dogs as they have many more tones to their ""speech"". Dogs have much better noses and can follow a scent for miles."
13,Important Things To Consider When Choosing A Pet Bed,pets," Weigh Then Measure Your Pet While Sleeping First pay attention to how your pet sleeps. If your pet sleeps stretched out, measure them from nose to tail. Add about 8 to 12 inches to determine the size of pet bed you will need. This is to accommodate your full-grown pet, if your pet is still a baby then you will need to add extra space to allow for growing. Also, you can add additional blankets, sheets, or pillows to a larger bed while your pet is still a baby. If you have a larger, heavier pet the thicker the cushion will need to be. This will help prevent cushion squash, which could be just like your pet sleeping on the bare floor. Special Needs and Important Features If your pet is older they may need to have an orthopedic bed to help ease their pain. Orthopedic beds are made of high density memory foam to help conform to your pet's shape and help offer comfort from sore joints or arthritis. You many want to choose a heated bed for pets that are prone to being chilly or are short haired or you live in a cold climate. If your pet likes to feel more secure, then choose a more cave-like bed where they will feel safe. This will be a good idea if your pet likes to hide to go to sleep, or goes under furniture to sleep. There are many shapes and sizes of these special beds. Look At Washing or Maintenance Instructions First It is most important to be sure to check if the bed for your pet will be easy to clean. Let's face it, our pets are not always tidy creatures, so it is much easier and less expensive to purchase a bed that you can just toss into the washer and/or dryer. Beds do need to be cleaned every week or two, to help with odors and dirt. Cleaning can also help with fleas. I found washing pet beds in baking soda and vinegar is the best for removing odors in the wash. What Style or Color Should You Choose Look at what best fits your decor in your home. Pet beds have come a long way, and there are as many different styles of pet beds as people furniture. Once you have conquered choosing the right size, then the options are unlimited, you can choose to match your decor for color and style, or go a completely a different route. Make it a fun choice, all of my pets have specific colors and all their bedding is in that color family. How Much To Spend An estimated 17.8 Billion (yes, BILLION) dollars will be spent in the year 2018 on various products for pets. We as owners want our pets to have the absolute best of everything, but it is easy to go overboard (as I often do) with purchasing a pet bed. Try to have a budget in mind before looking at pet beds and stick to it. Remember that this will likely not be a one time purchase, since beds will need to be replaced for wear and tear."
14,Dealing With Swollen Dog Paws: Treatment & Prevention with MyPamperedPup,pets," Dealing With Swollen Dog Paws: Treatment & Prevention with MyPamperedPup Understanding how to spot swollen dog paws... There are a number of different factors that can cause a dog's paws to become swollen, sore or irritable. Dogs who have swollen paws may start limping, favouring a particular leg or hobbling around. Spotting these signs is key in quickly establishing the cause of the problem and dealing with it quickly so it doesn't get any worse! Checking your dogs paws for the cause of the irritation... If you notice that your dog has any strange symptoms, like those we've described above, then it's time to have a thorough check over the paws and investigate exactly what the cause might be! Check the top and underside of each paw pad and note any swelling. Inspect carefully for signs that could be causing swelling or irritation. Foreign objects are usually the primary cause as they can easily become trapped between toes & paw pads. Foreign objects can easy to spot depending on the size of the object but they can also be elusive so it's important to carefully check each individual paw pad closely. Other causes of paw swelling which are more difficult to spot could insect bites and stings, broken toes & nails or even wounds. During the hot summer months, paw burns from hot pavements are a real issue as the burnt skin causes pain, irritation & swelling. ​ Treating the cause of the swelling & soothing irritated paws... Once you've found the cause of the swelling, it's important to treat it in the most careful and appropriate way. Foreign Objects Depending on the size of the object and the way it's embedded, you can carefully remove it with a pair of tweezers before gently cleaning any wounded areas thoroughly to avoid the risk of infection. Soapy water works great. Keep an eye on the area and check that any swelling subsides with the object removed - if not, seek the advice of your vet. Insect Bites & Stings (... & nothing visibly obvious) More often than not insect bites & stings don't visibly stand out but it's important that you still work to soothe the irritation and swelling. If you can't see anything obviously causing the issue, even after a close, thorough inspection, an effective treatment is to carefully wash and paws with warm, soapy water before soaking them in Epsom Salts dissolved in warm water. Using Epsom Salts to treat swollen and inflamed paws couldn't be simpler - use around a handful of salt per 4.5 litres of warm water. Clean the paws carefully before soaking them for around 10 minutes, up to 4 times a day. This should relieve irritation & itchiness. It's important to not let your dog drink the salt water as this can lead to diarrhoea. Summer Burns During the hot summer months, burns from hot pavements are a very real possibility. We talk a lot about the issues of understanding how hot the ground can become in the height of summer - burned paws are can be incredibly painful yet are entirely preventable by checking the ground first to ensure it's comfortable for your dog to walk on. Wounds, Sores & Prolonged Swelling If you happen to spot an open wound or lesion, the swelling remains even after you'd soothed & treated, or the dog starts preferring another leg; it's time to call your vet for advice and seek their expert attention. It's important that if there is an obvious open wound to seek expert attention as soon as you can so that it can be properly treated! Prevention & ongoing care with 'Soft Paws' Soft Paws paw balm is the ideal soothing, moisturising treatment for paws that are dry, cracked, damaged or swollen. The organic, natural ingredients that make up our paw balm lock-in moisture and deliver essential, healing oils deep into the cells to soothe against the cause of the irritation and swelling. We've handcrafted Soft Paws to contain ingredients which are proven to make a real difference to a dogs health. Coconut oil is an amazing soother for dry, itchy paw pad skin and is known for reducing the effects of allergic reactions such as those that cause paw swelling. We also use healing vitamin E oil which is carrier deeply into the paw by the plant oils and allows the cells to absorb nutrients. Vitamin E oil helps with canine dermatitis and sores, particularly on the delicate, sensitive skin of paw pads. The natural peppermint oil in Soft Paws paw balm is a proven antiseptic meaning it helps to protect from infection which can enter through sores, cracks & damage. This wonder oil is also a fantastic insect repellent so keeps away ticks and fleas from already irritated paws. The wonder element of Soft Paws has to be Neem oil. Now, you might never have heard of it - but listen up! Neem oil is a powerful antifungal, antibacterial, antiseptic & anti-inflammatory - we've chosen Neem as it protects and heals swollen, irritated pads!"
15,How stress can affect your dog's sleep and health,pets," Just like us, dogs can get too stressed for a good night’s sleep, according to recent research by European scientists. A study into canine anxiety revealed that negative experiences can adversely impact your pet’s ability to relax — but what does this mean for you and your pet? Rest is vital for mental, emotional and physical wellbeing, we’ve looked further into the findings of this interesting study, as well as how you can ensure your dog is happy and stress-free when they head to bed. In 2017, a canine study showed that anxiety affects the quality of a dog’s sleep — much like a bad day at work can affect ours. Researchers monitoring the test discovered that negative actions caused the participating dogs to have a fitful sleep that they awoke quickly from, while the pooches that enjoyed more positive experiences managed an hour of deep, consistent napping. So, how did researchers fairly examine the impact of anxiety on dogs? To test the effect of stress on canine sleep, some of the dogs received ‘positive’ experiences before sleeping, while the others endured ‘negative’ experiences prior to resting (all dogs were subjected to both types of experiences). After monitoring the sleeping brainwaves of the canines, researchers came to the conclusion that anxiety plays a part in the ability of a dog to relax and rest. This study took place over three hours and involved a mix of 16 dogs, including a Labrador Retriever and boxer (among several other breeds). One of the main challenges of the experiment was to determine what a ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ experience was to a dog. Scientists decided that the ‘positive’ factors would include petting, attention and playing games, while ‘negative’ factors would involve isolation from their owners and being approached menacingly. Typically, dogs that received a ‘good’ experience managed around an hour of deep, non-REM sleep. Conversely, ‘bad’ experiences caused the dogs to have only around 40-50 minutes of non-REM sleep. But what is REM (rapid eye movement) sleep and why is it important? REM sleep is the more active, lighter resting stage consisting of increased heart rate and quicker breathing, while non-REM is a deeper sleeping stage that provides optimum rest and more regular breathing and heart rates. Although REM sleep takes up around 20%-25% of overall sleep time in adult humans, it’s important that we achieve the non-REM stage in order to get what we’d refer to as a ‘decent night’s sleep’, free of tossing and turning. ""We found dogs get less deep sleep after a negative experience. It suggests that, just like humans have a bad night’s sleep after a difficult day, dogs may have a similar problem,"" commented Dr. Anna Kis, the study’s research leader. Were there any other interesting findings as a result of this study? Although it may seem odd, researchers found that dogs that had received negative experiences actually feel asleep quicker than the dogs that enjoyed a nicer pre-sleep experience. Dr. Kis, explained: ""In humans, stress causes difficulty falling asleep, whereas dogs fall asleep more quickly — we think as a protective measure to remove themselves from the stressful environment."" Non-REM sleep is crucial to receiving adequate rest for a healthy body and mind, and this study highlights how negative experiences can adversely affect a dog’s wellbeing. It’s clear from this 2017 study that ensuring your dog is stress-free can help them enjoy better sleep, which may lead to improved, all-round health. But how do we know when our pets are anxious? Here are a few typical indicators that your dog is feeling the strain and that you may need to intervene: •	Barking. •	Panting. •	Destructive behaviour. •	Yawning. •	Lethargy. •	Licking their nose. •	Excessive shedding/moulting. You might be asking: why is sleep so important for dogs that don’t have the responsibility of a family or job to consider? Consistently poor sleep could stop your dog ‘consolidating memories’ and ‘dealing with their emotions’, making them more aggressive, according to Dr. Kis. In agreement is senior vice-president of the British Veterinary Association, Gudrun Ravetz, who said: ""We know that positive interactions with our pets are important for their overall health and welfare."" But try not to worry, even if your dog is stressed, there are ways to help them — even something as simple as switching to natural dog food can improve their general health and help better their mental state. So, what do you do if you have fears that your dog is stressed? To help make your dog happier and less anxious, you can try one or all of the following. Ensure they get enough exercise every day: Dogs need a decent amount of exercise every day to help avoid built-up energy and keep them fit and healthy. If your dog is stressed, extend your walk time by 10 or 15 minutes, or head into the garden once a day to play fetch. Swimming is a great way to tire out your anxious pooch and an excellent stress booster — granted that your dog enjoys water. Help them stay sociable: Most of us have busy lives that keep us out of the house for long periods, but you need to make sure that your dog isn’t left alone for too long during the day. While some dogs handle being alone better than others, some suffer from separation anxiety. If you can, book them into a doggy day care centre or ask if a family member or friend can dog-sit for an hour or two to break up their day. Implement a secure routine: A routine will help your dog feel secure, and it will be a huge comfort to them to know roughly when you get home, when they’re usually fed and when they often go to bed. Try to make each day similar. Of course, this isn’t always possible, but maintaining consistency helps keep your dog from worrying. Improve their diets: What your dog eats can also affect their fitness. Try a new dog food with better nutritional value (after checking with your dog’s vet) or cut out the human treats, which can be harmful to canines. Stress is evidently something to watch out for as a pet owner. However, being vigilant and introducing the above stress-reducing methods can help ensure your dog gets a good night’s sleep every night."
16,Puppy Training Tips: How to Set Your New Puppy Up for Success,pets," Bringing a new puppy home is one of the most exciting things in the world. And when it goes smoothly, it’s a wonderful experience. However, amongst this joy, it’s also very easy for things to go pear-shaped quickly if you don’t know what you’re doing. Especially if you’re a first-time puppy parent. I believe it’s so important that dog owners are given the tools, resources, and puppy training tips that are essential for setting a new puppy up for success. Probably the first decision you’ll make about your new puppy is whether or not you want to look at getting a little crate for your puppy, a pen, or both. A perfect-sized crate is usually not going to be much bigger than your puppy for sleeping, but bear in mind the puppy is going to grow. It’s important that your puppy is able to stretch out in the crate. However, you don’t want to give him too much room to explore. The idea is not that the puppy runs around in the crate; instead, it contains the puppy and lets him fall asleep because he can’t run around. Many cages come with internal walls that allow you to change the size of the cage as the puppy grows. This is very helpful so you don’t have to keep buying crates! Put a comfy blanket in the crate, and your puppy will learn to love the crate as his safe place. Now, you may choose to get a pen as well, which is usually about 6-feet-high and 6 feet by 6 feet in width. The idea is that this is where the puppy can wake up, get out of his crate and play…even if you’re not watching him. Your puppy will be safe in the pen and will be all set up if you put a little potty pad and some have some toys in there to play with. Using a crate and pen together are very helpful in toilet training. Both keep your puppy contained and relaxed, which makes it easy to pick your puppy up out of the crate or pen where he is and take him outside to the potty area on a routine basis. So, that’s one huge advantage of using a crate and a pen, and generally the puppies love them. The other advantage is that, in terms of money, the crate and the pen usually hold their value. If you buy them secondhand you can usually sell them for the same price later on. You only need to use them for about six months. Deciding where your puppy sleeps can be tricky because a lot of it depends on how independent and confident your little puppy is. If you think of it almost like a child or a young baby, some babies need to be in the room with you for the first few weeks or months, and some puppies do as well. They’re much more relaxed if the crate is in your bedroom because they know you are close by. However, you can always have the crate in your bedroom and then move the crate during the day so they can be with you, or have a second crate in another room. Bear that in mind. Some puppies will need to be in your bedroom for sleeping, but you can still set the main area up with the pen, in a room where you spend most of your time during the day. Important note: Make sure you’re not putting the puppy in an area where there’s a large draft or where he’s going to be in a hot direct sunshine. You need to make sure that the temperature is going to be maintained. It’s also important to make sure that you set the pen or crate up on an area or surface that you can clean very easily. It’s best not to have them on a carpet. Put them on a wooden floor, tile floor, marble floor, concrete floor, or something like that. Or think about putting a plastic sheet underneath and, fingers crossed, the puppy doesn’t start chewing it. If your puppy is on a carpeted area, and he starts peeing on it, it’s very tricky to stop that. The second thing to think about is safety. You want to keep your puppy away from any sort of electric cables and any staircases if you’ve got a very small house. You do not want to give your puppy access to the whole house. Just one room is absolutely fine. Having your puppy in one room allows you to start this whole process of just peering down to the other end of the house to check on your pup. When you come in, your puppy realizes it’s not the end of the world that you’ve been gone. The other main reason for not giving your puppy access to the whole house is, if you do, I guarantee you he’ll travel down to the far end of the house, sneak behind a piece of furniture, and go potty there. Puppies are very sneaky little critters. Okay, that brings us to puppy potty training. Now, with potty training, there’s not one correct way of training your puppy. There are many different options, and the way you train your puppy often depends on what kind of home you live in. If you’ve got a large garden that’s easy to access, it might be realistic to set a schedule and take your puppy outside every day at the same times. However, if there are lots of steps down to your garden and you want to use potty pads, there’s nothing wrong with that. As your puppy gets older, he’ll be able to hold his bladder longer, and you can make the transition to using the bathroom outdoors. One thing I would suggest though, regardless of what training approach you take, is to roll up any thick chunky pile carpets, valuable carpets, or any other rugs on your floor that your puppy would be tempted to use as a restroom. Once the puppy starts peeing on a carpet, it is incredibly difficult to get that stain out of the rug and to break the habit. So, I’ve warned you…roll them up, and you can put them back down in six months when your puppy is trained. The other thing with toilet training is to make sure that the outside area where your puppy is going toilet is very safe. What I’m talking about is when you take your puppy outside, make sure he can’t get into the house or escape through a fence. And you will even want to check to be sure there’s not rat bait or anything like that on the ground that your puppy can get into. A lot of ensuring your puppy stays calm and happy comes down to making sure you spend time with him to make sure that he is comfortable. We’ve talked about making sure your puppy is warm enough and not too hot and that he has a nice cozy blanket to lie on. You may also want to look at having a variety of dog toys that he can chew because it’s the different textures of toys, which will really stimulate the puppy’s mind. You don’t want to have all of the puppy’s toys being made of the same product, such as plastic. You want plastic rope, maybe a toy made with natural fibers in there, and a soft, fluffy toy that your pup can really sink his baby teeth into. And of course, remember to always leave water down for your dog. Make sure your puppy has all of these things, and it will be easier for him to stay happy and relaxed. The last thing I want to talk about is an important training tip that is especially important for puppies. The tip is basically to let sleeping dogs lie, and there are three reasons why I have this rule. The first reason is that puppies will get very tired. They’re going to be so stimulated by every new thing they encounter, and it’s very easy for them to become overtired and exhausted. Much like a newborn child, it’s important to not ""wake your baby."" He needs rest…and lots of it! If you keep bothering your puppy when he’s in his little bed trying to relax and switch off, it’s easy for him to become tired and grumpy. So, if your puppy goes to bed, leave him there. If you need to take him out for the bathroom, by all means go and pick him up and take him straight out. That’s the one exception. The second reason is that it’s very easy for little puppies to be scared by young children. If you put the puppy into his bed and you explain to the children that when their puppy is in the bed, you must leave him alone, this will help your puppy feel more safe and secure. Then, your puppy will learn to love that little area—whether it be a crate or a pen— as his little safety space. One little tip you may try with the pen or the crate is to put a little blanket over the top because then it feels more like a little den to your puppy. It will make it feel much safer. Puppies don’t really like being out in the open and neither do dogs. That’s why many dogs like to go under a table or under a bed…it feels more like a den. The third reason is, if your puppy knows that he is safe in his bed, he’s going to learn to love his bed. This is a very important thing for your dog to learn to like…especially if you plan on crate training your dog. Al right. I hope all of this information helps! Cheers and have a great day!"
17,Recall Training: How to Get a Dog to Come When You Call,pets," There’s nothing scarier than watching your dog run off across the beach, down the street, or through the woods while you helplessly call for him to come back to you without any luck. It only takes seconds, for a dog to vanish before your eyes—all because your dog is excited and decided to chase a squirrel or heard another dog in the distance and wanted to check it out. What might seem like fun adventure to your dog quickly turns into panic and overwhelm for you. You may start thinking to yourself,""What if she gets lost and can’t find her way back?"" Or, ""What if my dog get’s hit by a car?"" As a dog parent, I know this feeling all too well. Which is exactly why I stress the importance of recall training—how to get a dog to come when you call Not only can recall training save your dog’s life, but it can also keep other people and dogs safe in the event that your dog takes off after a person or other animal. So, here’s the million dollar question… ""How do you get your dog to come every time your call her?"" Keep reading and you’ll find out… Dogs and puppies not coming when we call them can be one of the most frustrating things! We ask nicely, we call them, we shout and scream… We even begin to wonder if our dog or puppy has a hearing problem! Even worse is when they’re running wild at the park and we have an audience watching us…so embarrassing! Let’s face it, most dogs only come when they want to. You know, when it’s dinner time, when they want a pat or when there’s nothing else going on! So what can you do to train your dog to come when called? Here’s 7 recall training secrets that will help you out… a. Tasty treats Yes I know, we all hate bribery… but trust me on this one thing. If there is ever a time to use food to train your dog, then it’s when we’re developing the recall command. I’m actually not a fan of using food when it comes to stopping behavioral issues, but this is different. This is asking our dog to do something as fast as they can and we need to reward (or pay) them so that they do it. Think of the food as payment… After all, would you keep going to work if they stopped paying you? So, when you ask your dog to stop playing with their best friend and come running–all the way back to you down the beach–they need more than just a pat! Making sense? Of course later on we can fade out the food, but for starters it’s ok to use treats. b. Keep control One of the most common questions I get asked is what do we do when our dog is running away and won’t come back? And the answer is simple… There is not a lot you can do. It’s the same as when a horse has bolted out the stable and is galloping off. They are out of control! You see there are really only two ways to get our dogs to come to us… The first way is when we still have physical control of them–so, they’re on a leash or a long line and we can get them to come to us with a bit of encouragement. The second is that we have a verbal recall, in other words when we call them they listen and choose to come running! So, if we don’t have a good recall we first need to consider option one by purchasing a line to attach them to. The safest way is to attach the line to a clip on the back of a dog harness. If it’s just on a dog’s collar and you stop your dog abruptly you can injure your dog, so a word of warning there. That said. This line will give you the opportunity to keep control and then train the recall – it’s a game changer! Remember, without control and no recall, our dogs are by definition ""Out of control."" Don’t let that happen. c. Set your dog up to win Okay, this is a very subtle concept, yet hugely powerful. Let me first describe a typical scenario that occurs with a lot of dogs… As soon as your dog is let off leash he runs off, happy as can be. He has heaps of energy and runs away fast. Often your dog may pick up on a smell or see another dog and go visit. You, knowing that your dog has recall issues, starts to panic and you want to keep your dog under control so you make the decision to immediately try and call your dog back closer. But, your dog is so full of energy and delight at being free that the chance of him coming is next to zero. So why did you call the dog? Was the dog doing anything wrong? No. Was the dog going to run off into the sunset? No. Was there any danger? No. Is the reason our dogs are off leash so they can run, sniff and play? Yes. Was the dog going to have a sniff or a quick play and then follow you? Yes! In this case, we’re much better off waiting until our dogs have had a quick run around and are coming towards us before calling them. One they’ve had a bit of freedom, then you can crouch down, give him a treat and let him go. This is the concept of ""Setting the dog up to win."" We need to let our dogs have fun and call them only when we know they are going to come. Less is actually more. So only call your dog a few times. That keeps it special. If your dog is totally focussed on something such as another dog, try just giving him a bit more time or maybe move closer to him or go and get him calmly. Remember good dog trainers never call the dog when they know they aren’t going to come! d.  Give one clear, constant command Let me ask you a question… How many different names, phrases, or voices do you use when you call your dog? Come on, be honest! Most people have a whole selection of commands. Some when the dog is in trouble, some when there is a treat coming. And the truth is that all these different words, terms, and tones of voice just add to our dog’s confusion. We really just want one word or phrase that we use every time we ask a dog to come and we want it to be in the same consistent tone. This word or phrase should mean ""Come here and I’ll put food in your mouth and then I’ll let you go and play again"". The more phrases, voices and sounds we use the more inconsistent it is for our dog or puppy. I know it’s not always easy, but staying calm and using a consistent command, even when our dog isn’t coming, is crucial if we want him to come. And whatever we do, don’t tell them off when they finally arrive, just clip the leash on and ignore them. It’s so easy to instantly ruin a great recall when we scold them angrily when they finally do come. It becomes a vicious circle and the next time we call them they’re even less likely to come. So remember: That one clear command needs to mean ""Come here and I’ll put food in your mouth and then I’ll let you go and play again!"" e. Use the (Huge) power of random rewards Why do people play the lottery? To maybe win ten bucks? No…of course not. Everyone’s playing to win the ten million dollars. We want to win huge and that’s what gets us hooked and coming back for more. And guess what… It’s the same with our dogs! If they never know when they’re going to win next, or what they’re going to win, they’ll keep playing. So, it’s random rewards that work so much better than just using the same food every time. There’s a huge difference in performance between a dog who knows the reward is just a dry biscuit at best (probably the same dry biscuits they ate for breakfast) and a dog who thinks they may get a piece of that yummy sausage, a morsel of cheese, or their favorite treat. Just like humans… I know what I’d do for one million dollars compared to what I’d do for a single dollar. And, just remember, the key is to keep our dogs guessing. They shouldn’t know which of the treats they are going to get. That’s the random bit! Now, one simple way to do that is to have all the treats in a little bag or pocket and only bring the treat out once your dog has arrived. That way they can’t see what the random reward will be. And sometimes give your dog more than 1 little piece (Yep, small pieces is better) and sometimes give your dog 5 little pieces of different treats in a row. That’s random. The day you take half a chopped up sausage, a little piece of cheese and some other yummy treat you will see what I mean. You won’t be able to get your dog to leave your side! One sure way to win your dog or puppy’s heart is through their belly! f. Increasing the motivation Now this secret to success is understanding how to increase your dog’s motivation and drive to work for you. Very simply… a hungry dog will work for food. A dog who is full will generally lose interest. So, try taking your dog for a walk before you feed him. This way they’re hungry and far more motivated by the treats. Over time, you’ll start to realise that you actually have breakfast in your pouch and they have to ""work"" for it. It becomes a game 🙂 And most dogs love running and eating so it should be fun! It’s actually much better for a dog to eat meals after any vigorous exercise for the same reason it’s not good for humans to exercise straight after a large meal. g. Consider the use of a professional dog whistle Have you ever wondered why so many farmers use dog whistles? And why more and more professional dog trainers are starting to use them? The answer is simply because they’re easy to use and they work! In fact, they’re one of the most useful tools when used correctly. Here’s why: The whistle has a constant sound. It doesn’t matter if you’re a bit frustrated with your dog or in a rush or upset, when you blow it the sound that emanates is constant. And your dog responds to that neutral sound very well. Whistles are easy to use. A professional dog whistle is very easy to blow (be careful of the metal ones when it’s really cold though as I’ve had them stick to my lips). The sound of a whistle travels a long way, a lot farther than you can shout. Voices don’t travel that well, especially if you have a quiet voice. The whistle that I use can travel up to 500 feet and it’s gentle on your vocal chords! Easy to hear. Good dog whistles operate at a high frequency. This means that they can pick up the sound easily and it’s appealing to them, but not at all harsh on the human ear. The high pitch also cuts through all the background noise such as other people shouting, wind, trees and bushes because it’s such a unique sound. Using a whistle saves your voice. You never need to shout or raise your voice in front of people ever again. Fresh start. For many people the quickest way to develop a great recall is to start again with a fresh sound. The whistle gives us this chance. Recall training is all about getting your dog to return to your side on command. And in theory it’s so simple. You call your dog and they come running towards you wagging their tail. Yet in reality so many people struggle with this. Unfortunately it results in dogs being walked only on by leash their entire lives, or worse still, they aren’t walked at all for fear of them never coming back. We all love it when our dog comes first time (I call this the recall) but it doesn’t always happen that way and it doesn’t happen overnight. To develop an amazing recall where you can call your dog from extremely long distances, or off a high speed chase takes time, a strong bond and a dog that really listens and does what you say even though sometimes they would rather do something different. I am proud to say that I have called my dog off a high speed chase when she caught sight of a bunny and bolted. On my call she stopped, turned and came straight to me. And as you can see in the video below, I’ve called my dogs from the neighbors yard. This is something to aim for and with everything, practice makes perfect! It might look easy, but this type of recall training took some work—even for me as a dog trainer. This type of command training simply doesn’t happen overnight. So, while you’re working with your own dog, here’s a few things I want you to think about while working with your dog… What your praise is worth? You decide the value of your own affection, pats, cuddles and praise. Does your dog just get it for free? Make everything on your terms. Never give your dog a pat, cuddle or affection on its terms or you are making it worthless in your dog’s eyes. Recall training starts at home. Calling your dog around the house is the start of the recall. Call your dog once. Never call your dog lots of times. Make sure that your dog has heard, then treat or ignore. Encourage. You can encourage your dog to keep coming by saying the words, ""good girl, good girl"" in a high energy voice. Use a gentle voice. Your voice should be soft, gentle and encouraging. Not threatening. The quote, by horse whisperer Monty Roberts, sums it up: ""Use as little as possible, but as much as necessary"". You can always use a more commanding voice when you need to outside, off leash. Motivate your dog. Find out what your dog loves and start by using this practice training before dinner. This way your dog is hungry and very motivated. Use some of your dog’s dinner to train. Take a portion of what your dog receives for his dinner and use it to train so he is not over fed. I wish you the best as you work with your pup!"
18,Crate Training a New Puppy: Tips and Tools for Setting Up Your Pup,pets," Today, I want to talk about a very useful tool when it comes to training your puppy—a crate. Even more important, I want to discuss how to set yourself up for effectively crate training a new puppy. To some people, a crate looks a bit like jail cell. However, most puppies and dogs (once they’re used to it) don’t see it that way at all. In fact, they typically come to see their crate as a ""doggy bedroom"" or a den. It becomes a safe place…a place your puppy will learn to love. If you think about it, canines have evolved from being outside animals where they would have to make little caves and dens to live in and feel safe. So, really having a crate is a very important part of making your dog feel comfortable, calm, and at home. And to make a create even more den-like for your pup, you can even put a blanket on top of the crate, which makes it a much warmer, safer place for your puppy. Now, the most important thing is getting your puppy to love his crate. This is all done through basic association, no rocket science here. Think of all the things that your puppy loves to do like eating and playing with toys. These are the things you’ll want to have your puppy do inside that crate as much as you can. For instance, you can feed your puppy every single meal inside that crate, and it won’t take long before he’s running and jumping in there as fast as he can. You can also give him his treats inside the crate. It’s also a great idea to give your puppy little chew toys that he loves inside the crate. These chew toys will give your puppy an opportunity to spend long periods of time inside his crate on his own will. And, of course, you should certainly make the puppy’s crate a warm, comfortable place with lots of lovely blankets or whatever it is that your puppy needs. As long as your crate is in a safe place, and is placed in a space that is not too breezy, too cold, or too hot, it won’t be long before the crate becomes your puppy’s favorite spot in the house. Important: In order to keep the crate a happy place for your pup, it’s vital that you don’t establish a negative association by getting frustrated or annoyed with your puppy in his crate. Once you’ve made a positive association between your puppy and his crate, you can start working on ensuring your puppy stays calm and happy once placed in his little den. One way to set your puppy up to win is making sure that you put him in the crate after he’s been fully exercised. If you’re putting your puppy in the crate when he is full of energy, chances are he’s going to be getting restless and possibly start whining to come out. However, if you exercise him and he’s been fed and watered, he’ll be ready for sleep and will remain calm. The next important thing to know is when to let your puppy out of his cage. The key thing is that you want your puppy to be calm before you let him out. If your puppy starts whining and you let him out, it doesn’t take long before the puppy catches on and goes, ""Okay, that’s how I get out of my crate."" Puppies are super smart little critters! For this reason, you have to be very careful about letting your puppy out when he’s whining. One of the biggest reasons to use a crate is that you don’t want your puppy to use the bathroom inside the house. And one reason your puppy might whine to be let out is because he has to go to the bathroom. To avoid this problem, always take your puppy outside to go to the bathroom before you put him in his crate. Problem solved! Other than needing to go to the bathroom, a puppy will often whine because he simply just wants out of his crate. Don’t fall for this…even if your puppy has been in his cage for a while. Always wait until he is calm to remove him. This might mean you need to sit by his crate for 30 seconds or a minute until he stops whining. The minute he stops, let him out. If he continues to carry on, leave him. One little tip: If you find that your puppy is crying and won’t stop, one technique that you can use is to sit quietly and calmly with your puppy with your back turned to him. The reason you do this is, if you look at him and speak to him, you’re giving your puppy eye contact and communicating, which will get him excited. This will often make him more whiny or barky. If you sit there very calmly, you’re giving him the message, ""I’m here. I’m calm. You’re safe. You don’t need to worry about anything."" Because your energy is so calm and low, the puppy will tend to mirror your energy and become calm and quiet, too. Then you open the crate door. As you continue working with your pup, you’ll want to increase the amount of time your puppy must be quiet before the crate door opens. This takes time and patience, but as long as you commit to this method, your puppy will learn the rules for being let out of his crate. It sets boundaries and allows you to control your puppy and keep him in the area that you want him so he’s not all over the place all the time. Here’s what’s important to know about potty training with a crate… When your puppy has been confined in his crate, his bowels are kind of stationary. This is good…it reduces your pup’s need to use the bathroom—the exact reason you have him in the crate. However, once his little legs start pumping and running around, it’s likely that he’s going to need to go potty. For this reason, it’s important to take your puppy outside to go potty every time you remove him from his cage. Eventually, your puppy will catch on to the idea that he’s only supposed to use the bathroom outside. Once you get a crate, you might wonder, ""Where is the best place to set it up?"" That’s a great question! Typically, I recommend that you set up your puppy’s crate in your main living area. This will make it easy for you to keep an eye on your puppy and take him outside when he needs to go potty. I also think it’s a good idea to bring your puppy’s crate into your bedroom at bedtime. This will ensure your puppy feels safe and secure at nighttime. As your puppy gets older, you can always move that crate inch by inch until it’s outside your bedroom. Once your puppy is more familiar with the house and more familiar with the noises in his new surroundings, he’ll feel more happy and relaxed. Tip: It’s not a bad idea to invest in two crates…one for your living space and one for your bedroom. Doing this will alleviate the hassle of constantly moving crates. How to manage separation anxiety while your puppy is crated It’s important to start slowly when leaving your puppy alone for the first time. Start by leaving your puppy alone in his cage for maybe 20 or 30 seconds, then come back in. It’s important to simply ignore your puppy and go do something, like make a cup of tea. Eventually, your puppy will start realizing that you come and go and that it’s no big deal. A great time to practice this is when your puppy falls asleep. This is a prime time when you can leave the room for a long time, come back, and then you slowly extend that time that you’re leaving your puppy alone in the room. Tip: When you return to the room after being gone, I suggest that you don’t immediately open the crate door. Get your puppy in the habit that just because you’ve come back in the room doesn’t mean you open that door for him again. Hopefully this post has given you some great ideas and tips as to how you can start using the crate as a safe place and training tool for your puppy. I wish you the best of luck with your new puppy! Cheers!"
19,Dog Safety Tips for the Holiday Season,pets," The holiday season has officially arrived! And while it's often a joyous and fun season for us humans, it can also be a stressful and dangerous time of year for our canine companions. This year, I wanted to ensure that both you and your dog are able to enjoy the holidays. So, I've decided to put together a post for you that covers a variety of different struggles or dangers your dog might encounter this season, along with the solutions of how to keep your dog safe. Without further ado, let's get right into the meat and potatoes of how to keep your dog safe during the holiday season... Dog Holiday Safety Tip #1 - Manage Dog Anxiety A lot of craziness happens during the holidays. Families travel, people have house-guests over for parties, and normal routines are often changed. Unfortunately, all this change, excitement, and exposure to new people can really stress your dog out, making him unusually anxious. And when dogs are anxious, they may exhibit signs of... Illness (vomiting, excessive scratching, stomach pain) Aggression Fearful behavior To help keep your dog calm amongst the chaos, I recommend using my Calm Freeze technique as soon as your dog starts showing signs of anxiety. For instance, if you're hosting a holiday party and entertaining guests, you may not be able to stop what you are doing to help your dog settle down. During times like these, I recommend... Setting your dog up in a safe space-Sometimes the best way to help your dog relax is by taking him out of the situation that's causing him stress and putting him in a safe, comfortable space. For some dogs, this might mean being locked in a crate with a soft blanket and a toy. For other dogs, shutting them in a quiet room with a cozy place to sleep is also a good option. That's right−there is nothing wrong with letting them sit the whole thing out! Exercising your dog more frequently-Occasionally anxiety pops up due to a dog having too much energy. If you know you'll be traveling or having people over at your house, be sure to get your dog out on a long walk or a take him to run at the park. This will help lower his anxiety levels. Monitoring your own energy-Dogs are fantastic at picking up on our energy. If you're stressed out and anxious, it's likely that your dog will also become stressed out and anxious.

Dog Holiday Safety Tip #2 - Protect Your Dog from Dangerous Holiday Food One of the best parts of the holidays is the food. And I bet your dog would agree! That being said, there are so many things that we eat during the holidays that are incredibly dangerous for dogs. Not only could many holiday foods make your dog very sick, but certain foods are lethal. Here's a list of some very dangerous foods that people traditionally cook or bake with that you need to watch out for this year... Chocolate Grapes Raisins Turkey/Chicken Bones (these are a choking hazard) Onions Alcoholic Beverages Nutmeg Peanut Butter Made with Xylitol Walnuts Garlic Avoid these ingredients, and feed your dog this instead! Dog Holiday Safety Tip #3 - Protect Your Dog from Dangerous Holiday Plants There's nothing more beautiful than a display of poinsettias or boughs of holly over the mantelpiece. However, for a dog, these decorations can be deadly. If you have a dog in your home, I strongly advise against setting up any decorations this year that include the following plants... Holly Plants-Holly, when ingested, can cause pets to suffer nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Christmas Trees (Pine Trees)-Christmas trees themselves are perfectly safe for pets. However, if you water your tree, this is where they get dangerous. Tree water often collects bacteria and can cause your dog to have an upset stomach and diarrhoea. If you have a tree, just make sure your dog can't reach the water the tree sits in. Note: If you must have one-or all-of these plants in your home this time of year, make sure they are high and out of reach from your pets. Or better yet, go for fake plants that are safe and can be used every year! Don't Forget: If you have a dog that is a chewer, the easiest approach to get him to stop that unwanted behavior is to redirect him onto something he is allowed to chew rather than trying to stop the chewing completely! Dog Holiday Safety Tip #4 - Choose Your Holiday Decor Wisely Twinkling lights, cinnamon-scented candles, and sparkly tinsel are all lovely and festive decor options for the holiday season. That being said, I want to urge you to use caution when putting out your decor. Here's why... Candles: If you have high-energy dogs that love to run around and occasionally knock things over, I'd forgo setting out burning candles. One accident and your pup could accidentally set your house in flames. For those of you that love candles and don't want to go without them, be sure to place them on high places, like a kitchen table or mantelpiece where they can't get knocked over. You can also purchase flameless candles at the store which are a safe option. Tinsel: As for tinsel, if you have a dog who likes to taste test your decor, I suggest you stay far away from this shiny decoration. Tinsel comes in long, plasticky strands. And when ingested, it can easily get caught going through your dog's digestive tract. This can cause internal blockages, organ damage, and death. Strands of Lights: Most dogs won't bother a strand of lights-especially if they are wound around a Christmas tree or are used to decorate the exterior of your home. That being said, some dogs-especially puppies-have been known to chew on strands of lights that plug into the wall. If you have a new puppy, or a dog that loves to chew cords, make sure your light strands are off the ground where they can't be reached. Dog Holiday Safety Tip #5 - Be Cautious of What People Gift Your Dog Many dogs receive gifts during the holidays. And there's certainly nothing wrong with that! However, it is important that you monitor what people are giving your dog. It's the same as having a small child. You wouldn't want Uncle Bob to give Little Timmy a blow torch for fun, much like you wouldn't want Aunt Jane to give your dog a cookie filled with dangerous ingredients. A lot of times, people-especially people who don't own dogs-think they are doing something nice by bringing your pet a gift. But, unfortunately, the gifts dogs receive aren't always healthy or safe. What is a good, safe gift to give your dog this year? I'm so glad you asked! I wish both you and your dog a wonderful holiday season."

2,Cool Facts About Polydactyl Cats,pets," Cats are pretty cool but there’s none cooler than a cat with extra toes. Most cats have 18 toes but some cats have a few extra making them polydactyl. Polydactyl is of Greek origin, ""poly"" means many and ""daktylos"" means digits. Being polydactyl is not unusual in cats. Most polydactyl’s have extra toes on their front paws, often looking like thumbs. Here’s some interesting facts about these beloved felines. Polydactyly is a genetic abnormality in cats. Most cats have five toes on their front paws and four toes on their back paws. A polydactyl kitten may have up to eight toes on any given paw. This abnormality is passed down through a dominant gene. If one parent is polydactyl and the other isn’t, there is a 40 to 50 percent chance the kittens will have extra digits. Ernest Hemingway was given a white polydactyl cat, named Snow White, by a sea captain. Being a prolific cat lover, Hemingway collected more than 50 cats from his beloved Snow White. Almost half of which had extra digits. Interestingly, most of the cats were named after authors. These cats today are often referred to as ""Hemingway cats"". You can visit the Hemingway Museum to see the cat colony that still thrives there. The Guinness Records lists the polydactyl cat with the most toes at 28. He is a ginger tabby, from Canada, named Jake. Each paw has seven toes. Each with its own claw, pad and bone structure. Polydactyl is a common trait in Maine Coons. This trait is not as predominant as in the past but, at one point, almost 40 percent of Maine Coons had extra toes. This trait is more common in cats found in western England, Canada, Wales and the eastern United States. Although the mutation can arise randomly in any cat population. Sailors believed that cats with lots of toes brought good luck to ships. They felt these large feet provided better balance and made for excellent mousers. These cats were often called gypsy cats. It is thought that the first polydactyl cats were brought to America by Puritans in the 1600s. The first scientific recording of polydactyl cats was in 1868. A severe condition called Feline Radial Hypoplasia mimics polydactyl. It may cause the formation on additional toes but is not caused by the same gene. With Radial Hypoplasia, the extra toes are immediately adjacent to the normal toes making the cat look like they have overly large, flat feet. This is often referred to as patty feet or hamburger feet. Breeding cats with radial hypoplasia can result in kittens with underdeveloped or twisted forelegs. There are two breeds recognized by some cat fancier clubs- the American Polydactyl and the Maine Coon Polydactyl. There is also a strain of polydactyl cats in Ithaca, New York known as Ithacats. Some of the most common nick-names are mitten cats, mitten-foot cats, boxing cats, conch cats, cardi-cats, snowshoe cats, thumb cats, six-fingered cats, and the best-known, Hemingway cats"
3,What To Do When Your Dog Is Shedding Hair All Over The House?,pets," Just like human hair loss, dogs routinely shed hair naturally as part of the body's 'renewal' process. This is considered to be a very normal matter so you can have a peace of mind because even if they shed hair, your dog is still perfectly healthy. However, if suddenly one day you notice that your pet is shedding too much hair that makes its fur thin, it may be a pathological problem. Moreover, it also makes you feel uncomfortable because dog hair is sticking to clothes, furniture, even scattered around the house.

Take a look! What to do when your dog is shedding hair? You should not panic when your beloved dog sheds its hair in the spring when the weather begins to warm up because it's just a normal change under the influence of the weather. However, if you see that your dog's hair is falling too much, scattering around the house, sticking to clothes, furniture ... even falling out in small pieces, you should consider the health of the pet as it may be signs of the disease.

Brushing not only helps to remove weak hairs but are also a great cuddly gesture that helps you close-knit with your pet. However, in the first time, your pet may not like being brushed, but don’t give up, try it slowly. You should try once a day, brush several times and then gently stroke its back; if you see any discomfort, then you should stop immediately. Repeat this process until the dog becomes more comfortable and allows you to brush the hair all over its body. Just like humans, if the pet eats nutritious with a proper, balanced diet, your pet will stay healthy with a soft, shiny fur. Conversely, if the pet is not adequately fed from the daily food source, its skin becomes dry, lacking in vitality, causing the hair to shed more and more. To find out the proper diet for your pet, you can consult the veterinarian about reliable nutrients and food labels. When the cat's fur is scattered all over the house, the best way to handle it is to use a vacuum cleaner to clean it.

Sticky rollers not only remove dirt, but they can also remove pet hairs that leave behind on your clothes. Therefore, you can use this tool to clean your clothes before leaving home. Conclusion These are simple ways to help you cope easily if your beloved dog loses too much hair. Hopefully, in the process of raising dogs, you will not have any problems with its fur anymore."
4,"Pets & Pee Predicaments, Part Deux",pets," The Only Dance There Is ""Pets & Pee Predicaments"", our first blog discussed the subject of (almost) all things related to pet pee predicaments. And this is it - create a cleaning dance to keep things interesting - don't call it a routine, the word conjures up static, low energy, just pure blah-ness. But, a dance, you can do that. No one is watching, you got this! By the way, if someone joins in, all the better. You should dance a few times a week. Crank it Up & Get Down Crank up the music and get down with ""we love pets, but we love a clean house too"" cleaning hoohah. Get vacuuming, clean old urine soaked areas with enzyme component cleaners, deodorize the place and open the darn windows. Part Deux, this part, takes it home with the rest, the last waltz - carpet spot cleaning, furniture cleaning, purifying and freshening the air. Spot Cleaning, H2O2, Vinegar & Your Pets Before the very popular subject of  ""vinegar cures everything on earth"" topic is addressed, decide that dealing with fresh pet pee should be a priority in life, at least one of them. With old urine stains gone, be vigilant. Create a new dynamic, clean fresh piddle right away which will minimize repeat offenses. Do not allow your very expensive carpet to become a surrogate fire hydrant. Cleaning products with H2O2 aka as hydrogen peroxide rock, and will make the task easier than you can imagine. Hydrogen peroxide is the only germicidal agent composed of water and oxygen exclusively, which kills pee related organisms by oxidation. Vinegar is acidic in nature and holds many of the same properties as urine. Vinegar therefore, should never be used to clean pet stains. Because dogs and most pets urinate based on scent, vinegar can actually draw them to the spot where it was applied. Just Say NO to urine cleaning vinegar hacks, please. Here's Where We Blatantly Promote a Brilliant Spot Cleaning Product Hydrogen peroxide is considered the world’s safest of all natural sanitizers that kills microorganisms by simply oxidizing them. When Hydrogen peroxide reacts with organic material it breaks down into oxygen and water, meaning it is a non-toxic entity and perfectly suited for general use. Spartan Contempo H2O2 Spotting Solution is a convenient, ready-to-use, hydrogen peroxide based carpet spotting solution and pre-spray treatment. It has an advanced cleaning formula designed with ingredients that penetrate, lift and oxidize stains. These powerful detergents dry to a brittle powder, leaving no tacky residue. The brittle powder does not contribute to re-soiling and is easily removed by vacuuming. Plus, it carries the Carpet and Rug Institute’s Seal of Approval which means this product will remove even the most difficult stains without damage to the carpet. Good stuff! Snoopy, Lucy & Dog Germs ""I have dog germs, get hot water"" ~Lucy.  Did she have it right? Come on, it's only logical. As much as we love dogs, most pets are little beings of bacteria carrying fur balls. Maybe some of the germs are good germs, that's possible, right? There are dozens of research studies on the subject with the same conclusion that we know to be true - just keep the environment hygienic and keep dogs in the family. Vacuum and clean upholstered furniture and sleeping areas, especially bedding and follow-up with a deep penetrating proprietary cleaning system to eliminate odor. Vacuuming removes the obvious: fur and dander. A HEPA vacuum filtration system captures 100 percent of particles 75 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair and actually improves indoor air quality capturing dust and allergen particles down to 0.3 microns. A professional grade fabric freshening product takes it home for a perfect storm of clean, which is not to be confused with covering odor - don't even try. Everyone knows and it's just not that healthy. The Holy Grail for Clean, Pure Air You've danced the last dance of the day. The dance is over. Your work is done. But your dogs, and other pets in the house, as beautiful and as happy as they are in this fresh, clean space will continue to generate germs and dander. Hey, that's just who they are. The cleaning dance will never end...not that there's anything wrong with that. But imagine if 99.7% of allergens including pet dander could be removed from the air effortlessly. Wouldn't that be sweet? Removing the problem, before it happens? Investing in an air purifier makes sense, and today's technology is rather brilliant. A HEPA air purification system features a carbon odor filter which has been treated with pure baking soda. The purification system is designed to trap larger particles, and virtually absorbs and eliminates all odors. Pure genius. The Gilded Lilly Not that you need it at this point, but we think it's nice. Pet odor has been eliminated thanks to you. Odor neutral spaces are quite heavenly. You'll even notice behavior changes in your pets, I know I have, personally. But just as a certain fragrance wafts through the air when someone walks by that is irresistible, wouldn't it be nice to have a beautiful fragrance in your home too? Not an assaulting sharp cover up kind of smell, something simply fresh & clean?  Also, by chance, if there happens to be a lingering odor, somehow, somewhere, many air fresheners are designed and formulated to freshen the air and eliminate bad odor. Brilliant.

To visitors, friends, family, and neighbors it is the proverbial elephant in the room. You've been there. Maybe you've visited a new friend, a long lost relative, super smart co-worker, nice, nice neighbor or happy church buddy, and there it is. The door opens and the stench is so strong you feel as though you might faint. Or you enter a house with windows that have been closed for a century unmercifully capturing the stench of pee soaked carpeting and furniture that literally belongs to the dogs. It happens and it almost defies description. Ideology Meets Logic So, here's where the ideology of loving a pet meets logic. There is no joy in having pets if your home has been turned into a kennel and an unclean one at that. It's not a healthy environment for you, children or other living things. Certainly, undeniably, for your friends who you would like to keep as friends. Yeah, it's that serious. But, the cleaning part, it's pretty easy if you just put one foot in front of the other.

So, get your game face on and vacuum every nook and cranny. I am here to tell you that an awesome vacuum makes all the difference.

Just stop. Now. Stains harbor old odor and there is definitely something you can do about it. Join this century. Cleaning products that include enzymes is a game changer. Although enzyme formulated products is not a new phenomenon, these products are undergoing a revival. And for good reason, the components and results are relevant in an age where green cleaning solutions prevail and mindfulness matters. Bacteria. Good & bad that's the root formula for cleaners with enzymes. Enzymes 101 Here's a scientific cliff note on the subject found in ""Simple Science: How in the World do Enzymes Clean?"" by Nyco: Contrary to popular belief, enzymes are not alive. They are produced by live bacteria and pave the way for it to work. Enzymes operate as helpful tools that catalyze (speed up) chemical reactions between bacteria and soils, making the bacteria more efficient. Enzymes work to break down complex waste particles into smaller pieces that bacteria can more easily consume. These smaller particles—organic wastes, urine, grease, stains—become ""food"" for bacteria to digest and break down into two basic compounds—carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). Certain enzymatic products are specifically formulated for carpet cleaning which penetrates soft surfaces without discoloring them. With a near-neutral pH, the application ensures that the cleaner will not damage the surface. For new or old pee problems, enzyme cleaners are the way to go. Deodorize, Simply Because, Pee Stinks What's next? The carpets and floors have been thoroughly vacuumed, stubborn pee problem areas have been eliminated, now it's time to odor neutralize your space. It's optimal to create a clean, fresh smell in the house without a perfumy sub-text. To accomplish this, deodorize. Deodorizing the home should create the absence of odor. This is your goal. Think about this - every time someone enters your home, should they immediately know that you are a pet lover? Or, would it be preferable for guests to simply enter a living space that is defined by no odor, a neutral odor zone? Of course, you know the answer. As you look for ways, products, and practices to simply deodorize, you will find every cleaning hack under the sun. Pop ups from vinegar, cat litter, vodka, baking soda, essential oils, tea leaves, to chalk abound. Yes, chalk. Don't go there. A Natural Disposition is Best Today's cleaning products combine the best of both worlds: they are effective and safe with the benefit of incorporating innovations and technology that possess environmentally sustainable qualities.

6,Trainable Cats,pets," There are a lot of people that don’t believe cats can be trained but there are loads of videos that prove otherwise. A YouTube search will show you cats jumping through flaming hoops, sitting on command or even running an agility course. Many cats can be taught to walk on a leash or use a toilet rather than a litter box but this doesn’t mean all cats will learn these skills. Here is a list of five cat breeds that are known for their trainability. Abyssinian: The Aby has an acrobatic build and daring nature. They are highly intelligent and excel at learning tricks. Their highly social personality makes them born entertainers and great family pets. Watch them greet everyone as you walk them on a lease. Their daring nature has earned them the nickname ""Aby-silly-an"". American Shorthair: These cats have extraordinary people watching skills that help make them quick learners. With an agile, adaptable and patient intelligence, the shorthair will response to requests such as come, sit and down. They can be taught to walk on a lease and use a scratching post. All this combined with a tolerant and easygoing nature makes the shorthair a great family pet. Bengal: This is a highly intelligent cat that’s both active and curious. It should be no surprise if they turn on the faucet just to play in the water or decide to catch one of your favorite fish from the aquarium. While these traits can make them a trainer’s dream, a regular cat owner may be less than ready to handle their curious nature. Offering puzzle toys and other activities will help challenge their brain and keep them from seeking out other objects they want to take apart. Bengals enjoy taking walks and learn to play fetch easily. Savannah: These smart cats have a good sense of humor, especially if it’s at your expense. They have been known to push items off of shelves so they land on your head, filling the sink with water to play and even turning on the alarm clock to make you get up. The Savannah needs to be kept busy. Interactive games, steps and bridges through-out the house and teaching them to walk on a leash with exercise their brain and body as well as challenge their athletic skills. Siamese: The Siamese are endlessly curious and can be very demanding. They love to be included in everything you do but can be found entertaining themselves by digging through the cabinets, watching television and turning the faucet on just to see it run. This cat truly enjoys a good walk and playing fetch. Their most significant accomplishment is teaching you to do what they want. Don’t be concerned if your cat isn’t an Einstein. When it comes to training, cats are generally very intelligent. They learn through a process of imitation, experimentation and problem solving. Trainability varies by breed and even within a breed. Some breeds are more willing to learn than others.  Focus on your cats strengths to teach them tricks that entertain as well as engage their mind."
7,All Dog Foods Are Not The Same,pets," All Dog Foods Are Not The Same Your dogs well being and health is vital to you, your family, and, of course in keeping down the costs of veterinarian bills! In order to do so, you will need to carefully consider the food you give your dog. People sometimes simply pick the dog food that is the very first case they see at the shop. It’s easy to forget the importance of dog food, however, it is crucial to pick the right one for your dog. To help keep your dog healthy, they need plenty of fresh water and should be fed good quality food in correct quantities to satisfy their energy needs. Constantly proceed with the guidelines on the dog food package for recommended feeding amounts. Picking a Dog Food The very first challenge in selecting a dog food is choosing one which is good quality in every aspect. The term that comes up a lot about dog food is ""human"" grade. „Human"" grade suggests that your dog food is great sufficient for us for eating. Unfortunately, many commercial dog food brands are manufactured from things which are less than desirable for human consumption. Often, the meat used in dog food is of a quality considered unfit for humans for eating. Major dog food businesses try to suggest balanced proportions of nutrients and minerals for maximum benefit to your dog. It benefits your puppy while you might see that many brands of dog food have actually almost identical labels. More reputable dog food companies will provide an explanation for each health supplement. Always read the label to see exactly what proteins, vitamins, and minerals are being given to your dog. Whatever you do though, try not to utilize store brand dog food(s) as they could short your dog on much needed nutrition. Research reports have shown that the main ingredient in dog food should be meat-based protein. Not corn meal or flour that has gluten. According to reviews, better quality dog food leads to a healthier coat and fewer digestive issues such as constipation. Pet nutrition experts agree that the best premium dog food is made of human-grade ingredients like meat, whole grains, and vegetables. Premium dog food’s is crucial because good nutrition is essential for a long, healthy life. Kinds of Dog Food There are many varieties of dog food to choose from with the three most popular types being dry, semi-moist, and canned. It is important to check the color of your dog’s food. Frequently, dog food made from 100% natural ingredients may have soft earth color and these contain no preservatives, artificial colors, or artificial flavors. Natural dog food is becoming more popular nowadays. More and more veterinarians recommend feeding natural dog food to your pet. They feel that is the most readily useful choice and it is the healthiest choice for your dog. The dogs will certainly enjoy it more than any commercial food brand. Raw food advocates concede that all natural dog food costs more than traditional dog food, but argue that it's worth it. Due to this fact, you might find that making your pets food at home is not easy. A good place to start is by a mixture of ground turkey, rice, and carrots... it is simple, healthy, and your dog will be very thankful for it. If you absolutely must go the commercial route for your dog’s food, it is better to buy premium dog food as it contains more energy and protein than a cheaper, or store brand. Unfortunately, not all dog food brands contain top quality ingredients, so be sure to always check the label. It is okay if you talk to your veterinarian before deciding on which dog food to feed your puppy. They will know your dog’s dietary needs, and you will discover that veterinary offices and feed stores frequently carry excellent, natural dog food. Natural Dog Food Many 100% natural dog food brands contain only fresh, normal, and wholesome ingredients for your puppy. Normal dog food has all of the vitamins and minerals which are important for healthy strong dogs. Chicken, fish and eggs are examples of good quality protein that is provided in natural dog food. There are additional ingredients in natural dog food’s that also assist in the ongoing health of your dog’s skin and also your dog’s coat. One of the key drawbacks of natural dog food, however, is that it has a shorter shelf life. It may spoil if not consumed quickly. Dried Dog Food A high quality (premium) dog food is actually more affordable than the generic brand(s) even though they cost more per lb. A vast majority of owners go after dry dog food for its convenience and easy storage. This is also because cheaper, dry dog foods are generally made from soybean, corn, or rice, while many premium dry dog foods are made with all-natural, human-grade ingredients. Conclusion Overall, it is best that your dog enjoys their own food as opposed to what is considered to be human food... even though they might prefer what we're consuming! Of course, you can feed your dog treats from time to time because a little TLC is always beneficial to your dog!"
8,Pet Therapy is the BEST,pets," Pet therapy is a type of therapy that involves bringing animals into the hospital to interact with patients. Pets help to normalize the hospital environment and make hospitalization less stressful and frightening for patients and their families. The benefits of pet therapy are numerous and well-documented in the scientific literature. Researchers have evaluated the effectiveness of pet therapy in several settings and have found a wide range of advantages. Animals have long served as an important source of social contact and bonding for humans. Pet companionship has been associated with improved overall mental, social, and physiological health status. Research has shown that companion animals serve as an aid to relaxation, as indicated by decreased blood pressure and increased peripheral skin temperature. More recently, the benefits of pet therapy in hospitalized pediatric patients have been explored. In a study of pediatric cardiology patients, a pet visitation program designed for therapeutic interaction between trained dogs and pediatric patients, parents, and unit staff. The study found that pet visits provided stress relief, normalization of hospital milieu, generation of positive rapport and feelings, and improved satisfaction and morale for patients and parents. The pet visits had both relaxing and stimulatory effects on patients–such as calming a child before a procedure or waking a child after surgery–and these observed effects corresponded with appropriate changes in heart rate and respiratory rate. A similar study explored the physical and emotional impact of a pet therapy program. Canine visitation was established with the goal of reducing hospitalized children’s anxiety and distress. In this study, it compared this pet therapy program to child-life therapy, a commonly used program in pediatric hospitals. They found that, compared to those in the child-life group, children participating in Pet Pals experienced more anticipatory excitement and displayed more positive effect. Parents’ ratings of the child’s mood were also more substantially improved in the pet therapy group. The implementation of another pet therapy program, A Magical Dream, for pediatric oncology patients found that the program was effective in improving overall mood and well-being. Moreover, patients and parents experienced acute reduction in psychological distress. Pet therapy also facilitated patients’ adaptation to the therapeutic process. Another study explored the effectiveness of canine visitation therapy (CVT) in pediatric pain management. They found that a one-time CVT intervention significantly reduced pediatric patients’ perceived pain after surgery, suggesting that the effectiveness of pet therapy may be partially cognitive. Pets provide a distraction from pain, as well as a comforting reminder of home. Furthermore, patients reported pets as a source of pleasure, happiness, fun, and entertainment. The physical contact provided by the pets further contributed to the reduction in perceived pain. Research that has investigated pet therapy in hospitalized adults has produced similar findings regarding its many benefits. For example, a study found that adult patients attained significant improvement in perceived energy level and significant reduction in pain, respiratory rate, and negative mood state with pet therapy compared to baseline. Specifically, these patients showed improvements on several mood state subscales, including tension/anxiety and fatigue/inertia. Overall, pet therapy intervention improved patients’ moods. Pet therapy can range from casual visitations to formalized intervention programs. There are different types of pet interactions, based on the patient’s desires and needs: Passive interaction – pet sits or sleeps with the patient. Low interaction – pet performs occasional tricks. Active interaction – patient and pet engage in lively play or go for a walk. The interaction type can be altered on any given day. In addition, the frequency and duration of visits or sessions can vary widely for different patients and their families. Conclusion: Pet therapy provides substantial pediatric benefit. It is also readily adaptable to the various needs of these patients."
9,Common Cat Ailments,pets," Cats seem to groom themselves all the time. But even the cleanest feline can succumb to some of these common health issues. Fleas Fleas are a very common health issue for cats as well as dogs. Fleas can live over a year and cause anemia in your cat if left untreated. They have some specific signs and are one of the easiest issues to treat. There are several treatment options including powders, foams, topical medication and oral medication. Consult with your vet on the best choice for your pet. Here are some signs your cat has fleas. • Constant scratching • Irritated red skin • Hair loss • Frequent licking • Flea dirt on their skin which looks like little black dots • Hot spots or infections Vomiting Vomiting is very common with cats due to many causes. It could be from eating something poisonous or inedible like ribbon, hairballs, an infection, diabetes or urinary tract disease. Aside from the usual symptoms, it can include include abdominal heaving and drooling. Vomiting can dehydrate your cat rather quickly so call you vet if your feline acts ill or continues to vomit. Your vet may request a sample so be prepared to take one along. FLUTD – Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease Vets estimate that as many as 3% of the cats they see have FLUTD. Feline lower urinary tract disease is actually a group of disease with many causes. Both male and female cats are at risk to contract FLUTD and is common in cats that are overweight, unfit or generally only eat dry food. Other contributing factors can be stress, sudden changes to their lifestyle, and even multiple cats in the homes. Treatments are based on the type of FLUTD that your cat has. If you think you cat may have FLUTD, contact your vet immediately. If your cat can’t urinate, there is definitely a problem. Here are some symptoms to watch for. • Bloody urine • Urinating in unusual places • Straining to urinate • Dehydration • Lack of appetite • Crying while urinating • Continuous licking of the urinary area • Vomiting Tapeworms Tapeworms are common in cats. Cats usually get tapeworms as a result of swallowing a flea. They live in the cat’s small intestine and can grow up to 2 feet. While they can grow rather large, they are segmented and usually break apart when expelled. You will usually just see segments of the tapeworm rather than a whole worm. The easiest way to see if your cat has tapeworms is their check their feces, anus or bedding. You will see small white worms, that look like grains of rice. The worms usually come out when your cat relaxes or sleeps. These are the best times to check for signs. Vomiting and weight loss are symptoms but many times it is hard to tell if they are infected. There are different treatment options available that include injections, oral or topical medications. Diarrhea There are many reasons why your cat can have diarrhea including spoiled food, allergies, parasites, liver disease, infection and even cancer. It can last anywhere from a day to several months. If your feline has diarrhea, be sure to offer plenty of fresh water to help prevent dehydration. Removing their food for up to 24 hours may help reduce the length of the episode. If you see vomiting, fever, lethargy, dark or bloody stool or loss of appetite, consult your vet immediately. Eye Problems There can be multiple causes for eye problems in cats. Viruses, trauma, conjunctivitis, glaucoma, cataracts, retinal disease, and inflammation are the most common. Here are some symptoms that there may be a problem. • Squinting • Watery eyes • Cloudiness • Tear-stained fur • Gunk in the corner of their eye • Red or white eyelid lining • Pawing at their eye • Visible third eyelid If you don’t know what is causing your cat’s eye issues, be sure to treat it as an emergency and call your vet for an appointment. Maintaining your cat’s health is an important part of pet ownership. Be sure to consult your vet whenever you have questions about their behavior."
10,Crush Cushing’s Disease the Vetoryl Way,pets," The cortisol keeps entering the bloodstream unhampered which has a negative impact on the blood pressure, electrolyte balance, immune function, fat metabolism and even the cardiovascular system. This hormonal imbalance is known as hyperadrenocorticism or Cushing’s Disease. The most common cause of Cushing’s syndrome is a tumor in the pituitary gland (located at the base of the brain). At times, it may also be due to a tumor in the adrenal glands. In either case, the condition causes the adrenal glands to secrete excessive cortisol in the body. Occasionally, it can also be triggered by illness or injury. Difficult to diagnose The problem with Cushing’s disease is that it does not manifest with common indications such as pain, cough, vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding and so on. The symptoms such as increased thirst, increased appetite, excessive urination, excessive panting, gastrointestinal disorders, lethargy, obesity, insomnia, hair loss and muscle weakness are mistakenly connected to normal signs of aging in the pet animal. It can even make the pet irritable or restless. This is the reason why pet owners can be forgiven for failing to seek veterinary intervention at the onset of the disease itself. However, if left untreated, Cushing’s syndrome can lead to diabetes, pancreatitis, seizures or congestive heart failure in the dog. Therefore, pet owners are advised to watch out for the warning signs of a bulging belly, sagging body, symmetric balding, skin darkening, hard white scaly patches on the skin, easy bruising or hypertension. Route to diagnosis Pet owners should consult a veterinarian at the earliest to rule out any underlying cause even for the general signs of aging. The physician will discuss the symptoms and conduct a thorough physical examination. He will run blood and urine tests to measure the level of cortisol in the dog’s body. If cortisol is elevated, the veterinarian can do an ultrasound scan to locate the tumor and determine if the Cushing’s disease is emanating from the pituitary or adrenal glands. Road ahead Tumors in the adrenal glands can be surgically removed in most cases. While Cushing’s disease from the pituitary gland is incurable, the condition can still be treated with drugs. In either case, the veterinarian will prescribe trilostane (through vetoryl for dogs) to block the excessive production and synthesis of cortisol in the canine. The medication has to be continued lifelong. Therefore, vetoryl for dogs can improve both the quality and length of the pet’s life. He or she will be able to stay active, comfortable and healthy for a much longer time."
11,Are You The Pack Leader for Your Dog?,pets," As dogs are pack animals, it is important to understand that they are always conscious of their position within the pack. This ""pack"" consists of you, your family, other animals, and any other dog(s) in the household. The Alpha dog, or pack leader, is the leader and protector of the pack. It is crucial that you accept this role. Your dog will be healthier and happier if it feels secure in it's pack, knowing that their leader does their job and every person that is safe. The first step in establishing your position as the pack leader, or ""Alpha"" is to learn which signals your dog will understand. You need to regularly communicate ""Alpha signals"" to your dog in a compassionate and respectful way. This does not entail being aggressive, bullying, or overbearing your dog! It is definitely a matter of learning the language that your dog understands, and utilizing the correct signals. Blended signals and other inconsistencies will confuse your dog, making them think that the pack leader is not effective. Your pet will be stressed and feel that they have to take control as Alpha to stabilize the pack. Although they are being ""bad,"" you have given them the wrong signals so they feel justified. So... what are these signals and how would you be able to communicate them effectively? Firstly, the pack leader always eats before the other pack members, so you MUST eat your dinner completely and clear the table before giving your pet their full bowl of food. They should see you eating and understand clearly you have completely finished before they are allowed to eat. Then, make them stay before you by placing their bowl down for them to eat. If you will be in the practice of feeding your pet before your dinner, or even during, this usually takes a while for the dog to become used to. Be aware that any fuss they makes if you are consuming is part of their learning process. You are giving them new signals, new information regarding the pack, and so you also must let them realize this. They might need time to assimilate this new information, so be firm but patient. Next, you must always lead your dog, particularly through doorways and passages which can be slim. NEVER let your puppy push past you or in front of you. Th Alpha in a dog pack would not enable a dog that is subordinate to push past, or ""lead"" the pack, and consequently, neither should you. Use a leash if need be, but ensure that you enter doors, spaces, gates etc. before your dog. Neither should you let your dog run up stairs in front of you as this permits them to run to the most top allowing them to look down on you, displaying classic behaviour that is dominant. The key for this is not to not punish the incorrect behavior, but to not allow them to exhibit alpha behavior in the first place. Once they do so, it will be too late to achieve that, but is is possible to not enable it. Work with a leash, closed doors, giving a short, sharp shout (or whatever your dog responds to), but remember to be firm, kind, and respectful. You're talking to your dog, not trying to bully them into submission. Major part of becoming a pack leader for your dog lies in these techniques. Practiced repeatedly, patiently and consistently."
12,Potty Training for Puppies,pets," Puppies are adorable, they can melt hearts in an instant and can entertain you for hours and hours with their inquisitive nature. However, as all dog owners know, puppy care isn't all laughs and cuddles, it also involves a lot of cleaning up mess and by mess we mean poop. Dog training can be a difficult process at the beginning, especially with young puppies who have little self-control. They are not born with any senses which tell them where and where not to do their business, but despite this, dogs have a remarkable ability to read human emotions, more so than any other animal. Some research even suggests they can read human facial expressions. Please see below for our two dog training tips for potting training puppies. Be overly tough and overly loving Next time you take your puppy on a walk and they poop in an appropriate place (it can be debatable as to what that may mean to you), praise them as much as possible and get them in a really good mood. To do this make sure you speak in a really positive tone and give them lots of physical contact. But also remember to do the opposite when she/he poops in the house, for example, don't be soft on them, let them know that what they have done is wrong. Now what we mean by this isn't to shout or be abusive, but to show with your tone of voice and physical expressions that you are not happy with what they have done. Please be aware that eventually, your puppy will start to realize that what they have done is wrong and start to hide from you, but you must keep to the plan and ensure that they have been told off. You can even talk your puppy to the 'crime scene' and tell them off there so they definitely know what they have done wrong. Learned behavior Another well-used technique is to make your puppy associate pooping on the floor with a particular part of the room. For example, you put a sheet of newspaper down in the corner of the room and every time your puppy fouls on the floor, you pick them up and place them on the sheet. Eventually, the puppy will start to associate the sheet with the need to go to the toilet and will begin going there instead of where ever they may be at that point in time."
13,Do Cats Get Lonely? Top Valuable Benefits Of Multi Cat Homes,pets," The subject of ‘Do cats get lonely’ is probably not something many single cat owners think about much, because they love their single cat and are happy with the way things are. However, just as with humans, an animal can get lonely if left alone for too long, and this can sometimes be seen in their behavior, although we may not realize it is down to loneliness when you are not there. Therefore, in this article we will take a look at the top valuable benefits of a multi cat home, and it may just make you think twice about getting a friend for your single cat, so read on to learn more. Why do cats get lonely and can this be cured by having an additional cat in the house? Ask any number of vets, and the majority of them will tell you that a multi cat household will be more healthier and happy with less behavioral problems than one cat families. In fact, one survey performed in the United States with over 170 veterinarians where more than 8 out of 10 said they agree that cats should not be left alone. Moreover, 7 out of 10 vets agreed that a cat with a feline friend will be more happier and healthier, and 86% said that separation related anxiety will generally result in some type of negative behavior. Sticking with the facts, the same survey, which was conducted by Harris Interactive and commissioned by Arm & Hammer, also noted that more than half the vets agreed that cats that exhibit negative, or behavioral traits tend to improve simply by adding another compatible feline. The main problem with cat owners that have a cat with behavioral problems is they tend to look at it as something that can’t be fixed and tend to give the cat up to a shelter. In addition, at least half the cats in shelters that are put to sleep is usually due to behavioral problems that could more often than not be due to the cat being left alone for hours on end, when a companion may have helped remedy the situation. It is widely becoming more agreeable with both pet owners, and vets alike that cats are not the solitary creatures we once thought they were. In fact, they are very sociable and enjoy each others company, this shows even in feral cats that often live in large groups. Moreover, in Switzerland authorities have passed a anti cruelty law that requires owners to buy, or adopt multiple cats since it is the nature of an animal to have some company of its own kind. So having said that, we now know that cats do get lonely, and it can be more humane to have at least two or more cats when thinking of owning a new cat, plus this would also help to keep cats out of the shelters too. Keeping that in mind, there are advantages, and disadvantages of owning multiple cats and some points are obvious while others are not, for instance two cats is twice the expense. However, you can get some good deals when shopping for pet health insurance as many companies offer discounts for multiple pets, although not everything is covered, so it is wise to check the small print when buying pet insurance. There is also twice as much fur to clean up, but for most it isn’t a problem seeing as you’re cleaning up one lot it may be just as easy to clean up twice as much. If, you are thinking of getting a cat either for the first time, or because you lost a single cat a while ago and are ready to get another one, consider getting two, and instead of buying one you may want to consider easing the burden of shelters by adopting. In addition, it can be easier to bring home two kittens from the same litter that already get along, rather than trying to introduce one to an older cat, although this is possible too. Introducing a new kitten or cat to an older cat can have its own problems, because the established cat could see this as a threat, so it would have to be done gradually. There are many other benefits of owning multiple cats, but these benefits will only occur if the cats are matched well and get along, there are even instances where personalities clash even in cats. However, having multiple cats will provide them with social interaction, and they will provide exercise for each other while you are out of the house. Multiple cats in the home will also be less likely to develop behavioral problems like tearing up your curtains, or furniture while you are out, and having multiple cats also prevents them from becoming obese, which is a major problem for single cat owners. It has been said by single cat owners that they had problems with their cat sleeping all day and keeping them up at night, but when they got a second cat they had enough exercise with each other during the day that the problem was resolved. Moreover, by having more than one cat, they are actually cleaner as most cats will groom each other and get to places on the other cats body where a single cat cannot, like behind the ears and along the neck. However, when it comes to having multiple cats, be sure to have a litter box for each cat as they can be particular when having their own spaces to go to the bathroom. While it is said to have at least one litter box per cat, you should also have one extra one as occasionally both will prefer the same one, which can lead to one or the other going where you don’t want them to. The same can be said with food bowls, as many cats do not like to share when it comes time to eat, although it has been known for two to eat from the same bowl. Nevertheless, don’t take any chances that can lead to aggressive behavior. Having said that, be sure to have multiple scratching posts available too, as they don’t just use these to sharpen their claws, it is also a way of the cat marking their territory, and having multiple scratching posts will also ensure they don’t use your furniture either. In Conclusion…. Finally, when it comes to having a multi cat home the benefits certainly out weigh the downsides, but be sure to have plenty of spaces the cats can call their own. Plenty of perching spots will allow them to have their own space when they need it, and deter them from fighting over one space. We hope after reading our article today you might consider getting a second kitty for your established feline friend, or adopting one from a shelter even, remember when it comes to cats, the more the merrier, and less chance for your single cat to become lonely too.

14,Mysterious Cat Behaviors,pets," Cats are wonderful companions, but sometimes their behavior leaves us a little confused. The way they communicate and interact socially is different than dogs and is often misunderstood. Yet these quirky behaviors make us love them so much more. To help you understand your furry friend better, here are some of those mysterious behaviors explained. As you will see, these strange behaviors are quite normal for cats. Chattering at birds – the clacking sound your cat emits when watching birds fly by is thought to be pent up frustration due to their inability to go outside. Some believe the rapid jaw movement is your cat preparing its muscles for the act of killing prey. Head bumps - when you cat bumps you with its head their saying ""Hello, thanks for being here"". They also share pheromones from their face while rubbing against you. Cat behaviorists call this ""bunting"". Bringing you gifts – there are several theories as to why a cat does this. Some believe as a kitten, their mother may have brought them dead prey as food. Your kitty may be thanking you for feeding them or may just be sharing a good hunt. Chewing on plastic or other materials – chewing on milk jug rings, wool blankets, plastic and carpeting may be a sign of a condition known as pica. Pica can develop from anxiety or gastrointestinal disorders. Similar to a persons’ nervous habits like biting their nails or twisting their hair, this is how some cats cope with their anxiety. Chewing on these types of items can cause problems with the cat’s gums and GI tract. This is one behavior that needs a vet consultation. Kneading – the gentle massage you get when your kitty rhythmically presses their paws against you. Kittens start after birth when nursing by using their paws to stimulate milk flow from their mother. Some continue as they grow to express contentment, relieve anxiety and to mark you with their scent. Love of boxes – the need to crawl in any open box no matter if it’s empty or not. Cats feel safer and more secure in smaller spaces. If they were in the wild, cats would seek out a small den so they are not exposed to predators. In your home, they mimic this behavior when they want to be left alone. Failure to cover up their poop – leaving their waste uncovered could indicate more than one issue. It could be a sign of a urinary tract infection as well as an injured paw. Cats tend to avoid the litter box when in pain. See a vet if you think one of these could be the reason. If not a medical reason, your cat may simply not like the litter you are using or it may not be clean enough for them. Another reason could be the box is too small for them to turn around in. Adding additional litter boxes may help with some of these issues. Night crying – we all know the nights we want to sleep and the cat starts meowing keeping us up. Cats are active night creatures. They like to hunt any insects or rodents in your home. Their loud yowling may be from frustration from missing or even elation if they succeeded. Providing toys and food puzzles during the day will help keep them entertained and less likely to feel the need to hunt at night. These are just a few of the unusual behaviors cats express. There are many more that you have probably seen yourself. So when you are feeling unnerved by the cat staring at you, remember they are just speaking to you in one of their many unique ways."
15,The Best Shampoos And Tips on How To Bath Your Cat,pets," Cat owners dread the thought of having to bath their friendly felines. Most cats hate water and can become rather scary when doused with it. While there are a few cats that seem to love water, bathing one that doesn’t is not as hard as it seems. Bathing your cat can be easy if you have a little know-how and the right tools. Here are some tips to make it less stressful and some shampoos that work well. Choosing the right shampoo can be tricky. Shampoo and conditioners used by people tend to dry out your cat’s hair and skin. Mild ingredients, like oatmeal, work well for pets. Check ingredient labels to make sure you shampoo designed for optimal bathing results. Here’s a few that are veterinarian approved with good reviews. Four Paws Magic Coat Cat Tearless Shampoo – water-based with aloe and lanolin Earthbath All Natural Pet Shampoo – all natural Top Performance Fresh Pet Shampoo – Ph balanced reduces itching and flaking Vet’s Best Dry Clean Waterless Cat Bath – leave in foam with aloe, neem oil, vitamin E and oatmeal Bath time is stressful for cats. You want to make them as comfortable as you can. Start bathing your cat when they are a kitten periodically. This will help them adjust to process and make bathing easier as they age. Here are some steps to make it easier for you and your cat. Choose the right time of day. You want your cat to be relaxed and mellow. Kitty will be more receptive if you don’t interrupt their hunting hour. Keep their nails trimmed. Clipping the nails before bath time can prevent scratches during. Get everything ready before you start. You will need a towel, brush, a gentle spray hose or cup, and no-slip mats for you and your cat. Start by brushing out your cat’s coat. This will help remove dead hair, mats and debris. If you see matting in their fur, try to get out as much as you can before bathing as mats will shrink and thicken when wet. Be sure to use warm water. Too cold or too hot can be very uncomfortable for your pet. Sinks work well for small cats and kittens while bathtubs are better for larger cats. Use a gentle spray hose if available on you sink or tub. A plastic pitcher or cup is a good choice also. Don’t rush to get done. Moving slowly and speaking in gentle tones will help keep kitty calm and less stressed. Pour shampoo into your hand and lather as you work your way back to the tail. Always start at the neck and move in the direction of hair growth. Avoid washing your cat’s face and ears. Water can cause ear infections if poured on their head and shampoos can irritate their eyes. If you need to wash their face, use a warm moist cloth instead. Rinse off the shampoo with warm water. Remember to move slowly. Make sure you get all the shampoo out so your cat doesn’t lick any residue off later. Have a helper available in case your cat loses patience which is common at this step. Make sure you dry your kitty thoroughly. Gently pat and rub with a towel until dry. A hair dryer on the lowest setting can work if you cat tolerates it. Always avoid blowing directly in their face as this can dry out their eyes and nose. A wide tooth comb may be needed for additional brushing especially on long haired cats. Reward your special feline with treats and affection after bath time. This is usually a stressful time for them. Hopefully, the treats will be remembered next bath time. Use the tips above and a good shampoo to make bath time less stressful. Keeping your cat clean is an important part of cat ownership. Start when they are young so your cat is prepared for bathing as they get older."
16,People Foods Your Dog Can Eat,pets," Pasta and Rice Your pooch can have pasta once in a while. Just make sure it's plain and cooked. Brown rice is a healthy whole grain your dog may gobble up. Mix some into his regular dog food to liven up his meal. Make human food a treat for your dog -- it should be no more than 5% to 10% of his diet. The rest should be dog food, which supplies the nutrients he needs. Meat What dog doesn't go on alert when there's meat around? Chicken, turkey, lean ground beef, and chuck steak or roast are animal-based proteins, which help dogs grow strong. A few rules apply: •	Always cook meat well. Never serve it raw or undercooked. •	Avoid fatty cuts, including bacon. •	Cut meat -- and any human food -- into easy-to-chew chunks. Ground meat is fine, too. •	Old, moldy, or spoiled meats are not OK. Vegetables Vegetables give your pup vitamins, fiber, and some canine crunch. Try serving these raw veggies grated or finely chopped: carrot, cucumber, zucchini, lettuce, bell peppers, corn (cut off the cob), and celery. You can steam these favorites: green beans, broccoli, asparagus, cauliflower, and hard winter squash. Skip avocado, which can upset her stomach. Don’t give any vegetable or other human food that seems to cause tummy trouble. Treats for Dog-Day Afternoons To cool off a hot dog on a sultry day, give him pet pops. Make them with any food he likes, like veggies or applesauce. Freeze the pops in an ice cube tray. Or whip up some peanut butter pops: •	Mix 1 cup of peanut butter (unsalted is best) with half a mashed, ripe banana or a little water. •	Drop by spoonful onto cookie sheets lined with wax paper and freeze. •	Bread and Pretzels Bite-sized bits of whole wheat bread are good for his gut health. But don't give him raw dough -- it can cause serious stomach problems. He might also go for some pieces of unsalted pretzel. Just skip the salted kind, which can make him extra thirsty and can cause big problems if he eats a lot. Sweet Treats Except for grapes and raisins, most fruits are OK for your pup. Try slices of fresh banana or apple (without the seeds), chunks of cantaloupe or watermelon, blueberries, or orange section. Foods to Help the Meds Go Down Some dogs resist taking pills, especially if they’re big or smell bad. To make one go down easier, hide it in a tasty treat -- like peanut butter or a marshmallow. Make pill time game time if he likes to play catch. Toss him a few pieces of what you plan to hide his meds in, one after another, with the pill in one of them. He may swallow it without even knowing it was there. Ground beef and chicken are other good hiding places. If none of these works, it's OK to use a slice of hot dog. Holiday Foods to Share -- and Skip Too much holiday food is a recipe for doggie distress. But you can give your hound a taste of your celebration. He'll be plenty thankful for tidbits like well-cooked turkey, green beans, and cooked sweet potato in his regular chow. Skip table scraps. They may have ingredients he shouldn't have -- like milk, onions, or garlic. Keep chocolate and cocktails above licking level. Both are toxic. Dogs especially like eggnog and white Russians."

It also opens up the lines of communication between you and your dog and helps to establish acceptable guidelines and boundaries for your dog to follow.

Puppy socialisation and basic obedience training are not negotiable - they simply must be done."

19,Your Dog and Ticks,pets," Ticks are external parasites that feed on the blood of our canine companions. Like mites and spiders, ticks are arachnids. The brown dog tick and the American dog tick are examples of ticks that commonly affect dogs. They require three feedings to complete their life cycles. How are Ticks Transmitted to Dogs?: Ticks are most active from spring to fall. They live in tall brush or grass, where they may attach to dogs playing in these areas. These parasites prefer to stay close to the head, neck, feet and ear area. In severe infestations, however, they can be found anywhere on a dog's body. How Do I Know if My Dog Has Ticks?: Ticks are visible to the naked eye. During the warmer months, it's a good idea to check your dog regularly for these parasites. If you do spot a tick, it is important to take care when removing it. Any contact with the tick's blood can potentially transmit an infection to your dog or even you! Treat the area with rubbing alcohol and pluck the parasite with tweezers, making sure you've gotten the biting head and other body parts. Since it may only take a few hours for a disease to be transmitted from an attached tick, it is ideal for your dog to be evaluated by a veterinarian soon after any ticks are found. Are Certain Dogs Prone to Ticks?:  Ticks can be found all over the world. Dogs who live in warm climates and certain wooded areas of the Northeast, where ticks are more prominent, might be more prone due to increased exposure. What are Some Complications Associated with Ticks in Dogs?: Blood loss, Anemia, Tick paralysis, skin irritation or infections to name a few. Ticks can also transmit diseases such as Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever, all of which can cause serious complications and are potentially fatal without prompt and proper treatment. My Dog Has Been Bitten by a Tick! What Should I Do?: Remove the tick, as noted above, and consult your veterinarian, who will help you to prevent future infestation. Your vet may also perform blood tests to rule out diseases transmitted by ticks. What is Lyme Disease?: Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that can affect humans, dogs, cats and other mammals. Clinical signs include depression, swelling of the lymph nodes, loss of appetite and fever, as well as lameness and swollen, painful joints. Renal failure can also be a consequence of Lyme Disease. What Should I Do If I Think My Dog Has Lyme Disease?: Bring your dog to a veterinarian, who will evaluate your dog for Lyme disease. This includes a physician exam, blood tests and possibly x-rays. How is Lyme Disease Treated?: Your veterinarian can best determine the optimal treatment plan for your dog. Canine Lyme disease is most often effectively treated with antibiotics. With prompt and proper treatment, your dog's condition should start to improve within 48 hours. How Can I Prevent Tick Infestation?: Many of the same products on the market that treat fleas also kill ticks and protect against future infestation. These topical treatments or collars are especially recommended for those dogs who live in areas with high tick populations. Speak to your vet to select the best product for your dog. The key to any successful tick control program lies, literally, in your own backyard. Ensure a tick free lawn by mowing it regularly, removing tall weeds and making it inhospitable to rodents by keeping garbage covered and inaccessible."

1,Is Your Dog at Risk for Diabetes,pets," The rate of diabetes in America's pets has more than tripled since 1970. Today it affects approximately 1 in every 160 dogs.Canine diabetes is a lifetime condition that requires careful blood monitoring and daily insulin injections, unlike human diabetes which can possibly be treated with a controlled diet. Diabetes occurs when the pancreas has the inability to produce insulin, known as Type 1. This is the type that affects virtually all dogs. Dogs can also develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy, just like humans. Diabetes is one of the most common endocrine diseases affecting middle-aged and senior dogs, with 70% of patients older than seven at the time of diagnosis. Diabetes rarely occurs in dogs younger than one year of age and is more common in females and neutered males than in intact males. These breeds may be at higher risk to develop diabetes partially due to genetics. Here are a few breeds that could be in the higher risk range, Keeshonds, Pulis, Cairn Terriers, Miniature Pinchers, Poodles (Miniature and Toy), Samoyeds, Austrailian Terriers, Schnuauzers, Spitz, Fox Terriers, Bichon Frise, Siberian Huskies, and Pugs. It is likely that around 50% of diabetic cases are linked to pancreatic damage caused by autoimmune disorders. This can possibly be attributed to genetics and or environmental factors. It is also possible that diet plays a factor in this diagnosis as well. Chronic inflammation of the pancreas may be attributed to around 30% of canine cases. The pancreatic disease can also result in the deficiency of digestive enzymes. The signs of diabetes can occur several months before the digestive enzyme deficiency appears. There is no clear evidence that obesity causes diabetes in dogs. A dog can develop insulin resistance due to being overweight, making it more difficult to regulate their condition. They can also develop pancreatitis due to obesity, which then can lead to diabetes. Some symptoms of diabetes are excessive thirst as well as more frequent urination. They can also experience weight loss even though they are still eating the same amount and sometimes more than normal. A simple blood and/or urine test can confirm a diabetes diagnosis. Canine diabetes may be complicated when the patient is already ill, such as not eating or vomiting which may require a hospital stay. Uncomplicated cases may be treated at home, which is the most common of the two. With proper treatment, dogs with diabetes can lead a normal life. The first six months is the most crucial due to regulating their insulin. Once that is stabilized, dogs can lead a normal, healthy, and happy life. Exercise should be consistent as far as the type of activity and time of day. Try to avoid intermittent or unplanned strenuous exercise. A good time for regular planned exercise would be 20 to 30 minutes before the evening meal and the administering of insulin. The key to taking care of your dog, if he is diagnosed with diabetes, is to stay on a daily schedule and be consistent. This will enable you to keep his insulin level at a regulated number. Once you know how much he or she needs to eat and what time, as well as the dosage of insulin to be regulated, it is just a matter of doing this the same every day from here on out. This includes whatever exercise plan can be fit into the day to keep the levels regulated. If you deter from this, his insulin will have to be adjusted, thus making a little more difficult for the caretaker/owner."
2,The Devon Rex,pets," Little is known about the ancestry of this breed.  Kirlee, a kitten born in Devon, England, in 1959 was the first recognized cat of the breed.  First thought to be a Cornish Rex, Kirlee, was soon discovered to have a natural genetic mutation.  The Devon Rex is named after his birthplace as well as his curly coat, which has a texture like the rex rabbit.  It wasn’t long after this breeds discovery that it emigrated to the United States.  The breed was fully recognized by the Cat Fanciers Association in 1979. The Devon Rex has a slender medium-sized body.  They are muscular with long, slim legs and small, oval paws.  Their tail is long and fine with short fur that tapers at the end.  With large ears, high cheekbones and striking eyes, they are often described as having an elfin-like appearance.  The Devon’s most outstanding characteristic is their soft, wavy fur.  Some Devon’s have a thin, suede-like coat while others may have a loose, shaggy curl.  A thicker coat of hair covers their back, sides, tail, legs, face, and ears.  The top of their head, chest and abdomen have a more downy-like less dense covering.  The ""rexed"" coat is soft and fine, seeming to be without the harsher guard hairs that most cat coats have.  The Devon Rex can be found in almost any color pattern including solid colors. This is a friendly breed that loves people and being part of the family.  They take an active role in everything you do including sitting down for a meal.  Don’t be surprised to see them take a seat at the table.  They love to eat and will snack whenever the opportunity arises.  The Devon’s favorite perch is sitting on his owner’s shoulder.  They are very agile and have even been caught on top of the door.  Giving them a large climbing space will help keep them active and in shape.  These are smart cats with a moderate activity level.  They will play fetch and enjoy interactive toys which keep them busy while you are away. While the Devon Rex may feel warm, they are always seeking to be warmer.  If you feel cold, they probably do too.  A good sweater will help them retain heat.  They prefer to sleep under the covers and will target the warmest spots they can find.  While they love to bask in the sun, a cat-safe sunscreen is recommended to keep them from burning.  Their wavy coat is easy to maintain and gentle grooming with your hand is usually all it needs.  The Devon doesn’t shed much and the fur is so fine that it is hardly noticeable. The Devon Rex is generally healthy and usually weighs 5 to 10 pounds.  They have a normal life span of 9 to 15 years but can have just a few health problems. •	Congenital hypotrichosis, otherwise known as hereditary baldness •	Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a form of heart disease •	Malassezia dermatitis, a single-celled yeast that causes ear infections, greasy skin and itchiness •	Hip dysplasia, a malformation of the hip socket •	Urticaria pigmentosa, a dermatological problem that causes crusty sores •	Devon Rec myopathy, also called spasticity, a generalized muscle weakness The Devon Rex makes a perfect pet for families with children and cat-friendly dogs.  They are very social and love attention.  If you are looking for new member for your family, the Devon Rex could be just what you are looking for."
3,Discover the Siberian,pets," The Siberian is a glamorous native cat of Russia. They have been known to be around for some 1,000 years and are often part of Russian folktales. Let’s discover more about this beautiful feline. Siberians first came to the United States in 1990 but weren’t recognized by the International Cat Association until 1996. They have a beautiful long coat with large round eyes in a modified wedge-shaped face. Medium-large ears with tufts of fur complete their sweet look. The breed has a reputation for being hypoallergenic due to its lower production of Fel d1 – an antigenic protein. While no cat is truly hypoallergenic, research is being done to see why those with allergies may be able to tolerate this breed. This is a large cat when full grown, averaging 15-20 pounds. It can take up to five years for a Siberian to reach its full size and coat. They are very muscular but also agile. Their hind legs are longer than their front giving them excellent jumping abilities. You may find them balancing on top of a doorway or propelling to the highest point in a room. Siberians are an active and playful cat. They will instigate a game of fetch and will choose any item they find intriguing. Teaching them tricks can be a fun way to challenge their busy brain. Because of their forest dweller heritage, these cats like water. You can find them drinking from fountains or faucets, making puddles by their water dish and even splashing you in the tub. The Siberian has a warm heart and loves people. This affectionate cat will follow you around no matter where you go. Their desire to ""help"" you with everything being the driving force. Siberians are very happy to tell you about their day with quiet, pleasant trills and chirps interspersed with some soft meows and purrs. Sitting in your lap being combed may be the highlight of their day. They have a very calm nature and have potential to be a therapy cat. This is not a needy cat and will wait patiently for you to have time for them. They are not shy around guests and will be a very genial host. Siberians have a thick triple layered coat. An abundant ruff around the neck with slightly shorter hair on the shoulder blades is typical of this breed. They have a muscular body with rounds paws with tufts of fur and a thickly furred tail. Their undercoat will thicken in colder weather and thin in warmer weather. Brushing and combing a couple times a week is necessary to prevent tangles or mats. The coat will shed seasonally in spring and fall requiring more frequent grooming at those times. Bathing is rarely needed and can be difficult due to their water-resistant coat. Other routine care required would be dental hygiene, nail trims and ear cleaning. The Siberian is a hearty and healthy cat with a bold temperament. Not much will ruffle their composure. They are happy to live with other cats and dogs but want them to know they are in charge. When looking for a pet, look at the Siberian to fit in well."
4,Springtime Storms and Your Dog,pets," Thunderstorm phobia in dogs is real, not uncommon, and should not be ignored by owners. In most cases, they don't even grow out of the ""being afraid of storms."" It is up to us, as owners, to make sure they are safe during storms. They begin to pace, pant, hold on to us for dear life, hide in a closet, or some even curl up behind a toilet. If you are not home and your dog is not contained, they may even claw through drywall, chew your carpets, or even break through windows in severe cases. Their panic is real for them and if we are not there to help them, bad situations arise. After discussing this topic with a few veterinarians I know, they commented that they really don't know what triggers these episodes, other than they hear things that we can not. These can be a combination of wind, thunder, lightening, the barometric pressure changes, static electricity, as well as low-frequency rumbles that precede the storm. Again, many of these noises are only heard by your pet and not you. If your dog already suffers from separation anxiety, he or she is more likely to have storm phobia. In many cases, they also react to loud noises, such as fireworks or gunshots. Some dogs are only afraid of storms. Just like humans,  some dogs are only afraid of storms. There are many tools you can use to get your dog through a storm. Reward your dog for CALM behavior at all times during the year. There are     many training options such as practicing with your dog before a storm occurs. Practice getting your dog to settle on command. Use a special ""inside"" leash on your dog and practice having the pet lie at your feet while praising the calm behavior. Do this when storms are not occurring so they get used to the behavior. He will get used to the command ""come on and lie down here."" Remember to reward CALM behavior. Giving your dog a safe place where he can go in a storm. You can use your basement where is quiet and he may not hear the storm and/or keep his crate open if that is where he feels safe. Allow him free access to come and go so he doesn't feel anxious. In preparation for storm season, play recordings of thunderstorms on low while giving him treats or playing games. After he is feeling comfortable, increase the volume over the course of the training, and if he begins showing signs of anxiety, stop the process. The goal is to get your dog used to the sound of thunder and associate it with good things. Always get advice from your veterinarian. He may have many other options for you, such as behavior modification, as well as anti-anxiety medication if necessary. Some dogs require a combination of behavior therapy and medication. They may only need the medication during storm season, however, you may notice they do  better with it all the time."
5,Teacup Kittens,pets," The teacup kitten isn’t a true breed but more of a description of a group of cats with a smaller than average body size.  Teacup kittens are available in a range of different breeds.  The smallest cats of one breed are bred with the smallest cats of another breed to progressively product these tiny kittens. An average female cat weighs between 10-14 pounds while an average male cat weighs between 12-17 pounds.  A teacup female will weigh between 3-6.5 pounds with a male weighing between 3-7.5 pounds.  Weight is a good way to measure if a cat is a true teacup cat.  Some sellers may try to convince you a small kitten will stay small but that is not always the case.  Just because a cat weighs less than 10 pounds doesn’t make it a true teacup. There are two forms of dwarfism that causes their miniature size.  The first is anchondroplastic, where the dominant gene, through mutation, affects the bone growth hormones. The second is primordial dwarfism which occurs naturally. The MiniPer is the most popular of the teacup breeds.  They were developed by Cher Simmit in California by breeding Persians and Exotics.  This produced a primordial dwarf with a proportionate body size smaller than the standard Persian or Exotic.  The MiniPaw is a hybrid and carries both the anchodroplastic and primordial gene.  The combination of both dwarfism genes produces a cat with small proportions and shortened legs which are somewhat deformed. The Lambkin was developed by breeding a Munchkin with a Selkirk Rex.  This is still considered an experimental breed and are very rare.  They have a soft curly coat that resembles the coat of a lamb thus their name.  Regular grooming is needed to keep them looking good.  They have an easy-going personality and are very affectionate.  With a long tail and body with short legs, they are generally very healthy. The newest breed is the Napoleon.  Named after Napoleon Bonaparte, this is a hybrid of the Munchkin and the Persian.  They combine traits from both breeds to create a unique look with short legs, large round eyes and a colorful coat.  Often referred to as small, round and sweet, this kitten is very playful and loving.  Regular grooming will depend upon the length of their dense coat.  A shorter coat should be groomed weekly while a longer coat requires more frequent brushing. Some health issues can arise from the inbreeding used to create these adorable kittens.  They range from neurological and cardiovascular problems to deformities and even a shortened lifespan.  Professional breeders are careful to match pairs to produce healthy cats.  Unfortunately, some unscrupulous breeders are not as thoughtful so be sure to purchase from a registered breeder. Most of the teacup kittens are cross breeds of the Persians and Exotics.  These are the most sought after of the small breeds.  The toy versions of these breeds have the same physical traits and characteristics of the standard breed. As they mature, they will lose some of their more kitten-like behavior but will still be loving and affectionate."
6,Norwegian Forest Cats Traits,pets," The Norwegian Forest Cat has a history going back hundreds and maybe even thousands of years. This native cat of Norway, thrives in cooler temperatures and their lineage can be traced back to the Vikings. It is still a mystery as to where they originated but some claim they could be descendants of long-haired cats from Turkey. Another theory claims, they are related to the Siberian cat from Russia. Or they could simply have been the result of short-haired cats adapting to the harsh neat-Artic climate which produced descendants with wooly undercoats and long, water shedding topcoats. The skogcatt - a Norwegian word that means ""forest cat"" – learned to survive by its wits. They are great mousers and earned their keep with farmers and housewives by ridding their homes of rodents. These cats were first exhibited in 1938 at a show in Oslo. World War II derailed plans for developing their breed. It took until 1977 for this breed to finally be registered with Europe’s Federation International Feline. A pair of Norwegian Forest Cats were exported to the United States in 1979, which has increased its popularity in Europe and the US. Characteristics This is a bigger cat. They have a long body and long legs which give them extraordinary climbing abilities. Fables claim they can climb cliffs by the sheer strength of their claws. Their head has a longer triangular shape with tufted ears and a wide base as well as a characteristically bushy tail. They have a very thick, water repellant coat that allows them to survive in extremely cold climates. Males can range from 13 to 22 pounds or more. Females are slightly smaller. They mature slowly and are full grown at about 5 years of age. Personality This gentle and friendly feline enjoys being part of the family but doesn’t demand constant attention. They are happy to just be in the room with you but can be rather reserved with guests. The Norwegian Forest Cat or Wegie as nicknamed, is not much of a lap cat but does enjoy a good scratch between the ears or under the chin. This usually soft spoken kitty, may become more vocal when its wants something or feels ignored. Climbing is a favorite pastime for these cats. They have no problem scaling up to the highest point in the house or descending from any area headfirst. Due to their wilderness background, Wegies think nothing of fishing in a body of water for a good meal. Aquariums or koi ponds are certainly not safe from this behavior. While the lovey being outdoors, they can be just as content to live indoors. Care Norwegian Forest Cats are generally a healthy cat. They have a long life span of 14 to 16 years. Some diseases seen in the breed are: glycogen storage disease IV, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, polycystic kidney disease, and retinal dysplasia. Bathing is usually needed which is good due their practically waterproof coat. Weekly brushing or combing is needed to help deter tangles in their long hair. The Norwegian Forest Cat is a playful, intelligent cat with a friendly demeaner. Given the right amount of affection and attention, these cats will live a long and happy life."

8,The Feelings of A Pet Owner,pets," Having had pets throughout my childhood and adulthood, I can honestly say that pets give you a sense of satisfaction that nothing else compares to. Choosing an active pet can have multiple benefits. People tend to stay ""young"" with trying to keep up with their wild activities. They can also give a person a feeling of self-respect since you are taking care of something that requires your attention at all times. They rely on you to take of them.

Happiness is something everyone requires and is well deserved. It makes life so enjoyable and worth living when you share it with your pet. People with emotional, physical, social and medical disabilities use them for confidence and guidance. They become part of their family and they make them feel safe and happy. The police force uses them as deputies in an effort to keep our country safe. They become so close to the officers as they are very much like their human partner. Having a pet improves the health and self-esteem of any person who owns one. They make you more physically fit and the tendency to become lonely quickly goes away. Your pet will love to go on walks with you, which then gives you the exercise you desire. They can also make people feel better after experiencing rejection. The psychological benefits are very successful. They are amazing healers. There have been studies done in the past indicating that pet owners were happier, healthier and better adjusted than non-owners. I don't know the particulars of the study, but being a pet owner myself, it only stands to reason that this is a true statement. Your physical and mental health is an important part of daily living. There are plenty of pets that are in need of adoption. Owning a pet doesn't have to be a huge expense. The pets at the shelter need someone to love and take care of them. They need someone who will pay attention to them, feed and water them, make them feel like they matter. Often times, they come from a situation that wasn't ideal and may have even included abuse. You will have a challenge, but believe me, it will be the best decision you will ever make. Removing a precious dog from a bad situation will make you feel so strong, self-confident, caring and like you did the best thing ever.

9,Friendliest Cats,pets," Cats, like people, have lots of different personalities.

So, if you are looking for a true snuggler, look for one of these breeds. Scottish Fold – These cats are extremely friendly and love to cuddle. They have a great temperament and enjoy children. Their patience is so good, they will usually allow you to dress them in doll clothes. The Scottish Fold loves to be near its owner. It will follow if you get up to move out of the room.

10,Dogs Resemble Humans,pets," Growing research finds that man's best friend acts more like humans than canines. This comes as no surprise to dog owners. Dogs can watch television, display jealousy, have empathy, and even read our facial expressions. Their evolution reveals that they have picked up these tendencies from being wolves to domesticated pets. The things that mimick our behaviors are that they get along with us, they pay attention to us, and they tolerate us. Believe it or not, dogs are people watchers. This allows them to determine who is nice and who is not. This is an instinct from many, many years ago. I feel this is a behavior which allows them to make their owner's safe from harms way. In a new study, dogs were divided up into three groups: the helper, the non-helper, and the controller. In the non-helper group, the owner asked for help from another person, who denied the request to help by turning their back without helping. In the control group, the additional person turned his back without being asked to help. In all the experiments, another neutral person sat in the room. After the first round of experiments, all 3 of the people offered treats to the dog. The result was in the non helper group, the dogs most frequently favored the treat of the neutral person. In the helper group, the dogs did not favor the the helper or the non-helper over the neutral person. So, the question is this, are dogs ignoring the people who are mean to their owners? Future research studies will tell. It is thought that dogs only follow human interactions when food or toys are involved.  New research shows that untrained dogs can interact in ways that do not include food and/or toys. As far as trained dogs, they have a tendency to only follow the face of their owner, rather than where they are looking. Humans short-term memory declines during the aging process, as well as logical reasoning skills. This makes it more difficult  to learn new tasks. Research finds similar declines in dogs, however, long term memory is a mystery in the biology of the dog. The researchers are now studying how the dogs both young and old memorize tasks, and whether they can remember these tasks months later. The results are a work in progress, but not impossible. Who ever said you can't teach an old dog new tricks? For instance, the untrained dog will follow the owner to the door while the trained dog will keep his eye on the owner at all times. When training the untrained dog for 5 minutes to look at the owner rather than the door, he no longer looked at the door. This is a surprising study because this behavior demonstrates that the dog reacts like a human or a chimp in this case. It is called ""double looking."" Researchers have a very interesting position with following the human verses dog interactions."
11,Small Cat Breeds,pets," Everyone knows that kittens are small but they don’t usually stay that way. Many people don’t realize that there are some breeds that stay small. So here are a few breeds that do. Singapura The Singapura is considered the smallest of the cat breeds. These cuties grow to weigh between 5 and 8 pounds which is about half the size of a normal cat. They have large eyes and long ears with a petite, delicate frame. Their markings are like the ticked tabby. Singapura’s love to climb and have a very busy and playful personality. These are very loving cats and need lots of attention. Engaging them in activity multiple times each day will help keep them healthy. The origin of the Singapura is unclear. It is thought that cats from Singapore where exported to the US then taken back over. The result was the Singapura breed. It was then recognized in Japan as a formal breed by cat breeders. Munchkin The Munchkin breed is slightly smaller than the average cat but has short legs. This breed was established in the 1980’s and are very energetic. Their running and jumping abilities are close to that of a normal sized cat but they may not be able to jump quite as high. These cats weigh between 5 and 9 pounds and are bred to emphasize their dwarfism. The shortness of their legs is caused by a genetic mutation. This mutation can cause some health issues but generally these are healthy cats. Cornish Rex The Cornish Rex has a different look from most cats. They don’t have any outer layers of hair. They are covered in a soft wavy under coat that feels like down feathers. These are a petite cat with features similar to the Siamese as well as being very intelligent. With a slender body and big ears, the Cornish Rex is very affectionate and creates a strong bond with its owner. These cat weigh between 6 and 10 pounds and retain a kitten-like appearance and personality. Devon Rex The Devon Rex has some similarities to the Cornish Rex but they are not closely related. Both breeds come from the same area in England but have a different genetic mutation. These cats have a slender body, big ears and a waxiness to their coats. The Devon Rex is a highly intelligent cat and can be taught tricks, similar to a dog. These cats weigh between 5 and 10 pounds and have a bold personality. American Curl The American Curl is typically a smaller breed but can come in a range of sizes. Their name is derived from the outward curl on the end of its ears. This ""earl curl"", as it’s called, requires some extra care from their owners to keep their ears clean. Their ears are rather delicate so you need to be careful around them. The American Curl is very active and friendly. They make great family pets and weigh between 5 and 10 pounds. There are three types of small cat breeds. These are dwarf, miniature and teacup. While there are subtle differences between them, they all have the common trait of being smaller when full grown. You should be warned that when seeking a small cat that not all petite cats are true miniatures."
12,Hairless Cat Breeds,pets," Cats are often referred to as long-haired or short-haired but some are actually considered hairless. These breeds can range from completely bald to having a fine downy coat. Anyone looking to bring home one of these unique kitties has a few breeds to consider. The Sphynx is a breed with a fine downy coat. It's often described as being the same texture as chamois. Their skin has a pattern just like their fur would have if they had any. It will appear to be solid, tabby or even another pattern. This breed was created in the 1960's by selective breeding of naturally hairless cats. They have large ears, a wedge shaped head and large lemon-shaped eyes. They are very muscular with a medium size body. Sphynx cats are extroverts who love attention and are very affectionate. The Bambino is considered an experimental breed. It was first registered with the International Cat Association in 2005. These cats were created by crossing a Sphynx with a Munchkin, a breed with a reduced leg size and large upright ears. This typically produces a hairless cat with short legs. Their skin is usually white or pink so protection from the sun is necessary. Being hairless also means they are vulnerable to the cold. The Donskoy was first registered in 1987 and originated in Rostov-on -Don, Russia. It was officially recognized as an international breed in 1997. It has a similar appearance to the Sphynx but the lack of hair is caused by a different gene. These are medium sized cats with almond shaped eyes, large ears and a muscular build. Their skin is oily due to their lack of hair so some grooming is necessary. The Peterbald is another created breed from Russia. This breed is a cross between a Donskoy and an Oriental Shorthair. They have the looks and body shape of an oriental breed but are hairless. They are recognized by their slim muscular bodies, almond shaped eyes, wide set big ears and wedge shaped muzzle. The Ukrainian Levkoy has a very different look than any other cat. It has ears that fold inward similar to the Scottish Fold as well as being hairless. It is mainly found in the Ukraine and Russia and only recognized by the Ukrainian and Russian cat clubs. This is perhaps the strangest looking cat you'll ever see. The Lykoi was developed in Memphis Tennessee. It is a naturally occurring mutation of a domestic shorthair. They are black with a wedge shaped head and sleek elegant body. It is typically hairless with markings that resemble a werewolf, giving them their name. Being hairless does not mean these cat are low maintenance. They need protection from the sun as they can suffer from sunburn and are very susceptible to the cold. Even though they don't have hair, they usually require bathing or washing. Their bodies still produce sebum, a substance used to keep fur in good condition. If not cared for, it can cause dry, flaky skin and sometimes sore spots."
13,Black Cat Facts and Folklore,pets," There are many superstitions and tales surrounding black cats. Some people see them as bad luck while others feel their an omen of good luck. While most people focus on the folklore, there are also some interesting characteristics of black cats. Here are some facts and folklore that you may find intriguing. Black cats eyes are usually golden or yellow. This is due to an over-production of melanin that gives their fur its deep black color. It often causes the cat's irises to reflect the melanism in the pigment of their eyes creating the golden or yellow color. High exposure to sunlight can make their fur temporarily appear rusty reddish-brown. This is common when the cat has is missing an enzyme called tyrosine. In parts of Ireland and England, if a black cat crosses your path, its considered good luck. Its considered a sign of prosperity in Scotland if a strange black cat arrives at your home. Ancient Egyptians felt that cats were sacred and lucky. They were considered a symbol of the goddess of protection, Bastet, who has the head of a cat. Black cats were associated with witchcraft in the Middle Ages. Any single elderly women that cared for cats were considered witches and the cats their accomplices. Studies indicate that black cats may be more resistant to some diseases like Feline HIV. It also shows their immune system may benefit from their genetic makeup. It is considered good luck to give a bride a cat in the English Midlands of Great Britain. Single Japanese women look at black cats as good luck.

Pirates consider a black cat approaching as bad luck. If the feline walks up to the ship then stops and decides to leave, it is considered an omen that the ship is going to sink.

Most cats have a tabby gene, which is suppressed by the black gene in true black cats. If the gene is not fully suppressed, you will be able to see faint striping on their legs or tails. Whether you believe in all the folklore or not, these are beautiful felines. Growing appreciation of them has lead to more adoptions of black cats. Remember there is work when you get any cat, but the rewards far out weigh the work."
14,Summertime Furry Fun,pets," Taking your furry friend camping is so much fun. You can enjoy each other as well as enjoying family and friends. Nature is such a peaceful environment. We have had a summer campsite for over 20 years. Our first dog got to enjoy the friendships of many other pets as well as lots of human friends for 16 years. He absolutely loved going and come Friday, he knew before I started packing where he was going. Our permanent spot made it much easier to pack since everything was pretty much already there. He would jump in the vehicle and sit and wait until we were loaded and out the driveway. The trip was around a 45 minute drive and he could not wait till we got there. As we would get closer he would begin looking out the window and getting more and more excited. He could tell how close we were by the landmarks along the way. Once there he could hardly wait until we were unloaded and away we went. He enjoyed visiting all his friends and family every weekend. Since he was a Mountain Treeing Feist he was always hunting squirrel along with many other wildlife critters. Keeping him on a lease was a struggle but for his safety it was a must. Here are a few safety suggestions when taking your own dog camping. As I mentioned, always use a leash and watch the surroundings when going into the woods.It is always a good idea to carry a backpack with essential items, such as flea and tick repellent, snacks for training, and extra items in case your hike ends of being longer than planned. Another topic would be to always clean up after your dog no matter if you are hiking or just relaxing at your campsite. Carrying doggie bags should become a habit. Another topic would be getting a lease that is long enough to stretch from one area to another. like from tree to tree. That way your doggie can run and get exercise, however, do not leave him unattended as the leash could get tangled and cause him harm. And lastly I leave you with one of my favorite topics and that is the enjoyable campfire. Please make sure your furry friend is safe and not too close to cause harm. My doggie loved the campfires and would just sit on my lap and enjoy the moment. Now, take your furry friend camping and ENJOY what nature has provided for us. Relax and enjoy this special time with your doggy or doggies. They will love you for it."
15,Understanding Your Cats Communication,pets," Cats have always been considered rather mysterious creatures. While cats have a universal way to communicate with each other, they have different ways of communicating with us. Every cat has a different personality but loving owners come to recognize their unique traits. Here are some ways they express themselves. Body Language Cats are quick, active and muscular felines. They have athletic bodies and move gracefully. Their lean bodies can be very expressive. When your cat sprawls out in front of you, he is feeling confident and relaxed. If he rolls onto his back showing his belly, he is feeling lazy and in good spirits. This is considered a sign that he feels loved and protected. If his paws are curved under him, he is feeling secure. Eye Contact Your cats eyes are very expressive. When your cat stares into your eyes, it's considered a gesture of affection. Researchers claim, if your cat stares into your eyes than blinks, opens its eyes wide, stares and blinks again, that this is like your cat giving you a kiss. A sure sign that he trusts and loves you. If his eyes are dilated, this is a sign of fear. Watch your cats eyes, dilated pupils mean something has caused fear in him. When they become aggressive, their eyes may turn into narrow slits. Tail Movement A cats' tail will give you insight into your cats mind. When they hold their tail straight up, they are demonstrating confidence and pride. They move with a pompous regal stride. If your cat has its tail upright with a slight curve at the top, this is considered a sign of happiness and warmth. Watch for the fluffy bottle brush tail. This is an indication of fear and false courage. Your cat may greet you with quick swings of its tail which means he's happy to see you. Purring Purring is probably the most known form of communication owners recognize. While there are many mysteries behind purring, most owners feel it means their cat is happy. Many times cats purr when you scratch that special spot or rub against their head while relaxing. It means your living with your kitty in harmony. This is, no doubt, the best sound cats make. However, your cat may purr if it's in pain as well. Vocal Sounds Cats can very vocal when they want. When dinner time is approaching, your cat may follow you around meowing for his food. Other times, he may meow to try to locate you in the house. When he's playful, he may ""talk"" to encourage you to play. Of course, we all know of the high-pitched screech a cat can make when frightened. Following You Your cat truly enjoys your company when he follows you around. He may jump from surface to surface just to be close to you. This is thought to be a very loving gesture and says he wants to spend time with you. Every cat has a different way to communicate with us. They show their feelings in ways we don't always recognize. Watch for some of these common signs to see how your cat is feeling."
16,Feathered Friends Are Welcomed,pets," A brown speckled wren wiggles its way in and out of the screened suet feeder.  Every now and then he flies over to the deck railing, shakes his head to remove the fat from his rather long beak and then makes his way back to the suet.  Overlooking this wren, are twenty-eight mourning doves perched in a nearby leafless maple tree.   There are many daily visitors feeding at the other couple of feeders.  These visitors include, gold and purple finches in their winter colors, pine siskins, colorful male and female cardinals, tufted titmouse, black eyed juncos, house sparrows, chickadees, downy woodpecker, blue jays, red bellied woodpecker, and many other types.  Most of these birds spend the year here to include winter, nesting and perching in nearby foliage.  The foliage provides protection from harsh weather and predators, while the bird feeders provide a source of food, especially during extremely cold temperatures when food sources are limited. Across the United States there are over 65 million households providing food for wild birds.  Is this a good thing?  As with most topics, there are always two sides to the conversation.  Bird feeders can attract predators, both wild and domesticated.   Certainly, hawks or other predatory birds can be drawn to gatherings of song birds.  There is a hawk that frequently is spotted around this area of Webster Lake in Massachusetts.  He has perched on our deck and feeders occasionally.  Other than seeing him, the way we know he is around is everything is quiet and the other birds disappear.   Eventually he takes off and seeks dinner elsewhere.   Once gone, the birds return.  They seem to have an instinct to seek cover when a predator is in the area.  The best cover for birds is surrounding vegetation.  We can provide protection by planting flowers, scrubs, and trees in the vicinity.  These plantings serve multiple purposes for the birds in that they provide food, protection, and a place to nest. Certain types of birds travel and live in flocks.  As with humans, most diseases are spread amongst birds when they are near each other.  Various types of finches are known to congregate in large numbers at feeders.  In this situation, diseases can be easily spread.  The way to reduce this possibility is to keep some distance between feeders.  Also, clean the feeders and surroundings on a regular basis.  Discard wet and old food.  These simple actions will help reduce the risk of spreading disease among your feathered friends. There are some basic rules to follow for those of us that love to feed our birds.  Larger feeders are better than smaller ones.  This ensures the birds have a consistent supply of food.  Multiple feeders are another solution.  Our friends do need to stock up on calories to make it through those long cold winter nights.  Nutritious and high energy seeds and suet are great.  Suet is considered high energy because it consists of high calorie fat.  Same as us, eating fat means more calories.   In the case of birds, they burn it off trying to stay warm.  Water is critical.  Birds still need access to water in the winter and often it is hard to find due to the freezing temperatures.  The more water you can provide, the better to keep your visitors from becoming dehydrated. A lesson learned is that not everyone loves birds as some of us do.  I was sitting on our deck one warm spring morning, enjoying the chorus of song birds in the surrounding trees.  A visitor of ours commented on how it was never quiet.  I understood the point, but my preference is to listen to those beautiful songs.  One of my favorite singers is the Baltimore oriole when he drops in for a visit.  Last year, they were around for several weeks.  Other occasional visitors include blue herons, rose breasted grosbeaks, cow birds, flickers, blue birds, mallards, and others.  All of them are welcome in our yard, whether they are here for a quick bite or staying for the long haul."

They can be easily recognized by their distinct body type and fun personalities. Siamese cats have a wide range of skin colors and markings. Lets look at some more cool facts about them. The Siamese cat is originally from Thailand, formerly known as Siam. They are one of the oldest domestic cat breeds. In Siam, they were considered a member of the royal family. You can find them depicted in ancient manuscripts dating back to 1350. They were so well liked that, in 1871, this blue-eyed cat was on display in the Crystal Palace of London.

20,Choosing the Best Food for Your Cat,pets," Everyone deciding to bring home a cat or kitten needs to decide what cat food is best. What most people don’t realize is that cats have specific needs to be met just like humans. Let’s look at what your cat needs to stay healthy. Cats are naturally carnivores. This means they are geared to consume mostly protein in their diet. When a cat hunts, it will get protein from the muscle meat of the animals it eats. This meat also provides them with taurine, an important nutrient needed to maintain good health. A cat also needs to be well hydrated just like we do. They do not naturally drink lots of water. Outdoor cats usually get most of the moisture they need from the prey they consume. Inside cats need our help to make sure they get all the fluids they need. Always leave a fresh bowl of water out for them to drink from but remember this may not give them enough fluids through out the day. A good cat food will help with this. A good combination of wet and dry foods is best. Canned cat food typically has a high moisture content, between 75% and 78%. This is a great way for them to get the moisture they need to stay well hydrated. Serving about 3/4th of their diet in canned food will help maintain their good health. Giving the additional 1/4th of their food as a dry food will help keep their teeth cleaned and in good shape. Choosing the right food is very important. Not all canned foods have the nutrients needed to keep your kitty healthy. Check the label for the main ingredients. Chicken, beef or fish should be listed as the main ingredient. Check for a good concentration of the meal in the product. Many manufacturers use smaller amounts so read the label well to make sure the protein is the main ingredient. If the label lists ""formula"" or ""dinner"" it will usually have a lower concentration of the main ingredient. Likewise, reading the label on dry food is just as important. Many dry foods have high plant-based proteins. A cats digestive system is not designed to digest the cellulose found in plants. Look for the same main ingredients as in canned food for high quality dry foods. Proteins should make up approximately 40% of your cats diet. Fats should be around 1/3rd of it. This is why it is so important to choose food with high protein and also the right amount of fat. It is also important to check the carbohydrate level and source. Look for the carbohydrate level to be less than 50%. The main source of carbs should come from vegetables and rice not corn meal. You also want the food to have good amounts of vitamins and minerals like omega-3, taurine and fiber. Look for foods that use natural preservatives rather than artificial ones. Vitamin C and vitamin E are good preservatives and are good for your cat's health. If your cat is used to eating dry food now, introducing wet food can be a challenge. Never make drastic changes to your pets diet. Introduce new foods gradually. There are several types of wet foods available such as pate, flakes and chunks. Texture is important to cats so finding one they like make be tricky. Experiment with the different varieties to find the one they like best. While adjusting to wet foods, try adding small amounts of water to their dry food to increase moisture consumed as well as reduce the crunch. Just remember, the health of your cat is dependent on their diet. Providing a good combination of dry and wet food will help maintain your cats good health. This will give you many happy healthy years with your beloved furry friend."

1,Choosing a Cat Breed to Fit Your Family,pets," It's an exciting time when you decide to add a cat to the family. There are many things to look at when choosing the best breed for your family and life style. Some are affectionate while others can be more independent. Some breeds require daily grooming and others need minimal extra care. No matter the breed you choose, adding that special kitty to the family is a big time for everyone. Here are some breeds to consider. Persian This beautiful longhaired feline is perhaps the calmest breed in general. They have a wide range of colors, cute facial features and resemble a big fluff ball. While they do require daily grooming and frequent bathing, these graceful cats tend to be low energy and loving creatures. Persians are good additions to households with children and other animals. They need lots of love and affection. Persians will often choose one person as their favorite but will be loving to the rest of the family as well. Exotic Shorthair The Exotic Shorthair is a short haired cousin of the Persian. They have all the best characteristics of that breed, including the squashed facial features, but don't require the intensive amount of grooming. These are very affectionate and gentle creatures. While they are still a calm and quiet cat, they do enjoy showing off their athletic nature. Providing a cat tree and climbing space will keep them happy. Himalayan The Himalayan is a cross between a Persian and a Siamese. They have the beautiful longhaired coat of the Persian with the Siamese markings. Himalayans' enjoy playing but are not high energy. They are usually well behaved and calm. They make a good choice for families with children and other pets. British Shorthair The British Shorthair is playful and smart. They have a shorthaired coat and are compact in nature. They enjoy playing but can spend just as much time cuddling. The Shorthair is especially good with children and other pets. They make great family additions. Ragdoll The Ragdoll is a quiet and very affectionate breed. They enjoy playing and being around people most of the time. With that in mind, they do not do well when left alone for long periods of time. They are not well suited for outdoors so keeping them inside is recommended. This breed gets its name from the way it behaves when picked up. It will go limp in your arms like a ragdoll. They are also very intelligent and will learn tricks similar to a dog. This cat is a larger but gentle breed. They make an excellent choice if someone in the family is normally wary of cats. Abyssinian The Abyssinian has a wonderful unique ticked tabby coat. With their graceful sleek bodies, they are often called the supermodel of cats. They are an outgoing and friendly breed that loves to play. The Abyssinian enjoys swimming and are very accepting of the people they meet. They are very loyal and will lavish their owners with affection. Somali The Somali love to be the center of attention. They are very playful most of their lives but would rather curl up in your lap and cuddle first. They are very affectionate and enjoy showing their owners their love. Whatever the breed you choose, consider the cats characteristics as well as your home life. Many cats are true cuddlers' and need that time with family. Remember, a cats average lifespan is 15-20 years. This is a big commitment for any family so look for a cat that will be happy in your home and make your family happy too."
2,Keep Your Cat Safe From Holiday Plants,pets," Lots of people know that some holiday plants are poisonous to pets. Mistletoe and Holly are some of the best known but did you ever think about your Christmas tree? Most pet owners worry about them tipping it over but don’t think about if their pet eats it. Christmas is a time for many new things to be added to your home. Families want their home to be festive and colorful.  This means bringing in beautiful plants and live trees.  Most cats can’t resist chewing on the holiday plants and tree. Many of these plants are poisonous to your cat. There are different levels of toxicity from mild to extreme. The amount of plant ingested is related to the level of poisoning.  Kittens are the most curious about the new green plants.  Dose is size dependent, so kittens have a greater risk of plant poisoning. Christmas Trees Christmas trees are considered mildly toxic. The oils of the fir tree can irritate the mouth and stomach, causing excessive drooling or vomiting. Christmas tree needles are not easily digested. This could possibly cause GI irritation, vomiting, gastrointestinal obstruction or puncture. Artificial trees can also be dangerous if eaten. The main worry is the toxin released from the artificial material and possible intestinal obstruction.  The needles can not be digested by your cat. As noted earlier, the amount consumed will determine the amount of worry needed. Most times, cats don’t consume very much tree substance. An additional safety note would be to consider the tree water. Pesticides, fertilizers and other preservative agents are commonly used to keep the tree fresh. These can be harmful or deadly to any cats that may drink it. Try to use a covered tree water dish to be safe. Holiday Plants Bright holiday plants make great decorations and gifts this time of year. They may also pose threats to your pet from mild to severe toxicity potential. Poinsettia plants have often be labeled as highly toxic.  This is actually just an urban legend.  Poinsettia plant sap is considered mildly toxic or irritating. It may cause vomiting or nausea but does not typically cause death. Mistletoe and Holly are both considered to be moderately to severely toxic. The berries as well as the leaves pose a problem.  If ingested, contact your veterinarian or poison control center for advice immediately. Lilies and Daffodils are considered very toxic for your cat. This would also include the Amaryllis and Narcissus plants. Your cat rubbing against the lily plant can be just as severe as them eating it. When your cat grooms themselves to clean up, they are ingesting the pollen from the plant. Any bulb kit featuring one of the plants in the lily or daffodil family, could pose a threat to your pet. Try to keep any of these plants away from your cat. Severe symptoms such as cardiac arrhythmias, kidney failure, gastrointestinal signs, convulsions and even death can occur. What to Look For If you think your cat may have eaten some of your plants or Christmas tree, watch for any changes in their behavior. Most common signs related to toxic plant ingestion are vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and sometimes excessive drooling. Tremors or seizures may be seen is some cases when Holly berries have been ingested. Coma and death are common in these cases."

6,What You Should Know about Your Dog's Separation Anxiety,pets," People always talk about having separation anxiety when their loved ones go on extended holidays or get assigned to work in far-flung areas. But what many don't realize is that humans are not the only creatures that can experience this feeling. Dogs also develop separation anxiety, and it can become a problem both for them and their owners when the condition becomes severe. Why do dogs have separation anxiety? There are several events that can trigger What You Should Know about Your Dog's Separation Anxiety in dogs. Those that are given up by their previous families and placed in shelters often exhibit this behavioral problem. This is also the case for dogs whose families have moved to a new home and those that have lost a human family member (either because of death or moving away). Dogs whose owners change their schedule can also experience separation anxiety. For example, if you used to work at home but then get a new job in an office, your dog might get anxious when you leave for work since he's used to having you at home the whole day. Separation anxiety versus simulated anxiety Just because you have a seemingly sad dog doesn't mean he's automatically going through separation anxiety. He might be experiencing simulated anxiety, which has similar symptoms with the former but is actually a type of learned dog behavior. Simulated anxiety happens when the dog mainly wants to get his owners' attention. For instance, if your dog frequently jumps on you, you might push him away to show that you don't like his behavior. But, while the action might have a negative connotation on you, your dog might actually interpret it as positive since he got you to notice him. As a result, he'll develop the habit of jumping on you when he wants your attention. So how do you tell if your sad dog has simulated anxiety or true separation anxiety? Well, if your dog has the former, he'll usually exhibit negative behavior most of the time; if he has the latter, he'll usually behave badly only when you're out of the house. Signs of separation anxiety Different dogs exhibit different behaviors, but there are several common signs that you should look out for. These include: •	Howling •	Excessive barking •	Pacing in a circular pattern or a straight line •	Digging (particularly in points of exit like doors and windows), sometimes in an attempt to escape •	Chewing on objects other than his toys, or excessively chewing to the point of destroying his toys •	Urinating or defecating, with some dogs even exhibiting coprophagia (eating their excrement) How to reduce or eliminate separation anxiety One of the first things you should do is to remove leaving and arriving cues (such as fussing over your dog when you get in the door). Acting like going to work and coming home are a big deal can actually make your dog more anxious, so go through your routine quietly and act like it's a normal part of the day that your pet should get used to. If your dog has mild separation anxiety, you can calm him down by giving him an activity toy that's filled with delicious treats when you leave. This can distract him from your departure since his attention will be focused on extracting his snacks from the toy. It will also make him associate his alone time with a positive experience (i.e. enjoying yummy snacks). If your dog has moderate to severe separation anxiety, he won't be easily distracted with food. Because of this, the best thing you can do is to get the help of experts, like us here at Atlanta Dog Trainer. Through our professional dog training services, we can help your pet recover from separation anxiety and develop good dog behavior."
7,Horse Sense,pets," When I gazed into the calm, round eyes of the auburn-coloured quarter-horse, I thought of all the people who ask me, ""Do animals have souls?’ Miss Tanya snuffled as I rubbed the underside of her head, and I imagined her saying, ""This human is okay. By the way, do you have an apple for me?"" The racehorse’s owners wanted my friend Brian, an animal acupuncturist, to treat Miss Tanya’s skittishness, and Brian had asked me to accompany him, so I could link with this beautiful horse’s soul and try to find out why Miss Tanya was so frenzied whenever she stepped onto a race track. Carlotta, one of the horse’s owners, cocked a skeptical eyebrow when Brian asked about bringing me, but she shrugged and said she’d try anything. Horse racing is an expensive sport, and after spending thousands of dollars on training and upkeep, Miss Tanya wasn’t living up to her potential Brian and I arrived at the stables to find six horses in or around their stalls. A young stable hand was combing the silvery mane of a palomino. Two horses were being led around the ring for exercise. Brian pointed out his favorite mare, Saladin, a jet-black Arabian that looked like he spent his life posing for statues. His neck was the size of an armload of baseball bats. In her stall, calmly munching hay was Miss Tanya. She stood 15 hands high, and her well defined muscles stood out beneath her sleek brown coat. When we approached her, she raised her head and snorted, then chuffed twice and dipped her head into her water trough. Carlotta regarded me with a smile. She gestured with her chin at Miss Tanya and said, ""She’s just letting you know who’s boss."" ""Yes, ma’m,"" I told the horse, then gently stroked her head. I love horses. They’re such wonderful, loving, wise animals, and so attuned to their emotions. Miss Tanya looked at me and blinked twice. I felt a twinge of sadness. Miss Tanya seemed to nod, then nuzzled my hand. I wished I had a fistful of oats to give her. Keeping my eyes locked on the horse, I said, ""She doesn’t feel like she’s being listened to."" Carlotta snickered as she pulled back her thick dark hair and tied it into a ponytail. ""She’s not the only one. Honestly, sometimes, I think none of these horses give a fig about anything I do for them."" How do you feel? I silently asked Miss Tanya. I’m bored, seemed to be the reply. I want to run around outside. I don’t know how much time passed, but as I got a feel that Miss Tanya liked running, but didn’t like racing. Whenever she lined up at the starting gates, all the other horses were either in bad moods, or hell-bent on competing. They were so focused on winning, they unnerved her. As a result, she wanted them to hurry up and get out of her space. Which explained why she usually came in last. You like running, I mentally told Miss Tanya. Think of a race as just another way of running. Ignore the other horses. Just have fun going fast. Miss Tanya snorted once – if she’d been human, she might’ve gone ""Hmph!"" – then stepped away from me. By this time, Brian and Carlotta were in another stall, tending to Bucky, a Bergeron with a limp. It was odd seeing the huge horse standing still, seeming to enjoy acupuncture with several thin needles in its flank. ""If you want to help Miss Tanya,"" I said, ""put blinders on her eyes before the next race. Seeing the other horses freaks her out."" Carlotta nodded, considering the idea. Over the next few hours, Brian and I spent time with the other horses. Cinnamon told me she was pregnant, and was excited about getting ready to foal. Rockefeller loved Carlotta for taking care of him when he was sick, and thought of his owner as ""Mom."" And Bucky wished people would brush him more often. Carlotta seemed intrigued when I told her my impressions. Two Sundays later, I watched Miss Tanya race at Woodbine and the poor girl came in sixth out of seven. From the stands, I noticed she was not wearing blinders. Oh, well… I spoke with Brian last night, who told me Carlotta had admitted that after my visit, her horses seemed to be listening to her more. But she still couldn’t understand why Miss Tanya ran so well when she was all by herself.

8,Exploring the Causes of Dog Bites,pets," If a dog bites an individual, many people end up blaming the dog. However, the dog does not have any means of compensating the victim. Because of this, people often have to go after the dog’s owner with the help of a dog bite lawyer to get compensated for their injuries. Dog bites are a huge problem today. More than 4.5 million people are bit by dogs each year. Many result in the individual needing medical treatment. At times, the injuries might go so far as to require reconstructive surgery or hospitalization. Mail carriers and children tend to be the main targets. Because of the epidemic, municipal ordinances and state laws are cracking down on all of these dangerous incidents. In some areas, dog owners are held liable for the actions of their dog. This means that the victim does not have to prove that the owner of the dog was negligent or that they knew about how vicious their dog was to begin with. When you know why bites occur in the first place, you can help prevent them from happening. If prevention is not an option, it will help point out those individuals who are responsible and should be held legally responsible for the claim. --- Common Reasons Why Dog Bites Occur --- There are a number of reasons why dogs bite. Biting is often because of something going on in their environment. Some of the common causes are outlined below: Fear – Many dogs bite out of fear. If they feel threatened by someone they do not know, another animal on their property or a trespasser, they will end up attacking to keep themselves safe. Protection – Oftentimes, dogs are trained to protect their property. They become territorial. This can end up emerging when it gets triggered. Dogs also bite to protect puppies and their masters. They can feel territorial over their food. If they think someone is coming after their food, they might attack. Sickness – At times, a dog might bite because they are sick. They become irritable and snap. --- Preventing a Dog Bite --- There are various steps that you can take to prevent a dog bite from occurring. Some of those are: Avoiding any unfamiliar dogs. If you are not familiar with a dog, you should not assume it is friendly or attempt to approach it. Even a nice dog could end up lashing out on you if it is scared or territorial. Children need to let an adult know if they see a dog wandering around the neighborhood to make sure no one gets injured. Avoid disrupting the dog. You can avoid being injured by leaving the dog alone. If a dog is eating, do not bother it. Avoid messing with the animal’s environment as well. Just like children, dogs like consistency and routines. Animals should never be messed with when they are eating, watching over their puppies or sleeping. Avoid antagonizing the dog. You should never antagonize a dog. This includes such things as shoving the dog, hitting it or hurting it in general. Anyone who owns a dog or who is playing with the dog should not encourage them to play aggressively. In many instances, this is a valid defense for a dog owner to get out of paying if the other person antagonized the dog and that caused the animal to bite. Confronting the dog. If a dog is acting menacing but has not attacked yet, you need to take the necessary steps to prevent the dog from attacking you in the first place. Do not make any sudden moves. Do not run from the dog. Avoid making any loud noises. The last thing you want to do is panic. You should also avoid making eye contact with the animal. Avoid taking an aggressive stance or any other type of action that could appear aggressive to the animal. --- Get Legal Assistance --- Even though you might do everything in your power to avoid being attacked by the dog, there are always going to be times when someone gets bit. Not only can this be terrifying, but it can also be frustrating as well. It becomes even worse when it is a child who is attacked by the dog. However, you cannot blame the dog alone for their actions. Dogs do not just bite because they want to. They often bite because something in their temperament was triggered that caused them to act out. If you were injured by a dog, you need to hire a dog bite attorney who can help you figure out what steps to take next. The lawyer will walk you through everything you can claim in your personal injury case and what you cannot. Do not hire just any lawyer. Hire an attorney who has dealt with cases like yours in the past. This will save you a lot of time and hassles along the way in making sure you get the compensation you deserve. There are a lot of things that you can claim in a dog bite case that you might not be aware of in the first place. This is why it is so important to have someone with experience working on your case. As frustrating as it might be to deal with being attacked by a dog, there are things that you can do to make sure you are compensated fairly. Hang in there and follow the proper protocols to get everything you deserve and more."
9,Are dogs motivated by treats?,pets," Many dog owners believe the only way to reward dogs is by using treats or assume that dogs only respond to treats. The reality is that we don’t give dogs enough credit. Dogs don’t need to be rewarded by food or treats only to learn something. They are smarter than you think and obviously you are a smart individual as well. The problem with treat training is that dog owners assume that dogs are motivated by treats only.  That is not true. There are two types of dogs; one who love treats and those who don’t care about treats. If a piece of treat is in front of a dog, he may end up doing anything depending how hungry he is which is a normal and natural response from a dog. If we assume that a dog is motivated by treat, that is because he loves treats. That‘s all. That does not mean that he is responding to treats or understands the exercise. He is responding to the temptation. If a dog is treat lover and you tease him with treats constantly, you are actually stressing and agitating him. Plus he is not focused on the task but the food. That is cruel to the dog. Treats can be used for rewarding the dog for being a balanced, well behaved individual but I do not recommend using treats for training dogs. When treats are used to implement a behaviour to a dog, the dog tends to connect it with survival and hunger related situation which has nothing to do with teaching a behaviour. A behaviour needs to be taught to a dog when the dog has developed a deep connection with the human using other systems than food or treats. When treats are used with a dog that is not balanced and well behaved, the dog misreads the idea and the techniques as being rewarded for being unbalanced. There are also dogs that are not interested in treats. Yes, I have come across so many dogs that are not interested in treats at all and dog owners are forcing the dogs to love the treats, eat it and respond to the command. These kinds of dogs are obviously not responding to the treats but are looking for some other form of motivation that could be found and build by connection between the dog and the owners. Dog owners need to work on building relationship with their dog rather than spending money on the treats and tools. You can use your praise just for the sake of praise for your dog. That is hundred times more effective and rewarding to a dog than the most expensive treat in the world. Many dog trainers use treat training system because most dog trainers have been taught the same system. But the reality is that there are other systems of dog training in these day and age. Anybody can put a treat in front of a dog and ask it to sit and of course the dog will sit. You don’t need to be a dog trainer to train dog owners that. I use play, praise reward system to train dogs. Not many dog trainers use this system because either they are not aware of it or it is hard for them to learn it. It is easy to use the system to teach the public and dog owners. Dogs respond to play and praise more than treats and it is more reliable. I have been training my own dogs and hundreds of dogs without treats for years and I can assure you, it is more effective and reliable than anything else. In a nutshell, if you are depending on treats to get results from your dog, it means you don’t have a solid, healthy relationship with your dog. Work on building a better communication and relationship with your dog, which takes a long time and don’t use temptations to lure in your dog to you."
10,Things You Should Keep In Mind While Choosing A Professional Dog Trainer,pets," For dog owners, one of the most important decisions to make is choosing the right dog trainer, regarding the nature and behavior of pet, which makes it one of the most difficult decisions to get right as well. We assume that you are already determined to get the help of a professional dog trainer, so you are very likely to deal with a virtual armada of people, who would claim that they are the only ones to hold the keys of dog obedience and happiness. They offer guarantees and charge more per hour than the professional human psychologists. So how can you emerge with an actually qualified dog trainer among this minefield of options as that trainer is required to use force free and science based techniques and modern tools? Although there are many dog training organizations, this profession still seems unregulated as any person can claim to be a trainer, not matter what kind or level of education and experience he/she has in the field. That’s why, if you don’t want to face a glut of under qualified self proclaimed ""professionals"", then you should back up to the first step of decision making, which is what do you want your dog to learn? If you want your pet to go for ""sit, ""stay"", ""come"" or ""heel"" at beginning lessons and the dog doesn’t do the obedience work, then you should take professional help for the dog obedience. Similarly, you can hire the services for the dog agility training, which is a tough task to do for a normal dog owner. Just decide if you want the trainer or not, you have to choose the right tool for the job you require done. Certainly there are plenty of good dog trainers who are professionally gifted without any kind of formal certification; still you should ask them if they have been certified. This is because a person having the certifications has passed the minimum requirements and has already put in his hands with dogs. Before hiring any dog trainer, you should ask to talk to a couple of his/her previous clients. In this way, you’ll get the proper idea of the trainer’s mode of training, reliability and most importantly, willingness to follow through. A professional dog trainer may have a great expertise and a successful track record, but if you are not comfortable working with them, then you should drop them for sure. A good trainer has to be able to treat you respectfully and discuss things in an easy way for you to understand. Along with that, a good dog trainer keeps up with the modern training methods and adapts them to an individual dog’s needs. One more thing, if you’ve already chosen someone, but then later you feel like the hired trainer isn’t the right decision for your dog, do not hesitate to seek dog training elsewhere. Drop the person right there and move on with the correct one."
11,What Do You Need To Know About Dog Aggression?,pets," Any dog, no matter how social, can get aggressive with another pet, resulting in a fight. It is normal for dogs or any kind of pet to misbehave at times as this isn’t the indication that they are having an aggression issue. However, when your dog is being frequently and unpredictably aggressive, then it is definitely a problem. Dog aggression can be a really frightening and harmful behavior issue and it basically stems from the frustration and dominance. Now here are some points that you should be clear about while dealing with your aggressive dog. This is a common misunderstanding that the dog aggression comes from the breed. This isn’t true because any breed can cause trouble. The only difference is that the bigger breeds cause proportionally more damage than the small ones. This is why it is very important to recognize that if the strong breed dogs are aggressive and unbalanced, they can be a reason to cause serious injuries. One thing you have to understand is that bad things happen when people want to have the stronger breed, but do not bother to fulfill the animal in the dog. Usually they focus on the looks or popularity, without thinking the lifestyles of the dogs, which later becomes the recipe for disaster. Another reason for a dog to be aggressive is the lack of adequate dog exercise, which burns the excess energy of your dog, helping to maintain the healthy state of mind. You should give it importance because the energy needs to be expelled from the body before talking to dog’s mind. This is the powerful negative association of your dog with other dogs. This behavior may have several reasons, for example your dog is afraid from other dogs and attacks them in defense. Other reasons for the dog aggression can be to guard their territory or resources etc. When your dog shows any kind of aggression, just understand that it is asking you to be its pack leader. A pack leader is an instinctual role that leads the pack and provides protection and direction. In return, the pack trust and depends upon the leader for the proper behavior. You need to become a pack leader of your dogs and once you’ve earned their loyalty and respect, they will act according to your rules, boundaries and limitations. Their aggression will stop because before they were fighting for dominance and now they have you as their calm assertive pack leader, so they don’t need to be aggressive anymore. You’ve got to do this because you are needed to fulfill the nature of the dog, so if you are considering adopting a powerful breed, then first decide and make up your mind about taking this responsibility. Now the question is how can you become the pack leader? For this, you are needed to take lessons from a professional dog trainer who will explain and teach you to be the leader, like your dogs want you to be. So if you have an aggressive dog, hire the experienced trainers to get rid of your dogs’ frightening and embarrassing behavior."
12,5 Things That Need To Be Taken Care Of In Summer To Keep Your Dog Away From Heat,pets," As the weather kicks it up a notch, everyone gets the natural tendency to go outside, even the pets. Spending time out of your house can be great for all the fun, but you have to be wary of the heat exhaustion in your pets, especially dogs. Dogs are sensitive animals and there are some serious issues that may arise from overheating in summer, which you need to avoid by taking the precautionary measures. These issues are: When the skin of your dog becomes slow to return to its original position after being pulled up or the mouth gums are feeling tacky to touch, realize that the dog is dehydrated, which lead to lethargy and the eyes of your pet may appear to be sunken. Heart stroke is a really serious problem as when it becomes fatal, the dog becomes comatose and its temperature rises to 104°F – 110°F. The symptoms may include salivating, vomiting, extreme panting and staggering. In this case, you must call your veterinarian immediately. Sunburn normally occurs in the non pigmented areas, like often the ears or nose and it looks similar on a dog as it does at you. Due to the reason that dogs lick off their sunblock, you have to keep them out of the sun from 10A.M. to 4P.M. Here are FIVE most important measures that you should consider for your dogs when the temperature soars. On a sunny day, the temperature of a car can rise dangerously high for your dog to suffer the irreversible organ damage or even death. So just don’t leave your pet in your parked vehicle, not for a minute with the car running or even an air conditioner on. Not only temperature, but also the humidity can also badly affect your dog. Actually animals evaporate the moisture from their lungs that takes the heat away from them, but when the humidity level increases, they can’t cool themselves and their temperature instantly rises to the dangerous levels, so you should not allow your dog’s temperature to be over 104 degrees. Carefully adjust the intensity and duration of your pet’s exercise with respect to the temperature and always carry water with you to prevent it from dehydration. You have to be especially careful with the dogs of white-colored ears as they are more prone to cancer and short nose dogs, who suffer difficulty breathing. Walk your dog on grass to keep its’ paws from burning. Whenever your dog is out of the house, make sure that it is getting satisfactory protection from the heat and plenty of cold water. You can add ice in water during heat waves and provide tree shade and tarps as they do not obstruct the air flow. Provide your dog enough water, whether you’re indoors or outside of your home. You can also whip up a notch of peanut butter with it. While indoors, you can keep your dog from overheating by giving it a cooling body wrap or a mat, first soak them in cool water and wrap it around your dog and they’ll stay cool for like 3 days. Now, you and your pet are ready for this summer!! we want to hear from you, please tell us how was the experience at Atlanta Dog Trainer"

14,5 Basic Commands to Teach your Dog,pets," In this article I am going to share with you basic commands to teach your dog. Make sure to be patient with the learning process and repeat the commands as often as necessary. The standard release commands are ""free"" or ""release"", but you can choose any word you like, other than ""OK"", ""let’s go"", or ""come"".  It must be a word that isn’t commonly heard in normal conversation.  Some examples include: taco, chaos, zombies, cuckoo, libre, skidoosh, at ease, etc.  (People living in multiple dog households will need a different release command for each individual dog). To get beside your dog, hold some yummy, yummy treat in front of his nose, and then gently touch or tap his rear, where the tail meets the rump.  The dog should automatically drop into a sit- mark the instant his rear hits the ground with ""YES!"",  then deliver the reward.  Be sure that you are saying ""yes"" when the rear hits the ground, and NOT when you feed the treat!  The behavior being marked is the ""sit,"" not the taking of the treat. Shake. Put your dog into a sit position in front of you.  Raise their paw up and say ""shake"" and give them a small treat.  Let them put their paw back on the ground before you pick it up again. Do this 20 times in a row,  4 sessions a day.  Soon they will start offering you some sort of shake.  Praise anything towards the behavior you want.  We can tighten the shake up as we go.   Praise Praise Praise!!!!! High-five. By now, your dog should have a pretty good grasp of the ""shake"" command, so you can begin to turn it into a ""high-five"" command.  Your hand held horizontally, palm up, should trigger the dog swipe at it with their paw for ""shake"". You will gradually begin to shift your hand out to the side, eventually getting it up to a vertical, high-five position.  Once your dog is swiping at your vertical hand, you can start to add the ""high-five"" command. Wait. ""Wait"" is a command that simply means, ""stop moving forward and await further instruction"".  Dogs understand boundaries, so you will practice this command at any clear thresholds (doorways, stairs, etc), as well as getting in and out of the car. As you approach a threshold, you will stop moving forward, while simultaneously tugging backwards on the leash and saying ""wait"".  If the dog keeps trying to go forward, you will keep tugging him gently back on the leash behind the threshold.  Remember to loosen the leash as soon as he gets back behind that threshold, even if you have to keep tugging him back multiple times- it needs to be his decision to stay behind the threshold, and if the leash is tight, that means you are holding him.  As soon as he relaxes for just one second, release him as usual and proceed across the threshold. Now you are ready to start to teach these commands to your dog, then tell us how was the experience.

11,3 Reasons Why You Would Want a K9 Unit,pets," K9 units or dog units are glorified in movies. If you have watched any action movie or series recently where a dangerous and vicious criminal is the on the run from the police, you may have spotted a K9 unit on the chase. As spectacular and intriguing as those chases are, that is not all there is to dog units. You don’t really have to be in the middle of a chase between the police and a fugitive to see dog units in action. In fact, you can have a dog unit at your service if you are struggling to protect the perimeters of your home or workplace. A lot of people will come up to you and tell you that using dogs to secure your boundaries is too elaborate and old fashioned. This is because people are gradually turning their attention away from man’s best friend and placing their trust in technology. There is no denying the fact that technology has a huge role to play in the private security industry today and in the future. However, you cannot possibly forget how useful guard dogs and their handlers are. The presence of a dog unit can make a world of a difference when it comes to safeguarding your life and assets from criminal attacks. It is okay for you to doubt the effectiveness and legitimacy of a dog unit. A lot of people are not familiar with the concept of using dogs to ward off criminal threats. Then again, there are those who are concerned about safety issues associated with a dog unit. ""What if the handler loses control and the dog breaks free?"" is one of the many questions that make people overlook perks of hiring a dog unit. If you are in the same boat, then here are pieces of information about dog units that will change your mind. ""Safety comes first"" is the motto of every exemplary dog unit. Unlike a lot of so called modern security systems, K9 units will not compromise your security under any circumstances. The people who are appointed as dog handlers are not ordinary men and women who simply have an affinity for dogs. Believe it or not, dog handlers are actually recruited from law enforcement agencies and from the military. State of the art private security companies look to hire former police or army officers who have had years of training and experience handling guard dogs. This is not a job that can be left to the hands of an amateur. Handling guard dogs is an extremely difficult task that requires a great degree of skill. It is not only the dog handlers who are trained. The guard dog themselves undergo rigorous training regimes as well. While the dog handlers are trained to exercise unwavering control over the guard dogs, the canines are trained to be obedient and faithful to their handlers at all times. This incredibly high level of training allows the man and the animal to develop the chemistry required to form a formidable security team. If you do not believe it, then simply talk to a dog handler (provided that you are not scared of the dog he or she is toting around). They will tell you all about the unbelievable amount of work that they and their dogs have put in to deter crime. You may have heard security personnel talk about how they can scare away criminals from a mile away. In the case of a dog unit, this is literally true. Statistics suggest that criminals, even the most violent released inmates, are fearful of guard dogs. In other words, if you were a burglar or a robber who was trying to break in to a store, house or an office, then you would most probably change your mind upon seeing a dog unit from a mile away. The dogs in K9 units are specifically trained to be very hostile to criminals. Since they are completely obedient to their dog handlers, they will not pose any threat to you or people around you. These dogs have a particular taste for criminals. With the assistance of their dog handlers, these guard dogs are able to spot criminals and track them down even before the crime is committed. There is no better crime deterrent than a dog unit. If you buy a security system, it can only make you aware of the presence of a criminal. It cannot literally chase away a criminal now, can’t it? But a guard dog is born to strike fear in the hearts of criminals, so that they do not even think about robbing or vandalizing your house. If you want static guards to offer you the same level of protection that a dog unit does, then you would need to hire at least five to six different static guards. Hiring that many static guards would drain a lot of money out of your pockets, something that you surely do not want to see happen under the current economic circumstances. Even if you hire six guards, they would not be able to frighten away criminals and deter crime like a dog unit would. Dog units are thus the smarter choice, because they are evidently more cost effective. With a dog unit, you are paying an affordable price for state of the art security. The combination of a single dog handler with a single guard dog is a strong enough security team to let you reside in your home or work in your office without the fear of being attacked by deadly criminals.

14,Budgies as Pets,pets," Budgies are beautiful birds that make nice pets. They require relatively less maintenance and therefore are ideal for beginners. These lovely birds are intelligent, extremely social and bond well with humans. With training they can be taught a variety of tricks. The budgie or budgerigar is a native of Australia. They belong to the parrot family.. The scientific name of the budgie is Melopsittacus undulatus. The natural habitat of the budgie is arid, semi-desert. Budgies, like other members of the parrot family tend to live in large colonies. Their diet consists chiefly of seeds. Buying your Budgies Budgies can be bought from almost all pet shops. It is important to check that the shops maintain the birds in good and hygienic conditions. See that the birds are active and healthy. It is good to buy the birds in pairs as they will bond. Most pet shops will put your budgies in a box for the journey home. Ensure that the box has adequate means of ventilation. Setting up the Bird Cage A good cage for your budgies should be at least 18 x 18 x 20 inches. Wire cages would be ideal as the birds will be able to climb the sides. Alternatively, if you are using cages with metal bars, ensure that the bars are horizontal to enable climbing. Provide adequate perches for the budgies. Ensure that the cage provides enough space for the budgies to fly from one perch to another so that they can exercise their wings. Budgies are very inquisitive and active creatures that require a lot of stimulation. Hence, it is good to provide toys such as plastic rings, small balls, etc for the birds to play with. The cages need to be kept away from direct sunlight. The cage must also have a removable litter tray to enable cleaning the cage without opening the cage. Feeding and Diet Budgies have a diet that consists mainly of seeds. You can occasionally treat your budgie to a meal of fresh fruits. However, certain foods such as avocado, lemon, and potato, chocolate can be harmful to your budgie. Besides their base diet of seeds and occasional fruits, budgies may require supplements of substances such as calcium to augment their dietary intake. This is particularly true of female budgies who need more calcium to form the egg shells. Cuttlebone, which is available at almost all pet stores is a good source of calcium. Besides food, a permanent supply of clean drinking water should always be made available. It is recommended to replace the water every day as budgies sometimes tend to dirty the water. Breeding Budgies can be bred as soon as they attain sexual maturity at around 8 months. In budgies, it is possible to visually tell apart the sexes by the color of the ceres, located below the nostrils. The males have blue ceres while the females tend to have pink or brown ceres. For the birds to mate, they must bond with each other. Bonding occurs when the birds start feeding and preening each other. The female budgie lays a clutch of about 4-5 eggs with an interval of a day between each egg. The female then sits on the eggs during the incubation period of around 18 days. The chicks are born naked and blind. Both male and female birds share the responsibility of raising the chicks. The chicks grow fast and are completely covered by feathers by the end of one month after which they leave the nest. Budgies are beautiful birds that are easy to care for. They are also highly social and are ideal for beginners. They bond well with people and are easily handled."

18,Cat Courageous - Adopting A Cat,pets," Summary: Being cat courageous is recognizing the beauty of a cat and then courageously giving them a second chance by adoption.  There are many pros and cons to owning a cat.  These responsibilities, as with any animal, requires realistic  decision-making, then choosing a kitten or an adult feline.  No matter which one is chosen, there isn't a high enough praise for being cat courageous. Cats have a beauty that defines sleekness, stealth and grace.  Cats have the ability of a ninja, playfulness of a baby and an independence only they can show.  Accepting these qualities which makes up the feline is a joy all cat owners can attest to. Having multiple felines in the house only adds to the joy and fascination of these qualities and personalities. There is an added satisfaction when the owner has the courage to adopt an older cat. Cats, with all their attitude and personalities, have basic needs that need to be met.  Examples of these needs include brushing, claw trimming, feeding and litter box changing.  When giving a feline a second chance from an adoption agency, bring a feline brush with you.  Brushing a cat can be relaxing for them. You will be able to spend one on one time with your choice of cat and relax them as well. By brushing a cat daily you will help maintain a healthy coat of fur and cut down on hairballs.  The second thing to evaluate is whether or not they like their paws being touched.  Although this not the act of claw trimming, the touching of paws is half the battle.  Another item to evaluate in the basic needs category is whether or not the cat uses a litter box.  This can be evaluated by either direct observation or asking the caretakers.  The last item in basic needs being met is the diet. This must be asked, as older cats may or may not have special dietary needs because of allergies, or other medical conditions. Of course all these basic needs leads to monetary responsibility. Even though cats are independent creatures they are by no means a cheap animal to care for.  The phrase ""cheaper by the dozen"" does not apply to cats.  Is a kitten or an older cat less expensive?  My answer, they are about the same.  Either, the kitten or the older cat, have the same basic needs that need to be met.  Along with these needs comes the vet bills for the shots that are needed.  Should you adopt a cat, not from an agency, the feline will need to be neutered or spayed, ask your vet on how to get a voucher to help off set this cost.  Many years of great health can be enjoyed when preventative checkups are given. Cats can give many years of love, laughter and heartaches. Cats are also a popular animal in people's  households. This means there are a lot of articles out there about cats. Think about a question you may have, an there is bound to be an article out in the Internet world or book displays that can give you an answer. Be cat courageous and look at adopting an older cat as you will be rewarded with personality  that only a cat can bring into any household. Our senior cat, Biskers was adopted when she was 3 years old. Being once an outside cat, she now lives a spoiled lifestyle of being ""master"" of the house.  She doesn't show the slightest hint of wanting to go outside.  She owns the couch and demands her brushing daily.  She has her ""spot"" when its dinner time and her after dinner lounging tunnel.  Biskers adds royalty to the household by her mannerism and demands."
19,Cat Litter Choices,pets," Summary: Cat litter choices are quite abundant today. Although the rule of thumb is if its not broke, leave it alone. However trying different litter is not always a bad thing. When running the experiment of different litters, be vigilant, you may have need to clean it out and return to ""old reliable"" pretty quickly.  In the end, let your cat make the choice. I know from first hand knowledge the daunting task of choosing a cat litter box and the use of cat litter. The task of a litter box: open or closed, big or small, automatic or manual, not to mention the number of boxes needed.  For my household, having four cats: we have two cement mixing boxes on our enclosed porch. There is also one open rectangular litter box in the dining room, and a private box in a cage.   The cement boxes are used by Zippy and Wolverine. The open box is used by all, but mainly it is for our senior (16 years old) Biskers, and the private box is for Snoopy. The choice of litter to put into each box is a challenge. Clay, clumping, or natural with pine, newspaper, wheat or corn scratch.  All these choices have strengths and weaknesses.  For my household I want:   No tracking through the house, easy cleaning, little dust, cat use choice, but also monetarily feasible as well. I have tried and used all of the above suggested cat litters. When experimenting, I used the one box located in the dining room. In keeping to my list of what I wanted the litter to be, I wanted to make sure the litter box was used by Biskers and Snoopy mainly.  Because Biskers is our senior cat, she is prone to more accidents and wanted to make sure the dining room box is to her liking. Also Snoopy is a concern because she has so many allergies (26 to be precise) that Joe and I have to make sure the litter doesn't affect her. After months of testing, the following litter choices are used in the following boxes: For the cement litter boxes on the enclosed porch we use Stall Dry.  Stall dry is used mainly for horse stalls. It is a powdery fine litter, which means it tracks and kicks up some dust when pouring. Although this is two strikes against my list of expectations, the Stall dry  handles the smell of ammonia very, very well. It also clumps in the cement boxes so it easy to clean out and Zippy and Wolverine use the boxes. The cost is about $15.00-$25.00 per 40lb bag. For the litter box located in the private cage (5ftx7ft) for Snoopy, as well as the box located in the dining room, mainly used by Biskers, I use either clumping or newspaper litter. Clumping litter falls short on the tracking and dust pouring areas, however, it is easy to clean, and Snoopy doesn't react to it.  Also monetarily, I can get clumping litter at any store including Family Dollar and Dollar General for less than $10.00 per 20lb box.  I can buy multiple boxes throughout the month and have some boxes for emergencies.  The newspaper litter I use are in pellets. This limits tracking, limits dust, Snoopy doesn't react to it, Biskers enjoys pawing it and the litter is easy to see where to clean. The downside to this litter involves it being more difficult for her to bury the feces, and the litter will smell after one day of not cleaning it.  I can only buy this litter online, or at pet stores. The cost can range from $15-$25 for a 30lb bag. I don't use just one type of litter.  I have been experimenting for months with different litters and keeping mental notes on cost, who uses what, what reactions Snoopy may have, tracking and smell.  This was the result of the experiments. Also cost wise, I try to get two bags of stall day and newspaper pellets when I drive by the pet store each month.  I also try to get three boxes of clumping litter once a month. As a result, I have enough litter so when I wash out all the litter boxes every fourth to sixth month, I have plenty to refill with and still have some put aside in case I don't go to the store and pick any up or emergencies that should arise."
20,Trap-Neuter-Return Program,pets," Summary: I read an article on the Trap-Neuter-Return program possibly coming to our county.  I vaguely know about this program though.  It will be interesting to see what the final vote will be. I have heard about this program. I have seen some YouTube videos on this program. This program is now being closely considered by our county in Florida.  I saw an article in the Commercial Press (Wed, May 13,2015), stating that the Sheriff is ""exploring whether it is feasible to implement"".  I have not done any research of my own about this program. What little I do know, Trap-Neuter-Return involves the humane capture of feral cats, having them neuter/spayed, then returned to their colonies location. This article states that the University of Florida has been doing an 11-year study, finding the felines on the campus has declined by 66%. This program is being implemented in Jacksonville, Baltimore, San Francisco and Los Angeles.  If this program becomes implemented, it could be run by volunteers. The article goes on to state the groups that are against this program including  the Wildlife Conservation group and other organizations.  Reasons for their opposition include danger of cats transmitting Feline Leukemia to the Florida panthers, toxoplasmosis to other animals and humans and the killing of birds by outdoor cats. It will be interesting to see what the final vote by the commission board says. The following are my own comments:
Beyond stating the cities in which this program is implemented, the article doesn't dwell much into the success or lack of in these locations.  Furthermore, this article doesn't state how much the projected  program would cost to run.  As I have stated in the first paragraph, I have not done my own research so I cannot vouch for the percentage of  numbers that  are being reported.     For example, this article writes, The American Bird Conservancy  reports every year ""approximately 2.4 billion birds and 12.3 billion mammals are killed by outdoor cats in the U.S. alone "".  Although these numbers are great, I would question what are the percentages or numbers in the local area?  An example would be, the University of Florida states a 66% decline in feral cats around the campus, has any research been done to the see if there is any change in the number of birds and other mammals in the area?  I would not have a clue on how to begin such a project, however, if numbers are going to be given, lets compare apples to apples. Don't give an approximate number of birds killed by outdoor cats throughout the U.S. and not have any numbers or research  for the local area in which the TNR programs are being implemented.  This should be possible since the TNR program has been in effect in some areas for over 20 years. These would be some of the questions that I would like to investigate.  Have any of you experienced the TNR program in your area? If so, what are your thoughts about how effective or ineffective the program is in your area."

1,The Story About the Magic of a Cat's Tail,pets," The magic of a cat's tail can be truly a wonder to any cat owner.  Last night I tried to settle down my thoughts for the night.  Having been given bad news early in the day, I was finding it difficult to quiet my mind and actually close my eyes.  After unsuccessful attempts to lay down quietly, I resolved that this would be one of those restless nights. I heated up some sleepy tea, crawled back under the covers and slowly enjoyed the beverage.  That is when the magic started, Snoopy jumped onto the bed. Before expressing the meaning of this moment, let me give a little background information.  My husband and I have four cats. One senior, two middle-aged and a two year old terror.  Similar to most pet owners, these four cats are our children.  There isn't a time that while I am in any room of the house that a cat or multiple cats are not in the room with me.  I get the privilege  of seeing their personalities and other feline traits throughout the day.  But a trait that I marvel at is how they appear to be laid back, but are watching me or my husband at all time, whether it is with the flick of their ears when they hear either of us move around the room, or the ""let's barely open an eye"" to visually track us.  Should I leave the room, it won't be long before the four paws of one hits the floor and follows.  This bring me back to last night. With a mind full of thoughts and emotions running in all directions, it startled me when Snoopy, one of the middle-aged cats jumped onto the bed.  She looked directly at me, walked up real close, sniffed my nose, stared at me for another 10 seconds and then turned around and laid down.  She brought her back feet to her body and curled her tail around towards her head.  Some time later, I finished my tea, put it down on the dresser and snuggled deeper into the covers.  I turned my head toward Snoopy, who was by now facing my feet.  Without warning she swished her tail. Not in a sporadic and powerful way, but in a what I like to describe as ""searching using the cane method"".  I define this as the methodical and deliberate  positioning of the tail in search of the object in question movement.  That’s when her tail found my head. She slowly moved it over hair then over my face until she felt my cheek.  There it stayed for about 3 minutes. Every once in a while the very tip of her tail would move back and forth.  When Snoopy finally removed her tail from my face and curled it back toward her body, I turned out the lights and closed my eyes. Now,  I know there are many articles out there on the scientific explanations of a cat's control over their tail or even a cat's sense of smell, however, to experience this action while emotions are high brings a profound moment of wonder with it. Although,  those heavy thoughts didn't disappear with the touch of her tail, the moment was enough to bring temporary peace.  Have you experienced such a moment?"
2,Animals Turn to Nature for Self-Medication,pets," Scientists still aren't sure if this theory, known as zoopharmacognosy, is correct, but believers in the practice are convinced that humans can learn a thing or two from these animals - specifically, in terms of finding new medications. ""Much of folk medicine, particularly in the undeveloped world, likely came from medicine men watching animals self-medicate,"" lead author Joel Shurkin wrote in the journal PNAS. Mother Nature's Pharmacy Many animal species, from birds, bees and lizards to elephants and chimpanzees, have turned to nature as their own personal kind of pharmacy. They self-medicate using the environment's own ingredients to prevent disease, kill parasites, bacteria and viruses, or to simply aid in digestion. For instance, seeing a dog munch on grass is nothing you haven't seen before, and an owner's first instinct may be to snatch away these greens to prevent their dog from getting sick. But according to Shurkin, that's exactly the point. Supposedly domestic dogs, and even cats, seek out the plant in order to relieve a stomach ache and expel whatever it is that's bothering them. ""Dogs do not have the means to digest grass, as they lack the enzymes needed to break down the fibers,"" Vancouver-based vet Dr. Michael Goldberg explained in the magazine Modern Dog. ""Thus, there is little nutritional value in it for them. One reason for eating grass may be due to a feeling of nausea."" Elsewhere, chimpanzees have been observed swallowing leaves whole, using their rough sandpaper-like texture to remove parasites. More than 200 species of birds have also been seen rubbing themselves with ants to kill feather lice, a behavior known as anting. Ants that spray formic acid can kill off feather lice and protect the birds from infection. Animals Turn to Nature for Self-Medication 0 Comments Text Size - + Print E-mail By Jenna Iacurci Dec 11, 2014 02:48 PM EST dog It seems that animals, such as dogs, elephants and chimps, are turning to Mother Nature for means of self-medication by seeking out drugs to treat their own ailments, new research suggests. (Photo : Flickr: smerikal) It's not uncommon for humans who just visited the doctor to want to seek out a second opinion, some of them turning to self-medication for the answer. But now new research shows that this may apply to animals like dogs, elephants and chimps as well, who seek out drugs on their own to relieve certain ailments.

But perhaps most astonishing are reports from back in October 2013, the Daily Mail notes, of mountain goats scaling a brick wall in the Gran Paradiso National Park in Northern Italy. It is thought that the animals were partaking in mineral licks, which is the licking of stones for their nutritious salts and minerals when food supply is low. Medicine vs. Food But how do you tell the difference between self-medication and just plain bizarre behavior? For example, researcher Holly Dublin while observing a group of elephants in Kenya spotted a pregnant female eating the plant boraginaceae, which was not part of her regular diet. The expectant mother ate the entire plant and then returned to her normal feeding routine, suggesting that she perhaps just had a momentary lapse in judgment. However, four days later she gave birth. This same plant is used by women in the region to induce labor, and so Dublin believes the elephant wanted the same effect."
3,How to Lessen Hairballs for Your Cat,pets," Every cat owner is well familiar with the ‘horking’ sound that their cat makes every week or two that results in a compact hair sausage being deposited on the floor. Owners generally become fairly blasé after cleaning up a few hairballs, but you should also be aware of how they form, how to prevent them from developing as frequently, and the complications that can arise. Unlike most dogs who will take a lick of two at their paws and consider that they have groomed enough, cats are grooming dynamos. Even tiny kittens will start grooming at a very early age and this continues throughout the life of the cat. The tongue of a cat is covered with little hooks which easily pick up dead and loose hairs when the cat licks herself. Cats spend a considerable amount of time during the day cleaning, so the opportunity of collecting hair is great. The hair that is taken up by the tongue is inevitably swallowed and enters the digestive system. The greater portion of the swallowed hair passes harmlessly through the stomach and intestines and is deposited in the litter box. However, some always remains and will develop into a hairball in time. Other than being disgusting, most hairballs cause no problems at all for your cat. Unfortunately, sometimes a hairball blockage can occur in the stomach or intestines – at times a mega-hairball will form in the stomach that takes up the entire space of the organ. There are clues that will tell you that your friend may be having problems with a hairball: •	You cat may become constipated – normal passage of stool will be prevented by the hairballs. •	Conversely, your cat may have diarrhea as the intestinal irritation from the hairballs causes food to pass too quickly through the system. •	Cats with blockage have no energy and will simply lie around. •	If your cat attempts to vomit (dry heaves), but is unable to bring anything up, the hairball may be too large to expel in the normal way. •	Appetite will fall off dramatically when blockage occurs. •	A large hairball can press against the lungs, causing the cat to wheeze and cough. At this point, you will have to consult your vet to have him or her resolve the hairball problem. The first step will be palpation of the cat’s abdomen, followed by an x-ray. If a large hairball is present anywhere in the gastrointestinal system, surgery must be done to remove it. This can be very expensive so owners should make every effort to prevent hairballs from forming in the first place. It would be completely unrealistic to suppose that you can prevent your cat from swallowing hair at all, but there are some things that you can do to help keep hairball problems at a minimum. Brush your cat. Not surprisingly, long haired cats are much more likely to develop problem hairballs than short haired ones. However, a daily brushing of your cat will help remove most of the loose hairs before they do begin to form a ball. Starting this when your cat is young is a good idea not only to help prevent hairballs, but also to provide a nice time for you and your cat to interact together. After the brushing session is complete, run a damp cloth over the fur to pick up any stray hairs. Brushing will be very important if your cat undergoes an annual shedding. Some cats are more dedicated to grooming than others, and these super-groomers are more likely to develop hairball problems. You can help to keep the cat’s tongue in his or her mouth by providing a new toy or two and by playing with the cat – both of you will probably have a great time. Oral lubricants are available at pet supply stores or through your vet. These help keep matter moving through the digestive tract more quickly and getting the hair out of the system will prevent the formation of hairballs. Fiber rich cat foods have been found to be valuable at preventing hairballs. As with any new food, however, introduce it slowly to prevent any stomach upsets. Cats can pick up human hair from the floor when they groom, and this can be a problem especially if the humans in the house have long hair – it will go down right along with the cat hair. Regular vacuuming can help keep these hairs out of your cat’s insides. And lastly, don’t let your cat become obese; fat cats are more likely to be constipated, which slows down the normal passage of matter through the intestines and contributing to hairball accretion."
4,Why You Should Vaccinate Your Cat,pets," Until fairly recently, cats, like people and dogs, were subject to illness and possible death from what are now preventable diseases. The lives of millions of cats have been made healthier and longer through the use of vaccines that prevent or mitigate the effects of various pathogens. Even if your cat never goes outside or comes into contact with another cat, you can inadvertently bring viruses into your home on your shoes or clothing. Protecting your indoor, as well as your outdoor cat against serious illness is the mark of a responsible and caring pet owner. The best way to make sure that your kitten or cat is well protected against preventable illnesses is to set up a regular schedule of vaccinations with your veterinarian. Always keep in mind that kittens will be much more susceptible to infections because their immune systems are still developing. Nursing kittens will receive some antibodies through their mother’s milk. However, this natural protection will actually interfere with vaccinations, and this is why kittens will need a series of shots to provide them with the maximum protection. Veterinarians generally begin vaccinating kittens when they are between 6 and 8 weeks old. To assure that your kitten is well protected, he or she will receive subsequent vaccinations about once a month until they are about 20 weeks old. The rabies vaccine is often delayed until the antibodies from the mother cat are gone. Adult cats require vaccine booster shots once a year for most diseases. While it is possible for you to administer most of these vaccines at home, by law rabies vaccinations will always have to be done by a veterinarian. Vaccines work to prevent illness by programming the cat’s immune system to recognize a pathogen and destroy it. When your cat receives a vaccination, dead or damaged live viruses are put into the animal. This allows the body to become familiar with the pathogen, so that should your cat be exposed to this particular virus, the body can destroy it before it has the chance to cause illness. Respiratory viruses can cause not only sneezing and discharge from the nose, but also damage to the cornea of the eye. These viruses have a tendency to occur over and over, and in time can severely damage the eye, even causing blindness. Additionally, these viruses can lead to chronic breathing problems. Humans cannot catch these viruses from their cats. Rabies is deservedly one of the most feared diseases on earth. Basically incurable and always fatal, this disease affects the central nervous system resulting in seizures, intense salivation, staggering, uncontrollable aggression or fear, and blindness. Spread by bite, rabies can be acquired by humans from an unvaccinated cat with the disease. Panleukopenia is a nasty disease that will hit kittens the hardest. Death can result from this illness and the virus responsible attacks the bone marrow and gastrointestinal system. A kitten or cat that is lethargic and has fever and diarrhea could well be infected with this virus. Humans cannot catch this disease from their cats. Feline leukemia mostly affects cats that go outside. However, if you have several cats and allow even one to roam outdoors, all the cats could become sick with this viral disease. Cats with feline leukemia will suffer weight loss, fever, anemia, and listlessness. Unfortunately, many cats with feline leukemia do not survive. Feline calcivirus is a relative newcomer on the scene and often occurs in combination with other respiratory viruses. Calcivirus will cause, in addition to the usual respiratory symptoms of sneezing, coughing, and discharge, sores in the mouth and on the tongue; it has also been linked to arthritis. This disease will sometimes mutate to a more severe form that can affect and cause damage to multiple organs and systems in the cat’s body. Vaccines for the above illness are considered to provide ‘core protection’ for your cat. Unvaccinated cats are at the risk of chronic conditions or death from diseases that can be easily prevented. Caring for a sick cat at the veterinary hospital is costly, and home care to nurse a sick cat back to health is time consuming and emotionally draining. It is quite true that side-effects can occur when your cat is vaccinated. Fortunately, in most cases, the cat may run a slight fever or be fussy for a day or two. At times, a knot will form at the site of the injection, and if this does not vanish within a few weeks, your vet should take a look at it. There is also a very slight chance of a severe allergic reaction to a vaccination, which is why your vet may ask you to remain in the clinic for a few minutes to make sure that no such reaction is occurring in your cat. Rabies vaccines are the ones most likely to cause problems. It is possible for a mast cell tumor to develop where the vaccination was given. However, the severity of rabies and the possibility of your infected cat spreading the virus to you and your family should overrule any fears you may have about side-effects from the vaccine."
5,So You Think You Know About Raccoons?,pets," Did you know: The raccoons’ name is actually spelled two different ways: racoon and raccoon.  It seems that it depends on which side of the pond (A.K.A. the Atlantic Ocean) you are on. Americans spell the word as raccoon, whereas the United Kingdom spells it racoon. Raccoons (I am American, no insult to my U.K. friends out there!) as seen from the above statement, can be found in Canada, United States, Mexico, Finland, Germany and Russia. In actuality they are also found in all of Europe, having been introduced by the Asians. They can also be located in all of the rest of the world, each country/continent boasting its own species and subspecies. The food chain is wide and varied.  Their natural enemies are foxes and bobcats.  However, they have also been known to be carried off by larger prey seekers such as owls and eagles.  Unfortunately, the biggest danger known to raccoons is the automobile. In turn, raccoons feast on a variety of foods such as berries, acorns and leaves.  Did you know that they are omnivorous? They also feast on dragonfly larvae, clams, salamanders, frogs, snakes, grasshoppers, crickets, turtles (and their eggs), bird eggs as well as nestlings (baby birds) and fish.  If you live in the suburbs, you know their buffet also includes garbage out of trash cans! In effect, I believe I can safely say they eat anything they do not deem as poisonous! Raccoons can make about 7 different sounds that at times can sound a bit like a dog, and other times more like a cat!  Maybe those purring cat sounds you hear at night are in fact raccoons instead! This is possible as raccoons tend to be nocturnal. They have hand-like paws that are good at tearing things apart, much like we can with our fingers-which is why they can partake in a meal of crawfish or crab.  However, they have their limitations as well.  My mom once watched a raccoon reach into a hole to catch his prey. He apparently caught it, but as he tried to pull his fist out of the hole, it got stuck.  He fought for a while trying to get his fist out. Alas, he had to let his prey go in order to pull his hand out of the hole! Raccoons are also sometimes seen as pets.  They are fun to watch and very entertaining.  But as a warning, they are still considered wild animals and are feisty and unpredictable.  They are not recommended as pets for those with young children.  Also, they are illegal in many areas as pets so before considering this option, check with the game wardens or pet control  department in your area."
6,Your Female Dog and Pyometra,pets," For those who are eager to use their female dog for breeding, either as a business, or simply to keep for themselves, pyometra can spell the end of any such hopes. This is a serious infection of the dog’s uterus and is mainly found in dogs that have never become pregnant, especially if they are not impregnated over several heat cycles. The roots of the word pyometra come from pyo, pus, and metra, uterus. In the female dog, the uterus is actually a ‘U’ shaped organ with the horns of the uterus extending up each side of the abdominal cavity. These horns are where the puppies will grow if she becomes pregnant. The female dog’s body looks upon the sperm of the male as a pathogen and the sperm would be destroyed in the uterus except for the fact that killer white cells are excluded from the uterus during the heat cycle. Besides the lack of white blood cells to kill bacteria, the walls of the female’s uterus become thicker (as a result of the release of hormones) during heat and remain so for several months afterwards – this is to prepare a suitable place for the puppies to develop. This thickness remains even if pregnancy does not occur. Over the next several heat cycles without a pregnancy, thickening continues. As the walls of the uterus become thicker, cysts form. Subsequent openings of the cervix result in the influx of bacteria, which find the perfect place to grow in the fluids produced by the cysts. In some cases, a buildup of bacteria that the body cannot handle will result in pyometra. Young female dogs are less likely to develop pyometra than older ones mostly because they simply have not experienced many heat cycles, but this disease can develop in a dog of any age. Owners of intact female dogs should always be on the alert for any of the following symptoms. A discharge is often pus leaking out from the uterus. If you find an odd discharge on the dog’s bedding or on furniture or rugs, your dog should be examined at the earliest possible time.  Your dog may be running a fever from her bacterial infection. Dogs that are not feeling well generally lose their appetite. As dogs are known for being hearty eaters, any falling off in appetite is a sign that there is a problem. The dog will probably become lethargic as the infection saps her strength and energy. A very ill dog will exhibit vomiting and diarrhea. Keep in mind that discharge will only occur in some cases of pyometra. However, a more serious problem can occur when the cervix is closed and the infected matter remains in the uterus. As more and more pus is produced, the abdomen will swell outwards. The uterus can expand so greatly in size that it can burst, which will distribute pus and bacteria throughout the abdominal cavity (peritonitis). To make matters worse, dangerous bacteria will also produce toxins. These toxins can enter your companion’s bloodstream, spreading the infection throughout the body to affect the kidneys. Dogs with pyometra will often drink heavily and urinate much more than normal and this can happen regardless of whether the cervix is open or closed. It is undoubtedly an enormous disappointment when you had been hoping to breed your female dog to find out that she has pyometra. The non-surgical treatment of pyometra, which revolves around using hormones to open the cervix and allow the uterus to drain, has a relatively poor success rate, and unless a vast improvement is seen within a day or two, there is only the surgical option. Surgery to cure pyometra involves removing the uterus entirely. Depending on how advanced the infection is, your dog may have to remain in the hospital for several days afterwards to receive intravenous fluids and antibiotics. In most cases, several weeks of oral antibiotics will have to be administered once your dog returns home. Keep in mind that a female dog with pyometra can be a very sick animal and that the longer you wait to initiate treatment, the greater the likelihood that the dog will die. Your dog will be every bit as loving and affectionate after her infected uterus is removed, and will also be much happier to be free of illness."
7,Why Declawing Your Cat is a Bad Idea,pets," Owners of cats will often consider having their pet declawed when scratching becomes a problem. It’s true that cats can cause considerable damage to furniture or door frames by using these as scratching posts. A favorite scratching spot can be completely ripped up and shredded by a cat exercising his or her claws. Declawing is generally done only on the front paws because the back paws rarely present a problem. The front claws of cats are retractable, and are always growing, just like our fingernails. In order to remove the outer sheath of the claw to expose the new, sharper claw, the cat must scratch. Wild cats satisfy their scratching need on trees or logs, but domestic cats will use whatever is convenient and at hand. Besides scratching furniture, cats will also scratch defensively, or in some cases, aggressively. People who own cats, and who also have medical conditions, worry that a cat scratch could cause problems. Declawing is a serious surgical procedure that will be performed on your cat under complete anesthesia. Declawing is not the same as trimming the cat’s nails. In order to declaw your cat, it is necessary for the last joint of the cat’s toes to be removed – the nail bed grows right out of the bone so in order for the declawing to be successful, the bone itself must be removed. Some vets use laser surgery to do the procedure, but the same result will occur. After surgery, the paws must be bandaged. Because this is painful surgery, your veterinarian will usually prescribe pain relievers and often antibiotics to deal with incipient infections. The time that will be needed for complete healing can be up to several weeks, although some cats will be healed within 3 or 4 days. As with most elective surgeries on pets, there is a great deal of discussion about whether declawing is cruel and unnecessary, except in certain medical situations (tumors, chronic infections). Studies have been done which exhibit contradictory results. However, several problems seem to arise after a cat has been declawed. Because the cat’s primary means of defense, its claws, are gone, the cat may be more prone to biting. Cat bites can easily become infected, and are considered to be more dangerous in this respect than dog bites. Many cat owners report that their cats have more of a tendency to urinate or defecate inappropriately after being declawed. It has been shown that with the removal of the front claws, cats may object to the feel of the litter in the box. The cat can never be allowed outside again, once it has been declawed, the cat must be kept in the house at all times. Without claws, not only will the cat be unable to defend itself, it will also be unable to climb a tree to escape an attack by other animals. Opposing these negative outcomes, there is also the fact that persistent scratching up of furniture or aggressive scratching of people or other pets can lead to the cat being surrendered to a shelter. It has been found that approximately one quarter of the cats in the United States have been declawed, and that most owners are satisfied with the outcome of the surgery but there are ways to solve the scratching problem without declawing. Those cat owners who object to declawing can work around the problem to one extent or another. Kittens start getting the urge to scratch when they are about 2 months old. This is the perfect opportunity to train the kitten to use a scratching post. One that has a rough texture will appeal to the scratching instinct especially. Posts covered with sisal, or even a section of log will be attractive to the kitten. Even adult cats can be trained to use a post if you are willing to spend the time to work with the animal. Vinyl caps that fit over the front claws can keep the cat from damaging furniture or harming others. These caps are glued onto the claws and have to be replaced about once a month. Some owners have found that trimming the cat’s nails themselves can help to reduce the need for scratching. However, your cat may not be cooperative during this procedure, and this is also something that should be started while the cat is still a kitten. Tendonectomy is a surgical alternative to declawing, and may actually be the worst choice of all. During this surgery, the tendons that control the flexing of the claws are severed. Owners must then trim the claws regularly to prevent them growing into the toe pads. This is not a recommended procedure for our beloved cats. Declawing is not a procedure that any cat owner should take lightly, and in most cases, it’s best to avoid it. There are other options to this painful procedure and if you take the time to train your cat, you can enjoy each other for many years to come."
8,Dog Ears Can Be a Real Trouble Spot,pets," For such a proportionately small area of your dog’s body, ears can present a number of problems that can not only make your dog uncomfortable, but can actually threaten your friend’s general health, especially if there is a bacterial infection present. Although any breed of dog can suffer from ear problems, dogs with floppy ears will be more likely to develop problems simply because less air will reach inside. Dogs that are in the water a good deal, such as retrievers, will also be more prone to ear difficulties. As with most things, prevention is probably the best approach to take with your dog’s ear health. Your dog’s ears should be cleaned every week with a mild cleaning solution and cotton balls. Not only will this help to prevent the buildup of wax, which can cause itching, but will also help you spot problems when they are just beginning. Always check your dog’s ears after he or she has been outside – not only could your dog have picked up a tick or two (we have taken ticks out of our dogs’ ears many times), but plant parts, especially seeds that are designed to be transported by animals, could have found their way into the ear canal. When your dog is experiencing troubles with his ears, they will quickly make you aware that something is wrong. If you notice your dog shaking or tilting his head, scratching at his ears, or running the side of his head along the floor, these are clear indications that something annoying is going on in the ears. Very often, a bad odor will emanate from the ears as well. Dogs with ear problems will feel not only itching, but also pain, so a visit to the veterinarian is definitely called for to get an exact diagnosis of the cause. Wax buildup is the easiest of the ear problems to solve, and often a thorough cleaning will solve it. A liquid cleaner is put into the ears, which are then massaged. Allow your dog to shake his head to clear out the excess liquid, then use a cotton ball or gauze pad to finish cleaning. Ear mites can cause intense itching in your dog’s ears and you can detect them by the presence of their dark red crumbs of scat. They are sucking your dog’s blood and what you see is generally their feces. Your veterinarian will prescribe an acaricide (substance that kills mites) to wipe out the population. Often, only one or two applications will be needed. Bacterial infections will produce a nasty smell as well as pain and itching. There may be pus present. These infections, if untreated, can spread from the middle to the inner ear, causing chronic, difficult-to-treat problems. Antibiotic ointments will have to be used to kill the bacteria, and be sure to follow through with the entire round of prescribed treatment. Yeast infections are very common and yeast loves to grow in damp, warm conditions – exactly what may be found in your dog’s ears. The intense itching caused by yeast can make life a misery for your dog, and not only will you be able to see an overgrowth of yeast in the ears, but there will be a sour, ‘yeasty’ smell. Prescription medication from your vet will take care of this. Allergies, usually to food, can also result in itchy ears. In addition to keeping the ears clean, your vet will probably prescribe an antihistamine to calm things down. Severe cases that do not respond to basic treatment may require the use of prednisone to help the immune system. Ear infections of any kind are not minor health issues, and if untreated can lead to some serious problems for your dog, and large veterinary bills for you. Should the infection progress from the outer to the middle and inner ear, you will be facing a case of otitis which can contribute not only to deafness, but to paralysis of the facial muscles. Both bacterial and yeast infections can cause such extreme swelling that the ear passages will actually be closed off. Surgery will then be needed to open them up again. Mastoiditis is an infection that festers in the middle ear then spreads to the mastoid bone. If left untreated, the infection in the bone can go to the brain, causing meningitis and perhaps the death of your companion. It pays to keep an eye on your dog’s ears, and take care of any problems that arise quickly. Not only will your dog be much more comfortable once the infection has been attended to, but it will also save you time and money that will be expended for more involved treatment."
9,A Historical View of Cats,pets," Although it may well make dogs a bit jealous, the most popular pet in the United States is now the cat. Capable of showing affection, tidy in habit, certainly not as boisterous as dogs, the cat can be the ideal pet and companion for busy households that simply may not have the time to devote to the attention-hungry dog. While cats certainly do enjoy the company of their human friends, they are also quite happy to simply lie on a soft cushion or sun on a window sill when left alone for the day. The domestication of the cat coincided with the beginnings of agriculture. Once people started raising grain, approximately 12,000 years ago, rodents became a problem. Stored grain would provide an untold bounty for mice and rats, and while dogs were terrific at hunting game or protecting flocks and villages, they weren’t as efficient at rodent hunting as cats. It is now thought that the domestic cat is descended from Felis sylvestris, the cat of the woods. It is also believed that the partnership between humans and cats began in the Middle East, probably in the Fertile Crescent. Domestication spread rapidly wherever humans were planting crops, and within centuries cats were helping to keep precious stored food safe from rodents over most of the Old World. Even today, mice and rats destroy millions of tons of food every year, either by eating it directly or by despoiling it with their urine and feces. In addition, rodent urine can spread such dangerous diseases as leptospirosis, salmonella, and Hanta virus. Rats are also responsible for spreading bubonic plague, also known as the Black Death, from fleas. Unlike the dog, which has basically received ‘good press’ throughout its association with mankind, the attitude of people towards cats has been somewhat changeable over the centuries, often to the detriment of cats. The Ancient Egyptians revered the cat to such a degree that it was considered to be a demi-god. Harming or killing a cat during this time could bring a sentence of death to the perpetrator. Although Felis sylvestris is the root stock from which most cat breeds have sprung, another cat, Felis chaus, is thought to have been bred with sylvestris during this period. Tomb paintings depict cats hunting birds from boats with their human companions. Cats appear in paintings, frescoes, and statuary from Ancient Egypt, and cats were often mummified to assure them of success in the afterlife. Another people who understood the value of cats in keeping rodents suppressed were the Norse. Their goddess Freya rode in a chariot drawn by a pair of enormous cats, and the farmers in Scandinavia would leave presents to these cats to help make sure that the harvest would be a good one (and probably protected from rodent predation by cats). Famines were common in Ancient China and protecting stored food was of the utmost importance. The goddess Li Shou was the personification of all that is good in cats and she was invoked to provide protection for the home and grain. Statues of the goddess were present in many homes and offerings were made to be assured of her good will. While those in China revered the cat, there were some in Japan who had an opposite point of view. Cats were thought to have the ability to become the changelings of princesses they had killed and so entrap unsuspecting princes and cause their downfall. Undoubtedly, the worst time for cats was during the Middle Ages in Europe. This was a time when superstition overcame religion, and people’s fear of witches and devils caused them to look upon cats as instruments of evil. Part of this stemmed from the preference of cats for night, and partly because some older women who might still be practicing ancient religions that were thought to be witchcraft kept the animals as companions and hunters of mice. The Black Plague is often thought to have become so widespread and severe because so many cats had been killed, allowing the rat population to blossom. Fortunately, today cats have moved back into their spot as revered animals once again in many parts of the world. Loving companions, but still deadly hunters of rodents, these independent, beautiful, and intelligent creatures are important and cherished members of millions of homes worldwide."
10,The Difference Between Sheepdogs and Flock Guardians,pets," Long before mankind began to grow crops, flocks of animals such as cattle, sheep, pigs, and goats were kept to supply families and tribes with a reliable source of protein. It is thought that the early domestication of animals began approximately 10,000 years ago in the Middle East. However, groups of relatively helpless sheep or goats would be subject to predation by wolves, bears, lions, and hyenas that were endemic to the region and a way would be needed to protect these valuable assets. Humans were already using dogs for hunting, so it was only one more step to take to use them with their flocks. Undoubtedly specialization of dogs began very early with larger and more ferocious dogs being used to protect flocks. Besides the need to keep the flock or herd safe, dogs would also come in handy when the animals had to be moved to new pasturage or to winter quarters. In time, two distinct types of dog evolved to fill these needs – sheepdogs and flock guardians. Herding Sheepdogs dogs have proven to be invaluable to pastoralists over the centuries. Able to move as fast or faster than their charges, sheep or cattle dogs are trained from an early age to obey a fairly large number of commands from their master. Because of the large vocabulary sheepdogs must become familiar with, these are accounted among the most trainable and intelligent of dogs. The basis for the dog’s control over the flock is that the sheep is fearful; most herding dogs display stalking behavior that the animals they are controlling recognize instinctively. Sheepdogs display what is called ‘eye’ to help intimidate, along with darting at the flock and nipping at the legs of the animals. These dogs are all quick and have a great deal of stamina. Sheepdogs work closely with the shepherd, to form a team to control and move the flock. These dogs come in a range of sizes, with relatively small dogs like Corgis being used to herd not only sheep, but also cattle and ponies. In addition to the Cardigan and Pembroke Corgis, other herding sheepdogs include Border Collie, Australian Cattle Dog, Belgian Malinois, Puli, Shetland Sheepdog, Old English Sheepdog, Collie, and Beauceron. Most of today’s sheepdogs seldom get the opportunity to practice the craft at which they have been so successfully bred, and are kept mainly as companions. Although all of these dogs make good and loyal pets, several are very protective of the human family and can be suspicious of strangers, and all need a good deal of exercise every day. Sheepdogs that are deprived of the chance to run and burn off some of their energy can develop behavioral problems and/or become overweight. Flock guardians or livestock guardians have been known since the time of Ancient Rome, when mastiff-type dogs were used to drive predators away from flocks. Unlike herding sheepdogs, which can be small or medium in size, flock guardians are massive, heavy dogs capable of dealing with almost any threat to their charges. Some of the popular flock guardians are Maremma Sheepdog, Komondor, Great Pyrenees, South Russian Ovtcharka, Anatolian Shepherd, and Carpathian Sheepdog. To produce the best flock guard dog, the puppy is introduced to the flock that it will guard at as young as 3 weeks of age. This helps the pup to actually become bonded to the flock and become a part of it. Previously, it was thought that humans should have as little contact with the dog as possible, but it has been found that the owners should oversee the bonding of the puppy and young dog to the flock. Guardian dogs take up to 2 years to mature fully. The goats, sheep, or cattle that the dog is guarding are not afraid of the dog, but rather will usually look up to it as the leader. The guardian takes its responsibilities very seriously, and will protect the flock with its life. When a predator approaches the flock, the guardian dog will bark to attempt to scare it away. If that doesn’t work, or the predator continues to come, the dog will attack. These dogs tend to be fearless and will take on predators much larger than themselves in the line of duty. Unlike herding sheepdogs, many of these livestock guardians are completely unsuitable for living in an apartment or the confines of the suburbs. These are tough, hardy dogs that thrive on extreme weather conditions, and they generally do not appreciate being kept indoors. Some of these dogs, such as the Anatolian Shepherd or Ovtcharka, will attack to kill, even humans that they do not know, so must be kept in a situation that allows them to fulfill their potential without causing harm. Also, unlike sheepdogs, flock guardians are not the most trainable of dogs – they have been bred to act independently, away from humans."
11,Stomach Torsion in Dogs and How to Prevent It,pets," Also known as gastric torsion, bloat, and GVD (gastric dilation and volvulus syndrome), stomach torsion is one of the most serious of canine medical conditions. A dog that develops torsion must be seen by a veterinarian immediately in order to save his or her life. Without treatment, mortality is effectively 100%. Stomach torsion is much more common in large dog breeds than it is in medium or small, although theoretically any dog can suffer from this. Male dogs are also the main victims of gastric torsion. Some large breeds are more likely to experience GVD than others, and these breeds include Great Danes, St. Bernards, Bloodhounds, German Shepherds, Boxers, and Irish Setters. These breeds have chests that are relatively narrow compared with their length and breadth. While gastric torsion is generally considered to be a single ailment, it actually consists of two conditions. The first is boat or gastric dilation which occurs when the dog’s stomach becomes filled with gas and fluid. Rather than emptying as it normally would, the stomach becomes larger and larger, causing acute pain and discomfort. This is not something that will go away on its own and the dog must be taken to the veterinarian as soon as possible. The enlarged stomach will fill the body cavity, putting pressure on the lungs, heart, and other organs. The second ailment is volvulus. In most cases, bloat will be followed by volvulus (torsion). When this occurs, the stomach of the dog twists around, completely cutting off the means for the stomach to empty itself. At this point, surgery will be required to save the life of the dog. Even with prompt treatment, death can occur in approximately 50% of the cases. Stomach torsion also causes an interruption in perfusion. Perfusion is the process by which nutrients are delivered from the gastrointestinal system, through the blood, to the body’s organs. Once cells and organs are deprived of the energy they need, they will begin to die – cells first, to be followed by organ death. A dog who is experiencing gastric torsion will exhibit very obvious symptoms – this is not a subtle condition and your companion will attempt to vomit or retch, exhibit a distended abdomen, drool, and wander restlessly. Touching the abdomen will often produce a whimper or yelp of pain. If untreated, the dog may go into shock, have a rapid and weak pulse, and suffer a collapse. Although the signs of GVD are often unmistakable, in some cases the dog may simply walk around with stiff legs and hold the head down; this dog will appear restless and anxious and will be lethargic. While a blood test is often used to provide an accurate diagnosis of bloat, the veterinarian will often proceed with treatment for the condition before the test is completed to save the life of the dog. If the problem is confined to a buildup of gas in the stomach, the vet may be able to put a tube down the sedated dog’s throat and drain out the gas. After the gas has been removed, the stomach will be ‘washed out’ with warm water to remove any debris or fluid that may be there. Antibiotics are administered intravenously to prevent infection in the stomach and/or intestines. In order to calm the system down, corticosteroids will also be given intravenously. Because surgery may well be needed, a medication that will prevent post-operative ulcers will also be introduced. If volvulus torsion of the stomach has already occurred, the only option available to save the life of the dog will be to operate to correct the problem. After fluids have been removed through the use of a large needle, the dog will be opened and the stomach will be revolved back into a normal position. Dead stomach tissue, which may have resulted from lack of blood supply, will be removed at this time. Because dogs who have suffered from GVD have a tendency to suffer stomach torsion again, the vet will tack the stomach to the wall of the body cavity – this will keep the stomach from rotating in the future, although bloat, gas buildup, can occur again. Because GVD is such a serious condition, veterinarians and dog owners are trying to discover ways to prevent it from occurring in the first place.  A number of theories as to why gastric torsion occurs have been put forth and dog owners, especially of susceptible breeds, are counseled to spread feedings out over the course of the day, rather than giving the dog one large meal. Avoid exercise for an hour before and for an hour after the dog has eaten to allow digestion to progress smoothly. Make sure that your dog is drinking plenty of water. Do not raise the dog’s bowls up off the floor. Raising the bowls was initially thought to prevent bloat, but the opposite has been found to be true. Too much dry food is thought to contribute to bloat. Use some canned food to offset any problems the dry food may present. Owners of large, deep-chested dogs sometimes consider having gastroplexy performed on their dog before any problem occurs. This is the procedure whereby the stomach is attached to the body wall. Bloat and stomach torsion are serious conditions that owners will not be able to treat or control at home – see your veterinarian immediately when you suspect that your dog is suffering from GVD, it may just save the life of your companion and friend."
12,Provide Your Outdoor Cat with a House for More Comfort,pets," Cat furniture doesn’t just have to be for inside your home; it can also be used outdoors. Some cats prefer to be out in the big, wide world, especially in spring and summer while the air is warm and weather dry. However, as a cat owner, you still want to protect your feline, even when it’s not in your house, and this is where an outdoor cat house is coming. Waterproof to protect from the rain, and warm to shelter your cat from the wind, the wooden outside cat houses are made for those moggies who would rather remain outside than indoors on those blustery nights. Protection from the elements An accurate stereotype for cats is that they despise water and the rain in particular. The combination of being wet and cold, with water dripping on them, making their fur soggy, chilly and heavy is their worst nightmare. Most of cedar cat houses are waterproof so that if a sudden downpour should occur, your cat will have shelter without having to go into the house. It’s also warm to protect them from the cold and the wind. Usually made of wood, the house is sturdy an secure enough that you don’t have to fret about it being blown over. Protection from unwanted attention As curious as cats are, they don’t appreciate having the tables turned on them. Even when another animal doesn't mean them any harm, if it encroaches on their space, a cat can get extremely territorial. Some custom cat houses are elevated off the ground and have a door that can be closed firmly. Being higher up means the cat can get a good view of their territory in case any other cats or animals, such as foxes, venture into your garden. Your cat can bid a hasty retreat if it wants to, and, if their house is extremely elevated, they can avoid unwanted attention altogether. There are also outdoor cat houses that have doors which require the owner to open and close them. If you know your cat prefers sleeping outdoors, you can be on-hand to close it when your cat hunkers down for the night and let it out in the morning. Fun in the great outdoors Some houses aren’t just the self-contained cat house. If your cat is a full-fledged outdoor cat and doesn’t just like to snooze out there occasionally, you can get large outdoor cat house that are akin to mansions. They contain wooden, waterproof levels and chambers for the cat to play, scratch and sleep in peace and safety. Being sheltered from the elements while still being able to play is an outdoor cat’s dream. Outdoor cats need protecting, just like your indoor cat.

It is just the safest place for your cat to relax while it’s not inside your home."
13,Caring For Your Dog-Helpful Tips,pets," Follow these tips and advice to help keep your dog happy and healthy. Have your dog vaccinated against rabies. Don't let your dog roam around without a leash. This endangers your dog and increases the chances of getting hit by a car or hurt by another animal. On your property make sure your dog is secured and cannot escape or roam around the neighborhood. Have your dog wear a collar and attach ID tags with your contact information on it in case your dog does get loose or lost. Consider installing a microchip. Make sure your dog is  getting the proper nutrition and water. Don't under or over feed. Your dogs eating habits and nutritional needs will change as they age so make sure you make the proper adjustments. Puppies need more feedings throughout the day than a one year old dog.

All of these tips are important and should not be put off or forgotten. Our dogs are animals but when it comes to their health and well being we need to treat them as if they were our child."
14,Dog Collar Tips & Advice,pets," Most of us put a collar on our dogs without putting much thought into buying it other than its color or style.  After its on the Dog we don't even think twice about it. There are many factors that need to go into your collar buying decision other than looks or color, these two things should be the last items on the list. Follow these tips and thoughts next time you are going to buy a collar for your dog. Also follow some of this advice now for the collar that is currently on your Dog. Don't think your Dog needs a collar? How are you going to attach his ID, license, medical and contact information in case he gets away? So its time for a new collar, what kind to get? A nylon, leather, head collar, chain or a choke collar. It depends on your needs and what you are going to use it for. If its just for walking or wearing then a standard nylon or leather one is the best way to go. A normal collar is needed for everyday walking and wearing, so what size to get? The normal rule of thumb says you should be able to get two fingers underneath the collar. It should not be so tight to choke your dog or too loose where they can slip out of it. Measuring length: Measure around your Dog's neck using a cloth measuring tape positioned where the collar sits on the neck. The width of the collar can be smaller and more proportional to your dog's size. 1"" for larger dogs, 3/4"" for medium dogs and 1/2"" or smaller for small or toy dogs. A flat collar or a Martingale Collar? A flat collar is the standard collar for Dogs. It has a buckle or a plastic, quick release closure with a metal ring for attaching your leash, ID tags, etc. They are usually made of nylon or leather. Most breeds can wear a flat collar. A Martingale collar is designed for dogs with narrow heads such as Greyhounds. Its designed so a narrow head dog cannot slip and back out of his collar. If you don't have a narrow head breed and he is slipping out of his collar its probably because the collar is not the right size or fitted properly. Do you want a head, choke or chain (pinching) collar because your Dog pulls a lot and you want to control them? Its OK to buy these but only for training purposes, they should not be used for normal everyday walking and wearing.

They should not be worn for everyday walking or all day use. Flea and tick collars are worn in addition to a regular collar, do not attempt to hook a leash around one of these. They contain chemicals to help protect your dog against fleas and ticks. Flea and Tick collars are usually effective for a short time and need to be replaced regularly. Follow these Dog Collar tips and advice to make sure that your Dog is fitted and wearing the appropriate collar. Doing this is not only a comfort situation for your Dog but also a safety one. Lets keep our Dog a Smiley one."
15,Pet Shedding/Grooming & DeShedder Tool Tips,pets," Regardless of our Pets breed there is no way for us to completely stop shedding. Our Pets need to shed and get rid of old, unneeded or damaged hair. Certain breeds will grow longer hair in the winter to keep them warm and then shed in the summer to keep them cool. Shedding can also result from skin disorders or even a poor diet. By practicing proper grooming techniques and the use of a DeShedding Tool we can help reduce and keep the shedding under control. Regular brushing is essential especially around seasonal changes. Most breeds will benefit from daily brushing using a bristle brush. Regular brushing will make their coat softer, cleaner and less prone to shedding. It will also help root out parasites which can lead to skin irritation and even more shedding. For cats this will also help prevent more hair from being ingested during self grooming, resulting in hair balls, which can cause serious problems. Regular brushing is a good time to observe your Pet's skin and coat to watch for any  changes. If you notice anything unusual talk to your professional groomer or veterinarian. Routine bathing is important and will help control shedding. Never use human shampoo  which can dry out their skin and lead to infections, irritation and dandruff. Purchase a shampoo formulated for your Pet. Cats need less bathing but if their coat is smelly, oily or discolored its a good time for a bath. Brushing our Pet before a bath will help the process and its also a good idea to trim their nails before the bath to prevent more scratching. For drying your pet after a bath, towel dry first. If using a blow dryer after a towel dry, make sure to only use the cool setting and not high heat. Nutrition and diet are extremely important for a healthier skin and coat. Feeding your Pet with advanced nutritional food or vitamins will help keep their coats shiny and skin healthy. While shaving your Pets hair off may seem like a quick fix for shedding, it is not recommended. Shaving will interrupt the natural shedding cycle and affect their ability to regulate body temperature. DeShedding Tool Tips: •Weekly DeShedding might be OK for short hair pets but for longer haired pets, a few times a week will be better. This will help prevent mats, tangles and dirt. •Its best to brush your Pet with a regular brush before using the DeShedding tool to remove any mats or tangles. •Make sure your pet is completely dry prior to using the DeShedding tool. •If it is becoming too difficult for your pet, take a break and come back to it later. •Using the right size DeShedding tool will make the process easier and more effective. •It is fine to use the DeShedding tool on the ears and tail. Just use extra care around these areas. The tool is non-abrasive to the skin. The tool will not cut or damage their coats. •Try not to drop the tool which can break the teeth. Wash the tool with warm water and a mild soap. Make sure the tool is dry before storing. Follow a regular grooming routine and make everybody, including your pet, happy."
16,Dog Toy & Playing Advice,pets," Our Dogs are amazing animals, they will give us unconditional love, be our best friend and play with us no matter what, how special is that? Dogs are more than willing to play with anything we give them or they can get their paws on. Their toys will help them fight boredom and keep them company when we are not home. Playing gives them a way to use their energy, provide physical and mental stimulation, can help prevent behavioral problems and helps to strengthen our bond with our Dog. To keep our Dogs healthy we need to make sure they play with the proper toys and to avoid many unsafe things around the house. The following are things we need to hide from our Dogs which can be dangerous to them: Plastic bags to avoid suffocation. Anything that can be ingested. Rubber bands, strings and ribbons. Baby toys with small parts that dogs can chew  off or unsafe stuffing. We need to become aware of these often over looked items and make sure that our playing environment is a safe one. The following are some tips on playing that should be followed: Make sure any treat dispensing toys are durable, easy to clean and not used to replace meals. Rotating toys is a good idea to avoid boredom. Rotating them keeps your Dog's attention fresh  but it's a good idea to keep their favorite toy out for them. Make sure the toy is not too small or a choking hazard. IE; Balls that are too small for your size dog can be swallowed. Be interactive. Fetch, Frisbee and tugging games create a bond with your dog. Laser pens should be avoided because it can damage your Dog's eyes. They also prevent your dog from the ultimate prize and satisfying their predator instinct. Make homemade toys but make sure any toy does not have sharp edges, protruding parts or small easily detached parts. Do not use children toys. They might be cheaper to buy but they can have stuffing or small parts that can be harmful to dogs. Inspect the toys regularly to make sure they are not tearing, coming apart or breaking. If they are they should be disposed of. If you have multiple dogs every situation is different as far as sharing. Never try to force sharing if they don't want to. If this is the case give each dog their own toys. Be careful with rawhide chews. Some are coated with preservatives that may be toxic and always check their shelf/expiration dates. Our Dogs are members of our families and every precaution needs to be taken the same way we would for a baby. A safe playing environment and proper playtime is essential."
17,Dog Training Collar Advice,pets," We love our dogs and it's extremely important for us to keep them a lovable happy Pet. These are tips for proper use and training to make the training collar as effective as possible and to keep our pets happy. Electronic remote training collars are excellent tools for reinforcing verbal commands like ""Sit"", ""Stay"", ""Down"" or ""Come."" Make sure your pet understands these commands before using the collar. These collars will also control nuisance or aggressive behaviors. Before you start the training, charge the collar and learn how the transmitter works. Become familiar with all the buttons and how to make changes and adjustments. This will make the training part easier when started. It is important to make the collar fit properly. If it is too loose the probes will not make the proper contact. The collar comes with 2 different sets of probes, short and long. The longer ones are for dogs that have long hair. The probes need to touch the dog's skin to stimulate properly, if not, the dog may not feel the stimulation and the collar will not be effective. The collar has 3 different training modes and 100 levels of intensity. Whichever mode you choose, make sure you start at a lower level than a higher one. Test your dog to see how he/she responds to the stimulation. You want to see a slight reaction by your dog, not a yelp. If your dog is not responding then slowly increase the stimulation level until your dog responds properly and obeys the stimulation. Call out a command, if your dog doesn't obey immediately correct he/she by pressing the stimulation button. We think it is best not to hold the button until the dog obeys, a shorter, quicker duration of stimulation is best. Keep repeating until your dog obeys and be sure to reward their correct behavior. It could be a pat on the back, verbal praise or a treat. To correct nuisance or aggressive behavior (barking, chasing, jumping, chewing, etc) when your dog performs the behavior immediately press the stimulation button. Your dog will soon learn that their behavior can cause an unwanted stimulation. Over time that correction will occur even when you are not there. It is important that the dog does not associate that the stimulation is from you or the transmitter. It's better for your dog to think that the stimulation is connected to the unwanted behavior instead. Try to discreetly use the transmitter and do not make it obvious that the stimulation is from you. The training results will be more effective and we don't want our dogs to think that their unpleasant feeling is from their dear owner. Electronic remote training is a safe, effective way to get positive results from training your dog. A better behaved pet will strengthen your bond and provide a more positive relationship. This training tool will keep our relationships with our dogs a SMILEY one."
18,"Canine ""Drowning"" on Terra Firma",pets," It is summer and what better time for your dog to dive into your swimming pool or at a sparkling lake, or playfully bite at the water jets from your lawn sprinklers or garden hose.  When it’s hot outside, there is nothing better than a face-full of cool, refreshing water.  But beware, if your dog takes in an excessive amount of water, it can lead to an uncommon but deadly condition known as water intoxication.  Water intoxication can affect any dog but small dogs, high-drive dogs, and dogs with little body fat are at a higher risk. When your dog’s body takes in more water than it can handle, it suffers a condition call hyponatremia, when sodium levels outside the cells are depleted.  The body attempts to rebalance itself by increasing fluid intake inside the cells in response to the low blood sodium.  Some organs have room to accommodate their swelling cells but others, like the brain, cannot as it is encased in bone.  The signs of water intoxication include lethargy, bloating, vomiting, stumbling, falling, staggering, restlessness, increased salivation, pale gums, dilated pupils and glazed eyes, and as pressure increases in the brain and cells begin to die off, the dog may have difficulty breathing, develop seizures, and lose consciousness. It is believed that water intoxication is much more common than thought and it is frequently misdiagnosed.  Many first guesses at veterinary emergency clinics include head trauma, hypothermia, and overexertion.  A number of veterinarians don’t know water intoxication exists as there is such a minimal amount of literature published on the condition.  One of the only scholarly works found was published in 1925.  Even some internal-medicine specialists seem confused at how a water-logged canine body turns on itself, thinking that if the kidneys are working, excess amounts of water shouldn’t be a problem.  One sure sign of water intoxication is lower-than-normal sodium levels but it’s not how low the sodium falls as much as how quickly it falls.  The intake of water has stopped and blood-sodium levels may start to normalize by the time the dog gets to the veterinarians office but the cellular damage has already been done.  If a dog is showing neurological signs from wobbling to seizures, and if the dog has been playing in water from the garden hose, pool, lake, etc. then water intoxication should be a consideration. Any dog who ingests too much water too fast can suffer water intoxication but advances quickly in small dogs because their bodies are easily overwhelmed by the excess fluid but high-drive dogs like Border Collies, Jack Russell Terriers and Papillion’s seem to develop it more than other breeds.  Because they are super-focused and high-energy dogs, they may be at a greater risk due to their personalities.  High-drive dogs are bred for agility and are obsessive about what they do.  Having said that, you would think the water-centric sport of dock diving would pose a higher risk of water intoxication but students of the sport have learned what to look for and how to combat it which includes taking breaks from swimming and using a flat toy for retrievals to keep the dog’s mouth from gaping open.  Also, dock diving dogs catch their toys in mid-air and their mouths are closed around the toy by the time they hit the water.  As their time in the water is limited, they have more opportunity to rid their bodies of extra fluid between runs.  Water work or retrieving bred dogs such as Newfoundland’s, Chesapeake Bay Retrievers, and Labrador Retrievers, to name a few, do not usually come up in discussions of water intoxication as these dogs have been bred for generations to move through the water with their mouths tightly closed and to create as little surface disturbance on the water as possible. Mild cases of water intoxication may take care of themselves without being noticed by the dog’s owner.  The dog may come out of the water staggering but then un-dilutes by urinating, thus removing the excess fluid from the body before it is overwhelmed.  Since water intoxication involves a lack of sodium, replenishing this mineral is crucial.  Treatment includes the administration of moderate levels of electrolytes, drugs to decrease intracranial pressure, and diuretics to help speed the removal of excess fluid, but really severe cases probably won’t survive because the brain stem dies and that controls respiration.  There is too much permanent damage. Preventing water intoxication does not mean your dog must swear off any contact with water, just take adequate precautions which include choosing flat rather than round objects to retrieve.  When your dog retrieves a round object, he has to keep his mouth open wider than a dog who closes his mouth around a flatter object.  Also, the dog must hold his head up high in order to see a flatter object floating in the water.  Know your dog and how he interacts with water.  Some dogs are careful swimmers, with their noses pointed to the sky and their mouths clamped shut.  Others are more enthusiastic and like to splash in the pool or bite at the stream of water coming from the garden hose or sprinkler.  It is these dogs that are likely at greater risk than more reserved dogs.  Do not let your dog dive for toys as this will avoid water intake.  Water shooting from a garden hose does so under such high pressure that, even though it is so much fun, your dog could ingest far more water than he should.  It is important to take regular time-outs on land to give your dog an interruption from ingesting water and an opportunity to rid his body of extra fluid by urinating.  Tired dogs swim low in the water allowing for inadvertent intake of more water than if he was rested. The opposite of water intoxication is salt-water toxicity.  Symptoms of hypernatremia (salt poisoning) include vomiting and diarrhea.  As fluid is drawn out of the brain and severe dehydration begins, neurological symptoms such as lack of coordination and seizures ensue.  Careful administration of IV fluids help to restore electrolyte balance as with water intoxication.  Offer your dog fresh water and frequent, shady rest breaks as a precaution when at the beach or seaside. The best way to deal with water intoxication is to not let it happen at all.  Pay attention because it is real and it is out there."
19,Tired Of Your Dog Ruling The Roost? Check Out These Simple Tips To Train Your Pet!,pets," One of the most important things to remember when training your dog is that it is a lifelong process. Many owners think that once their pet has the basics down, the training process is over. Dogs, much like people, learn throughout their lives, and consistent training will help them to be well-behaved and friendly. Reward your dog for obeying you, but only occasionally. Rewards like treats and excessive praise can be useful tools when training your dog. Just be careful that you do not condition them to expect this every time they do as they are are told. Reward them for following instruction, but do so randomly. Be sure that your canine is consuming a healthy diet. If your dog isn't getting what he needs from his diet, he will have a hard time concentrating during training. It is damaging to their health as well as making them more prone to bad behaviors. With the right healthy diet, your dog will be more energetic and eager to please during training sessions. To train a dog to stop barking you must first train him to bark on command. When the dog barks on command instead of when he chooses to bark, it is easier to teach him to stop barking during the training session. Once he learns the command for ""stop barking"" he will follow it outside of training. If you want to help your dog succeed in his training program, take a moment to try and think like he does. Understanding how your pet views the world can help you make better training decisions for him. The better suited your program is to your dog's personality, the more success you will have while training. To achieve the best results when housebreaking a pet, be aware of the food and water he consumes. Make sure that you feed your dog at least three times per day with good food. This ensures your dog won't have accidents as you'll know when to expect a trip outside. Stay with the training, so that he doesn't forget the lessons that he learned. Keep him in practice. Do not assume that your dog will remember his training all his life. You can encourage your dog to adopt good habits. That is why it is vital to ensure your dog maintains a strict rule system. Learn to read how your dog is feeling. By studying your pet's body language, you'll be able to guess whether it is feeling nervous, agitated, aggressive, or calm. If you can predict when a dog is about to behave badly, you can remove it from a bad situation before a problem develops. If your dog barks and growls at strangers in your home, do this: leash your dog, make him sit, wait until his attention is on you, and hand the leash, in full view of the dog, to your guest. Then wait until the dog is calm again, with the guest giving commands as needed. This teaches the dog that your guest ranks above him in ""the pack"" and he must accept them. When the dog starts to react again, repeat the exercise. Every owner owes it to their dog to know the basics of dog training. And the good news is that, even if you know little about canine behavior, there are simple and very easy steps you can take to develop a more positive and healthy relationship with your dog."

Next turn away from your dog and make sure that no-one gives it attention for a full 20 minutes. Tip 4 - Don't walk around your dog – make your dog move for you. An Alpha dog in a pack environment would never walk around a dog that's in its path. You should do the same. If your dog is in your way, make it move. You don't need to go out of your way to walk where your dog is relaxing, but if you do need to walk there, make your dog move. This give a very clear signal to your dog that you are the leader. Tip 5 - Don't sleep with your dog. If you really want to show superiority, don't allow your dog to sleep on your bed. When your dog sleeps in the same place as you it feels like it's on the same level socially. Making your dog sleep on the floor avoids any confusion and will allow you to easily maintain Alpha Dog status. After implementing the tips mentioned above you will become the Alpha Dog. Being the Alpha dog means your dog will respect you more and behave accordingly. Your dog will also be much happier knowing its place in the relationship."
3,Five Ways To Handle Cat Behavior Problems,pets," Quite a few people who get a cat as a family pet at some time might notice a variety of cat behavior problems.  These are behaviors that you don't want your cat doing for example consuming other cats' food, jumping on furnishings, hostility, cat litter box problems, along with scratching.  There are generally five intriguing things that you'll be able to do that will certainly assist you to deal with these types of behaviors. Cat consuming other cats' food. Occasionally moving a single cat away from the remainder of the group will be a remedy.  This might be feeding the problem one in another room.  Other times it might mean feeding those who are not getting enough at a distinct time. Cats jumping on home furniture. Use water to your advantage.  Water is something that almost all cats do not like.  If perhaps your cat is jumping on furnishings for instance, spraying a little bit of water on the cat will certainly be quite effective.  This is a tool that you need to use in moderation to help along with improper habits. Cats becoming way too aggressive. There are generally numerous problems such as aggression that are caused by the cat becoming way too lonely.  If perhaps the animal is at home all day long alone, it seems sensible that the kitty is acting out.  Sometimes having other cats at home might help.  Additionally stopping aggression as soon as you observe it, particularly in a kitty is critical. Cats not using the litter box. Sometimes you may observe that a cat isn't using the litter box.  This may be for a wide array of reasons.  Often you have to keep the litter box cleaner because this specific cat might be much more fussy.  In other cases you will need to supply a second cat litter box which is closer to be able to keep away from this problem. Cats scratching home furniture. Giving your cats something to scratch on at times may help limit this problem.  Often times utilizing distraction will be a great tactic to use whenever your cat is being bad.  If perhaps your cat is doing something you dislike, distracting using a toy is one thing that you should consider.  Often this can help keep the cat from continuing doing things that you do not like. Keep at it and your cat's behavior will change."
4,The Art of Catching a Dog on the Run,pets," There was a time when dogs simply wandered and meandered the streets without so much as a second look from the populous and owners assumed that, sooner or later, the dogs would come home.  Not so today due in large to a more diligent dog culture and increased compliance with leash laws, a majority of our best four-legged friends are safe behind fences or inside our homes when they cannot be supervised.  Now,  when we see a dog on the loose, our first assumption is that he has escaped or has been dumped and is lost.  Naturally, our first instinct is to try to catch the dog before he wanders into traffic or another life-threatening scenario. Just like us, dogs have different personalities and a gregarious, well-adjusted dog is easy to catch; they just amble up to you with their tail wagging.  But other dogs may be timid, insecure, reactive and under-socialized and the experience of being out in the wide world can be disorienting and terrifying, making catching a panicked dog something of an art.  You need to know what will soothe and what will spook him, what precise move you need to make and when to make it, therefore, the following are some dos and don’ts for catching a dog on the run and bringing him back safe and sound, which applies to both of you: •	Don’t grab.  Instinct takes over when trying to capture a dog on the loose with undesirable results.  Don’t make sudden moves or try to immobilize a loose dog by clutching him to your chest and don’t lunge at a frightened, lost dog as he may bite. •	Don’t chase the dog.  Our biological programming tells us to run after what we want but the problem here is, the dog will outrun you, sometimes directly into the path of danger.  If you see a dog wandering in traffic, don’t jump out of your car.  Turn on your flashers and follow the dog as best you can without disturbing the flow of traffic.  Whenever it is safe, pull over and call the highway patrol to assist in stopping and/or slowing traffic. •	Don’t talk.  Once again, our natural instinct, when we see a loose dog, is to slap our leg encouragingly and send an auditory signal that we are happy to see him and would like to get closer.  A loose dog is flooded with adrenaline and is very reactive, causing him to associate these actions as something frightening and overwhelming making him bolt when he hears them, even from his owner. •	Use calming signals such as yawning, using your peripheral vision, and blinking (not direct stares), and oblique approaches such as moving from the side, not head on.  Avoid moving toward him in a direct line, standing rigidly straight and staring at him, as you will be mimicking a predator. •	Go low and slow; get down to the dog’s level and be extremely patient.  It may take hours of sitting motionless before a lost dog decides to come over to check you out.  You can drop to the ground and fake indifference or lay flat with some food on your stomach and watch the dog from your peripheral vision – do not stare. •	Get a ""Magnet Dog"" to ride shotgun.  Sometimes a lost dog is so suspicious of humans that you need the assistance of a friendly, playful, gregarious dog to entice the lost dog to come closer.  Large dogs can be boisterous and hard to handle as the lost dog comes near so look for a reliable dog-friendly toy or medium-sized breed as your magnet.  Keep your body angled away from the lost dog so you are not facing him head on and yawn or blink.  This will, hopefully, make you fade into the background, giving tunnel vision to the skittish dog, causing him to focus on your magnet dog, not you. •	Don’t be unprepared.  Always carry a leash in your car and some treats.  When waiting for a lost dog to approach, keep the leash inconspicuous but handy.  This way, you can put it on quickly should you capture the dog before either of you panic. •	Don’t assume the worst.  Once the lost dog has been captured, think ""lost"", not ""stray"" as some dogs are dumped, but not as many as you think.  The condition of the dog is often not indicative of how it was treated.  If the dog is emaciated and in poor condition, it could be that he has been on the loose for a month or more and not the product of an abusive environment.  If the dog is skittish or reactive, don’t assume he has been abused.  More likely than not this is just the dog’s temperament and Mother Nature is to blame, not his owner. •	Do go to the shelter with a captured lost dog even if you are reluctant to do so out of fear the dog will be euthanized.  If you don’t leave the dog there, keep in mind that the local animal control facility will be one of the first places an owner will check for his lost companion so leave information where the lost dog can be located. Many shelters have equipment used for scanning dogs for implanted microchips which will give you the information needed to return a frightened lost dog safely home to his very worried owner."
5,Some Suggestions before Starting To Make a Cat Tower,pets," Your cat might need a cat tower, but have you ever tried to design and make your own one? Well, if you haven’t given it a try thinking that its rocket science, then it isn’t as hard as you may think. Save Money Making a tower can be a great way of saving money. Usually, ready-made cat furniture may cost you somewhere in the range of US $100 -US $300, but when you try to build one on your own, the cost may be minimal ($40 at the most). So, it can be a smart choice for the budget-minded people to make their own cat tree. Choose the Design of Tower You can take a look at the cat towers in pet stores and also on different online shopping portals to get a better idea of different models and sizes. You need to start thinking of few basic things before building it. You need to consider the number of cats present in your house. Do they share the space, or each of them requires its own personal space? Cat trees or towers need a stable base and strong poles. And the additional aspect is to add some amusement for the cats like a condo, hammock or just a perch for more relaxing. If you are planning to build your own cat tree, then you need to take a look at some of the materials at hand, in order to build it at minimal cost. So, what exactly do you require to build the whole project? Well, let’s start with the carpet first. Choose the Right Carpet for Your Cat Tower If you are intending to build a tower and haven’t done so before, then you might have got more questions in your mind. Many questions focus may revolve around the material types that you need to use. It’s always necessary to use only soft materials that the cats would love to cuddle with. Where to Buy Carpet? You can find a good one at any decent carpet outlet or building supply store. If you are planning to purchase a carpet role, you may be left with too much of excess raw materials. So, it would be better idea if you pick one from the scrap yard. Most of the carpet outlets do have remnants and they are sold at heavily discounted prices. Which Type Is Best? When you want to build your own cat tower and you are ready to cover the same with a carpet, you need to address few more considerations. First, you need to look into the color. This is totally a personal choice, and it is left to you. Other Considerations Then, you need to decide on the pile, weight, and texture that you want to use. If you are not familiar with the carpet terms, pile refers to carpet fiber’s length and weight refers to the thickness. When it comes to texture, it is best to choose for non-loop type. If you want to make the cat tower look more appealing, and do not want to get frustrated during the construction process, you need to stick to the medium-size pile as well as medium weight carpets. If the fibbers are too thick, it will be little tricky to bend and staple the corners and edges of shelves. If it is too thin or too short, then your cat will not feel comfortable on it. How Much Carpet Is Required? The carpet that is required will depend on the size and model you will choose. But in most cases you will need about 10 sq-ft if you want to create good looking cat tower."
6,Be My Memory – Alzheimer’s Assistance Dogs,pets," Alzheimer’s disease is frightening.  The loss of your health as well as the part of you that makes you unique is a terrifying idea.  Those who are affected by this disease begin to lose memory, judgment, and orientation in time and to their surroundings, along with their ability to relate normally to the presence of people because of damage to their cognitive thinking.  These changes interrupt their normal function in everyday life.  The loss of orientation interferes with the ability to return home safely which could be compromising to their safety every time they step out of the door alone. As the disease progresses, Alzheimer’s sufferers experience terrible isolation, frustration, anger and helplessness.  As the disease starts slowly, it leaves the sufferer aware of what is happening to him and what he can expect in the future.  People as young as 50 to 60 can start feeling the first effects, and active, respected professionals find themselves prisoners in their own homes, dependent on others for even the simplest things.  The resulting depression and despair often leads the patient to refuse to leave his home or bed and to refuse contact with others as well as serious deterioration of the patient’s physical health. An Israeli dog trainer, specializing in training dogs for various disabilities, felt that there had to be a way to train dogs to help early onset Alzheimer’s sufferers live a normal life for as long as possible so as not to be a burden on their families and caretakers.  Dogs assist people with a variety of physical and mental disabilities so there should be no reason why they could not also be trained to help Alzheimer’s patients.  After consulting with medical, psychiatric, social workers, and technical experts, a service dog program was developed to specifically cope with the problems of this condition. The first dog to be trained in the program was a smooth collie, starting when she was three months of age.  Her main job is to bring her master safely home when he becomes disoriented, avoiding obstacles such as parked cars, holes, traffic and anything else that might get in the way.  In addition, she is trained to give her charge support to avoid falls and injuries which Alzheimer’s sufferers experience when they have lost their orientation to their surroundings. Patients often feel fear, distress, loneliness, and anxiety, and lose the ability to act with caution so the task of the dog is to be a friend and be with the patient 24 hours a day.  They are able to calm their owner and distract him from his fears and worries and improve his mood.  The dog is with him at night and when other family members are busy with other pursuits so the patient is never alone.  When their charge is feeling depressed and will  not get out of bed, the dog is trained to pester him by pulling off the blanket, bringing toys, and will not quit until his owner gets up and tends to his needs.  It is important for Alzheimer’s sufferers to keep active as it is believed to be a factor to slowing the progression of the disease.  Alzheimer’s assistance dogs enable their owners to go out for a walk without the company of other family members which is excellent for the well-being of the patient, increasing contact with other people who show an interest and are curious about the dog wearing the special harness.  This contact and interaction helps to bring the Alzheimer’s patient out of the loneliness, isolation, and boredom cycle.  The Alzheimer’s assistance dog is trained to detect unusual physical conditions or problems with their owner such as difficulties breathing, falls and the like and will call for help. The primary task of the assistance dog is to bring his master safely home.  If the patient begins to feel lost or disoriented, he is conditioned to give the command ""Home!"" to the dog.  The dog takes control, leads the patient back home and barks at the door to alert the family members.  A special GPS homing device, which is attached to the dog’s harness should his master forget the command, is not able to give the command, or has wandered into a completely unfamiliar area, can be used by family members to alert the dog that it is time to come home.  The GPS device can locate the dog should the patient refuse to follow. The task of the Alzheimer’s assistance dog is demanding, complex, and stressful, more so than any service task performed by dogs as they must be able to take the initiative when necessary and function without any commands from their owner, in response to the situation.  These dogs must be able to put up with the radical mood changes, typical of the disease; to stay loving, devoted, and able to keep working.  After much consideration and trying various possibilities, the smooth collie proved the ideal breed.  This efficient herding dog is highly trainable without being overly active or spirited and are not aggressive to people or other dogs and animals.  They have a strong play drive which is essential in their training, extremely loyal, and want to be with their people 24 hours a day.  They are tough, resilient, and tolerant of mood changes in their master and keep on working and will not let patient instabilities interfere with the dog and master bonding.  They are a healthy breed and easy to care for. Now, a larger breeding group of smooth collies must be established from stock with proven working ability; to produce more puppies to assist more people.  Alzheimer’s assistance dogs can change the lives of people living in despair due to this horrible disease and help them live independent and functional lives for as long as possible."
7,Holiday and Winter Hazards and Your Pets,pets," While our dogs will be very unlikely to understand the meaning of the winter holiday season, they will certainly pick up on the excitement and preparations. There will often be guests visiting, and in the subsequent bustle, it will be easier for your dog to bring harm upon himself. Keeping in mind that the holidays can present dangers to dogs, and understanding what those dangers might be can help guarantee that your best friend will be in good shape to greet the New Year. Christmas and the holiday season in general will see a great deal of candy in evidence, including chocolates. Although dogs love chocolate as much as their owners do, chocolate is poisonous to dogs – the problem element is theobromine, and it will not take much to make a dog sick, or even cause the dog’s death. The darker the chocolate, the more danger for your dog. Keep chocolate out of the reach of all dogs in the home. Skip giving King or Beauty any of your fruit cake this year, too. Grapes and raisins are both poisonous to dogs. Any other cookie or cake that contains raisins, almonds, or currents should be on the forbidden list. Dieters who are substituting xylitol for sugar to save on calories should keep any treats prepared with this sweetener away from their dog. Xylitol will cause a rapid and potentially fatal drop in blood sugar in dogs. Many people are tempted to throw the dog some of the turkey bones as the holiday bird is picked clean. Despite the mythos of dogs surviving on bones, bones of all kinds are actually dangerous for dogs as they can splinter and perforate the stomach or intestines. The holidays mean that a great deal of fatty food will be in evidence, and fat trimmed from ham, roasts, or the roast bird can pose problems for your dog. Too much fat can bring on an episode of pancreatitis, which is painful at best, and life-threatening at the worst. Tinsel is sometimes looked upon as a delicacy by dogs. Eating tinsel can result in intestinal blockage, which will necessitate a trip to the vet’s to handle. Glass ornaments that fall off the tree and shatter can also be eaten by dogs, especially puppies. The Christmas tree can cause problems for your dog in several ways: dogs can knock over the tree either accidentally or deliberately, or the dog might eat some of the pine needles. Once inside your dog, pine needles will act in much the same way as bones; puncturing the tissues of the intestines and stomach. They can also lodge in the esophagus. While the dangers of antifreeze are now quite well known and dog owners generally make sure to keep this away from their dogs, they may be unaware that those lovely snow globes often have an antifreeze-based fluid inside them. If these break, a dog could lap up poison that could cause kidney failure. It’s no secret that people tend to consume a greater than normal amount of alcoholic beverages during the holidays, and some of these can be attractive to your dog, especially a drink like eggnog. Holiday punch may also smell good to a dog, so keep any drinks that contain alcohol well out of the dog’s reach. Decorations for the holiday often include candles, which lend a definite atmosphere. However, in addition to the dangers of burns and hot wax, if your dog knocks over a burning candle, it can cause a house fire, especially if the candle was near the Christmas tree. Puppies, and some older dogs, too, will often chew on electrical cords. While you may have taken care to keep your usual cords safe from canine teeth, lights on the tree and other decorations can present additional hazards, so take care to keep all pets away from electric cords. Don’t let your dog get lost outside during the holidays. With the arrival of company, the door will be open for much longer than it is usually, and a dog that has become nervous with all the new people and happenings may bolt out. Making sure that your dog is wearing his or her tags or has been micro-chipped are ways of assuring that you will get your lost pooch back as quickly as possible. Keeping your dog safe and healthy over the holiday season isn’t difficult; it just takes a bit of forethought and planning."
8,"Canine Stroke – Symptoms, Treatment, and Prevention",pets," If your dog suffered a stroke, would you know?  Do you know the symptoms and what to do?  Canine stroke symptoms are different from human stroke symptoms and usually appear suddenly.  Common symptoms in humans include paralysis on one side of the body and drooping face.  This is not so in canines.  Their stroke symptoms include changes in behavior and loss of balance.  Blindness, heart arrhythmia or collapse can occur in severe cases.  Although strokes are very rare in dogs, they recover faster than humans.  Canine stroke symptoms vary based on the location of the stroke and often include a tilting of the head, or walking in circles.  They may turn the opposite or wrong way when called, eat out of only one side of their food bowl, and act tired or lethargic.  They may suffer loss of bladder and bowel control, become blind and have a sudden change in behavior. There are two kinds of canine stroke, ischemic and hemorrhagic but both types involve a disruption in the flow of blood to the brain. Ischemic stroke occurs when a blocked artery disrupts blood flow to the brain.  A hemorrhagic stroke happens when actual bleeding in the brain, caused by a burst blood vessel, disrupts blood flow.  Conditions which are the main cause for ischemic stroke are kidney, liver, heart or Cushing’s disease, diabetes, parasites, tumors, fat, spinal cartilage, high blood pressure, and over or under active thyroid glands.  Conditions which are the main cause for hemorrhagic stroke include all types of diseases which lead to high blood pressure such as kidney, heart, Cushing’s, blood clotting diseases, head trauma, brain tumor, consumption of rat poison, inflammation of the arteries, lung worm, immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, and abnormal blood vessel development in the brain.  Needless to say, if you see symptoms of stroke in your dog, take him or her to your veterinarian right way. When diagnosing the stroke symptoms of a dog, the veterinarian will do a complete physical exam before running a series of tests.  He or she will view your dog’s brain via a CT scan or an MRI in order to diagnose the stroke as it will not show up on an X-ray.  Once verified that your dog has indeed suffered a stroke, the next step is finding the cause.  This may include blood tests, X-rays, ultra-sound tests, and a spinal tap.  Head trauma can also be cause for stroke.  Keep in mind that in about 50% of all cases, cause of the stroke is not able to be determined. Treatment for canine stroke is focused on treating the cause, if determined, as a preventative for future strokes.  Corticosteroids for brain swelling along with anticonvulsant medication to prevent seizures are usually prescribed.  Studies show that dogs can recover quickly from strokes with most dogs recovering their motor functions and movement control within several weeks, however, the extent of recovery depends on the severity of the stroke and the amount of damage done to the brain.  There is a good chance that the dog’s behavior may change so pet owners must accept the truth of this fact.  The best treatment for canine stroke is to maintain a healthy lifestyle for your dog.  This goes a long way in preventing and controlling the disease and keeping it from causing more damage to the brain in the future. Dogs suffering from kidney disease can prevent canine stroke by controlling their diet.  Feeding your dog a diet with low levels of phosphorus may slow down and reduce the mineral deposits in the kidneys.  High levels of nitrogenous wastes can cause nausea and vomiting.  Low protein diets have less nitrogenous wastes but, if not careful, can lead to dog malnutrition.  Do not change your dog’s diet without discussing it with your veterinarian first.  Obese dogs are at a higher risk for developing heart disease so a good balanced diet and frequent exercise is imperative.  Canine diabetes is a disorder of metabolism caused by less insulin being produced by the pancreas or cells that do not accept insulin normally.  Dogs suffering from diabetes will need insulin for the rest of their lives and adhering strictly to their diet is important.  Food that is high in protein and fiber with restricted fats and carbohydrates is best. Another choice for prevention for dogs who have had a stroke is to supplement their diet with herbal supplements which are designed to support brain and nervous system function.  Look for ingredients such as passiflora incarnate or Passionflower which helps the nervous system, also Skullcap, Hyoscyamus (30C), Belladonna (30C), and Cuprum mettalicum (30C). Keep in mind, if your dog is very young or very old, he will be at higher risk for a stroke when exposed to extreme temperatures.  Though some experts believe there is no age, sex or breed predisposition associated with domestic canine stroke, others believe that breeds with extremely thick coats and those with flat faces, such as bulldogs and pugs, are stoke-prone due to the fact that their respiratory pathways are narrow and limited , a consideration when purchasing a breed dog. Canine stoke is a real and dangerous thing.  Knowing what to look for and how to prevent future strokes is more than half the battle."
9,Caring for a Litter of Puppies,pets," For those who are looking forward to their favorite companion delivering her puppies, they should be aware that quite a lot of effort will probably have to be expended for the litter to be successful. Puppies are born prematurely and are completely helpless – their eyes and ears are closed and they have only a limited ability to move. It is possible to lose some puppies every litter but you can greatly increase the survival rate of your dog’s litter if you prepare for every eventuality beforehand. Expect to spend a considerable amount of time caring for puppies, especially if the mother is unresponsive or absent. If you have bred your female dog you will first have to prepare a nest box for her. This can be a cardboard box that will be large enough to accommodate her and the puppies. The box should be twice the size of the mama dog when she lies down. The sides should be low enough so that she can leave easily, but high enough to keep the puppies in. A layer of newspapers should be put in the bottom of the box first, and then this should be covered with clean rags. It’s a good idea to have an abundant supply of rags ready as it is inevitable that the puppies will soil the nest on a regular basis, and both mother and pups should be kept as clean as possible. In some cases the mother will be unable or unwilling to care for the puppies, and the owner will have to take on some or all of the duties of raising the litter. Even a capable, alert mother dog will not turn up her nose at some help along the way. Before the litter arrives, the following supplies should be on hand, even if you don’t ever have to use them. Canine replacement formula is available as a premade liquid or as a powdered formula. If the latter is used, use only distilled water or water that has been purified and boiled – the intestinal systems of puppies is extremely delicate and they will develop diarrhea if untreated tap water is used. Cow’s milk will also give puppies diarrhea. Nursing bottles designed for newborn puppies should also be on hand. A puppy heating pad can provide added warmth for the litter, even if the mother is present. Tiny puppies have no way of controlling their body temperature, so must be kept warm. Heating pads designed for puppies will not overheat – regular pads can become too hot and kill the puppies so be sure to use the correct ones. Toilet tissue should be available to help the puppies go to the bathroom and to clean them up. Newborn pups need the stimulation of their mother’s tongues or a moistened tissue to be able to urinate and defecate; this is a way to help keep the den clean. This should be done after every feeding and every several hours as well if the mother does not perform this duty herself. Pasting can be a real problem; feces can accumulate on the rear end of a puppy and block normal processes. If a puppy becomes listless and stops feeding, check their hind quarters. Use a warm, wet cloth to loosen the hardened stool and remove it, but be prepared for an explosion. Shallow puppy bowls should also be purchased for use when the pups begin to eat and drink on their own. A scale, either one designed for this purpose or a postal scale should be used every day to weigh the pups. Record the weight of each puppy, and if one begins to lose weight, you will have to begin supplemental feeding right away. Within about 2 weeks the eyes of the puppies will be open, and it will not be long before they will be able to begin eating food. Human baby food, such as rice cereal, mixed with canine formula will get the pups off to a good start, and you can then progress to puppy kibble that has been softened with warm water. Helping to raise a litter of puppies is a lot of work, but the satisfaction you will feel at seeing those healthy, active, happy puppies makes it all worthwhile."
10,Helping Your Dog Get Along With Other Family Pets,pets," If you have, or are planning to have, a multi-pet household, one of the first things to consider will be the breed of dog you want. Some breeds of dog are friendlier than other breeds and include poodles, beagles, cavalier spaniels, and retrievers. These breeds, among many others, will be more likely to accept another dog or pet in the home, while other breeds may present some problems. Always remember that all dogs are individuals and you will find variation in personality in all breeds. Some dog breeds were developed to participate in dog fights and these breeds may be best in single-pet households – pit bulldog, Tosa, Fila Brasileiro, and Akita are all dog breeds that have a high level of dog-to-dog aggression, and they are often aggressive to other pets as well. While some hunting dogs, such as Labrador or Golden Retrievers are calm dogs that will accept all pets, some breeds still have a high prey drive and will hunt and chase smaller pets in the home, such as cats, rabbits, and Guinea pigs. Afghan hounds and Dachshunds will never be trustworthy around smaller pets, and this should not be held against them, it is simply their innate nature. If you are bringing a dog into a household where there are already cats, or are adopting a cat, you should remember that the cat will probably be terrified of the dog, regardless of the dog’s docility. Some dogs have absolutely no interest in bothering cats, while others will look forward to a good chase. However, except in extreme cases, it shouldn’t be difficult to get your dog and cat to at least be respectful of one another. A puppy, naturally, will be easier to train to accept a cat. Because the personality of the pup is still developing, familiarity with cats at an early age will lessen the chances that the adult dog will act aggressively towards them. Regardless of the age of your dog, however, keep the dog and cat separated to begin with. The cat will probably be frightened of the dog and must be allowed to become accustomed gradually to it. Keeping the animals in separate rooms, but allowing them to sniff at one another through a gate is a good way to promote tolerance, and hopefully friendship. When the cat and dog actually meet face to face, have both of them on a leash, they will be much easier to control. Make sure that you reward with treats for good behavior, and don’t bother yelling if things go wrong, it will only make the situation more emotionally charged. If the pets involved will be two dogs, keep in mind that dogs of the same sex are less likely to get along than opposites. A male and a female dog will be more likely to become friends than two females, and two males may actually fight. The size of the dog will also have a bearing on how the adjustment will go, regardless of whether you are introducing a puppy or kitten. Regardless of how friendly and tolerant the dog may be, large or giant dogs can inadvertently harm smaller pets when trying to play with them. Dogs can be taught to accept and even be friendly to ferrets, birds, rabbits, and other small pets, but still should never be left alone with them. You should always cage small animals if they are going to be alone with the dog when you are not present. As it has been scientifically proven that dogs have the same set of emotions that humans do, and that their brains respond in the same way, it’s not too surprising that jealousy is among the emotions dogs can feel. Dogs have been living with humans for tens of thousands of years and have shaken off much of their old canine loyalties and transferred them to people. Some dogs are so attached to their owners that they will even be jealous of inanimate objects, in much the same way that a child may become jealous of the telephone if mother talks on it too much. Never make light of jealousy in a dog, especially in a large breed, as it can result in attacks on people or other pets. Proper socialization is helpful in circumventing jealousy – when the dog sees the owner in a number of different situations, it will become accustomed to ‘sharing’. Make sure that the dog receives a treat and a vocal reinforcement when he or she behaves properly. If jealousy problems have already developed, take steps immediately to remedy them. Give more attention to the jealous dog when interacting with the other pet or person, and be lavish with praise when things go well. There will be times when your efforts to curb jealousy are unavailing, and at this point you should speak to your vet or a canine behaviorist."
11,Are Wolves or Foxes Ancestors of Today’s Companion?,pets," Although most people consider wolves to be the direct ancestors of domesticated dogs, elements of doubt have been creeping into this assumption. Based on DNA, the link between wolves and dogs seems to be ironclad, but DNA testing is also the subject of some controversy. In many cases, only a small percentage of the genome is actually tested, which can give a skewed result. All living creatures share over 90% of their DNA, regardless of species. The results can also be based on what the scientists in charge of the test want to discover. While it might be considered strange to suggest that animals other than wolves led to the development of Fluffy or Scout, this can possibly be the case. There are other wild animals that have as good a claim to dogs’ ancestry as wolves – and possibly even better. Whether or not wolves can actually be tamed is central to the question of whether they gave rise to modern dogs. One thing that separates domestic dogs and cats from wild animals is that even after attaining sexual maturity our companions remain tractable. Many wild animals are perfectly loving and engaging while still juveniles. People have made pets of raccoons, rabbits, and other wild animals only to receive an unpleasant surprise once the animal goes through puberty. An animal that was cuddling you yesterday can literally attack you remorselessly the following. This is not the animal’s fault; it is simply how their brains work. During the Middle Ages, numerous attempts were made to domesticate wolves; the superior strength and hardiness of the wolf was desired for a hunting companion. However, even wolf puppies raised by humans from an early age remain unpredictable, aggressive, and largely untrainable. Pariah dogs are often associated with India and the large numbers of Pariah dog packs are found there. Pariah dogs generally live on the fringes of human settlements and have interactions with people, varying from limited up to household pet. Pariah dogs are trainable, although like the wolf, the female goes into heat only once a year. These are medium sized dogs that can have a wide range of coat colors, but most have upright ears and curled tails. The pack hierarchy is not as strict as it is with wolves, and all female Pariah dogs are allowed to breed, unlike the situation in a wolf pack where only the alpha female is permitted to have pups. An interesting fact that points to Pariah dogs being the ancestors of at least some of today’s dogs is that when modern domestic dogs revert to a wild state, within a few generations there will be found a pack of Pariah dogs, not a pack of wolves. A Russian scientist, Dmitry Belyaev, conducted a decade’s long breeding experiment with silver foxes. Belyaev bred the foxes according to their level of tameness. Over succeeding generations, a population of ‘dogs’ evolved that had varied colored coats, floppy ears, and a preference for human company. The new dogs also shed their old reproductive habits, with the females coming into estrus several times a year without regard to the season. Another fascinating fact is that the level of corticosteroids in the fox’s blood dropped significantly as they became dogs. Corticosteroids are the hormones our bodies produce in times of stress – they are responsible for the fight or flight options all creatures face when presented with danger. The lowered levels of these hormones would mean that these domesticated foxes would not constantly be ‘on edge’. Perhaps it’s time to go beyond the ‘one origin of the dog theory’ and investigate whether the many breeds of dogs had a number of different sources. It is quite possible that domestic dogs arose from foxes, wolves, jackals, and now extinct canids over a wide geographical zone over a long period of time. Some of our companion’s ancestors may have tamed themselves simply by living near humans and benefitting from food scraps, while others may have been actively domesticated. Some level of selective breeding program would not have been beyond Neolithic or Mesolithic mankind."
12,Enrolling Your Puppy in an Obedience Class,pets," When a new puppy is brought into the home, there is generally a hope that this new family member will be an asset to the household, bringing joy and happiness. Unfortunately, many puppies never fulfill their potential as companions simply because they have not been properly trained. Dogs often end up in shelters or rescues because their behavior is out of line in some way, and often this unfortunate situation could have been prevented if the puppy had been enrolled in an obedience class, often called a puppy kindergarten class. All puppies have an overabundance of energy – this is normal and to a certain degree simply has to be endured with a good will until the pup grows out of this stage. However, by the time a puppy is 3 months old, it is probably ready for a puppy obedience class. Before enrolling your puppy, however, make sure that he or she has been vaccinated properly. Although any puppy can benefit from obedience classes, those belonging to a larger and more aggressive breeds should definitely be enrolled to help prevent problems when the dog is an adult and more difficult to manage. Classes usually run for about 2 months. Not all dogs enjoy the company of other dogs and dog to dog aggression can result in fights, injuries, and even death. Dogs like Pit Bulls and Tosas were actually developed to fight other dogs, and early socialization with other puppies can help make these pups good canine citizens. Even breeds that are generally unreliable around other dogs can become at least tolerant if socialized early in puppy obedience. In addition to socialization, puppy obedience classes emphasize the basic obedience commands such as sit, stay, come, and down. Learning these basic commands helps your pup learn how to control himself more effectively and gives him more confidence in varying situations. Puppy classes also provide tips on housebreaking, feeding, and other behavioral problems that may surface at this time. Enjoying a beginner obedience class with your puppy is also a way to develop a stronger bond between you. As these classes generally emphasize positive reinforcement, they will be enjoyable for both of you. A competent instructor will understand that a combination of rewards and praise is the best way to achieve lasting results. Obedience classes not only help your puppy to develop into a responsible dog, but they will also help to keep your puppy safer now and in the future. A puppy that can be stopped before wandering into the street by a spoken command, or will drop a potentially dangerous substance is more likely to be your companion for a much longer time than one who ignores commands. It’s not unusual for owners and dogs to continue with training after the puppy has graduated from kindergarten. The next step, for pups who are 5 or 6 months old will be a continuation of training in basic commands as well as learning some more advanced instructions. Young dogs, especially, will often require numerous repetitions before they understand what is wanted from them, and a structured obedience class is the perfect way for both pup and owner to become trained. Canine Good Citizen classes bestow a certificate on those dogs that successfully complete them. Many of these dogs are used as therapy dogs in nursing homes, hospitals, or hospices to provide affection. Both the mental and physical condition of the patients in these situations improves greatly when a dog is able to provide comfort."
13,History of Man’s Best Friend,pets," Regardless of how close you are to any other human, there will probably be no other being who will accept you unconditionally for what you are than your dog. All your dog cares about is being with you as much as possible. As long as you treat your dog with respect and love and spend time with him or her, you will have a best friend for as long as your dog lives. Anyone who has a dog knows exactly how thrilled the dog is when you arrive home. It actually doesn’t matter whether you have been gone for 10 minutes or 5 months, your dog will give you a hero’s welcome every time. And, as dog are pack animals and understand the importance of keeping all pack members safe, in most cases your dog will also defend you. It is still up in the air as to exactly when mankind and dogs first teamed up, but it was evidently over 10,000 years ago. From the beginning, the relationship has benefited both species. Regardless of where and when, dogs have used their ability to bond strongly with humans to our advantage. Some dogs are strictly one person dogs while others will bond with an entire family. The eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79 completely destroyed the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. It was in the ruins of Pompeii that the remains of a dog named Delta were discovered. Delta was positioned next to his young master, evidently still trying to protect him. Delta had saved the child’s life 3 times previously, as commemorated on his collar. The Battle of Agincourt occurred during the Hundred’s Year War between France and England, and one of the participants was a British knight named Sir Piers Leigh. During the fight, Sir Piers was wounded badly enough to be knocked to the ground. Rather than ending up as easy prey for the French, his female mastiff stood guard over him until he could be removed from safety. This mastiff subsequently returned to England to found a famous line of mastiffs. A dog doesn’t have to be big to be valiant, as was highlighted by the pug owned by William of Orange. Pompey had been sleeping in his master’s tent during a campaign in Spain. Pompey heard Spanish soldiers stealthily approaching the camp and awakened William by barking and licking his face. From that time on, William always kept Pompey in his bedchamber, and Pompey is featured alongside his master on William’s tomb. With the advent of the internet, it’s now easy to see all the dogs that have proven that they are not only their master’s, but also all of mankind’s best friend. From the elderly woman who fell one outside winter night and was kept alive by her dogs bringing her a quilt and lying next to her to keep her warm, to the 5 month old cocker spaniel puppy who brought help for her master trapped in an overturned vehicle, it seems that dogs will go out of their way to give us the help, love, and (often) guidance that we need. Just think of the thousands of therapy dogs who assist their owners every day to live more comfortable lives. It is more than likely that your particular best friend will not perform any really heroic acts for your benefit – few dogs will ever be faced with a marauding bear or a house fire. But it doesn’t matter; your dog is a hero as well as a best friend simply by being there for you every day, to see you through the bad times as well as enjoying the good. The only thing we humans can do in the face of such devotion is to be just as devoted to our dogs as they are to us."
14,Find the Best Heat Lamps,pets," Once you decide to get an Iguana pet, you have probably spent a lot of time surfing the internet for information on your exotic pet. If you have found good information on the care of Iguanas, you will know that this species needs a specific light and heat source in its terrarium. Why It Needs Heat Iguanas are cold blooded reptiles and their physiology needs a good external heat source since their bodies cannot stay at a constant temperature. All of their body functions depend on the environment that they are in and its current temperature. An Iguana's native environment is in warm tropical weather, so they need this type of environment to thrive. Although a permanent heat source may not be vital for their circulatory system, they depend on it for their digestive system. Iguanas without heat lamps can suffer from malnutrition because they cannot assimilate nutrients from their food. This can also cause health problems in the future. The Reasons Why Light is so Important In the Iguana's natural tropical habitat, they spend the majority of their daytime in the sunshine for two good reasons. One reason is because they need the heat as was discussed before. The other reason is that they need the light that comes from the sun. The UVB and UVA radiations can also be provided in an artificial environment too. These ultraviolet rays can help their bodies make vitamin D and properly process Calcium that they take in. Without this process, Iguanas would be calcium deficient. Eventually, they would receive bone injuries and catch diseases. We Can Provide Iguanas with the Necessary Light and Heat Here are some good ways that we can give our pet Iguanas the heat and light that they really need. Since not all pet owners live in a sunny environment year round, there can be many different choices. Direct sunlight is a great option if it is available. Sunlight that comes through glass or plastic is not effective because most of the ultraviolet rays will be filtered this way without reaching their destination. In a cold climate, owners can purchase UV lamps and heat lamps to give his or her pet the gift of warmth and light. This will allow the Iguanas to function at their best. A pet owner should always have a basking area for his or pet, and a shady area is important too. If the animal gets too hot, it should have a place to cool off. Since it is a cold blooded animal, it cannot cool itself off or raise its temperature either. An Iguana will alternate between sunbathing and retreating in the shadows to get cooled off. Pet owners will need a thermometer to keep track of its temperature to make sure that it does not go below 80 degrees Fahrenheit. This is the best way to keep your iguana happy and in good health. You want to try and keep your pet Iguana in a habitat that is as close as possible to its natural one."
15,Producing Aquarium Decorations From Rejected Objects,pets," Designing and putting together a theme for your aquarium can be quite a delightful project. Done properly, it will certainly create a piece of home decor for you to be satisfied with and one that you may get enjoyment from for a very long time. What's nicer after a tiring stressful day at your workplace than to loosen up in your living room and watch the fish swim serenely around replicas of castles and sunken boats. It beats the television by a mile. Nonetheless shopping for decoration for the aquarium could get costly, especially if you aspire to have real intricately crafted decorations. Should you be on a low budget, you will have to settle with the run of the mill items which you could possibly get in many other aquariums. You would still have furnishing, but the aquarium may not resemble the amazing, one of a kind theme that you hoped nobody else has. All is not lost. In case you still wish to have an aquarium layout that stands out apart from the rest, one that nobody you know could have, there are lots of goodies around your house that you are able to utilize. Certainly, it is easy to build a splendid theme primarily using mementos and baubles that you possess around your own home that you no longer want. Design Factors And Cautions The key to any good theme is functionality. The design which you assemble should not just be attractive but should also profit the fish. The number one profit that fish tank decorations can give to aquarium fish will be to supply them with a cave. Caves in a tank are any enclosed spot that enables the fish to go into as soon as they prefer to. Fish dwell in a stressful habitat, believe it or not. Out in the wild, they have ample space to swim around in but in an aquarium, their swim space is really constrained. Furthermore, they are plagued by human gaze almost all of the day. Once very troubled, fish get reduced resistance to diseases and will swiftly die. Caves enable the fish to escape every time they feel stressed which will help increase their lives. This is only one of the numerous profits that caves offer. The second concern is the element that the object is made of. You definitely want to stay away from metal. There should not be even the smallest chunk of it anywhere on or in the thing. If there is, remove it. Yet another material to refrain from is wood. I'm not talking about driftwood here, only accessories design for home decor created from wood. Many are not intended to be drenched in water for extensive periods and many of these are varnished or covered over with paint. Types Of Stuff That Create Cool Aquarium Decoration With a bit of innovation, anything around the home which you no longer like could be converted into a very interesting theme. Here are a few examples of things that you could try. Unwanted chinaware. That chipped cup or broken teapot still has its beautiful design work on it. Why not fixed them up inside your aquarium and place these to resemble a tea time scene. In case any of the porcelain are badly chipped, it will be best to bury the sharp area into the substrate so that it doesn't wound the fish. In addition if you happen to be putting in a sugar bowl, turn it on its side so that it works like a cave for the fish. With a little care, you may cut out a gap in the side of the teapot to make a cave to. Make sure you sand away the sharp edges. Abandoned playthings. Kids toys make very great aquarium ornaments. The toys created nowadays are extremely detailed, they out beat any home ornament you have got. Get hold of the types from the same cartoon show and place them to construct an aquarium layout based around that show. The kids will love them. Redundant patio decorations. Lawn and garden decor are produced to weather any situation and will last in the aquarium for quite a long time. If you do wish to use these, give them a fairly good rinse because they would have collect a lot of dirt and grime over time."
16,Dogs with Jobs - Bed Bug Detection Dogs,pets," There is a group of working dogs known as detection dogs, and there are many specific types of detection specialties.  With the frequency of travel within the United States and to foreign countries, there has been a noticeable increase in concerns over bed bugs.  Along with this problem came the need to find ways of detecting bed bugs without the harmful use of widespread pesticides.  Since detector dogs can pin-point scents it became increasingly popular to use dogs to detect not only live bed bugs but bed bugs in there developmental stages as well.  This way any treatment of the problem could be narrowed to the exact area needing treatment rather than the widespread potentially harmful fumigation and pesticide. There is no special breed for bed bug detection.  The best criteria is a happy dog who loves to work and hunt.  The training is extensive and today these dogs are certified and usually are in the range of 98 percent accurate.  Since their sniffing abilities are so keen, they can find hidden infestations and save time and money when it comes to treatment.  More and more extermination companies are using this reliable resource to rid their customer's problems. The training of these dogs usually involves hiding vials of bed bugs in various stages of development as well as their fecal matter, and having the dogs pick up the scents, alert their handlers and get rewarded.  This is similar to how other types of detection dogs are trained.  The dogs become very focused on ""the hunt"". There has been a growth of new business opportunities in this specialty industry and mostly in North America.  The need for this service ranges from residences to large hotels, and is serviced by private dog sniffing companies to partnering with extermination companies.  Either way the dog doesn't care about that - only about when the dog can get to work!"
17,The Truth About UV Animal Urine Detector Flashlights,pets," When trying to find a solution to find pet urine spots in your home, it can be overwhelming. There are A LOT of products and brands to select from. However, sadly not all are made equal. First of all there are the fluorescent tube lamps, which can provide results, however they usually require you to be so close to the stain in order to see it fluoresce that finding the stain is hard to begin with. Luckily the new breed of LED UV flashlights makes finding urine stains much easier with a more powerful and more concentrated beam of UV light. However, good LEDs are not cheap to produce especially at the lower wavelengths which are required to make the proteins in urine spots fluoresce efficiently. You will see that a lot of UV LED Flashlights being offered under the $20 price tag which are marketed as urine detectors, however on closer inspection you'll often discover that they do not discuss the UV wavelength (a value in nanometers or ""nm"") since it's at the wrong end of the spectrum closer to actual visible light (about 390-400nm). This wavelength range can make some spots fluoresce, however it's not proficient at it and often overwhelms the already limited stain fluorescence with bright purple visible light. Not useful at all when searching for urine spots around your house - so be sure to watch out for the true wavelength output. The manufacturers of these UV Flashlights sometimes make use of gimmicks such as a large amount of LEDS (in some cases as much as 51 LEDs!) as marketing techniques to make the flashlight sound powerful and as though it will output a really strong UV beam. Well, with that many LEDs shining away it will definitely be bright, however unfortunately this is not going to help if it is with the cheaper 390-400nm LEDs; the larger quantity simply compounds the difficulty these wavelength LEDs have in the first place because a larger quantity of visible light is output if more LEDs are added. So exactly what's the solution? Utilizing LEDs that output a lower UV wavelength of 365-370nm is the trick. The drawback here is they are FAR more costly to manufacturer and so you will be hard pushed to discover a good UV Flashlight containing these lower wavelength LEDs under $30 not to mention $20! There are professional level UV flashlights used in forensic science and various other professional areas, however these range in the $200+ price bracket - well above the budget plan for the average animal owner who just wants to find some animal spots in their house. The best way is to look for a solid UV flashlight with 365-370nm which contains the right amount of LEDs - just enough to do the job well yet not too many that the cost ends up being to expensive. UV flashlights such as this are bizarrely hard to find, and is why the ""PeeDar"" was made; to fill this gap with a trustworthy well considered solution which doesn't break the bank. A flashlight like this will have to be used in the dark - no lights on and after sundown, however it will work really effectively and will rescue you from wasting an awful lot of money and stress from either purchasing a super costly professional UV flashlight or from trying one cheap UV flashlight after another hoping to obtain decent results each time. We hope this post assists you on your journey to successfully finding and eliminating those pet urine spots in your home!"
18,Safety in Homes With Dogs and Children,pets," While it is true that most dogs are strongly attracted in a positive way to children, the truth is that a good relationship between kids and dogs is something that rarely comes about without some work. Most children who are bitten by dogs are bitten by the family pet, and while it might be easy to blame the pup, it is actually primarily the fault of the adults who have not provided the leadership and guidance that both dogs and children need. Small children, especially, have no concept that they might be abusing the dog when they pull on its ears or poke their finger into its eyes. Babies have a grasping instinct that could lead them to inadvertently pinch the dog. Some breeds, including breeds like French and English Bulldogs, and English Mastiffs will tolerate just about any punishment that comes their way from a child, but other breeds will not be so patient. The adults in the household should teach the children the proper way to behave with a dog, and even babies can be taught (through positive reinforcement) that they should not ever pull or pinch your pet. Any striking of the dog by a child is totally unacceptable, and this sort of behavior should never be tolerated. Small dogs are often looked upon as toys by children who are too young to really understand that the dog is a living being. Because of the possibility of harm being done to either, it is best not to leave a child under the age of 7 or 8 alone with a dog. Parents should never leave a baby or toddler alone with the dog, even for a few minutes. It is quite true that children need to learn the proper way to behave with dogs, but your pup must also learn that even the smallest baby is above them in ‘rank’. A dog that believes that it is superior to a human member of the home will simply be more likely to bite than one that views humans as superior. Use positive reinforcement as much as possible when accustoming your pet to its household status, but time out in a crate or correction with a sharp word may also be necessary. A pup that has received obedience training is much less likely to cause problems than one that has not. In order to prevent problems arising when a new baby is brought into the home, make the dog a part of the preparations. Dogs are just as likely to become jealous as an older child will be when a baby arrives if they are deprived of the attention they have previously been getting. After the baby is born, have the father bring home a blanket or article of clothing the baby has been wearing to let your pet become familiar with the baby’s scent. Let the dog be part of baby care by keeping it close while feeding, bathing, and changing the baby. And, once again, do not ever leave the baby alone with the dog. Children will often make a beeline to a dog when they see one outside. However, a strange dog is an unknown factor and kids should be taught never to approach a dog they do not know. They should always ask the owner’s permission to pet the dog. Teach children that a growl means ‘No’ in dog language and to back off if any dog growls at them. Likewise, if a dog rushes at them, they should never run – it will make them into prey. It’s best to stay where they are, lower their eyes, and slowly back away. Taking a bit of time and effort to train both dogs and children in a home can mean that there will be less likelihood of conflict between them."
19,Common Illnesses of Dogs,pets," When Pandora’s Box was opened, not only were a host of diseases released upon mankind, but also plenty of illnesses that would affect dogs. Most of these diseases are dog-specific, but several of them can pass over and be spread to their owners or other people. In many cases, vaccination will prevent these illnesses in the first place, preventing the need for often catastrophic veterinary bills and possible heartbreak. Distemper is probably the most common disease to afflict unvaccinated dogs. It is actually more likely to impact puppies, and getting your pup vaccinated early can help to prevent this disease. Distemper is spread by a virus, and includes some symptoms reminiscent of human influenza, such as respiratory distress and coughing. However, it also can cause seizures, diarrhea, and vomiting, and can result in the death of the dog. Rabies is probably the most serious illness your dog could ever acquire. Rabies is a virus and spreads from infected saliva from a bite, and it affects the nervous system and the brain. There is no treatment for rabies and it is fatal. Rabies can be spread to humans, but is entirely preventable with vaccination. Parvovirus is another highly contagious disease affecting the gastrointestinal system. It will include severe diarrhea and vomiting, and it can cause death. Puppies are much more likely to become ill with parvovirus than adult dogs. Unlike the above illnesses, leptospirosis is caused by a bacterium. The infective agent can be found in water such as rivers, lakes, and even puddles. This disease affects the kidneys and liver and spreads through contaminated urine. Humans can catch leptospirosis, so cleaning up after a sick pet should always be done wearing gloves. Kennel cough is another viral disease that causes coughing, vomiting, and a runny nose and eyes. While this disease generally goes away by itself, the owners can look forward to spending some sleepless nights tending to their sick dog. Coronavirus is another malady that is usually more serious in puppies and younger dogs, although dogs of any age could catch it. This disease causes diarrhea and vomiting, and can be serious enough to merit hospitalization. Lyme disease is a bacterial illness spread by ticks. This disease causes fever, vomiting, diarrhea, painful joints, and possible permanent damage to the heart if left untreated. All of the above diseases can be prevented by use of vaccines, and a consultation should be made with your veterinarian as to the correct vaccination schedule for your pet. It is best to allow your vet to vaccinate your pet in case your dog experiences a negative reaction to the shot. Allergic reactions are not uncommon with vaccinations, so ask your vet what you should be alert to in this respect. Rabies vaccine is always administered by a veterinarian, and make sure that your vet uses a better brand of vaccine that will be less likely to cause problems. All rabies vaccines are not the same, as we found out when one of our bulldogs had an anaphylactic allergic reaction to the shot and nearly died. Iris was in the hospital, in the equivalent of intensive care, for almost 5 days and needed continued care at home, including subcutaneous fluids and antibiotic shots. The veterinary bill was enormous. Because of the problems many dogs have experienced with rabies vaccine, some vets and dog owners suggest having a titer done on the dog to see if antibodies to rabies are still present. Keep in mind that the shot that a 300 pound Tibetan Mastiff receives is exactly the same dosage that your Toy Poodle will get. It is always best to talk to your veterinarian about your dog’s healthcare needs."
20,Hot Weather and Your Dog,pets," After a winter spent cooped up inside, it’s likely that both you and your dog will be anxious to get outside and enjoy the warmer weather. Although the temperatures in spring are generally fairly moderate, regions in the south can be hot even in April and May. As the years moves into summer, higher temperatures will prevail almost everywhere, meaning that you will have to make some effort to assure that your dog is negatively impacted by hot weather. Obviously, any breed of dog can be harmed by high temperatures, but there are some breeds of dog, called brachycephalic, that have heightened sensitivity to summer heat. Brachycephalic dogs have shortened faces and include breeds like English Bulldogs, French Bulldogs, Boxers, Pugs, Japanese Spaniels, French Mastiffs, Toy English Spaniel, Boston Terriers, and Bullmastiffs. These dogs with flatter faces are much more likely to be affected by high temperatures and care must be taken to prevent heat stroke or dehydration. You must restrict exercise to early morning or evening when the temperatures are cooler and suspend exercise completely during a heat wave. Make sure the dog always has fresh water available. No brachycephalic dog is an ‘outside’ dog, especially during the summer. When the temperatures soar, keep the dog in an air conditioned room or home. You must take your flat faced dog to the vet at the first signs of heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Although the terms ‘heat exhaustion’ and ‘heat stroke’ are used interchangeably, they are slightly different, with heat exhaustion being the milder form that could lead to heat stroke if untreated. Because of the inability of a dog to describe his or her symptoms, treat any heat related problem as heat stroke. There are signs that your dog may be suffering from heat stroke and these include thick saliva and bright red or even purple tongue and gums, rapid, excessive panting, wobbly gait, vomiting, and/or hot ears and nose. Because heat stroke includes dehydration, your dog will need to be treated at the vet’s office as soon as possible to prevent permanent organ damage, but you can help to treat heat stroke by bathing the dog in tepid water, giving your pup cool water (if your pup will drink Gatorade, give that), and getting him or her into the shade or an air conditioned space. Even if your pup seems to revive with your treatment, intravenous fluids will probably be needed to restore the body’s chemical balance. As much as you may enjoy riding with your dog, you may want to leave him at home once the temperature gets above 60 degrees F. We leave our French Bulldogs at home during the warmer months unless they have to visit the vet. We have found that even a short trip of 2 miles during the summer can begin to affect them. Older dogs will be much more likely to be harmed by high temperatures than younger ones. It is thought that hundreds of dogs die from being left in cars every year, and this is totally preventable. Cracking a window, even if the car is left in the shade on a hot day, will do nothing to prevent the heat in the car from rising above 120 degrees in less than half an hour. Air conditioning will be of little or no use since, even if you leave the car running, it will shut itself off in about 20 minutes, meaning that the dog will have no protection whatsoever against climbing temperatures. And, even if you think you will only be in the store or bank for a minute or two, these visits have a way of stretching out to a half hour or more. If you must take you dog with you when it’s hot, make sure you take along water. A cooler with ice and a wet towel is also a good idea. A breakdown could create an emergency situation for your dog, so always be prepared for the worst."

1,Parasites in Dogs,pets," Diseases such as distemper and parvovirus can have a serious impact on your dog’s health, but your dog can also be affected by external and internal parasites. Parasites are creatures that derive their living from feeding on the blood or tissues of a living host. These creatures, generally small in size, can weaken your dog’s system and make them much more likely to become ill, and can also cause a great deal of damage to the dog’s body themselves. A visual check for external parasites should be made daily, and periodic testing to make sure your dog is not supporting a multitude of freeloaders can keep your companion healthy. Few dogs go throughout life without experiencing some of these parasites, and the effect on the health of the dog can be slight or profound. Fleas are insects, and good indications that your dog has these small, but pestiferous insects will include frantic scratching, flea dirt (the bloody flea feces), and irritated patches of skin from severe infestations. Fleas will be happy to feed on you and your family, too. Large populations of fleas on dogs can actually cause anemia and, if eaten during grooming, fleas can give your dog tapeworms. Ticks are deeply-dyed villains that can carry dangerous illnesses such as Lyme disease, Ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, and Babesiosis. Dogs should be checked after being outside during tick season and the ticks removed as quickly as possible – the longer a tick is biting your dog, the greater the chances of infection. Mange mites can infest a dog’s ears or the coat in general. These mites can cause extreme irritation and inflammation if untreated. Ironically, most pooches carry some mange mites on them from birth, but the creatures will simply live quietly on them in their hair follicles. However, if the body’s balance is upset, the mites will gain the upper hand and cause discomfort and irritation. Body mites can cause large portion of the body to lose hair and ear mites can cause swelling and intense itching. Treatment is available for mites that can return your pup to normal. There are preventives such as flea collars and anti-tick treatments that can help to keep your dog at least relatively free of external parasites. Take your pet to the vet if he or she shows any signs of illness as a result of a tick bite – treatment is available. As serious as external parasites of dogs can be, those that dwell inside your dog are probably even worse. Internal parasites can literally suck the lifeblood out of your pooch, leaving it weakened and unable to fight off illness. The only good news about internal parasites is that there is treatment available that will kill them. Tapeworms are less likely to cause serious harm to your dog than other internal parasites. These segmented worms suck less blood out of the dog’s body, and are visible in the stool or on your pet’s bottom as resembling flattened grains of rice. Roundworms are very common in dogs, and puppies often contract them from their mothers while still in the uterus or while nursing. Dogs will sometimes vomit up roundworms, and they can also cause diarrhea. Puppies are most at risk from roundworms and a bad infestation can actually be fatal. Roundworms can be spread to humans, especially children. Whipworms can seriously impact your dog’s health as these worms embed themselves in your dog’s colon. Bloody diarrhea is a good sign that your dog may have these worms, and dehydration can occur. Hookworms are among the most serious internal parasite that can infect your dog. These worms live in the small intestine and not only suck large amounts of blood, but also leave wounds that continue to bleed because of the anticoagulant in the worm’s saliva. Hookworms can cause not only bloody or tarry stools, but also anemia, and can kill the dog, especially younger ones. Humans can, in rare cases, pick up hookworms from infected dogs. As it is impossible to absolutely prevent infestation of internal parasites, it’s a good idea to have your vet check out a stool sample twice a year, even if your dog is showing no symptoms. Any dog showing signs of internal parasites should be seen by the vet immediately."
2,Caring for Your Dog During a Disaster,pets," Natural and manmade disasters or emergencies can happen anywhere, and often with little or no warning. Whether you are dealing with the aftermath of a tornado, coping with a hurricane, or recovering from an earthquake, your dog will be impacted as much as the members of the human pack. In fact, dealing with a disaster is probably more difficult for dogs because they have no way to understand what is actually happening. However, a bit of preparation and planning on your part can help your dog to survive even the most difficult situations with as little trouble as possible. Anyone who has seen coverage of the aftermath of disasters like the 2011 Japan tsunami, Hurricane Sandy, or tornadoes knows how confused and disrupted life has become. Both people and animals are dazed, and many are injured. In these circumstances, dogs can easily become separated from their owners, and if there is no way to identify the dog, reunion will be unlikely. Most dogs wear collars or harnesses, and making sure that your dog’s license, at the very least, is attached to the collar can help to return a lost pet. Tags are also available that will give detailed contact information, including the owner’s address and phone number. Microchipping is an excellent way to help track down a missing dog. A tiny microchip is injected into the skin on the dog’s shoulders that contains information on tracking the dog. This is a painless procedure that is low in cost. Universal microchips are now used that will identify a lost dog at any shelter, and nearly every veterinary office in the country. It is recommended that every household have a 3 days’ supply of food and water on hand, and this should include the needs of your dog, as well. As far as water is concerned, this translates into 1 gallon per person per day. This is also a sensible guideline that should also be followed for your dog. While a small dog will not use nearly that much water, the extra can always come in handy for other purposes. Among the family’s emergency supplies should also be food for the dog. Disaster supplies for dogs are available, but your pet’s ordinary food can also be put aside, although this will not have as long a shelf life as food designed specifically for emergency purposes. Rotate food when the expiration date approaches, and keep bags sealed until they will be used. Keeping warm is another consideration when your dog is involved in a disaster. Although certain breeds of dog are very cold tolerant, many are not, and suitable dog clothing and extra blankets for your pooch should be a part of the household emergency supplies. Towels to dry off a wet dog can help to keep it from developing hypothermia. If your dog is taking medication on a regular basis, you should have a supply that will see it through 2 weeks if necessary. Make sure you have the name and phone number of your veterinarian and a copy of the prescription. A dog first aid kit can help you to treat any minor injuries that may occur during the crisis. Dogs can easily become confused and disoriented during an emergency – even in their own yards. Because panic might cause the dog to run off, he or she should be kept on a leash at all times when going outside the house. Standing water can conceal a number of dangers for your dog, such as broken glass and other sharp objects, downed electrical lines, and bacteria and viruses. Do not allow your dog to either walk through flood waters or drink from them. No one can do much to prevent a disaster or emergency from happening, but understanding the needs of your dog under these circumstances will increase the chance that he or she will come through it unscathed."
3,Dogs with Jobs - The Truffle Sniffing Dog,pets," I have a great interest in well trained dogs, especially those trained for specific tasks.  Dogs with jobs are fascinating to me.  I want to know if the job skill has to do with the breed or if there is any trait that can be trained up for a job.  My first job curiosity is the truffle sniffing dog.  Can any dog become a truffle sniffing dog or can only certain breeds be used? There is a great demand for truffles, mostly because they are rare, hard to find, and thus very expensive.  Pigs are instinctively drawn to truffles and love to eat them.  The hunter has to be very quick to rescue a truffle from a 300 pound pig.  The risks are pretty great!  Apparently one can lose a finger or two in the process.  So other means of truffle hunting evolved - that of the truffle sniffing dog who does not have the innate instincts to eat truffles. The best dogs for truffle sniffing are dogs with a keen sense of smell, dogs who are calm, obedient, and are not easily distracted, and dogs who are sociable and have great endurance. Some of the breeds successfully trained for this job include the Italian Lagotto Romanolo, Belgian Malinois, Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, German Shepherd, Dutch Retriever, Springer Spaniel, Poodle, Fox Terrier, and Dachshund.  But this job is not limited to those breeds as long as the necessary traits are there. Dogs can be trained as young as a few months, but young dogs around 8-9 months are desirable.  These dogs are trained with a variety of methods, but training for the scent of a truffle is foremost.  Some trainers use truffle oil to develop the scent.  Others may use gorgonzola cheese and move to the truffle in a gradual process.  Apparently gorgonzola cheese has a similar scent to a dog as the truffle.  The truffle scented item is buried and the dog is trained to smell until it is located, then scratch the area until the handler can come and dig up the truffle. Each time the dog successfully finds the buried treasure the dog is rewarded with a food treat or something else the dog loves like a game of ball toss. Dogs who are successfully trained for this job are in great demand."
4,DIY Chicken Coop,pets," Inside Summer, we have ten Aficionado Orpingtons (of course, ten-- I've six youngsters that insist upon consuming 3 x per day, additionally goodies, so we go through ova at an mind boggling charge). To start with, I believed we would construct our very own hen house.Then while I realized your pure craziness of what I had prepared, My spouse and I texted my husband Doug as well as informed him I had been a wild lady so we should completely promote your flock. He texted rear that they recognized I really could undertake it, and it will be historical past.Like We explained, we've 6 youngsters, and that i work from home. So purchasing the $1000+ custom houses together with stylish colours and Ikea-like construction recommendations ended up being an alternative far beyond the signifies.Luckily, a friend was in process of entirely redoing his or her swimming pool deck. He let's pick by way of his or her employed cast-offs. That along with a Facebook or myspace shout-out regarding plyboard gave everyone the actual wood we have now utilised. And so the undertaking in the blueprint-less hen house began. Sort & nails Punch with regard to setting up handles & fixing the house ramp I got paperwork via various pens I discovered on the internet, as well as received out and about most likely 15 distinct possible ideas which i loved. Path with the sun-- the vast majority of essential here in Texas, however i think it might be one factor anyplace. I wished the actual hen chickens to possess a lot of shade during the day. I additionally take their a single full-length screen window around the Northern aspect so they might have plenty of lighting, nevertheless then it could be roundabout lighting.Security-- Naturally I want your hen chickens being well-protected. Easy design/building-- In addition to painting stretcher-bars attending school, Doug & I had in no way built anything before. Actually, nothing at all. So keeping things fairly easy, construction-wise was obviously a priority.Great ventilation-- my own prepare provided two windows + venting eaves A location for you to roost, a location to get ovum, an area in order to eat-- conference basic wants with the chickens. After many of us position the framing on the floor, My spouse and i cut particle board to fit every single wall, leaving behind your windows and doors wide open, in order that hens would not roost throughout (along with feces within) your framing/walls. Pertaining to unconventional Do it yourself features such as the egg package along with hen house bring, We investigated ahead of building. I checked out a lot of images of other's coops, required notes of the We appreciated, common sizes (our egg cell packing containers tend to be something such as 11x11 or perhaps 12x12-- just large enough to get throughout, nevertheless sufficiently small enough to be able to experience comfortable), and so on., then viewed your wooden we'd offered, along with built this along with those actions at heart. As an alternative to chicken line, all of us utilised 1/2 "" computer hardware fabric. It is more expensive, but with hawks and also raccoons as well as bobcats having ripped off friends' flock within a number of kilometers people, all of us determined in which for house along with adjoining hen run, we might commit any additional money to safeguard all of them. Regarding rain to remain off of each of our flock, I created a straightforward slanted roof structure. To result in the riser from your higher facet (48 inches wide) to the reduce part (36 inches) of the hen house, I used a 2x4 to compliment any coop-length 2x4 about each of the 2 (right now angled) walls that would support the roof structure. Because I'd personally discover the method that ammonia can easily assemble inside a house and how essential it can be to own good venting, I opted to go away the particular eaves open, as opposed to home siding these people, along with staple-gunned computer hardware towel regarding this. (We determine, since period moves on your own, if I realize that as a result for any wet/snowy indoor using months, I'm able to only use plastic-type material tarping to pay for one sides, but it will be considerably more tough to retro-install sufficient air-flow.) Once you have your our bones in place, I started employing gotten back 1x4 parts to create house siding for our hen house. I thought we would make use of the slimmer 1x4 parts in order that the outdoor can be standard and much less hefty. We in addition got 2x4 and 2x6 items in our timber stack, nevertheless the 1x4s (as well as periodic 1x2) ended up being perfectly for exterior siding. I furthermore utilized 1x4s to the roof structure foundation, since I'd personally uses up plyboard. The actual mitre noticed ended up being priceless at this point, so I could make confident the edges lined up nicely:Some tips about what the inside of the actual hen house seems like, through the upper door beginning:You can see that there exists a 2' by 4' screen that makes up almost half of the northern wall membrane. I elected to do this pertaining to air flow therefore that they can would likely find plenty of mild within the house, without them actually staying immediate lighting. Additionally obvious from the previously mentioned picture include the roosts (you will find there's total of 10+ feet involving roost place readily available for the girls), eggbox, and the 1' a 1' entrance which will result in the house bring in to the poultry be used up the particular western world. You may also rarely observe (nonetheless it could possibly be a lot more obvious in the greater photo should you draw up) your rebar (in ceiling stage) I am going to employ to hang our sprinkling buckets through. We decided to generate our personal providing water coin slots with poultry erect nipples so that the ladies can not spice up turf, nourish, and poultry poo into their h2o. This is the particular nearly-finished sort of our blueprint-less chicken coop. You may also see the 1x1 screen My partner and i put across the fowl roosts to get ventilation closer to the actual birds without indeed being around all of them (they are doing nicely along with air-flow although not sea breezes). We all installed doorways this kind of the other day, however don't possess images of the. We merely lower plywood for the suitable dimensions, utilized 1x1s some thing because front door puts a stop to (therefore the entrance doors can open to the outside however, not be capable of be pushed into the house) and installed all of them with simple T-hinges we all available at Lowe's. Within this, I suppose it's a given, however i let logic along with the materials we had on hand guide my own strategies. I did determine even as gone together, but only for the chicken coop join along with alone, never to meet virtually any particular plan. It helps it be better necessary to perform mathematics as well as reduce wooden for that space, as an alternative to in accordance with a good & nice system, just about all enables you to burn up what you have got instead of obtain costly solid wood. This particular got so that we will use the components there were, and also fulfill the ambitions we'd, as cheap as feasible. When we all looked over what we would have invested just upon components, experienced all of us not necessarily employed them gotten back from my good friend, we'd have effortlessly spent $800 or higher only for wood & plyboard. In total, we all put in $20 upon solid wood (a single friend experienced extra-good particle board & Two by fours available which they might obtained to construct a bunkbed yet in no way received about to be able to creating; all the other characters of our solid wood has been free), utilized partially-rusty-but-straight toenails all of us salvaged from my working area resulting in $50 about knobs and so forth , then we now have spent about $100 in enough components fabric to complete not merely the thing that was pictured over but additionally to accomplish an attached 15' by 8' times 3' tall hen operate so that they will always have one safe, closed area for you to go, in addition to infrequent no cost which range by way of each of our fenced backyard. By getting back wooden through close friends and ultizing might know about acquired on hand, the complete DIY house for 15 chickens (as well as fastened work) will certainly, ultimately, cost less than $200, on the other hand believe that it is similar wide and quality for you to pens I've come across marketing regarding any where from $1500+. We such as the reclaimed, elderly look from it, as though it has been close to for years, and i believe the actual hen chickens will enjoy the safety, effortless residing, and also ventilation of it. The particular blueprint-less chicken coop suits each of our wants along with the spending budget, which has been the original objective."
5,Why Do Dogs Howl?,pets," I have 3 dogs, all of different breeds.  Each of them is unique in their own way, endearing and peculiar at the same time.  One of the unexplainable behaviors they have all developed is the howling at sirens or noises they hear which we as humans may not.  I know that howling at the moon or at sirens is something many dogs do, but not all dogs have this behavior.  Howling has been researched and some believe it is an ancestral behavior - likely from wolves.  But one has to wonder why in this day and age that which drove wolves to howl is no longer necessary in the domesticated house dog.  So one would wonder if the noises the dog hears hurts the ears and howling is a reaction to pain.  But this theory is not supported by veterinarians who believe that sirens and piercing noises do not hurt a dogs ears. The mystery in my household occurs daily in the wee hours of the morning in the bedroom when one of my dogs raises his head with nose pointing to the sky and begins the howl.  I call him the tenor of the group.  Like a chorus the second dog will join in, this one more like the alto of the group.  Then, finally the third one joins in.  He really sounds like the soprano of the chorus.  It would be amusing but in the wee hours of the morning.  I listen for a siren, and it is not obvious to me.  So was it once a siren and now it is a habit?  This musical chorus lasts for a few minutes, then the dogs go back to sleep.  It takes a bit longer for me to get back to sleep. Occasionally during the day I will hear a siren, but no howling.  And occasionally I will hear a siren and the howling begins.  Why?  And if I start to sing in a high pitched voice I may be joined by my animal chorus - joining in the same order - the tenor, alto and soprano! So do my dogs think they are communicating with the lost sound of the distant siren which to them may sound like another dog howling?  It is a thought.  And when they ""sing"" with me are they positively rewarding me?  I do think I won't be able to break them of the habit of wee hour morning howling, so I just need to accept it."
6,The Risk Of Neglecting Your Pets Oral Care!,pets," Whilst most pet owners are concerned about the oral hygiene of their pet,  many others should understand that this is a matter that could possibly carry severe repercussions if left unattended. The problem does not end with just the mouth. It goes on to unleash various other medical complications that may in some cases, prove to be fatal. Pet owners at times may notice their cat has a bad smell. They may ignore it. However, the bad smell coming from the pet’s mouth may be a sign of oral disease. The fact is that a cat’s oral hygiene is essential for maintaining the overall health of the pet. Poor oral hygiene does not only cause tooth decay or gum disease. Apart from aggravating these conditions, poor oral hygiene goes on to cause serious health issues such as heart, kidney and lung diseases. A cat's teeth are most vulnerable to plaque build-up. The plaque could go on to cause separation of the gums from the teeth. This would in return cause the formation of packets of bacteria which result in infections. The problem does not end here as it goes on to afflict the internal organs of the body. Failure of internal organs such heart and kidneys could possibly result in death. These are the reasons why any pet dental problem needs to be avoided. The best way to do so is by introducing hygiene practices early. Though it is difficult to train a cat to accept routine brushing, it becomes easier once you start doing it regularly. There are some brushing techniques that need to be learnt. Another important aspect of preventing a pet dental problem is inspecting the cat teeth for any signs of oral diseases. In particular, the presence of inflamed gums or cysts under the tongue needs to be checked. Regular checkups and follow-up appointments are a good way to prevent the pet dental problem. Cat teeth unlike humans do not suffer from tooth enamel decay. Generally it is an infection or inflammation or receding of gums that afflicts them. This is exactly what causes discomfort and drooling in the pets. Dental disease as pointed out earlier, can cause heart and kidney diseases in older cats. This is because of the bacteria that live in the infected tissue that could go on to enter the blood stream and hence affect the internal organs. Hence, as it can be seen, cat teeth are vulnerable to tartar and plaque. These can give rise to a host of other medical problems such as gum disease, tooth decay and infections. The next possible cause is the failure of internal organs such as the heart and kidneys because the bacterium that has accumulated in the gums finds a way to enter the blood stream and lodge itself in the internal organs. This calls for the need to attend to the cat teeth to avoid any oral health problems. This needs to be addressed occasionally so that an overall good oral hygiene can be maintained. This is because cat teeth require special care."
7,Preparing For Your New Puppy,pets," Regardless of whether you’re an adult or a child, there is nothing more exciting than bringing a new puppy into the home. However, successfully introducing a new puppy depends upon a good deal of thought and preparation, and there are a number of things that should be kept in mind when getting ready for this new family member. Is the puppy’s breed suitable for the situation (a mastiff in an efficiency apartment is probably not the best choice)? Are there children or other pets in the household? Do you understand any potential health problems associated with the breed? In addition to the above, people sometimes forget that each puppy is an individual living creature with its own personality and needs. Getting a puppy, in most cases, means that you are going to provide a lifelong commitment to this animal, and no one should take this responsibility lightly. Regardless of the breed of dog you have decided upon, all puppies will need equipment and supplies to keep them healthy and comfortable. Having everything needed on hand when you carry your puppy into the home will help make the period of adjustment smoother and easier on everyone. Most breeders will give you a small supply of the food that the puppy has been eating. You will probably want to choose your own brand or one that your veterinarian suggests. Get the best quality you can afford – the puppy will not need to eat enormous quantities just to get adequate nutrition, and higher quality foods also contain more meat protein. Meat should be the first item on the ingredient list. Food and water dishes are a necessity and probably the best type to use are stainless steel – they are easy to keep clean and the puppy won’t be able to chew them up. Clean water should be available at all times. Puppies are extremely active and playful, and your puppy will also be shedding its baby teeth. Have plenty of safe toys on hand and be prepared to spend time playing with your puppy, this will help with the bonding process. Avoid rawhide as it can cause gastrointestinal problems if pieces are chewed off and swallowed. You should never leave toys with the puppy when it is unattended. A first aid kit for dogs is another item you might want to have ready. Being able to treat relatively minor injuries at home can save a trip to the vet. Although most people usually use a collar and leash with their puppy, a harness may be a better choice as it keeps pressure off the neck. Be prepared for some possible dramatic activity when you first put the harness or collar on the pup. Our Frenchies threw themselves onto the ground and writhed around as if in agony the first time we put their harnesses on. We paid no attention and they just got up and forgot they were even wearing them. Hopefully, you don’t subscribe to the old idea of putting a new puppy into a box with a towel, clock, and hot water bottle. If you have decided to get a puppy, it is going to be a member of your family and should be treated as such. Your puppy should sleep in your bedroom. You can let the pup right into bed with you, or you can put the pup’s bed on the floor next to your bed. The puppy has, up to this time, been sleeping with its mother and siblings, and isolating it in a cardboard box is cruel. If you want to keep the pup in a crate at night, at least place the crate next to the bed so you can reassure the pup during the night. There will be times when even the best puppy will portray frustrating and destructive behavior. It is completely inappropriate to yell at or strike the puppy.  At this early stage in the puppy’s life it is easy to use positive reinforcement, combined with ignoring bad behavior, to help the pup develop into a good companion. Obedience training is a good idea, especially with larger breeds, and can help your puppy become confident and calm."
8,How Ticks Can Impact Your Dog’s Health,pets," There is basically no region of the country that can be considered free of tick borne diseases. These diseases can have a serious impact on your dog’s life, and being aware that they exist can help you detect symptoms early and get treatment when it will be most effective. Ticks are active during the entire year in winter-free regions and will appear in colder areas as soon as the ground thaws. Never assume it’s too early or too cold to find ticks on your dog.  Our Pip even got one from somewhere when there was 2 feet of snow on the ground. Check your dog over after every outing, even if it’s only been to the backyard. Catching ticks before they attach to the pet is much easier than prying them off later. Most people probably think that ticks are insects, but they are actually a member of the spider family. An adult tick has 8 lets, just like a spider, and feeds on the blood of living animals. However, while spiders will form egg cases for reproduction, the female tick itself sometimes forms the egg case – in some tick species, the eggs mature inside the swollen body of the female, which eventually bursts to release hundreds of tick nymphs, while other species simply lay the eggs on the ground. These tiny ticks have only 6 legs and generally feed on smaller animals like mice and shrews until they mature. Ticks feed by inserting their mouthparts into the flesh of their host and drawing blood out. An anticoagulant is used to keep the food supply flowing, and the bite itself causes extreme irritation including itching and oozing of clear liquid. Removing ticks from your dog safely is important because they can either leave mouthparts in the skin or regurgitate into victim, opening the possibility of more infective agents entering the dog’s body. Use fine tweezers or a special tick removing tool to grab the tick as closely to the skin as possible, and use a slow, but steady motion to draw the tick out. From personal experience, I have found that swollen female ticks will inevitably leave their mouthparts in the skin regardless of how careful I have been, raising the chance of infection. The types of ticks most dogs and people encounter are the dog or wood tick and the deer tick. There are actually about 90 species of ticks found in the United States, although some have a very limited geographic range. Tick borne diseases can cause serious illness in dogs, as we found out with our French Bulldogs several years ago. The first to become ill, Iris, was taken to the vet the first day her symptoms of limping and lethargy appeared. A blood test revealed that she had both Lyme disease and Ehrlichiosis. Although she was on the appropriate antibiotic, she lost the use of all 4 legs in 3 days, and was unable to even drink on her own; we had to use a syringe. She ate nothing for over a week until the medicine finally kicked in. She was literally reduced to a loose bag of bones. Primmy and Pip also became ill, but not to as great an extent, and all the dogs recovered after a month of antibiotic treatment. Ehrlichiosis is also called tracker dog disease and is a legacy of the Vietnam War. Returning dogs used by the military were infected with Ehrlichiosis, and it causes symptoms such as joint pain, high fever, lethargy, vomiting, and diarrhea. Unless treated, long term damage can occur to the heart and joints. Lyme disease causes many of the same symptoms as Ehrlichiosis, and the antibiotic used to treat it, doxycycline, is also the same. Rocky Mountain spotted fever is even more serious a disease than the above two, and can be fatal if untreated. Symptoms, again are similar to tracker dog disease and Lyme, but can include skin lesions and cough. Heart attacks can also occur. In addition to doxycycline, tetracycline can also be used to treat it. Anaplasmosis is yet another serious tick borne disease and this time the infective agents target either the white blood cells or the platelets. This disease causes muscular pain, fever, general malaise, coughing, and diarrhea. Doxycycline is the medicine of choice to cure the dog. Babesiosis is caused by a tiny parasite, and this one attacks the red blood cells. Anemia is one obvious result as well as red urine, lethargy, fever, and weakness. Unfortunately, treatment for this disease is more complicated than for the others, and often involves a combination of drug therapies combined with blood transfusions in extreme cases. There are a number of products on the market that are applied to the dog’s back that will either kill ticks on contact or hopefully before they are able to infect the dog. Flea and tick collars also offer protection. Carefully checking your dog after he or she has been outside is also a good way to prevent these diseases. Ticks often wander around for quite a while before settling in for a meal, and disease transmission depends on how long the tick has been attached – it usually takes about 72 hours before enough pathogens enter the system to do harm. You should check with your vet with any concerns or questions regarding tick borne illnesses in your pet."
9,Does Your Dog Need To Bark All The Time?,pets," Barking is natural for your dog; he or she uses it to communicate and under ideal circumstances, barking is used as a warning or to signal fear. However, all too often barking slides from being a normal means of communication to being a nuisance. Dogs never seem to become hoarse from barking, and dedicated barkers can keep up the opera for hours at a time. Not only can barking become annoying to you, it can be even more obnoxious to your neighbors. In order to stop your dog’s excessive barking, it’s important to find out the reason for the behavior. Although a woof or two to let you know that a stranger is approaching the house is fine, a barking session that continues without respite is certainly not called for. Dogs who bark like this will also generally start in as soon as they hear any odd noise or catch a glimpse of something moving outside. Some dogs bark just to keep themselves amused. Like people, dogs can become bored, and this is probably especially true with dogs that belong in the working breeds. These dogs have been used over the centuries in various occupations, and if simply left to sit with nothing to do, they will bark to pass the time. Dogs that have been left out on a chain are particularly prone to do this. Sometimes our dogs love us so much that they simply cannot bear to have us away from them.  They will bark when we go out, evidently hoping that the barking will cause the owner to return. This is called separation anxiety. Dogs with separation anxiety will often be destructive in the house as well, tearing up furniture and eliminating on the floor, bed, or sofa. One of the most common mistakes owners make when attempting to curb excessive barking is to pay attention to it. This doesn’t mean that you praise the dog or give it a treat when it barks, but even yelling at the dog is providing attention – like children, dogs will take negative attention if nothing else is available. One way to deal with a problem barker is to deny the attention that they crave when barking. However, staying quiet and unresponsive while the bark session is going on is not enough; you have to pay positive attention to the dog when the barking stops. Spending more time playing with your dog or otherwise providing affection can help to curb barking. The best time to address barking problems is when the puppy first comes into your home. Young puppies will often bark out of excitement, but once again, paying attention to them when they do not bark is a good way to short circuit future barking problems. Obedience training for dogs of any age is another way to either control or prevent barking issues. A dog that undergoes obedience training not only learns a certain set of commands, but also comes to understand his place in the home ‘pecking order’. This is not a bad thing as wild dogs of all kinds have an established social order that helps maintain the security and order of the pack. Learning what is considered appropriate behavior will keep the house and neighborhood much more peaceful. While obedience training is most effective when started early, adult dogs also respond well to this training, especially when it heavily emphasizes positive reinforcement. There has been a good deal of controversy over the use of bark collars on dogs, and there are arguments for both sides. Some dogs respond very quickly to even a vibration on the throat, but anyone who uses these collars should realize that some dogs will be able to block out the ‘stimulation’ and will continue barking. Injury can be done to the dog if the collar is used too long, especially if there are no results. It is possible to train a problem barker to stop serenading, but in all cases, it will take time, patience, and understanding. Always remember that your dog doesn’t realize that it is being a pest, and finding out what is causing the behavior is the first step to stopping it."
10,Curbing Dog Aggression,pets," Uncontrolled aggressive behavior is one of the major reasons why dogs are either given to animal shelters or put down. All dogs, and all living creatures, have the capacity to act aggressively because it is a survival technique. However, when the dog acts aggressively towards other pets or humans, the behavior must be corrected as quickly as possible. In addition to the possibility of injury to the other party, serious legal ramifications can arise. Although any dog can growl and bite inappropriately, certain breeds are much more prone to this kind of behavior than others. The size of the dog is also a factor in this and an attack by a Chihuahua will be considerably less serious than an attack by a German Shepherd or Rottweiler. However, any dog that behaves aggressively should first be seen by a veterinarian to make sure that a physical condition, such as infection, cancer, or a thyroid problem, isn’t at the root of the behavior. One of the biggest causes of dog aggression is fear. The dog in question is acting aggressively precisely because it thinks it will be attacked, and evidently adheres to the old adage, ""The best defense is a good offense"". If you have gotten a puppy and would like to prevent future inappropriate aggression, the puppy should be socialized at an early age. Because of dog diseases, wait until the shots have all been taken care of and then take your puppy with you to introduce it to different situations. Dogs that become used to being around other dogs and people at an early age will be much less likely to react aggressively in later years. However, even adult dogs can be trained to overcome aggression by careful training and socialization. Unless you will be able to sequester your aggressive dog away from people and other animals for its entire lifespan, the dog should be trained to overcome its aggressive tendencies. The safety of others will always be the first consideration, so make sure that the dog is on a leash and is wearing a muzzle during training. An aggressive dog can be socialized to feel comfortable and calm in the presence of others. It will take time and patience, but even violently aggressive dogs can be turned into good canine citizens in most cases. In order to do this, you need to enroll the dog in an obedience class and make sure the person conducting the class understands your dog’s aggression problem. Learning to obey basic commands is a good way to bring the dog under control in other situations. Take the dog to an area where it will be exposed to people and dogs and keep it to the side. When a dog or person comes near and the dog begins to lunge or to growl or bark, give a sharp tug at the least to redirect its attention. In addition to the corrective action, you will need to reward the dog when it behaves correctly. Have a supply of small treats on hand and be lavish with pets and verbal praise as well when the dog remains calm. People who love their dogs tend to make excuses for the dog’s bad behavior. However, there is no excuse for a dog biting another dog or a person unless the owner is under attack.  This sort of behavior can have very serious consequences for both the dog and the owner. In extreme cases, when someone has actually been killed by an aggressive dog, the owner has served jail time. The owner can also be sued for bites and the offending dog can be ordered to be put to sleep. It is critically important to get your dog’s aggression problem under control. If your dog is acting aggressively towards others, start seeking a solution immediately before the problem gets totally out of hand. You and your dog will both be much happier."
11,Choosing a Dog That Fits Your Lifestyle,pets," Other than serious behavioral problems, such as aggression, the reason most dogs wind up in shelters is because their owners find out that they have just chosen the wrong dog for the way they live. Dogs have evolved with humans over the course of thousands, maybe tens of thousands of years, and as they shared our homes and lives, they have been bred to fill specific roles. Besides the innate personality of the breed, there is also the dog’s adult size to take into consideration. That fluffy little St. Bernard puppy that fits so well on your lap now could grow into a 200 pound giant in over a year. If your house or apartment is simply not big enough, at some point your dog is going to outgrow its living space. Regardless of the breed, all dogs require some exercise during the day. While some breeds can have their exercise requirements met with indoor play or a short walk, other breeds will need to run every day to satisfy their energy demands. Another thing to consider is the grooming needs of the dog; some dogs have a carefree coat that requires no maintenance to keep it looking good, while others (especially those with long hair) will need intensive grooming to keep the coat free from tangles, debris, and external parasites. If you are unfamiliar with dog breeds in general, and are considering adding a puppy or dog to your life, do some research not only into the different breeds. You also need to determine why you want a dog, and how much time you will have to spend with the dog. Always keep in mind that nearly all dog breeds will want to interact with their humans – dogs have emotional needs, too. If you are looking for a lapdog or companion, choosing a smaller breed is often a good idea, but make sure you understand the different energy level of different breeds. Jack Russell terriers and Westies are small dogs, but they require enormous amounts of exercise, otherwise they can develop personality problems. Breeds such as French bulldogs, English bulldogs, Chihuahuas, Japanese Chins, and Papillons are all excellent choices as well, although all of these dogs will need a lot of attention from their owners. Hunting dogs combine great personality with the high energy needed for hunting. Those who enjoy taking to the field and woods during hunting season will want to focus on such dogs as Labrador or Golden retrievers or one of the spaniels, such as English or Cocker Spaniels. A laid back hunting dog that works well even in an apartment is the Clumber Spaniel. Vizslas and pointer breeds also are a good choice for hunters. Remember that these breeds will still need plenty of exercise outside of hunting season so be sure to take them for walks or runs daily. Many people are worried about home security and will use a dog to guard the home. In one respect, nearly every dog breed is a guard dog, but some breeds are more protective than others. When you looking for a guard dog, you should look for a breed that will be easy to train, passive with the family, and have a defensive rather than an aggressive nature. Dogs like English Mastiffs, Bullmastiffs, and Schnauzers are good with members of the family, but do not possess the hair-trigger attacking instincts of dogs like Dobermans, Pit Bulls, and German Shepherds. Flock guardian dogs are often important to those who live in rural areas and keep livestock. These dogs tend to be more aloof with people than other breeds and tend to concentrate their attention, and affection, on the sheep or cattle they guard. These dogs can be difficult to train as they have been bred to think independently and are best employed in more isolated situations where they will not have to interact with people. Being a responsible dog owner isn’t restricted to how your dog gets along with other people and animals, it also means that you have chosen a dog that you will be able to take care of properly and that will be able to live out its life with you in comfort and dignity."
12,Asian Concept Aquarium Decor,pets," Aquarium ornaments are the tendency to look stiff and lifeless. If you examine the various types of aquarium accessories sole, they usually depict sunken ship, old establishments or dead pirates. However if you would go for an aquarium theme this is more natural and refreshing, then the Asian Theme is the right choice for you. What makes the Asian Aquarium Design suitable is that a good number of the aquarium decorations from this style is based on sights from nature or a day in the life of an Asian villager. Miniature panorama are depicted perfectly among rocks that seem just like hills and mountains with tiny shrubs dotting the panorama. The Asian Terrain Fish Tank Decoration The Asian fish decor depicting natural scenery is quite soothing to look at. With this kind of fish tank decor, rocks with holes and crevasses depict rolling mountains with caves. You can get these kind of rocks in numerous sizes, fitting any type of sized aquarium. The best of these are those that also have fake plants in them, appearing like tiny trees. These provide an incredibly authentic appearance to the decorations, just as if you are looking at a mountain in the distance in Asia. There are also some, particularly from the bigger ornaments which may have little shrines on them, with small minute stairways leading up to the structure. You can view a lot of very great samples of these at my webpage. Possessing openings in them, these panoramic decorations supply the extremely important cave or hiding hole for your fish to get in. Asian Buildings As Fish Tank Accessories In the event you'd rather have something appearing man made, there are several Asian type architecture that you could decide on as an alternative. The popular versions portray wooden Asian homes, with straw rooftops. But rather than simply a lone property, these fish decor would possibly require other ornaments for instance figurines or a bridge to provide a better effect. Besides shelters, you will be able to get tiny shrines or the pagoda that is a very regular aquarium decoration in the Asian design. Unusual Asian Aquarium Decor Currently there are a couple of very creative and attractive Asian type aquarium decoration which you can also buy. Many of the most attractive I have discovered are the Cambodian temple type, in which you will find a broken temple with a tree growing through it. The temple possesses fairly big slots in it, allowing the fish to swim in also. Statues from Buddhism also has been famous among fish enthusiasts these day. You can acquire a number of different statues of Buddha in numerous poses as well as just the head of the statue, appearing like a historical ornament. In choosing to opt for the Asian aquarium theme, you may want to stay away from pairing up the accessories with modern ornaments. Doing this might ruin the effect. What you want to do, should you lack any suitable aquarium components, is to use rocks and plants to accentuate them."
13,Dog (and Cat!) Days of Summer – Lifestyle & Yin-Yang Food for YOUR Unique Pet with Custom Pet Food,pets," As summer heat approaches, it brings to mind a traditional Chinese food philosophy of yin and yang – certain foods have a ""heaty"" or heat-inducing quality (too much yang) vs foods with a ""cooling"" or chilling effect (too much yin) on the body and its organ systems.  When heat-cold is out of balance, the body is more susceptible to developing health problems. The concept of ""Chinese Food Therapy"" is described in the Huangdi Neiji, the Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medicine (500 BC).  Eating too many ""heaty"" foods such as chili peppers or lobster could result in rash and dry skin while eating too many ""cooling"" foods such as watermelon could cause GI upsets and lower immunity to viruses. In the summer, cooling foods are believed to have an effect of clearing heat and toxins. Some cooling foods are apples, watermelon, alfalfa sprouts, seaweed, eggs, and barley.  Examples of heaty foods are mango, guava, pumpkin, butter, venison, and shrimp.  Neutral foods include berries, peas, carrots, and sweet potato. Pet parents face special risks during hot weather.  Depending on the lifestyle of the dog and cat, the following are good to keep in mind during the summer months. Heat Stroke:  One of the most serious and often fatal conditions commonly occurs in summer months as a result of prolonged exposure of pets to excessive heat.  Prevention is the best cure – avoid direct sun exposure (especially for dark coats), never leave pets in a car, beware of sun burns from shaved or thin/short hair, check the surface temperature to prevent paw burns, and adjust walk and exercise times to cooler temperatures and shade. Short-faced breeds have a hard time keeping cool as it difficult for them to pant. Water & Safety:  It is essential to have available cool, fresh water to drink at all times.  Wading pools are great for cooling off.  If a pet swims, ensure that there is a means to get out of the water (steps/ramp for pools and boats), personal flotation device if needed, and never leave unattended. Travel:  Air travel is not advised in the summer and many airlines will not ship where and when the temperatures are too high. For car travel, do not leave pets unattended.  Also be conscious of the temperature in and around the crate. Cool tips include using frozen liter bottles of water, placing sunshades on the windows, and providing a means of drinking water during the trip at all times. Summer Diet:  Adjust the pet’s diet to match lifestyle activities during the summer and the amount of time spent in the heat.  Decrease the caloric intake if a pet will be spending more time relaxing indoors, Increase the caloric intake if a pet will be more active outside in the pool.  If possible, increase more cooling foods in their diet. Petbrosia diets are convenient as each formula is customized and also contain cooling (apples, seaweed, egg) and neutral (sweet potato, carrots, peas) food ingredients that will help balance the Yin-Yang needs for the dog."
14,Acupuncture for Cats and Dogs,pets," Acupuncture is a form of traditional Chinese medicine where tiny needles are placed into the body to promote healing, most people are aware of alternative medical intervention for humans, but most are not aware that this procedure can also be performed on animals. While Chinese veterinarians have used acupuncture to treat dogs and cats for thousands of years, it wasn’t until the 20th century that acupuncture, as a form of alternative intervention for humans gained popularity in Western Europe, Canada, the United States and Australia. Different acupuncture points are located along an animal’s body (as in the human anatomy); each acupuncture point promotes healing when stimulated. Acupuncture can stimulate nerves, relieve muscle spasms, increase blood flow, and release endorphins and cortical, a natural steroid produced in the body. Acupuncture can be used alone or in conjunction with other veterinary treatments (for example medication) for cats and dogs. Musculoskeletal problems, such as traumatic nerve injury, arthritis, and intervertebral disc disease, certain types of reproductive issues, allergic dermatitis, gastrointestinal problems, and respiratory problems, like feline asthma, may be treated with veterinary acupuncture. Like humans, animals should not feel pain from the insertion of acupuncture needles, in fact, once the needles are in place, animals do not feel any pain. It has been observed that quite on the contrary, cats and dogs receiving acupuncture appear to become very relaxed during the treatment. However, occasionally cats and dogs experience some discomfort during acupuncture due to numbness, tingling, or cramps. The length and frequency with which a cat or dog will need acupuncture treatments depends on the animal’s condition and the method of stimulation (e.g., aquacupuncture, electroacupuncture, etc). An acute, simple medical issue, such as a sprain, may be treated with a single acupuncture treatment while a more complex, chronic problem, such as arthritis, may take several sessions. In addition, the effectiveness of the treatments depends on the condition being treated, the skill of the veterinary acupuncturist, and the length and frequency of sessions. In general, acupuncture is safe and does not have any side effects when treatment is performed by a properly trained veterinary acupuncturist. However, rarely side effects can occur. For instance, an animal’s condition may appear to worsen for up to two (2) days following an acupuncture session. Alternatively, a cat or dog may be lethargic for one day following a treatment. These side effects are temporary, and an animal's condition typically improves within a couple of days. Given the differences in human and animal anatomy and the potential for harm if performed incorrectly, dogs and cats should only receive acupuncture from a properly trained veterinary acupuncturist. Additionally, most states, providences, and countries consider acupuncture a surgical procedure in veterinary medicine, so animals should only receive treatments from a licensed veterinarian. A veterinarian is the best person to diagnose a cat or dog’s condition and determine if the animal could benefit from acupuncture. Dogs and cats may benefit from acupuncture. If you are interested in seeking this type of treatment for your pet’s medical condition, extra care should be taken when searching for an acupuncture for you pet. One way to do this is to narrow your search to outline 'acupuncturist for dogs/cats' rather then searching for an 'acupuncture clinics', this will ensure that you are in contact with the right professionals to help your pet."
15,Purchasing Dog Beds: A Comprehensive Guide,pets," Our pets are just like us and why not! After all, they are part of our very own family. So, quite like most of us, they have their own siesta or party time, lounging hours, bed times, and also their favorite resting spot. And, in order to provide the ultimate comfort to your pet dogs, you would also need to buy dog beds that are aesthetic, durable, and provide the requisite amount of comfort. Besides, once you have purchased this bed, it would be equally important to place it in their favorite spot as well! What are the desirable dog bed features you should be looking for? To begin with, it should be adequately comfortable. It should be able to conserve the body heat for a warm and restful sleep. It should protect bony prominences fittingly as well. If your pet has aged or has special needs with respect to bone and muscle support, you could also opt for orthopedic dog beds. You need a bed that is easy to clean and wash. It would be prudent to consider beds that come with covers that can be machine washed. It is important to maintain hygiene for your pets in order to keep them clean and healthy. Your dog bed should be durable enough to stand the test of time. Consider waterproof material for pet beds that resists moisture build-up. Ideally, a dog bed made from soft poly-fill that is marginally elevated would be considered as the ideal choice. However, if you are looking for specialized orthopedic dog beds that cater to specific medical needs, it would be prudent to have your personal vet verify the features and the make, before you buy. Some Practical Tips for Choosing Dog Beds When you select a dog bed, consider the size of your dog and choose one that is likely to be sufficient for him even as an adult. You could seek your vet's advice in case you aren't sure of the size of a full grown dog of the breed. It should fit into his crate snugly, so that his so called ""home"" could be made more comfortable. Keep in mind that dogs can try to rip or consume the bed materials. So, beds need to be sturdy enough to protect them from damage and dog bites. If the dog does decide to chew on the bed, the bed will be worn out eventually and eventually ruined. You should buy something else for the dog to chew on and keep them easily accessible for the dog so they do not feel inclined to chew on the bed. Again, if you have opted for orthopedic dog beds, all specifications provided by your vet for the same, needs to be adhered to. A Better Life for Your Dog Whether you choose ordinary beds for your pet dogs or orthopedic dog beds, the choice should be planned well. Just make sure you take time in selecting them, so that your coveted pets can enjoy the benefits of a restful sleep. There are many things to consider when selecting the right bed for your pet.

16,Lure Your Cat to Drink More Water through Pet Drinking Fountain,pets," Majority of pet owners can prove to the fact that cats are particular. They will only eat specific kinds of food out of a certain type of bowl. What many individuals don't know is that this rule applies to water as well. Generally, cats do not drink enough water and this can lead to different health problems, but these problems can be prevented simply by observing the likes and dislikes of a cat with regards to water preferences. To lure a cat to drink more water takes some trial and error, but as soon as the perfect combination is found, a pet owner should have no problem with their cat remaining hydrated.  A cat is one that prefers moving water. It must be an instinct from the wild to desire moving water as opposed to stagnant, but lots of cat owners report their cats will only drink running water. To check the cats' preference, just turn on a faucet part way (high water pressure will most likely scare the poor thing) and situate the cat next to the sink. There is a good chance the cat will examine it cautiously at first and then start to drink. If the cat likes this, it will be obvious when they begin jumping up to the faucet and trying to drink without the water running. If they do indeed seem to like getting their water this way, a pet drinking fountain may be bought to facilitate this. Cat dehydration can be caused by lots of different factors from lack of available drinking water to illness. It's very important to make sure a cat doesn't become dehydrated, particularly for those cats afflicted by diabetes or renal failure, as those two illnesses in particular cause increased urination which in turn causes increased chance for dehydration.

On the whole, cats love water, which is what the family pet fountain provides for their life. Some may just wallow in it and check out it for a little bit, or some may stick their paw on the water and spend playtime with it. But then they will probable realize this really is their water source, and they'll start drinking from your fountain. If you've been among those pet owners that run around the house turning faucets on in order that they drip with your cat can drink their particular, you will need to stop doing that. Allowing your cat drink from sinks is an efficient way of getting him to give up drinking from his bowl.

17,Five Tips for Selecting the Best Cat Tree,pets," One of the best ways to satisfy your cat’s curiosity and keep in shape is to provide her with a cat tree. Since there are many such trees offered in the market, you should spend enough time understanding a few things before purchasing one for your beloved pet. Many pets need enough amount of stimulation to prevent them from getting bored, and cat trees are definitely one among best cat furniture that will keep your cat active through the day. But before making decision which tree is best for your feline friend you should consider some things. Safety Matters a Lot! It should be the very first thing that you need to consider, when shopping for a cat tree. Not only should you provide safety for your cat, but also for you or anyone who comes close to that tree. Cat owner should know what their cats can do, and if there are risky areas in your home, the pets are going to explore it for sure. The manufacturer is responsible for making a well-constructed cat trees, but the owners are equally responsible for making good judgment in terms of selection. Ensure that the design of the tree does not compromise on safety. Some of them could be made of cheap materials and could collapse under the weight of your pet. You may also want to buy a tree, which will not trip over when your cat takes a flying leap, lands on side or top of the cat tree. The lighter and smaller trees are not the best option if you have big or heavy cats at home. Check the stability of tree before making the purchase. Some of the manufacturers use toxic chemicals, glues, and dyes in the making process, and it is strictly not recommended to go for such ones. Accessibility Ensure that the kitty cat tree you intend to buy is accessible to your cat or kitty. Cats should be able to climb tree in all situations. You pets many be overweight, old, have health problems, or declawed. If you’ve bigger cats, take trees that can accommodate properly. The cats should be able to get down or up the tree very easily. Durability Some cat trees at local stores are made with cheap materials, so stability should always be checked. Many use cardboard as the main support, which is not that safe, especially when the cat is climbing the tree. Don’t Overlook the Visual Appeal The cat tree not only should appeal to your pet, but it should also be great addition to your home décor. If you’ve spent $2000 on a new sofa or furniture, you wouldn’t of course want to see ugly tree placed in the middle of living room.

Price It is not about buying some cheap or expensive kitty tree, but purchasing something that offers great value for money. Have some budget in your mind and buy a tree that will satisfy both you and your cat. Keeping all these things in mind, now you can choose a secure, well-balanced, and stable cat tree, and keep your pets happy."
18,Things to Consider Before Getting a Dog for the First Time,pets," Are you thinking about getting a dog for the first time?  If so, then hopefully you have thought the decision through thoroughly.  There are a few things that you may not have considered yet.  Keep reading to learn a few things to consider before you make your decision. Dogs aren't goldfish.  You can't buy one and expect to be rid of it a few weeks later.  Although various breeds have differing lifespans, dogs live approximately 12 years.  This is a lot of time to take care of something. You need to realize that you'll be making a huge commitment before getting a dog for the first time.  Dogs need to be fed and walked daily.  Don't forget about other tasks such as brushing teeth and hair, especially for longer-haired breeds. Owning a dog isn't for everyone's lifestyle.  Do you spend all day at work?  Your dog will get lonely without attention from you.  Also, if you frequently travel out of town, you would need to make arrangements for your pet's care. Before you get a dog, you need to think about your family's situation.  Is everyone in the household fine with bringing in a canine?  After all, they will likely care for and love him too.  However, if there are small kids around, certain breeds won't be suitable. The amount of space you have to offer is something else that you should think about before you get your first dog.  This is especially important if you plan on getting one of the larger breeds.  However, small dogs need space to run around too, since they're often more energetic. Even if you have a big enough yard, it's best that it also has a fence around it.  Not only does it keep your dog from getting out, but it keeps other animals from coming into your yard to bother your dog too.  Living in close proximity to a dog park will come in handy for daily exercise. Even if you have adequate space to accommodate a dog, you need to consider the community that you live in.  Not all of them are pet-friendly.  Your apartment manager or home owner's association may have something to say about it.  It's vital to understand the rules that apply to pet owners before you go about getting a dog for the first time. Owning a dog can be relatively costly, so make sure that you have enough room in your budget.  In addition to standard items such as food and toys, your dog may need medication for some reason.  In fact, flea and heartworm medication on a monthly basis is often recommended. Keep in mind that you don't always have to get a cute little puppy as your first pet.  Older dogs are in need of rescue too.  There are plenty of benefits like not having to go through the housetraining process."
19,Tips for Litter Box Training a Dog,pets," Smaller dogs obviously have smaller bladders.  That means that they have to go outside more often than their larger counterparts.  One way to avoid frequent trips outside is to teach your small dog how to use a litter box much like a cat. Be aware that your dog's won't have a cat's natural instincts when it comes to using a litter box or burying waste.  Therefore, it will take a lot of patience when it comes to litter box training a dog.  The following tips should help somewhat though. Many people are surprised to learn that there are litter boxes designed especially for dogs.  However, you can still use those designed for cats.  Just make sure that it's one of the largest that you can find so that your dog doesn't have space issues. Your little one won't just go running to the litter box whenever it's time for him to go to the bathroom.  You will need to pick him up and take him there instead, at least until he gets used to the process.  This means that you'll need to keep a watchful eye on your canine. Dogs typically start walking in circles or sniffing the ground whenever they're about to go.  Dogs also have to eliminate whenever they wake up in the morning, so take him to the box then too.  A few minutes after he eats is another time that he needs to be taken to the litter box. You may not want to go about litter box training a dog right from the start.  The old method of using newspaper will help considerably.  Once your dog gets used to going on the paper, you can just switch it out to a litter box. As with any type of training, you will need to be patient with your dog.  Whenever things go right, make sure that you praise him for it.  Give him a nice treat or two whenever he successfully uses the litter box too. Conversely, make sure that your dog gets the message whenever he messes up.  Don't worry about scolding your dog if you find an accident at a later time, since doing so will do no good.  Catch him in the act and reprimand him, just not physically. When there are accidents, make sure that you're prepared.  You will need to clean up messes thoroughly.  Dogs have an amazing sense of smell, and will be drawn back to spots that they've eliminated on in the past. Litter box training a dog isn't the easiest thing in the world to do.  However, it will save you a lot of trouble if you can do it successfully.  Good luck."
20,Helpful Advice on Caring for Senior Cats,pets," Sooner or later, your beloved cat will start to get old and experience physical changes.  This typically occurs between the ages of seven and ten.  However, some are fortunate enough to stave off major changes until approximately 12 years old.  Whenever the time finally comes though, you will need to make a few changes in how you care for your pet.  Keep reading for useful advice on caring for senior cats. Most owners take their cats to the vet for an annual exam.  Older cats need to be seen by the vet more often than their younger counterparts since the risk of problems has increased.  It's best to schedule a wellness exam every six months. You will also need to change what you feed your senior cat somewhat.  Seniors who become less active but are still fed the same amount of calories will more than likely become overweight.  Obesity is particularly a problem for seniors, so a veterinarian-approved diet would definitely be in order. When caring for senior cats, always ensure that they always have access to fresh drinking water.  Dehydration more easily sets in as cats advance in age.  Their organs won't respond very well to chronic dehydration either.  The kidneys usually give seniors the most problem, and frequent dehydration certainly won't do these vital organs any good. Just like with humans, arthritis becomes a problem for older cats.  Once arthritis sets in, your cat won't be as physically active as he used to be.  Don't be surprised if he stops climbing the stairs or hopping up onto the windowsill.  Arthritic cats may even have problems getting into their litter boxes.  If you notice yours has an issue with this, you can accommodate him by getting a shorter box or even putting a set of stairs beside it. Dental care is important for cats of all ages.  For older cats, it becomes increasingly important.  The risk of developing dental disease only increases with age.  This disease can cause enough pain to keep your cat from eating. Your cat may also lose the energy to keep himself groomed properly.  You don't want him to develop a dry or excessively dirty coat.  Matting can also become a problem if you have a long-haired breed.  You can help your senior cat out by brushing him yourself on a daily basis, or at least a few times each week. The changes that occur in your senior cat aren't just physical.  He may also display mental issues much like elderly humans.  He may wander around occasionally or even appear disoriented.  Some cats become much more vocal and meow too much for their owner's liking.  When caring for senior cats, also keep in mind they may not respond well to changes.  Try to keep everything in the household the same as they do best with familiar routines. There are quite a few diseases that are common in older cats.  Hypertension, kidney issues, hyperthyroidism, and diabetes mellitus are among some of the most common.  Different types of cancer are also more prevalent for aged cats. With the increase in risk of these diseases, it's important to monitor your cat closely for changes.  If you  notice anything out of the ordinary, you may want to let a vet give his opinion of it.  Examinations conducted twice a year will hopefully catch any diseases early on, which would hopefully make it easier to deal with."

1,Haul Around Your Dog In Vogue Everywhere You Go,pets," Many individuals become so emotionally involved with their pets that leaving home without them is a very difficult thing to do.  Dog carriers allow you to take your dog with you wherever you go. Most people will take their dogs along with them on an airplane if your carrier meets the approval of the airline.  This is less stressful for the pet than flying underneath with the luggage and cargo; but this may also be arranged for a bigger dog with a sufficient carrier.  Before you fly, make sure to check the airline's particular rules about traveling with pets. If you like taking your pet out to a lively area of town, a carrier makes it simple to carry your pet without the worries of them running away, running into traffic, or getting lost.  Very small dogs have a problem keeping up once you walk them on a leash, therefore placing them in a dog carrier is a lot easier. If you have an elderly dog which may have arthritis or another type of condition that makes walking challenging, it is particularly significant to you to take additional care of them.  Smaller dogs also gain from being in dog carriers because they run the risk of being stepped on if you are walking on a congested street.  If you buy a tote or handbag type carrier it can be easily carried over your shoulder when you walk.  A tote or shoulder carrier will free up your hands also. Of course, you won’t manage to carry your Great Dane in a carrier this way, however, if you own a smaller breed, they'll fit perfectly in a tote carrier. There are many various dog carriers to chose from, so you will easily find one which meets your needs and your dog's personality as well. Dog carriers come in different sizes, so you should get one that is the correct size for your dog so that they will be comfy.  In case your dog is simply too big for a small carrier, he will not be comfortable; however, if you purchase one that is too big, you are squandering your money on the excess size. The dog should have enough room to turn around in the carrier. If they can't turn around, you'll need a much bigger carrier. If you are considering buying a carrier online, be sure to select cautiously the right size carrier for your dog.  Since you won't be able to put your dog inside the carrier first, you have to figure out the very best size ahead of time.  Measure your pet, then double-check the length of the carrier. Your pet needs to be comfy when you are on the go, so be sure to find a carrier that they can sleep in as well as see out of. You can carry your dog in style, and keep your dog secure.  You can find a variety of cute designer pet carriers which will get the attention of others.  They're entertaining and comfy for your pet, and a good way for your pet to travel in style."
2,Can Animals Learn Human Languages?,pets," At an early age, most humans have developed an ability to communicate through oral language, and by the age of five to seven, most humans can comprehend, as well as express themselves in written thoughts. The amazing human abilities of communicating clearly separates humans from all other animals. So, does this mean that human and animal communication is impossible? Can animals understand us when we talk to them? It is usually at 6:30 am when our bedroom is filled with funny meowing noises, jumping, and attempts to  open the window curtains. Our 4 year old Norwegian cat named Annika is amazingly skillful and bright animal. Being so impatient in the morning, our cat usually wakes us up, telling us she wants food and attention. Having a pet at home doesn’t only involve feeding the animal but it also requires a direct communication between the animal and its master. I can thus observe myself that animal to human communication is possible; however, it requires extra attention, practice and patience. Although animals do not understand speeches, animals like cats and dogs learn and understand sounds.  Our pets recognize their name being called, don’t they? They can detect angry or loving tones, which allows them to understand a situation. When I am sitting on the couch and Annika is meowing, looking for some touch and attention, I usually call her, ‘’come here!’’. If she just walks slowly I make an effort saying ‘’quick, quick!’’. I guess she understands me, because she actually responds by running towards me and letting me pick her up. Human – animal communication is observed in everyday life in the interactions between pets and their owners. In addition, animals have their own ways of expressing themselves and communicating with people; our cat Annika simply gives me a soft meow every time I come out from the bedroom, and I think it is simply saying, ‘’Oh hi, how are you doing?’’ Recently, a video of a male Asian elephant named Koshik that showed him mimicing Korean words went viral n the internet.  Apparently, in the video, Koshik mimics words such as ‘’choah’’, which means ‘’good’’ in English, ‘’annoying’’, sit down’’, ‘’no’’ and ‘’lie down’’.  According to Angela Stoeger, researcher, from the University in Austria, ‘’ Human speech basically has two important aspects: pitch and timbre. Surprisingly, the elephant Koshik is capable of matching these two important components of human speech sounds. On the other hand, researchers cannot understand why Koshik imitates human sound and words; many experts believe that Koshik and some other talking animals started to adapt the human words and sounds from their human companions to strengthen social affiliation. However, Koshik mimics human sounds not entirely as a form of understanding and learning a language, but the elephant is just imitating sounds. There have been many cases of animals learning and understanding human language; sometimes, it is unbelievable but the reality is that it is simply amazing when it is true."
3,Purchase The Greatest Dog Bowls For Your Best Friend,pets," The phrase ""a dog is a man’s best friend"" was coined by Virginian attorney, George Graham Vest, in 1870, as he defended Old Drum, a farmer’s pet dog.  The expression stuck, and it's still popular today.  Obviously, you desire to provide the best dog bowls for your companion, so you should shop, and consider many things when choosing the best bowl.  The kind of the dog bowl is important when it comes to feeding or watering your dog, whether the bowls are placed outside or indoors.  The goal to finding the right bowl is one that is designed to easily let the dog drink and eat from it, as well as keeping the area around the bowl clean. Flat-bottomed bowls tend to be the very best bowl to provide food and water for your dog.  They are usually more stable than bowls which might be rounded on the bottom, and will stay upright while your fired up pooch devours his dinner.  Frequently, dogs can't wait for their mealtime, so they enthusiastically eat down the food readily, however smaller dogs are likely to snack at the food, and are not so assertive about eating.  While ingesting, wandering about, and rubbing his nose directly into his bowl, a dog may effortlessly tip the bowl over, creating a big mess for you to clean up.  So, look at purchasing a flat-bottomed bowl when choosing one for your dog, because it will reduce the chance of your dog causing a mess. Another thing to look for in a dog bowl is a rubber rim around the border of the bottom.  A rubber rim tends to make all the difference in the world with regards to keeping the bowl in place.  It will keep your bowl from sliding as the dog slurps up his pet food.  Even the most hungry and excited dog will have a problem moving these type bowls, because the rubber sticks to the flooring.  One that doesn't have a rubber rim can easily travel over the floor, spilling food or water as the dog drinks or eats. Rather than dealing with the mess, wouldn’t it be less difficult to find a bowl that is going to stay in place through feeding time? Horrible bacteria and viruses like to hang out in dog bowls.  It can be worth getting a bowl that is dishwasher safe.  That way, you can easily toss it in the dishwasher, run a cycle, and rest assured that the bowls is going to be sanitized.  Don't forget, you want to steer clear of germs, so having a germ-free environment in your house is the goal.  It is even more crucial if you have children walking around on the floor, and around the dog bowls.  If these areas are not cleaned on a regular basis, small children might be exposed to the bacteria and viruses growing around the feeding containers. Another consideration, is choosing a bowl that only your dog can get is nose and mouth in to keep his ears out from the food.  That way, his sweet, floppy ears won’t obstruct, and feeding will be easier.  You are lucky if you are looking for a dog bowl.  There are plenty to choose from to make feeding time a cheerful time for you and your best friend."

5,6 Guinea Pig Care Mistakes,pets," When dealing with guinea pigs, many mistakes are made by a simple action: visiting a pet shop. People imply by default that every and any product offered by a shop for a certain type of pet is legit and safe. Unfortunately, it is not. One of those products is a leash for guinea pigs, which in fact is a very bad idea. Cavies have very delicate spines and bone structure which can not tolerate stress generated by hamster wheels. Avoid at all costs. Similar product, and our mistake number two, is a Hamster Wheel, which some people promote that it also works on cavies. But here is a fact: it does not work on cavies. Moreover, guinea pigs could seriously hurt themselves on that thing because of their delicate spines and bone structure which can not tolerate such stress. Getting at number three, by putting your pet on the direct sunlight on the hot summer day, by believing that he/she need to get some sunlight and to get out of the shades. But in fact, guinea pigs have LOW tolerance for high temperatures and could suffer a heat stroke. They do prefer shades, after all, they are prey animals. Single Guinea Pig is a mistake number 4. It could be easier to maintain and control, it is cheaper, maybe less messy, but the fact is, guinea pigs are social (herd) animals and they need company besides their human caretakers, no matter how much time they spend with their pets every day. Small Cage is one of the most common mistakes, and here it is on number 5. Small cages do not enable fair air circulation, and there is a serious danger of higher toxic gasses fluctuation inside the cage. Smaller cages are messier, need cleaning more often, more unhealthy for your pet, and not to mention that cavies need larger living space because, well, they tend to grow. Mistake number 6 involves improper diet - one of the most dangerous mistakes. Giving your pet human junk food, dairy products, wrong vegetables, too much fruits, or anything that is not on the ""safe list"", creates a danger for your cavy. Seeds are also a mistake because they are mostly empty calories with no significant nutritional value, plus bonus feature: they are choking hazard. Learning guinea pig food preferences is one of the most important prerequisites for having a guinea pig for a pet."
6,Safe and effective tick & flea control,pets," There are thousands of pesticides, oral medications, sprays, dips, shampoos, and powders  that are approved to control fleas and ticks on cats and dogs. Some products kill only ticks or adult fleas-others break the flea life cycle by preventing flea eggs from developing into adult fleas. Most of those products contain insecticides, which should not be used on pets that are sickly, pregnant, or nursing, or with certain drugs that may interact with the insecticide. Insecticide can endanger the health of your pet, especially the liver. After applying the product, if your pet shows symptoms of illness after treatment, call your veterinarian. Symptoms of poisoning may include poor appetite, depression, vomiting, diarrhea, or excessive salivation. What most of pet owners don’t know is the fact that chemical products become 100 % more aggressive and stronger every year due to increase of parasite’s resistance.

7,Controlling That Pesky Bark,pets," Above anything else, a dog wants to please its owner. Dogs view their family as their pack, and they are biologically wired to provide and desire extensive protection for them. There are times when a dog's passion for protecting its 'pack', however, is translated through an excessive amount of barking, which may quickly become a nuisance for its owner. It may not be appreciated by those next door either and its owner may be met with a barrage of complaints from sleep-deprived neighbors. Fortunately, there are a number of ways to achieve bark control which don't put our enthusiastic, four-legged friends in danger. Some of the most common tools for bark control are anti-bark collars. These collars have an assortment of designs, but the two most popular on the market are shock collars and spray collars. Shock collars work by delivering a small, yet harmless shock to a dog when their barking is detected to be excessive in volume or length. Some models deliver a warning tone first so that they aren't immediately punished for what is, after all, their instinct. The shock collars often come with a number of settings so that the power of the shock or the sensitivity of the collar can be carefully adjusted to meet the owner's preferences, with the maximum settings still being safe for even the tiniest of dogs. Just the idea of shocking a dog, however safe it may be, may come off inhumane for some owners. For those, there is the popular alternative of spray bark collars. The spray bark collar works in a way easily predicted from its name. Just like shock collars, it has the ability to detect nuisance barking and can be adjusted to meet a number of settings. However, instead of delivering a shock, it simply sprays the dog with a bit of liquid which the dog typically finds unpleasant. The spray bark collar can be filled with many liquids, but the citronella bark collar is a highly recommended choice for any owner seeking a bark-controlling collar, as it is fully safe while still remaining remarkably effective. The liquid inside it, citronella, is colorless and has a lemony odor, making the citronella bark collar an even friendlier choice for owners who are concerned about ensuring their house looks clean and keeping the aroma of their house pleasant. It may be a dog's instinct to bark in order to protect its 'pack', but a dog is also known for its extreme intelligence and ability to adapt. Dogs are certainly smart enough to adjust to anti-bark collars quickly, and they can be a perfect aid in the training of dogs at night when their owners are not present to guide them. Since dogs function as our best friends, showering us with love, attention and joy, it’s best that we treat them well in return. If excessive barking is an issue, anti-bark collars are safe, effective, and humane tools we can use to improve our and their environment alike."
8,Pet Vaccination; How Much is Too Much?,pets," Back in 2003, the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) revised vaccination guidelines, recommending veterinarians to vaccinate adult dogs every three years instead of annually and many veterinarians have changed their protocols in respect to the new guidelines.  The change was implemented after experts agreed with the overwhelming evidence showing annual vaccinations for canine diseases were unnecessary and harmful.    It behooves the pet owner to avoid veterinarian service providers who recommend, and even demand, annual vaccines.  There are many veterinarians who choose to ignore the guidelines as they don’t want to lose the income these booster shots bring in every year.  Another  veterinarian service pet owners should avoid are those provided in a parking lot or pet supply store where you and your pet are without the benefit of a relationship with the veterinarian providing the inexpensive service.  Your pet may pay the price of inappropriate or unnecessary veterinarian care.  Vaccinations are a major stress to your pet’s immune system and can cause side effects and allergic reactions as well as long term chronic disease such as skin allergies, arthritis, leukemia, upper respiratory infections, irritable bowel syndrome, and neurological conditions as aggressive behavior, epilepsy, auto-immune disease and cancer.  It is common today for veterinarians to see sicker dogs and cats at a much younger age.  Pets as young as 5 years of age are diagnosed with cancer and auto-immune disease is also on the rise.  Combine over-vaccination with poor nutrition, poor breeding practices and environmental stresses and your left with generations of pets who are susceptible to chronic disease and congenital disorders.  Yearly veterinary checkups are imperative for your pet as this provides them with a strong health baseline, helps pet owners recognize subtle changes in their pets over time, as well as develops a relationship between your veterinarian, you and your pet. It is best to prepare yourself for your dog’s annual veterinary visit.  Be ready to discuss the best vaccine strategy for your pet by bringing veterinary records of your pet’s vaccine history with you.  Don’t assume the clinic will have the most recent information on hand and this is more imperative if you’ve changed veterinary clinics.  Include all test results such as heartworm, antibody titer, blood and/or urinalysis.  Have a clear idea whether you want or need your pet to receive any vaccinations for which diseases and ask your veterinarian if any particular vaccines are necessary due to conditions in the area you live in.  Consider the risk.  If your pet is indoors only and is never exposed to unvaccinated animals, then the risk of infection is low.  Educate yourself so that you can have an intelligent conversation with your veterinarian concerning the good and bad of vaccinating your pet.  Know your pet’s health; whether he has health or behavioral issues that your veterinarian should be aware of and bring a list of any medications or supplements your pet is taking along with dosage, strength and frequency.  The decision to vaccinate your pet or not is very individual and should be based on extensive research before you go to your veterinarian.  If you are seeing a veterinarian for the first time, it is a good idea to make an appointment to see him without your pet to discuss his philosophy toward vaccinations and other tests such as the antibody titer test.  A ""titer"" is a measurement of how much antibody a certain antigen is circulating in the blood at that moment.  A dog displaying a positive antibody titer test result is considered protected from the disease for which the vaccine is intended and does not need vaccines at that time.  Never vaccinate a pet whose immune system is compromised with an infection as the vaccine might distract the  immune system from handling the infection and create the likelihood that the vaccine may not produce protective immunity. Should you choose to vaccinate your pet, consider asking your veterinarian to perform a health exam and other tests first then wait for the results.  If your pet is in good health, schedule a follow-up vaccine visit.  Avoid multiple vaccines in one or combination vaccines; if this is the only option available, look elsewhere.  Don’t vaccinate your pet more than every three years.  Some vaccines such as Lepto, Bordetella, or Lyme do not last more than one year however consider whether these diseases are heightened in your area before vaccinating your pet.  Schedule these vaccines separately from the rabies vaccine if your pet needs them and administer them in another part of the body.  Vaccine programs must be designed to each animals specific needs, not the masses.  You need to figure the dog’s age, environment, activities, lifestyle and previous adverse vaccine reactions, if any, in the equation.  Do not vaccinate puppies and kittens who are younger than 12 weeks of age as their immune systems are very vulnerable to the stress of the vaccine.  Keep puppies and kittens safe from exposure by avoiding pubic areas such as parks and pet stores.  Vaccinate puppies between the age of 12-15 weeks for parvovirus and distemper and wait until after they are 6 months old before vaccinating for rabies.  For kittens, one Panleukopenia combination (FRCP) and, if available, have the vaccine administered separately spaced three to four weeks apart.  Consider the lifestyle and environment of your cat; if he goes outside and you have rabies in your area, vaccinate him at 6 months of age.  Feline leukemia and FIP vaccines may not be necessary for your cat.  Keep in mind that legal requirements vary from state to state.  Studies show that a single vaccination for parvovirus, distemper and panleukopenia provide long-term protection and a simple blood test will revel if antibodies levels remain high enough to resist infection therefore a ""booster"" is not needed.  Vaccines do not need ""boosting"".  Unless diseases are locally endemic or if a specific kennel has contracted  Bordetella, corona virus, leptospirosis or Lyme, veterinarians do not recommend vaccinations.  The leptospirosis vaccine is generally not useful because the currently licensed leptospira bacterins do not have the serovars which cause leptospirosis today.  An alternative homeopathic method used by pet owners choosing not to vaccinate are Nosodes which can be used on animals younger than three months of age if the animal is at risk.  These homeopathic medicines help protect pets against Parvovirus, Distemper, Kennel Cough, Panleukopenia and FIP.  Though some nosodes work more effectively than others, they are not vaccines and do not produce titers against these diseases but seem to offer some protection in the severity of illness if the pet has been exposed even if they don’t prevent the disease. When it comes to vaccinating your pet, educate yourself.  You are your pet’s guardian and the decision is yours, not your veterinarians, nor should it be.  You are responsible for the care of your companion; give them the best by researching and very carefully weighing decisions about their healthcare."
9,Stem Cell Nutrition For Horses and Pets,pets," STEM CELL ENHANCER FOR HORSES Supports the release of adult stem cells into the body There is NO OTHER product in the marketplace that does what this one does for horses. Our sensational NEW product is the world's first and only 100% natural stem cell enhancer for horses – an exciting breakthrough to help your horse achieve optimal health and optimal performance! The granules are the specially formulated equine alternative to our patented, scientifically proven stem cell enhancer for humans. It is flavoured with apple, molasses and alfalfa leaf, natural flavours that appeal to horses. And, it is so easy to use … all you have to do is add it to your horse's feed. Just like humans animals have adult stem cells (hereafter called ASC) that have the ability to become virtually any type of cell in the body. They can become heart cells, liver cells, muscle cells, brain cells even cells in the eyes, joints and more. WHAT ARE ADULT STEM CELLS AND WHY DO HORSES NEED STEM CELL ENHANCERS? Adult stem cells (ASC) are the ""master"" cells found in the body following birth, and are most abundantly found in the bone marrow. They form the core of the body's natural renewal system. As they do in humans, they reside in the bone marrow of animals where they are released whenever there is a problem somewhere in the body. Studies revealed that ASC in animals, conduct themselves the same way of those in humans do. When there is an injury or stress to tissues, ligaments or organs, compounds are released that reach the bone marrow and trigger the release of ASC into the body. The released ASC then travel to tissues and organs in need of help in order to regain optimal health. When you understand how your horse's natural renewal system works, you will become familiar with the benefits of increasing the number of circulating ASC. According to numerous studies, a higher number of circulating ASC equates to better overall health and wellness in your animal. With age, the number of ASC circulating in the body gradually decreases, leaving horses more susceptible to injury and other age related health challenges. Just as antioxidants are important to protect cells from ""free radical damage"", stem cell enhancers are equally important to support ASC in maintaining proper organ and tissue function, ultimately supporting their optimal health. When you give your horses stem cell enhancers, the ingredients help support the release of ASC from the bone marrow into the bloodstream. Through a natural process they then travel to areas of the body where they are most needed. The result, a uniquely effective health performance strategy for your horses. Another option is stem cell injections. This requires a lot of work, not only is it stressful on the horse it is very expensive by comparison with stem cell nutrition. As you can see the stem cell nutrition is by far the best choice. Let's have a look at some of the differences: STEM CELL NUTRITION Easily administered in food No anesthesia required Not a medical procedure/treatment Nutritional stimulation of the bone, bone marrow or fat tissues ASC released in the body within 30-60 minutes Fed daily as long as needed Nutritionally supportive made of natural ingredients Supports circulating ASC - helps whole immune system Cost effective approximately ($3-$4 per day plus additional benefits to overall health of horse) STEM CELL INJECTIONS Specialist required Local anesthesia required Medical procedure/treatment Extraction of ASC from horses bone marrow Several days from extraction to re-insertion Many treatments typically needed Not nutritionally supportive Treats localised area only (not whole immune system) Costly procedure ($1,500 - $3,500 per treatment or more) Results of clinical studies shows that stem cell treatment can improve healing rates, overall outcomes and decrease re-injury rates by almost half. Due to physical activity, stress, and the aging process, your horse's tissues require ongoing daily renewal. So, give your horses what they need to be at their best in health and performance, there is no doubt that stem cell nutrition is extremely beneficial to your horses."
10,Pet proofing your home using indoor dog gates,pets," Most people know that when you have a toddler running thru your home you are going to need a baby gate to keep them safe.  Well the same hold true for your furry friend,  using indoor dog gates will keep them confined so your pet will be safe.  When you bring a new pet into your home it can be overwhelming to figure out how to take care of them and give them just what they need. That is why I recommend that you do what new parents have to do with their homes, and I call it pet proofing,  much like baby proofing, it is something you must do to keep your pet safe and secure. Pet proofing can be a bit easier since most dogs are pretty smart and can be trained in a quick amount of time.  Consistency and praise are the most important two things, when it comes to training a dog.  I have four dogs, and this seems to be the best way in my opinion to get them trained with out your dog thinking you are being mean.  Just like with children love goes along way when you are training your pet and this will make them try harder because that is a dogs nature, to make you pleased with them. One other tool I have found to be most useful is  indoor dog gates. They can be placed anywhere with ease and can help you to keep your sanity while keeping your pet safe and sound. I have seen some pet owners that decided to not use pet gates and found that their dogs will tear up their home, furniture or shoes.  The pet gets into trouble for it and this is turn will make both the dog and the master feel bad.  If you set boundaries for your dog at a young age they will respect you, and your home more.  This will make for a happy and healthy relationship with your dog, which is a real rewarding experience. I have also found that I can clean up my house or have a dinner party a lot easier with the use of indoor dog gates, which I know some of my guest appreciate since I am well aware that not everyone is going to be a dog person.  Dog gates can make a better experience for your dog, and your guest so that you can avoid any awkward situations. I do have a fenced in yard I can put them in when I have guests. But when it is raining or really cold  outside I do  not feel right about putting my furry friends out there to suffer since my pets are used to being indoors.  In contrast I do not want to lose my friends just because they are not comfortable around a dog. With the proper love and encouragement your pet can be a really well behaved member of your family. Just remember that a lot of love and praise, and setting boundaries will make your dog respect you more and give them a feeling of trust that will make them a better pet for you.  And safety first when it comes to dog gates, just check out  http://indoor-doggates.com for more about indoor dog gates and what types you may find the most useful for your home."
11,Why Do Cats Like To Sleep So Much,pets," One thing is for sure: cats know how to sleep. And they sleep a lot. However, so far nobody knows why they sleep so much, but you gotta admit that they are the most adorable creatures when asleep. As they choose the weirdest place to sleep. Either on top of a dog or in a pot. You name a place and they are there :) Well, it's a known fact that cats evolved from a long line of hunters and predators and that probably has an effect on their sleeping pattern. Their diet may also play an important role. Since they are on protein rich diet that doesn't take them a lot of time of the day, they have plenty of time to sleep. And sometimes all they do is sleep, since they don't have things to do. Of course this applies for indoor cats. But there is always something you can find for your cat to do and stay awake and entertained. While newborn cats, well they sleep most of the time, but believe it or not this actually keeps them safe. As they don't attract attention and by that I mean, they don't attract predators. As for the cats in the wild, well they are constantly on alert in order to survive. While indoor cats are sleeping, they are still active and ready to go into action. And you can see that as all cats while sleeping have their ears rotating and as soon as they hear a noise or sense that someone is coming they open their eyes to check out the situation and if safe they go back to sleep again. And as I've already said at the beginning cats sleep basically anywhere.  At the table, on a top of a piano, on the edge, anywhere. As long as it safe and comfortable enough for it to stretch that body. :) For example when it's cold it tries to find a shaded place where it can stretch out. While during the cool winter days a cat will try to find a place warm enough, like warm sunshine or next to a heat source. Another interesting fact is that cats like to sleep in their owners' beds. And people who use this method  actually benefit from it, as it strengthens the human-feline bond and let's not forget all the warmth and the comfort your cat gives you. And one last thing. Cats dream, too. But, unfortunately for now we can only guess what they dream about. By Emilija Spirkoska"
12,Pet Health - Information Regarding Cat Enteritis,pets," Enteritis in cats is a very serious disease.  It's often referred to as distemper, which is a disease that dogs commonly get.  However, feline enteritis isn't the same.  A common other name for the condition is panleukopenia. This disease normally strikes kittens younger than six months old.  However, older cats also have a relatively increased risk of developing it.  Older cats may be strong enough to fight off the affliction, but kittens can easily succumb to it. Feline enteritis is caused by a virus.  Wild animals such as cats and raccoons can harbor the highly contagious virus.  Infected animals can pass it to your cat by coming into direct contact with him.  If your cat comes into contact with nasal or oral secretions, he can get infected too. Owners should also know that the virus that causes enteritis in cats can also contaminate items such as bedding, litter boxes, and food dishes.  Owners can also pass the virus along to their cats because it's capable of contaminating human hands. After being infected with feline enteritis, your cat may not show any symptoms for up to ten days.  Common signs include high fever and loss of appetite.  Cats may also vomit frequently, producing yellow-tinted bile in the process.  If you touch your cat in the abdominal region, he may cry out in pain.  It is also common for cats to have diarrhea and produce stool that also has a yellow color, although it may appear to have blood in it instead. As mentioned, enteritis in cats is quite serious.  That's why it is important that you get your cat checked out and diagnosed with the condition as soon as possible.  The chances of your cat surviving a bout with this virus rise considerably the earlier that treatment is started. There is no way to battle the virus that causes cat enteritis directly.  The vet will simply need to provide supportive measures to help your cat make it through the disease.  Antibiotics will likely be given to stave off any bacterial infections.  IV fluids and nutrition therapy may also be necessary. It is very easy to prevent enteritis in cats.  Simply have your feline vaccinated.  The virus can live virtually anywhere in your home, so your kitten would be at risk if left unvaccinated.  Using a standard disinfectant won't be enough to kill the virus either. If your cat survives an episode of feline enteritis, then you should be aware that he will continue to shed the virus for a few weeks.  Other cats in the household can easily be infected.  The good news is that cats that survive an infection from the virus will be relatively safe from reinfection since their immune system will be boosted."
13,The Truth About Cat Endocrine Alopecia,pets," There are many reasons why cats can experience problems with hair loss.  A relatively rare reason for this to occur is because of feline endocrine alopecia.  Vets don't exactly know why this rare skin condition occurs. Whenever it does develop though, your cat's hair will start thinning.  Various areas of the body will be affected by hair loss.  You may notice that these areas appear to be the same on both sides of the body.  Two areas that are most often affected include the rear legs and abdominal region. Certain other medical conditions can mimic the signs caused by feline endocrine alopecia.  To see if your cat is really suffering from this condition, the vet will have to rule out other possible causes of the hair loss first.  Parasites and conditions like ringworm can cause similar signs. In order to make a diagnosis of endocrine alopecia in cats, vets typically look at a sample of hairs under a microscope.  Doing so can help determine at what stage of their growth the hair were broken.  Skin scrapings around the affected area can also help determine what's causing hair loss in your cat.  Fungal infections like ringworm can easily cause signs. A blood sample may also be in order if your vet suspects feline endocrine alopecia to be the problem.  The sample won't be tested in the office though.  A laboratory will need to inspect it to see how the endocrine system is functioning as far as hormones go. As mentioned earlier, vets don't know why cat endocrine alopecia develops.  Hormones like testosterone, estrogen, or thyroid hormone are some of the leading suspects though.  Cats with the condition may need to start a regimen of hormone therapy to deal with it. Cats that are eating foods that they're allergic to may experience spontaneous hair loss.  Therefore, you may need to start your cat on a food trial to see if it helps relieve the signs.  You may need to start feeding your cat a different type of food. Sometimes, feline endocrine alopecia is treated with medications that are designed to grow the hair back.  This isn't always the preferred method of treatment in cats though.  These medications can lead to serious side effects in some felines.  They can be toxic to the liver over time and also cause cardiac problems. Cats may even develop other conditions like diabetes mellitus after taking these medications.  Some even experience changes in their behavior."
14,Information About Chlamydia in Cats,pets," Both bacteria and viruses can cause conjunctivitis in cats.  This condition is known as pink eye, the same thing that can affect dogs, humans, and other animals.  Feline chlamydia results from a bacterial infection.  Cats are usually infected with other viruses along with this disease like herpes virus and calicivirus. Chlamydia in cats usually affects those at the younger or older end of the spectrum.  Those with damaged immune systems or other illness of some sort have an increased risk too.  However, the bacterial infection can cause symptoms in any cat. There is an assortment of ways that feline chlamydia can be transmitted.  The bacteria can be passed via eye discharge, nose secretions, or saliva from infected cats.  Mothers are also capable of transmitting the disease to their kittens while giving birth. You should also know that it's possible chlamydia in cats to be transmitted in indirect ways.  The bacteria can live in bedding, food dishes, and other places and can infect your cat if he comes into contact with them.  Owners can also harbor the bacteria on their hands and pass it along to their felines. Seeing the white of your cat's eyes turn red is one of the primary signs of feline chlamydia.  The eye may also swell, with the third eyelid closing partially.  Discharge that's very watery may also appear from the eyes.  All of this will irritate your cat's eye, causing him to paw at it frequently.  This illness may only cause symptoms in one eye at first.  Eventually though, both eyes will likely experience problems.  As mentioned, chlamydia in cats usually occurs at the same time as other respiratory conditions.  Cats may have a fever, discharge from the nose, coughing, and sneezing if this occurs. Feline chlamydia doesn't usually prove difficult to treat as long as it's mild.  Antibiotics can get rid of the bacteria.  They may be given orally or placed directly in the affected eyes.  The condition can get more problematic though if there are other problems at the same time.  Your cat may have an upper respiratory illness that requires hospitalization. Whenever giving your cat antibiotics to treat any condition, it's vital to go through the entire regimen.  If you don't, then the bacteria you're trying to get rid of may mutate and grow stronger.  If this happens, they may become resistant to the antibiotics. If you have multiple cats in your household, then you'll especially need to be careful with feline chlamydia.  It can easily be transmitted to other cats.  Keep infected cats in seclusion.  Disinfect bedding, food dishes, and other places that can harbor the bacteria.  Also, make sure that you wash your hands thoroughly after you touch the infected cat so that you don't spread it to your other felines."
15,Neighbour's Dog Barking? How to Stop It,pets," At one time or another, most of us have experienced a neighborhood dog that never seems to stop barking. Whether it's working in a garden, having a picnic, or just reading, most people go outdoors to relax, and a barking dog is not a particularly relaxing sound. The Reason Dogs Are Barking The first step in solving the problem, is to realize that, unlike some humans, dogs don't bark just to hear themselves make noise. If a dog is barking, there is usually a reason, and to stop the barking you need to find out what triggers it. Is the dog barking when you, or other people are outside? If that is the case, and you're friendly with your neighbors, you might try to talk to them when they are outside, explain the problem, and ask if it would be possible for them to bring the dog outside. Dogs are quite territorial, and once he or she knows you belong, it won't see you as an intruder, and won't bark when it see's you outside(in theory). The same could be true if you have pets of your own. If neither animal is aggressive it may help to socialize them, or even let them play together if possible. If you don't know your neighbors well, or are hesitant to bring up the subject, you could try leaving a nicely written note on their door. However you decide to proceed, do it rationally, and respectfully, an angry neighbor is the last thing anyone needs. You could end up having a complaint filed against you because your lawn in 2 centimeters higher than the city code allows. Dog Whistles Another thing to try is getting a good dog whistle. Every time the dog barks, give a few short blasts on the whistle. Eventually the dog will associate barking, with the unpleasant noise. There are also products available that attach to your house and emit the same high frequency noise whenever the dog barks. This is the same type of product that you buy to keep unwanted animals out of your yard, it is a high pitched sound that is painless, but annoying to the animal. A word of warning about the whistle or product that you use, try to find out, in an unobtrusive way, if anyone living close has a hearing aid. While you are feeling proud of accomplishing your goal without upsetting the owners of the dog, you could be unknowingly making the slightly grumpy, older gentleman next door, very unhappy (it seems that some hearing aids can also pick up that piercing sound.). How to Complain If none of these things work, you may be forced to call and complain. Do this very carefully, as a last resort, and do it anonymously. People tend to get very irate when they get complaints, even if you have spoken to them about the problem before, and letting them know who complained will just give them a target for their anger. Before you call anyone, look carefully through your city's codes, the noise laws may only apply during certain hours. All in all, the best way to solve your problem is to work with the dog owners and try to keep a peaceful neighborhood. Contacting the authorities going to cause hard feelings, and if your neighbor reacts badly, you could find yourself dealing with something much worse than a noisy dog."
16,When Dog Preparation Training Really is Needed,pets," Dogs can be very sociable. In fact, they sometimes get too sociable and get aggressive. That is why it is important to train the dogs to control their behavior. Moreover, dog trainings are important to avoid dog biting incidents. Statistics show that 77% of dog biting cases are mostly those that are within the family. Hence, with dog training, bad habits are removed and dogs have better control with their feelings and behavior towards environmental and social variables... Dogs can be extremely sociable. In fact, they occasionally get too sociable and get hostile. That is why it is significant to train the dogs to manage their behavior. Moreover, dog trainings are vital to avoid dog biting incidents. Figures show that 77% of dog biting cases are typically those that are within the family. Hence, with dog training, awful habits are removed and dogs have improved control with their feelings and behavior towards environmental and community variables. However, implementing dog guidance is not that easy. Certain things must be employed to boast positive results. The idea needed in dog training is what nearly all experts define as ""positive reinforcement."" This refers to the way people prize their dogs with treats, praises, or fancy dog collars whenever their dogs show optimistic behavior. Through positive reinforcements, dogs will be capable to comprehend that treats and praises will come whenever he shows respectable behavior. For example, when the owner gives his dog a few treats for obediently obeying his commands, the dog will believe that obeying instructions when told equals treats. But this does not essentially mean that when the dog did not comply with the owner's commands, punishment is wanted as counter-reinforcement. This must not be the case because punishments will merely make the matter worst. What will occur is that the dog will be confused and it will start to doubt your feelings. The next thing that humans must keep in mind when training their dogs is that people should stay away from training their dogs into bad habit. Actually, numerous people are not aware they are doing it but there are instances where the people's response towards some behavior of the dogs will unintentionally train the dog in a unpleasant way. For example, when dogs bark, it is ordinary especially when they do that because they see something odd or unfamiliar things. But, when dogs persist to bark, even if it includes a recognizable person, that becomes a crisis. In this case, most people have the preference to yell and tell their dogs to shut it or shut up. This particular response of dog owners will puzzle their dogs and will only make them comprehend that the reason why their masters are yelling is because they also like the shouting prospect and that they are ""barking"" beside with their dogs. The main point here is to steer clear of paying attention to the dog. In time, he will discontinue. It's when the owners should gift their dogs. Boiled down, dog preparation training is all about constructive reinforcements. And, as they say, encouraging reinforcements reap encouraging results."
17,Tips Regarding Tack Storage and Care,pets," Tack cleaning is often the thing most riders dread however it can be a very rewarding process and not necessarily the dreaded chore it is reported to be. The care of the tack is far from just a cosmetic venture. It has varied safety implications for both horse and rider. There is no substitute for well-fitting tack; in fact a poorly fitting saddle can cause untold discomfort to the horse and therefore many problems for the rider. Your tack should always be stored correctly. Saddles should be supported on correctly shaped racks and bridles should be hung untangled on a bracket designed for the purpose. These generally have a domed profile keeping the leather nicely curved. Always avoid hanging a bridle on a single hook as the head piece can become misshapen. Ideally a tack room should be well aired and provide a dry environment but this is not always the reality. The cleaning of the tack can be made easier by employing a few good habits. It is always easier to clean mud and sweat from your tack when it is fresh! You may not feel like it having just returned from your ride but a quick wipe over pending a deep clean saves a lot of graft. Depending on the storage conditions and the frequency of use you can sometimes notice a formation of mildew on the saddle .This is sometimes more evident under flaps and straps or where moisture has become trapped. This is not only unsightly but if left untreated and cleaned can cause damage to the leather if it takes hold. It is not necessary to remove straps and dismantle your tack on a daily basis but it is important to be vigilant in checking the condition of the leather. The leather will be maintained in good condition by a good cleaning routine. The use of a good leather conditioner following a thorough clean will help maintain flexibility in straps, stirrup leathers, and in the bridle preventing pressure on the horses face. Take care with the use of oil as over oiling can make the leather too soft and a bit fluffy reducing the strength of straps etc. Remember cleaning tack is not like washing clothes, and too much water can be damaging to the leather so do not immerse the tack. For synthetic saddles, cleaners are available with particular ingredients suitable for their composition. So happy scrubbing and polishing and remember do it now! Not later, as safety is paramount."
18,Crate Training Benefits - Not just for housebreaking.,pets," Crate Training Benefits #1 - Housebreaking a puppy Puppies have a natural instinct to not soil in their den. This instinct can be used to your advantage for housebreaking. If you leave your puppy in a small room, you'll notice that the room usually has two sides. One side where she plays/rests and the other where she relieves herself. Clearly, a room is too big to take advantage of the ""clean nest"" instinct. The same result can happen in a crate that's too big for your puppy. In this case, your little guy will be resting on one side of the puppy crate and soils on the other. If the puppy is confined to a properly fitted crate, she is likely to ""hold it"" until she is taken outdoors. Crate Training Benefits #2 - Deterring Destructive Habits An untrained puppy should never be allowed to roam free in the house. Leaving him unsupervised in your home puts him and your possessions at risk. Your puppy could encounter dangerous items such as toxic chemicals, toxic plants, electrical cords, fans and medicines. The most common danger I've seen has been when they swallow an everyday item that you would normally deem harmless and it gets stuck in their digestive track. He may make confetti from the Sunday comics or turn your favorite sneakers or the leg of your antique chair into a chewing toy. These bad digging, tearing and chewing habits are difficult to correct once they have started. The best approach to preventing these unwanted behaviors is to confine the puppy. Keep him in his puppy crate with a couple toys when you're away from home. When you are with him at home and he is running around free, it's your job to teach him which items are off limits. Crate Training Benefits #3 - Give your puppy his own space A puppy will easily and happily learn that the crate belongs to him. It's his private place where he can go when he feels tired or grumpy. He can take his favorite toy or chew item there without the family cat or another dog interfering. The crate is also a place of security for the new puppy, giving him a sanctuary when you have unruly children or a friend's incompatible pet visiting. In situations like these, the puppy may go to the crate on his own. You may want to give him a treat in the crate so that he can enjoy himself without being bothered by the visitor. If the puppy crate is wire, you can put a blanket over the top during the visit to ensure privacy. Doing this with a wire crate is recommended for it's strength and because it allows for proper ventilation. If visiting children seem likely to poke about the puppy's crate, simply tell them that your puppy is taking a nap and shouldn't be bothered. Crate Training Benefits #4 - Travel Safety If you need to take your puppy somewhere in your car, a crate is a safe method of confining him. Your puppy could interfere with your driving. Crating allows you to open the windows for ventilation without the risk of him jumping out. It also keeps your car damage and potty free, if you need to leave the parked car for a bit. (Be sure to park in the shade and crack the windows, of course) If you need to leave the puppy at a friend's house, a boarding kennel or a veterinarian's office, his own puppy crate will help to alleviate anxiety he may feel when separated from you and his home. The crate becomes his own portable ""room"" and place of security. If you take your puppy on a vacation, you will find that many motels and hotels permit crate trained puppies, since they cannot damage the room if they are confined. Many families have fenced in enclosures in the rear of their car for their pet. A crate serves the same purpose, but it's also portable and offers a safe, familiar, comforting environment. Crate Training Benefits #5 - Time Out Area A puppy is often overly rambunctious. If a long walk or a play session doesn't calm him down, you may choose to redirect his energy by giving him a toy and puppy crate time out for a short while. A very important rule when crate training is to NEVER let your dog think he is being punished or banished when he is put in the crate. When bringing him to it, be friendly and encouraging to him. You should also give him one or two of his favorite toys. Giving him a treat each time you bring him to the crate is a good practice also. Crate Training Benefits #6 - Give your puppy some flexibility of location Who doesn't love the idea of falling asleep with a super cute puppy and waking up with his cute face right next to you? For many people, this becomes a habit that's hard to break. What's more natural than a den animal sleeping with his pack? If this isn't what you want, there's a way to still allow your puppy to bond with you, in the bedroom, without actually being on your bed. I'm sure by now you've guessed that I'm talking about a dog crate. Let's face it, puppies are a handful. If you have chores to do, most people will keep their puppy in another room. In the crate, he can be safely in the kitchen, while you're chopping food for dinner. Try vacuuming with a puppy in the room and you will understand what I mean. Your puppy will still need training for proper house manners and family etiquette, but using a crate may help you maintain a sense of loving companionship while he learns acceptable behavior. Crate Training Benefits #7 - A safe place to recuperate When your puppy or dog needs to be confined because of illness or injury, a dog crate can really be a blessing. After all, when you're sick, don't you prefer to be in a private, familiar, safe place until you are better? The crate will shield your recuperating friend from other pets, children, or anything that will interfere with him getting a really good rest."

20,Brown Thrashers,pets," Do you ever get that feeling that something is different? Like something has changed? I felt like that recently when I pulled my vehicle up into my driveway. I looked around a little bit trying to figure out what it was. I looked up into some tall bushes that are next to my driveway. I then understood the change. There was a bird I didn’t recognize as the leaves of the bushes camouflaged her. She flew out of the bushes from the other side. I waited quietly for a few minutes. When she came back to the bushes I saw a Brown Thrasher carrying a twig and some moss in her beak. She flew off again. While she was gone I took a closer look at where she was at within the bushes. She was building a nest! I was so excited to have a bird building a nest so close to my home. For the next few days I watched her building her nest. A twig here and some moss there. I looked up into her nest while she was gone and I saw what appeared to be an egg. I didn’t want to get too close to her nest so I didn’t know how many eggs she had laid. While I waited for several days for the grand day to arrive I took lots of pictures and some video of the Brown Thrasher and her nest. A few days had past when I parked my vehicle in my driveway when I noticed a Brown Thrasher feeding 1 baby bird. This made my day as I have never had the opportunity to see a baby bird being fed in its own nest. As I continued to sit in my vehicle I watched both the Brown Thrashers taking turns bringing the baby bird small bugs and worms. Brown Thrashers are found year round in Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina and South Carolina. During some winter months you may find the Brown Thrashers spending time in Maryland and Virginia. On April 6th, 1935 the State of Georgia made the Brown Thrasher the State Bird of Georgia. The Brown Thrashers were chosen because they were seen in Atlanta, Georgia all year long. The Brown Thrasher is the size of the American Robin but they are more slender. They have a long brownish orange tail and wings. Their wings are short and they have white wing bars. The Brown Thrasher’s bill is somewhat curved and thick. Their face is gray and their eyes are yellow. Their under parts are white with heavy brown and black streaking. Both male and female build a cup-shaped nest. They use twigs, grass, bark strips, leaves and roots lined with hair and feathers in low trees, bushes, vines, stumps, brush heaps and even on the ground. The Brown Thrashers eat different types of foods, such as insects, beetles, earthworms, snails, berries, nuts and seeds. They spend lots of time searching for food in dry leaves on the ground, and they can be heard underneath the bushes moving leaf litter with their bills. Female Brown Thrashers lay three to five eggs and incubates them for a period of eleven to fourteen days. The young fledge nine to thirteen days after hatching. Brown Thrasher chicks are very cute when they fledge. They’re very awkward and curious. The pair may raise two or three broods a year, nesting from late March through July. The Brown Thrashers are wonderful mimics and have one of the largest song repertoires of any North American bird. They belong to the same family as the mockingbirds. The differences between them are: Mockingbirds repeat phrases many times and are capable of retaining and reproducing up to 200 different sounds from a variety of subjects. Brown Thrashers are capable of retaining and reproducing up to 3000 different sounds and usually emit the song twice. Two days after this video was taken there was a thunder storm with very strong winds that knocked over a few oak trees. I haven’t seen the birds return to the nest since the storm. The nest was built to withstand these strong winds as the nest is still there in the bushes."

An excessive amount will cause the grass to become colored most commonly to brown or yellow.  This problem is really made much worse if you're using lawn fertilizer that adds additional nitrogen to the soil. The sex of your dog will also affect how much of your grass gets discolored.  Both sexes output urine with similar concentrations of nitrogen and uric acid.  However, males tend to urinate on trees, mailboxes, hydrants, and other objects. This isn't the case with their female counterparts.  Your female dog will squat down and put all of her urine in one spot.  Such a high concentration will dramatically increase the risk of dog urine killing your grass.  There are a few things that you can do to help prevent this problem.

After your dog uses the bathroom, you can use the hose to rinse the area which will go a long ways towards preventing discoloration. As you have already learned, lawn fertilizer contains nitrogen.  If you make use of fertilizer, then make sure that it doesn't contain too much.  With your dog urinating in a fertilized yard, you would most likely have problems with spots appearing.

The main way to avoid this scenario is to erect a fence around your yard.  However, fences won't be able to keep out more agile animals like cats."

11,About Crested Geckos,pets," The Crested Gecko, also known as the New Caledonian Crested Gecko or the Eyelash Gecko is believed to have originated from Southern New Caledonia. It was first described in 1866 by the French zoologist Alphone Guichenot and is also known as Guichenot's Giant Gecko. The species was long believed to be extinct until it was rediscovered in 1994 after a tropical storm revealed it along with several other species in the rain forest. Since their rediscovery in 1994 they have become very popular in the pet trade. Although the exportation of wild Crested Geckos is now outlawed, the species that were imported around the USA and Europe before the ban are the ones that established the breeding lines we know today. The Crested Gecko has an array of different color patterns including yellow, orange, grey, red, brown and many other different shades. They also all carry variable markings, such as blemishes, stripes and spots and the size and position of the crests may vary immensely. All these are naturally occurring and are not specific to any certain family or region of species. It is not rare for offspring of the same clutch to look totally different in pattern and coloration from their parents or siblings. The Crested Gecko is very popular amongst the pet trade worldwide and this is because it comes from cooler climates and therefore prefers cooler temperatures, so replicating the living conditions is not so hard and the cost is very reasonable. During the day they like the temperature around 24oC (75oF) dropping to around 13oC (55oF) at night. Daytime temperatures can mostly be attained without any additional heating or just a tiny heat source. You may want to place a small heat mat in for the cold nights. Temperatures above 30oC (85oF) can cause serious health problems for your gecko. The Crested Gecko generally grows to around 7-10 inches in length, with the male being the larger, so you only need a small enclosure. A vivarium or similar around 18""x 18"" x 24"" would be ideal for a large adult. Put down some humus as the surface. This absorbs water that is sprayed into the terrarium without turning moldy. The enclosure better be quite high rather than wide because the gecko loves to climb. They are arboreal (climbing) lizards and can climb up almost any surface. They also like to climb branches and rocks, so some of these in the enclosure will also help. Remember to set a few hiding and resting places for the Gecko because it will help replicate the natural habitat. They are nocturnal creatures and like to hide during the day. It is advisable to put your lighting on a timer with around 10-12 hours of light per day. The Crested Gecko is omnivorous, which means it eats live creatures and vegetation. A good mixture of soft fruits such as bananas, peaches and apricots plus crickets and locusts make up a good diet. Wax worms and mealworms are also nutritious for them. You can get Gecko food in tins and jars from the pet shops and these are full of the nutrients needed to maintain a healthy diet. Placing a small bowl for your gecko to drink from, spray/mist the rocks and leaves daily as they love to lick the dew from the surfaces. Remember to clean out the enclosure monthly or weekly. Molted skin, feces, old food can cause bacteria to grow rather quickly. The Crested Gecko does not mind being handled and can become very tame, but always handle with care and never grab or pick up a Crested Gecko by its tail. If you do try to grab a gecko by the tail, it will detach its tail from its body as defense mechanism. While this is not fatal for the animal, the tail will not grow back."

13,Fish Disease - Trouble with Ich,pets," ""Ich"" is one of the most common freshwater diseases in fish.  ""Ich"" is caused by the ciliated protozoa, Ichthyophthirius and is a major concern to aquarists and commercial fish producers across the globe.  One of the most concerning aspects of this disease is that it is highly contagious and spreads quickly from one fish to another; furthermore, this disease has a high mortality rate and, if left untreated, may result in 100% mortality rate. ""Ich"" is particularly harmful to the skin and gills and can be identified by small white spots on the skin and/or gills.  These white spots are the result of the parasite burrowing into the skin of the fish to feed.  In addition to the blister-like white spots on the skin and/or gills, your fish may seem sluggish or you may find them scratching themselves on rocks and gravel.  You may also witness your fish bobbing at the top of the aquarium for air as the ""Ich"" infects the gill area. Preventing ""Ich"" from taking hold in your aquarium is crucial to fish health.  Practicing proper quarantine methods before adding new fish to the environment is the first step to prevention.  Maintaining water quality, adding a consistent diet and avoiding temperature swings in the aquarium are all crucial steps to maintaining the health of your aquarium. Treatment of ""Ich"" can be troublesome due to the parasites’ uncommon life cycle.  Water temperature plays a significant role on the parasites’ life cycle and can be leveraged in the treatment of the disease.  While chemical or parasitic treatments of the disease may rid fish of the parasites affecting them, these treatments usually breakdown in the aquarium by the time the second or third generation emerges from cysts left from the first generation.  For this reason, increasing water temperature speeds up the life cycle so fewer treatments may be used. Unlike other fish diseases, any outbreak of ""Ich"" should be treated immediately and aggressively.  Because it is easily introduced into an aquarium, proper quarantine methods, along with a good diet and water quality, should be followed to prevent this horrible disease from affecting your fish.

14,How To Care For Your Betta Fish,pets," Betta fish, or betta splendens (their scientific name), come from a decent sized genus of fish, commonly called Siamese fighting fish.  They are relatively small in size and usually brightly colored.  Bettas are a special kind of fish called a labyrinth fish.  They are typically aggressive fish, and were forced to fight each other for lots of yearsbrutal actions have earned them the title Siamese fighting fish.  For this reason, They are usually happiest when in their own tank. Bettas are relatively small.  The average Bettas barely get to 3 inches long in their lifetime.  Bettas in the fish stores have  vibrant and exotic colors.  These fish are the results of many years of selective breeding.  All have fins that are fairly small, but because of selective breeding some have larger fanned out  fins. For the most part, it's a good idea to keep male bettas separate.  They will battle one another every chance they can if they are together.  This is also true for betta fish of opposing sexes.  Unless you are breeding betta fish – which is really best left for the more seasoned fish keeper, one shouldn't ever keep opposing sex betta fish with each other.  Female bettas are the exception.  With the condition that you have a large enough tank, you can have groups of 3 – 7 females together.  There should also be lots of of places to hide when they are kept together.  However, bettas are able to be be in the same tank as other varieties of fish.  Learn about betta fish compatible tank mates to ensure you choose the right types of  fish. They have a really unique mating system.  The male spreads out his fans and flares his gills to try to arouse the female.  The female will darken in color when she becomes aroused.  A nest of bubbles will be made near the surface by the male. At this point, the female will drop her eggs, so the male can fertilize them.  The male betta will then gather up all the eggs in his mouth and deposit them carefully into the nest of bubbles.  The fertilized eggs will stay in the safety of the nest of bubbles while they hatch and are able to swim on their own. Recognizing their violent attitude, it's no big shock that they are carnivorous fish.  They have upturned mouths and enjoy feeding on the surface of the water.  Mosquito and other insect larvae provides most of their diet in the wild.  If you own a betta, you can find specific food that is called betta pellets.  Betta flakes and pellets are a combination of brine shrimp, shrimp, grains and mosquito larvae.  it is also possible to find frozen foods to feed your betta fish. Many people say that Bettas have a lifespan of only two to three years, yet in a proper fish tank, betta fish can live for as long as seven years.

15,Choosing Horse Food For An Underweight Equine,pets," With winter on its way, it's more important than ever that underweight equines receive the right horse food and put sufficient weight on before the colder weather arrives. This is especially relevant if they are living out, as horses need to be carrying enough fat supplies to keep warm. In fact, horses and ponies that are turned out over winter generally require around 30 percent more energy, in order to remain warm and healthy. If a horse is struggling to put on weight, there are a number of things that need to be checked. Teeth - if there are any sharp edges, these will be uncomfortable and will mean the horse is both reluctant and unable to eat as much horse food as it should be. Poor dental health will also have a negative impact on digestion and feed efficiency. Most equines require an annual visit from the horse dentist. Worming - every horse should be following a carefully thought out worming programme. If there is any chance the horse might be carrying worms, contact a vet to determine the best course of action. ""Wormy"" equines are often lighter in condition as the horse food is providing nutrition to the worms, rather than the horse.Work vs. feed ratio - occasionally, a horse's workload might have been increased but the levels of horse food have remained the same. It can be worth consulting an equine nutritionist or feed company if the horse owner is unsure of the amounts they should be feeding. Disease - if every other cause has been ruled out, the reason behind a horse's weight loss could be more serious than simply increasing the amount of horse food. Always consult a vet if there are any concerns the horse could be ill. If the horse simply requires a little more weight, there are a number of actions that can be taken. If the horse is not living out 24/7, consider giving it more turnout time, preferably on good grazing. If the grazing is not of a high standard or he needs to be stabled, supplement with high-quality hay or haylage. Something else that can help is feeding more of the hard horse food that the horse or pony is already receiving or trying a conditioning horse food. These are designed to put weight on equines and can be highly effective. They are usually high-energy; nutrient-rich horse foods, containing plenty of protein. Most can be fed on their own or as part of an existing diet. A more traditional route is suppling straight horse foods such as boiled barley and linseed. They are both energy dense foods that are efficiently converted into body fat. Do be careful if the horse is fed more of these kinds of horse food though as they can lead to excitability if the horse doesn't receive adequate exercise. On top of the additional horse food and checking the aforementioned health points, do ensure that the horse is well rugged when it is cold and is not put in a position where it will be agitated, such as being grazed away from its companions. Horses will lose weight quickly if they are struggling to keep warm and also if they are stressed."

Your dog should enjoy his training and look forward to it. Remember that dogs have short attention spans, and keep your sessions short accordingly. Give him varied rewards, and don't be stingy. The more you reward your dog the more he will continue the positive behavior. If your dog perceives training as fun, he will listen to you more! Dogs are commonly referred to as ""man's best friend,"" but when they are unruly and untrained they can be a nightmare. The old adage that one cannot teach old dogs new tricks is false, but it is definitely easier to train a puppy. Dogs are ultimately pack animals and it is important for a dog owner to be the leader of that pack. Well trained dogs are happy dogs and dogs that are trained make for happy dog owners. It is a win-win situation. Training your dog takes time, but it starts with house-training and moves onto learning how to walk on a leash. Simple commands such as heel, sit and return are important for any dog's safety. Dog owners can find pet trainers via their local big box pet store or the veterinarian, but it will take a lot of work from the owner regardless. A dog that is well trained makes a happier pet and really happy pet owner. Use the dog's name as much as you can to make sure he pays attention. By using his name all the time in the first month of having our dog, he should associate his name with focusing on you. The name should be short and unique, so that he does not confuse him with everyday language. The way dogs learn is by repeating techniques and being rewarded. You need to demonstrate proper behavior, then work with your dog over time and reward him when he does the right thing. This is the accepted method for teaching a dog a new behavior. You show them using rewards and repetition. You should always keep the tone of training sessions upbeat and positive with lots of praise. Always reward a dog during training sessions. Never use punishments or negative words when training your dog. These methods will result in fear and anxiety which will make training more difficult. Training your dog is one of the most beneficial things you can do for your pet. Teach your dog one command at a time. Tell your dog to sit, and when they do, give them a treat. Once they have mastered one command, you can move on to the next. Training your dog will provide a more peaceful relationship between you and your pet. Your dog will know that you are in command, and listen to what you want them to do. There are a lot of tricks you can teach your dog to do; a common one is training him to hold a toy in his mouth without chewing it. When he does pick up and hold a toy in his mouth, reward him with a treat. After your dog succeeds in mouthing an object a few times, move on to rewarding the dog for picking it up with his mouth. Once he has performed, do your click and then give him a reward. Next, only give him a reward if he holds the toy using his mouth. It is very easy to train some dogs in groups, but some dogs might have personalities that clash, making training them together impossible. If you've been trying to train your dogs together and it isn't working, switch to training them one by one first. After succeeding at individual training, you can work on group training. To train your dog to sit, have him in a standing position and hold a treat in the air. Pass the treat directly above his head, moving your hand behind him. This will cause him to look up as he tries to follow your hand. When a dog does this, it is natural for them to sit. Now that the people who are interested in training their new pet dog have, hopefully, learned some new tricks, they can proceed to pass them along to their pets. Once a dog is on its way to learning, the owner will begin to appreciate the dedication that he or she has shown for doing the right thing for man's best friend."
18,Keys to Establishing an Effective Retail Pet Bird Department,pets," How to Set up a Retail Bird Department or Shop Establishing a top-notch pet bird department isn’t difficult, but it does require a commitment to providing customers with exceptional service, knowledge and products.  Sales are built on relationships, so it is imperative to develop excellent communication skills both in the store and in following up with customers and prospects.  Each employee should be trained in product knowledge and sales techniques to represent your business and effectively maintain customer relationships. Wyld’s Wingdom has developed guidelines for getting a great bird department off the ground and maintaining strong repeat business. A Strong Beginning The greeting your customer receives is one of the most important parts of the retail experience. Whether taking a call from a prospective customer or greeting a walk-in, it is important to give an upbeat and welcoming greeting. ""Good morning! Welcome to (or thank you for calling) –store name–"" followed by ""How can I help you today?"" Asking a walk-in customer ""Can I help you?"" gives them the opportunity to say, ""No, thanks"" or ""I’m just browsing."" Asking how you can help or what the customer is looking for requires an answer that opens the door to conversation and allows you to begin interacting with the customer. You can also ask a walk-in customer if they’ve ever been in your store before. If they say ""yes"" you can welcome them back, which makes them feel valued and reminds them that they’ve done business with you before. If they say ""no"" you can tell them a little bit about how the store is set up and give a little information about yourself, and then ask what they’re looking for. The timing of the greeting is also important. Greet customers immediately so that they feel welcomed and know you are there to answer questions and give advice. Many customers who walk out of a store without buying do so because they feel ignored or like there is no one available to help them. Deliver your greetings with sincerity and warmth and make an effort to get to know the needs of repeat customers and you will see a big difference in customer response. Keep the Conversation Going As a retailer you are a problem-solver for your customers. You provide the solutions to their needs by supplying them with the products they’ve been looking for. That’s great if they actually know what they are looking for and what they need. As a retailer of pet bird supplies, you have a huge bank of knowledge to draw from, to provide customers with the information needed to make more purchases. You know about new products, new discoveries in the world of avian health, food and equipment. You are the expert! As a retailer, you should feel good about sharing your expertise, giving your customers the knowledge and products needed to give their birds what they need for a healthy, happy life. The best way to begin with customers is to engage in conversation. Asking the right questions is the most effective way to assist your customers and increase sales. Find out what they are looking for, and then ask why they want that particular product. This opens the door for the customer to talk more about their situation, their particular bird, and that bird’s needs. Pet bird owners generally enjoy talking about their pet, and your questions about species, housing, diet, activities and habits will provide you with valuable information. This is a great opportunity for you to use your unique avian knowledge and recommend the specific item that best suits their need, as well as additional products that might work well for the customer. Once you build rapport with the customer and are able to make effective recommendations, you increase the chances of future purchases as well as referrals to other bird owners. Staying in Touch – Using Social Media & Email Marketing The opportunity to interact with customers doesn’t end when they leave the store.  Establishing successful customer relationships requires frequent ""touches"". Once you have the interest of a customer or a prospective customer, it’s important to stay in touch with them, reminding them of your business and what makes it special. This is especially effective in retail businesses where you provide customers with products they buy over and over again, such as pet food and supplies. Email marketing and social media are two effective ways of staying in touch with a high volume of prospects and customers while maintaining a personalized feel to the interactions. In order to stay in touch via email marketing, you’ve got to be sure to capture email addresses. If your checkout system is run by computer, make asking for an email address a part of the check-out process in the store. Alternatively, you can keep a stack of information cards near the register and ask customers if they’d like to fill one out and join your email list. Make this question a part of your phone script for prospective customers as well. Let them know that you carry a wide range of products and would like to let them know when you are offering specials or have exciting, new products available. Establishing a Facebook page and Twitter feed is a great way to let customers and bird fanciers know what’s happening in your world. You can build credibility, establish yourself as an expert, highlight new or popular products, and offer followers special deals. For those in your email database, providing a clickable link to your Facebook and Twitter pages in your email updates and asking recipients to ""like"" or follow your business is an effective way to build followers. Provide in-store customers with a card that gives your Facebook, Twitter and webpage addresses, or have it print on every receipt. Ask followers to recommend your pages to their friends, and spread the word through your local Avian club or other community groups. Social media has become a necessity in today’s business world.  Unlike traditional advertising, social media brings a personal edge to your marketing. Through social media, you become more than just a name to your audience; you become a person with whom they can interact. You can engage with your customers and not only brand your business, but build a sense of trust and credibility. When you communicate with your social media audience, you are not only communicating with your followers or fans, but also with your followers’ followers.  The fact that someone ""likes"" or follows you is seen as an endorsement to their connections, allowing you to reach a whole new audience. In addition to these benefits, social media will help you get a pulse on what your customers want. Social media makes it easy for customers to comment and give feedback, allowing you to see what it is that they like, don’t like, want and don’t want. You can use this information to better your service, your products, and in turn, your business. The Latest in Social Media Trends A sure sign of the role social media is taking in marketing is the recent launch of Google Plus for businesses. Similar to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other social media sites, Google Plus offers the advantages of communicating with your customers on a more personal level, getting to know their preferences, and getting a personal endorsement from them. Google Plus has the added advantage of the ""+1"" button, which takes this endorsement to a new level. Google Plus melds together social media, its email system (gmail), AND its search engine so your business gets exposure, not only through your followers, but also through your email contacts AND anyone who sees your website come up in a Google search. If your website is properly encoded for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) purposes and someone does a Google search using your keywords, your website could pop up and that person could see your Google Plus page and ""+1"" it, endorsing it to all of their followers and friends as well as Google itself.  Google states, ""+1’s"" from friends and contacts can be a useful signal to Google when determining the relevance of your page to a user’s query. This is just one of many signals Google may use to determine a page’s relevance and ranking."" What this means is that Google itself is saying that having and using a Google Plus page will help increase your ranking on search engines. While Google Plus is going to be the major contributor to SEO, interacting on all of the different social media sites will benefit your SEO. The algorithms for SEO ranking are changing and are including more and more of the social media postings, so if you want a higher search engine ranking, you will need to establish an active social media presence. Training Your Bird Department Associates Giving your bird department staff the best tools for dealing with a wide range of customers and situations is an effective way to keep customers coming back and reduce staff turnover.  Confident, well-trained employees will appreciate their work environment and pass on their positive feelings to customers. It’s a good idea to develop an employee handbook that outlines policies and procedures.  An employee handbook can address rules, expectations, and the ways in which employees should represent your business and brand.  This is the first step in developing effective retail associates who are reliable and responsible. Developing a training program can save time down the road when bringing new employees on board. Take the time to create your training protocol once, and each new employee will receive the same consistent information on store basics such as opening and closing procedures, cleaning and pet bird care, handling sales and returns, stocking and inventory, and the customer interaction techniques outlined in the previous sections.  The manual can cover greetings, collecting information, assisting customers through conversation, etc. Product knowledge and general bird care knowledge are other areas that will require training for your bird department associates.  If you have birds in your store or department, your employees should be trained on the basic information about the species you carry.  Customers will look to sales associates as the ""experts"", so they should be able to answer questions and provide information about various bird species. Encourage employees to familiarize themselves with inventory, and make educational resources on bird species and care available.  Holding regular meetings or training sessions before or after hours will give you an opportunity to go over popular products and how they can be introduced and explained to customers.  Role playing is another effective way to work through product knowledge and how staff can effectively listen to customers and direct them to the products they need.  Regular meetings will also keep everyone up-to-date on new products, new displays and promotions, and industry news. Consistent mentoring and training of employees can often give staff a sense of ownership and accountability, which ultimately adds to your store’s success."

20,Using Mirrors to Improve Your Horse Riding,pets," Many equestrian disciplines require the horse to work in a certain position or outline such as dressage, western etc. When teaching your horse to work correctly or when learning yourself, it is hard when you are unable to see how it looks and compare this to what it should look like. Many people will video their lessons or schooling sessions then play this back to make alterations for the next session. This is restrictive as it does not allow you to make instant changes and feel the results so you have an ongoing case of trial and error. An ideal solution to this is to have mirrors fitted in your arena or school. By having mirrors in your school it will allow you to check the position of yourself and the horse constantly and improve your performance without the need to have someone on the ground. Mirrors therefore can help with independence and make the rider feel more confident when schooling alone. As a competitor it enables you to see what the judge sees which is especially important in disciplines such as dressage. When learning new movements such as lateral work, the mirrors can help to show you if the horse is in the correct position. When positioned correctly, it will encourage the rider to look up at their reflection as opposed to looking down at the horse. When fitting mirrors it is important to remember that unless fitted correctly and made from sturdy stable materials they could potentially be very dangerous.Â  It is important to purchase them from a reputable company that specialise in mirrors for use with horses, as they will understand that they need to be able to withstand horses potentially hitting or kicking them. When riding your horse in an arena with mirrors for the first time, bear in mind that they do not necessarily know what mirrors are and there is the chance they could be spooked by a horse suddenly appearing alongside them.Â  Allow them time to get used to the idea before attempting any training in front of them. Training is incredibly important if you wish to improve your skills as a rider. The more time spent practicing, the better you will become. With the use of mirrors, your level of training increases as it allows you to actually see where you are doing things right and where you could improve. For those who wish to improve their dressage skills, mirrors can be a very useful addition."

5,How to Care for a Pet Tarantula,pets," Are you considering getting a tarantula?  If so, you may want to read through this article to get a basic idea of the kind of care required to sustain this unconventional, furry pet. The first thing you should know about tarantulas is that there are two main kinds you can keep as pets: burrowing tarantulas and climbing tarantulas. You will alter the environmental setup depending on which kind of tarantula you have. The second thing you must know is which species are good for beginner tarantula owners. There are plenty of great starter tarantulas. A few examples include the Mexican Red-knee, Curly Hair, Common Pink Toe, Costa Rican Stripe Knee, and the Chilean Rose. You'd be well-advised to understand the breed you are buying before you buy it. Certain species of tarantula are better left to experienced owners. Although they are beautiful, species such as the Cobalt Blue and Orange Baboon can be extremely aggressive and possess potentially dangerous venom. Therefore, you should start out with the more amiable breeds. Necessary Equipment: You'll need a small aquarium tank or critter keeper to house the tarantula. The enclosure should be around 3x the leg-span of your tarantula in length, and if it is a burrowing tarantula, twice the leg-span in depth. Since tarantulas can climb the walls of the enclosure, you don't want the walls to be too high for a burrowing tarantula because they can fall and injure themselves. Next you need potting soil or peat moss to use as substrate in the bottom of the tank. Naturally, a burrowing tarantula is going to require deeper substrate than a climbing tarantula. Aim for about 4 inches deep, or use the leg-span of your spider as a rule of thumb. If you happen to own an arboreal(climbing) tarantula, you'll need to get branches and twigs for it to climb. The walls of the container should be quite high for these breeds. Do not use bright lights of any kind around your tarantula. They prefer dimness and darkness. Although they prefer temperatures of 75-85 degrees F., any necessary heating should be done with an under-tank heat pad and not a light. Feeding: Tarantulas are mainly insectivores, although they can also eat small mice and reptiles. Most pet tarantulas are fed a staple diet of crickets. Thankfully you don't need to spend too much money on crickets for a tarantula because they tend to only eat about two or three crickets every 2 weeks. Provide water in a shallow jar lid or bowl. The water source should be no more than an inch deep for an adult spider, and even more shallow for a younger one."
6,Sprint Center Hotel - Tips for Travelling to Missouri with a Dog,pets," While the number of people that bring their pets along on vacation is steadily increasing every year, there are still some roadblocks that you may hit. For example, pets are not allowed in many hotels across the United States.Fortunately, there are many pet friendly places near Kansas City, including quite a few near the Sprint Center. Hotel rules vary, so it's always important to check with the manager ahead of time to ensure that they have rooms that allow pets. In most cases, hotels that welcome pets will openly advertise that they do on their website or brochure. In addition to finding a Sprint Center hotel that allows pets, it's always a good idea to check for dog parks in the area. There are at least several dog parks in close proximity to Kansas City, so it shouldn't be too difficult to find one that's near your hotel. However, don't forget that any public location can potentially transmit unwanted diseases and illnesses to your pet, so make sure that they are up to date on all of their vaccines before leaving for vacation. It's recommended to take your pet in for a routine vet checkup before crossing any state lines if you plan on driving because some check points require proof of an animal's health before they can enter the state. If you plan going to any of the events hosted at the Sprint Center, hotel rooms really aren't a good place for a dog to stay for the entire day. Instead, you may want to consider finding a dog boarding facility that's located in Kansas City so that you don't have to worry about your pet while you're gone. Most boarding places require owners to pay on a per day basis, and many offer outdoor exercise, playtime and treats for their guests. Your Sprint Center hotel will be located next to some really neat outdoor recreation facilities, including several state parks, like Watkins Mill, where you can take your dog out for daily exercise. Don't forget to bring something with you to pick up pet waste, though! Missouri, just like most other states, has local laws that mandate dog owners clean up after their pets. Additionally, it's always a good idea to bring along something that you can give your dog water with if you're planning on staying out for more than thirty minutes. Otherwise, they may become dehydrated, especially if you're visiting the state during the summer months."
7,The Truth about Exotic  Moths,pets," It's a natural sight to view, a butterfly playing on top of fields of flowers and weeds, but explore closer … that delightful creature may not be a butterfly at all!  Most people do not know that there are certain moths that are just as (or even more) brilliant than butterflies.  Both the moth and the butterfly are part of the Lepidoptera insect family and many times when you think you are looking at a butterfly, it is really a moth. For demonstration, the Madagascan Sunset Moth (Chrysiridia Rhipheus) is one of the most astonishing and elegant members of the Lepidoptera family. This moth is native to Madagascar and is heavily sought after by collectors.  whereas these moths are chiefly black, they boast iridescent green, red, blue, copper and yellow markings.  except, in contrast with other moths, the colors of the sunset moth are not pigments but otherwise the result of optical interference.  Many people mistake them for butterflies in that they fly during the day unlike most moths who are night fliers. Another moth native to Madagascar is the Comet Moth (Argema mittrei). This moth is clearly amazing; its wings fluctuate from creamy yellow-green to a more neon appearance of green with a intense red tail.  It is easy to tell the difference between a male and female Comet Moth; the male has a abundantly longer tale, which can reach up to half a foot in length. Unfortunately, by reason of habitat decline; the Comet Moth is now on the endangered species list. The Cinnabar Moth (Tyria Jacobaeae) is also a day flier and is broadly mistaken for a butterfly. It is native to Europe and Asia and has brilliant colored red back wings with a black borderline.  Its forewings are grey and have a red streak towards the front and two red spots on the outer edges. The Cinnabar Moth has now been introduced to North America to better alleviate the outburst of Ragwort. The Luna Moth (Actias Luna) is not a day flier like a good amount of exotic moths but is still broadly mistaken for a butterfly. This moth has pale pastel green wings with blatant eye spots on them.  It is arguably one of the most elegant moths in North America.  Its popularity was highlighted in 1987 when it appeared on a first class United States postage stamp. While the bulk of people know there are many elegant species of butterflies throughout the world, not as many are conscious of the great beauty of the moth.  There are many species of moths that are just as brilliant and beautiful as their relative: the butterfly.  So the next time you see a butterfly fluttering by, take a second look, it just might be a moth."
8,Keep Family Pets Safe During National Water Safety Month,pets," May is National Water Safety Month and it is the time to get the pool ready and review safety precautions for the family.  Pets are often a beloved part of the family, and while parents are usually vigilant about making pool safety a top priority for children, it’s important to remember our pets when it comes to preventing pool accidents and health issues. The Association of Pet Dog Trainers (APDT) makes some sensible recommendations on keeping dogs safe around residential pools.  First, take a look at your yard and pool area with your pup’s safety in mind.  Clearly, having a fence around the pool area is a great way to keep your dog out of the pool when unsupervised, especially if you use a lightweight cover.  If a dog falls into a covered pool he can become disoriented and remain trapped under the cover, resulting in drowning.  APDT recommends keeping a flotation device or life preserver on a long line nearby.  A panicked dog will try to climb onto his rescuer, so it is safer to try to pull him to safety with the flotation device, instead of jumping in yourself. Cats naturally avoid getting wet, so you probably don’t have to worry about your cat leaping into the pool after your retriever.  However, a floating pool alarm will sound if the surface is disturbed and would alert you to the fact that your pet has fallen into the pool.  Secure fencing with a locking gate is a good first step to keeping your pet out of the pool area.  As with children, supervision is key with pets and pools.  In busy households where people are coming and going, a small investment in automatic door closers could prevent your pet from spending unsupervised time outdoors. DCS Pool Barriers in Phoenix, Arizona, manufactures and installs custom pool fencing and their patented Ultra-Glide automatic door closer.  Todd Mattson of DCS says, ""We have found that many homeowners are very concerned about their pets’ safety where the pool is concerned.  We are able to create custom pool barrier solutions based on family and pet needs, as well as what works with a particular property and local safety codes.  Between permanent or removable pool fencing and the Ultra-Glide door closers, we’ve helped numerous pet owners keep their pets safe."" It makes sense to have a well-trained dog when the family is spending time around the pool.  Teach your dog to ""stay"" and to ""wait"" at the edge of the pool before leaping in.  A strong recall is equally important in the pool area when you want your dog to come to you.  Show your dog where the steps are, or use a non-slip ramp if your pool has no steps. If your dog is a breed that’s not really built for swimming (think stocky legs, bully breeds) or is overweight or senior, you may want to consider outfitting him with a lifejacket for his summer dips.  Like humans, dogs don’t always instinctively have great swimming form and may require help learning to use their back legs to make paddling less exhausting.  Supervise your pet when he’s swimming – if you see your pup getting tired, call him out and end the swimming session for the day. Don’t allow your pet to drink chlorinated pool water – keep a water dish nearby.  Remember to rinse your dog after swimming to remove chlorine and other chemicals.  Collars left on a wet dog can cause hot-spots, and keep your eye out for possible ear infections or skin infections caused by moisture.  And, always store your pool chemicals in a safe place where curious pets can’t get to it. This summer do all you can to prevent unwanted pool accidents for pets and people."
9,Does your dog behave aggressively toward other dogs who enter your land?,pets," Dogs are known to be very territorial. If you have a dog, you will know that they frequently mark their space and guard this territory carefully. Although most dogs will act friendly when they are not guarding their territory, once another canine has come into a space they consider their own, they may defend their territory fiercely. A dogs territory is probably be the same legal boundaries that are registered at the local courthouse. Sometimes they may even consider your neighbors territory their responsibility to watch over, possibly even from those who actually live there. In fact, if they mark a certain area during their daily walk, you can expect that they will now consider the marked territory theirs to guard. In fact, if you take your dog to a dog park and they mark that area, they may consider the dog park to be their territory as well. The territory your dog decides to guard may also be quite small, such as their kennel or crate, or the car you drive or just the house and yard where you live. There are some breeds that tend to be much more territorial than others, although any breed is capable of this behavior. This is actually a necessary behavior for dogs living in the wild, but for dogs that are living near humans, the behavior is very undesirable. To help prevent or fix this issue you should make it clear to your dog that the territory is not theirs to guard. You need to assert yourself as the leader of their pack and make it clear that the territory in question belongs to you. Leader of the Pack, a book written by Steve Duno and Nancy Baer, is a great resource for those who want to learn more about how to portray yourself as a pack leader to your dog. Although this does not always work, it will often help with the problem. Keep in mind that it is impossible to explain to your dog using speech why they need to be nice to other dogs in your yard. One of the best ways to avoid conflicts from happening is simply to prevent the situation in the first place. If two dogs are going to meet, be sure that the encounter happens outside each of their own marked territory. Only once it is established that they are playing well with each other should you attempt to bring them both into one of the dog's marked territory. If your yard is not fenced, do not leave your dog alone in it unsupervised. Make sure your dog does not attempt to claim your neighborhood as its territory and prevent it from running freely off your property. Your dog should not be allowed to bark at other dogs from a fenced yard either. This will create bad habits that might be a challenge to break without . Also make sure your dog is not tied or otherwise constrained in an area where there are other dogs. This can be very stressful for a dog. Your dog may become very aggressive in order to try to scare the other dog away. Dogs need space, just like you and me. Follow the wrong path of defining your dogs territory and you will have to work hard to change that incorrect behavior. For this reason, you need to be sure you start out right in terms of defining proper territorial boundaries for your dog."
10,How to Choose the Right Horse Feed for a Child’s First Pony,pets," The moment a child gets their first pony is an incredibly special one. After months of searching, a choice has been made and that perfect first equine partner, the one that ticks all the boxes, has been found. However, it is important to realise that the arrival of the child's new four-legged friend is not the time to start thinking about how to look after him. One of the most important things to think about is the horse feed he will be provided with. Firstly, it's vital to ask the previous owner what the pony has been fed so far. Is there a specific brand or type of horse food that the pony has been eating? A horse's digestive system is very sensitive and doesn't cope well with sudden changes. It is a much better idea to change the horse's diet over gradually. This might mean sticking with what the pony was used to at its last home, and slowly introducing it to whatever diet the new owner has in mind. Be prepared and make sure there is enough hay and feed to give the pony, for when he arrives at his new home. One of the main mistakes novice owners make is feeding too much. While it can be tempting to give a pony an extra scoop of hard feed, especially when he is new to the yard and everyone is trying to help him settle in and bond with his new owners, it is always advisable to feed according to the horse food manufacturer's guidelines. Feed too much and the pony might put on too much weight and the extra energy might have a negative impact on his temperament. Most pony breeds are very hardy and don't need an awful lot of hard feed. In fact, they can be susceptible to painful conditions such as laminitis when they are overfed. Stick to low-energy, high-fibre horse food and plenty of forage. A number of other factors will determine how much food the pony needs to receive. If the child is a beginner rider and will only be doing light hacking and a bit of schooling, he will need much less hard feed than a more active pony that is being used for show jumping and cross-country training. How he is being kept and what the season is will also dictate the amount and energy content of the feed. If a pony is being kept outside 24/7 over winter, he will need more horse food to help him keep warm and to prevent him from losing too much weight. If he is on lush spring grass, a pony will probably need minimal hard food, and might even need to be put on restricted grazing if he is putting on too much extra weight. Buying a child's first pony can be a huge learning curve, with choosing the appropriate horse food being just one of those lessons. Some of the best things a new owner can do is keep it simple, educate themselves as much as possible and never forget that horse food company Help Lines can provide excellent feed management advice."
11,Bringing A Horse Back Into Work: How To Choose The Right Horse Feed,pets," Whether the main focus is show jumping, dressage, eventing or simply hacking around the local fields and tracks, it is important that a horse receives adequate dietary support when it is being brought back into work after time off. They will require different amounts and type of horse feed as the athletic demands on them change. A horse in moderate condition will usually be fed concentrate horse feed and forage in a 50-50 ration. However, if the workload increases, this should change to around 60-40, as horses with a lean body condition will need more energy in their diet. There is a vast variety of horse feed on the market, for all stages of a horse's fitness programme. One of the most cost effective ways of increasing energy intake is through oil, which can be purchased from the local supermarket. As with any new horse feed, introduce it gradually so the horse's digestive system has time to adapt. One thing to bear in mind is not to overdo things. Only increase the horse feed once the animal's workload has stepped up a couple of gears. An overfed horse can quickly become overweight. On top of that, if too much energy is going in, but not enough is being expended, even the calmest horse can become unruly and difficult to handle. Increasing the horse feed too early can also lead to a condition called 'tying up' - a muscular abnormality, which can be caused by too much carbohydrate in the muscle tissues. Alongside the many types of horse feed in the shops, there are a multitude of supplements and added extras. While it is important not to go too overboard, running the risk of upsetting the horse's dietary balance, there are a few supplements that can be beneficial when bringing a horse back into work. If a pre-mixed horse feed is being used, it should already contain the appropriate mix of vitamins and minerals. If straight feeds, such as barley and oats are being used, the horse will require a vitamin and mineral supplement in the horse feed. A joint supplement can be a useful addition to the diet, supporting the body's natural repair mechanisms during training. Electrolytes and a salt lick are also recommended if and when the horse starts doing faster, more strenuous work. As always, forage is a vital part of the horse's diet. Make sure they have access to quality forage at all times, not just when training. A poor batch of dusty, mouldy hay can lead to respiratory problems, making fitness work much more difficult once it is time to bring the horse back into work. If finding good hay is proving a challenge, consider purchasing haylage instead or thoroughly soak the hay that you do have. On top of that, plenty of time out on nicely maintained pasture is not only good for the horse's physical and dietary health, but also helps them mentally, allowing them to take a well earned break from the rigours of being brought back into work again."
12,Alpacas as Pets,pets," Alpacas are domesticated members of the camelid family the others are llamas, camels, guanacos and vicunas. They are native to South America living in the higher altitudes of The Andes, Bolivia, Chile and Peru. Alpacas are kept for their fleece and have been farmed for thousands of years. There are 2 breeds of Alpaca the Huacaya (pronounced wakaya) and Suri. The Suri is not common in the UK and has a fleece which can be compared to dreadlocks which are long and loose. The Huacaya makes up 95% of the world’s Alpaca stock and have a denser and shorter fibre coat. Alpacas grow to around 3 feet high (90cm) measured at the shoulder and adults weigh between 50 to 80kg. At birth an alpaca will weigh around 8 kilos. Baby alpaca are called cria and castrated males are usually referred to as wethers. Alpacas are quite long lived averaging between 15 to 20 years and females can breed for around 12 years with an 11 to 12 months gestation period. There are 22 fleece colours from white to fawn and browns to black with some greys and rose greys. Alpacas as Pets - You need a herd! Alpacas are herd animals and should never be kept alone so you will need room for 3 or 4 as a minimum and should be stocked at a rate of 4 to 6 per acre. You will need land for them but small acreages are sufficient to keep alpacas. They are very hardy animals and but its good to provide an open fronted shelter for them particularly for the summer shade. There is no need for special fencing as alpacas very rarely jump fencing. Sheep fencing of 4 feet high is recommended as the most suitable and avoid barbed wire or electric fencing as this gets caught in their fleece. They are semi-ruminants and eat grass throughout the year. Hay should be provided when grass has become short, particularly in winter. Special alpaca food mixes are available that help the alpacas get vital vitamins and minerals. They only require a small amount each day and you could feed this by hand when keeping alpacas as pets to keep them tame. As with all livestock you need a supply of fresh clean water. Alpacas don’t make a lot of mess as they use dung piles so your animals will go to one part of your paddock from where you can clear this and use as manure. Looking after your Alpacas as Pets Alpacas very rarely get health problems which makes keeping alpacas as pets less expensive than many other animals. They should be wormed and vaccinated twice a year against chlorstridial diseases (soil born bacterial infection such as Black Leg and Tetanus which can prove fatal). Toe nails will need to be trimmed every 2 to 6 months and light coloured alpacas need theirs clipped more often. They need shearing once a year and the fleece can be sold to Alpaca wool users. So keeping alpacas as pets can have a financial benefit. We here at Penrose Products would love to hear from you if you have alpaca fibre to sell. Click Here. With patience alpacas can be trained and reasonably priced courses are available to help you both learn how to train and care for them properly. You can teach them to walk on a halter. They are animals that do not like too much handling and generally do not like their heads or necks to be touched. When you are thinking of keeping alpacas as pets do keep this in mind particularly if you have children that want animals to stroke and cuddle. Alpacas will offer protection from foxes so mixing them with sheep and goats can work well. If you have enough land available keeping alpacas as pets can be fun and rewarding but as with all animals make sure you can care for them properly before you take ownership."
13,The English Bullmastiff,pets," The English Bullmastiffs are a breed of domestic dogs with a solid build and short muzzle.They were originally developed by the British gamekeepers of the 19th century to guard their estates and to immobilize poachers.The English Bullmastiffs are very quiet dogs and they rarely bark. History of The English Bullmastiff Most of the breed experts are of the opinion that the modern day English Bullmastiffs are similar in shape and size to their ancestors.Mastiffs were originally found in Asia and the original ancestors were mostly like the English mastiffs which are extremely tall, muscular and weighed a great deal.The mastiffs were brought from Asia by the Romans who crossed over the Swiss Alps in search of land and for war.Thus the Mastiffs became popular in Europe and many varieties of the Mastiff breed began to grow.The English used them to guard their castles and they were also used as war dogs.Even the nomads used the English Bullmastiffs to guard their camps and they were used as cattle herding and bull baiting dogs.By the 1900s the English Bullmastiffs were nearly extinct in England but they became popular in America and they are the most popular breed. Country of Origin of English Bullmastiff In England the Bullmastiff was bred by crossing the English Mastiff with the Bulldog and such crosses were done even during the 1700s.However, the modern Bullmastiff is a breed of the crosses made during the late 1800s.The speed of the Bulldog was combined with the strength of the Mastiff to make them a very powerful breed of Mastiffs,which were used by wealthy estate owners to chase and fight off the game poachers.Originally English Bullmastiffs were bred with darker coats but the estate owners preferred the lighter coated breed.

14,Stop Dog Chewing - Effective Dog Training Makes A Happier Dog,pets," Dogs do not have the same ability to think as humans do, therefore you should not try to treat your dog as an intellectual equal. You will be greatly disappointed if you think that they can. You should put effort into learning about dog training, just as you expect your dog to do. It is a good idea to get the whole family involved with the training of a new dog or puppy. While they may have a single person working with them regularly, getting everyone involved can enforce that they must always follow the rules and it will make it more consistent. Puppy proof your house to prevent cherished possessions from becoming your puppy's favorite chew toy. Remove items, such as shoes, from the area where you keep your puppy. Many pet stores sell a bitter tasting spray that you can use to keep your puppy from chewing on electrical cords. Remember that most puppies will grow out of this stage. Accidents will happen when a puppy is being potty trained. If your puppy has an accident, clean it up straight away. If you don't clean accidents up quickly, your pet may smell the mess and eliminate in the same spot again. Your local animal store may have numerous products to help eliminate this. Something you could do is put a toy in the dog's mouth and keep it there. Every time he successfully holds onto the toy with his mouth, hit the clicker and proceed by giving him a treat. After a few tries you should allow the dog to pick up the toy on his own. Once he has performed, do your click and then give him a reward. Then move on to only rewarding him for holding the toy or object in his mouth. Dog-proof your home if you know that your dog is prone to chewing and biting everything in sight when the family is out. If you don't want to crate your dog, you will have to act as if there is a baby in the house and remove access to those things that your dog may get into when you're gone. Use the dog's name often when training to ensure that you have their attention. By using his name all the time in the first month of having our dog, he should associate his name with focusing on you. Pick a name that is distinguished and no longer than two syllables. Dogs only have the ability to focus on one thing at a time. After you repeat these cues enough, your dog will learn to focus on you, primarily, as he or she waits for signals. Gradually allow your dog more freedom. A new dog has to earn his freedom around the house. Otherwise, expect housetraining problems and chewing that causes damage, especially with puppies. Close off doors, or use gates to section off rooms or parts of the house. Over time, as they are house broken and learn to listen to commands, allow them more freedom. It is dangerous to put more than one dog together in a close space. The restraints for each dog can become tangled and in an effort to free themselves, they can be injured. If a large dog becomes tangled with a smaller one they could wrap up to the point the airway of the latter is closed off and the dog would die. Dogs have great focus and can focus on one thing, ignoring everything else, until something breaks their attention. With frequent practice, your dog will begin to focus on you and the signals you are giving him instead of other distractions. One of the very first commands you should teach a new puppy is the ""leave it"" command, which tells them to drop an item and step back from it. This simple command will get them to stop chewing on household items or furniture, and can keep them away from dirty or potentially dangerous items outside the home. You will get better results if employ a mixture of treats as a reward for your dog. These treats should be easily distinguishable from the common biscuit variety you may give your dog on a regular basis as special achievements in training merit special edibles in reward. If you give a new dog the freedom to roam your home as he pleases, you are likely going to have some problems. You need to introduce the freedom gradually. It will help to avoid accidents on the carpeting, destructive chewing and getting into the things that they are not supposed to. Crate training is the best way to keep your dog behaved. You want to make sure that you provide your dog a sense of security. When a dog is insecure about their safety, they could lash out with bad behavior. To help both you and your dog, always make sure your dog feels safe. Watch what sort of activities you are encouraging your dog to do. Sometimes we may perform actions with our dog without realizing that we are training them to do something we dislike. If every time your dog chews something up you send him outside, you are teaching him that chewing something up is the key to getting outdoor time. Be careful with the actions you take, especially ones that tend to be consistent practices. Make use of a crate when training your dog. For crate training to be effective, you must make sure to let the dog out frequently. Once properly trained, a dog that has been crate trained is less like to have an accident. After learning some helpful hints on how to get through to your dog and train it to stop dog chewing you simply need to follow what you have learned. After changing your dog's behavior to fit with the tips suggested you can properly train your dog to stop dog chewing."
15,Hypoallergenic Dog Breeds Myth Revealed,pets," We often get asked questions about hypoallergenic dog breeds and which are they and what to look for.. However I try to make it clear that no research has found any such breed and varies dog by dog. What you must understand about dog dander is it's similarity to seasonal allergies and how its affects varies from person to person from dog to dog. So what can you do? My best advice would be to seek a dog that doesn't shed as much as others and see if you are allergic to them. I myself have very bad allergies but seem to have done well with 2 Shih Tzu's and a Great Dane but seriously allergic to Pitbulls. Your next question would be what are some low shedding dog breeds? Here are a few I came up with based on a few of my favorite or popular low shedding dogs that sometimes get referred as hypoallergenic dog breeds (but are not) and doing some research on your own is recommended but from mine here is my top ten. Poodles Shih Tzu Spanish Water Dog Greyhounds Portuguese Water Dog Komondor Yorkies Basenji Irish Water Spaniel Maltese There are way's to reduce allergic reactions from your pets and a few I practice are: bath each dog twice a week, vacuum daily, brush dog hair daily and having dog free rooms. Mix and match to your lifestyle there a quite a few others out there like sprays and bath soap that help reduce allergens just not necessary to my life with dogs. Growing up with dogs helps as well but we all don't so we want to keep in mind of the things that should be considered when deciding to purchase a dog and what allergens you are allergic to. We don't encourage the use of chemicals that can harm our dogs and puppies as they are living creatures and should not be experimented on. I am going to recommend you go to the breeder, rescue or pet shop where you can find your pup and interact with for more than an hour to see if your allergies flare up that way you give yourself a fair chance of knowing if you can with stand that dog breeds allergens. That being said its important to know what dog you are getting to do this trial and always understand dogs and other pets are a responsibility and should not be viewed as an accessory."
16,Destructive Dog Chewing,pets," Most people who have ever owned a dog, especially a puppy, will know how they can easily wreak havoc with their teeth. Whether you own a teething puppy, energetic juvenile or behavioral adult, you may have experienced the damage that destructive dog chewing can cause. Many things can lead to destructive dog chewing, from separation anxiety to a thunderstorm phobia. Some dogs chew out of boredom. Fortunately, there are several things pet owners can do to combat destructive dog chewing in their home. Offer Toys Give your dog an outlet for his chewing problem. Provide several chew toys for your pet that are safe for the chewing habits of the particular breed. Dog toys should have a variety of textures and be of various sizes and shapes to meet the dogs chewing needs. Many dogs enjoy chew toys that also dispense food, such as a Kong, which can be filled with peanut butter, canned dog food, ground raw meats, or other foods to keep the dog busy. Provide a Safe Area When you are not able to supervise your dog, it's ideal to offer a safe place for the dog to rest. Put the dog into a comfortable crate to prevent the dog from causing destruction. Avoid putting the dog in a room behind a door or gate, as this often leads to other forms of destruction, such as clawing the flooring at the base of the door. Chew Spray Many pet owners have success with the use of dog chew sprays. Bitter apple sprays and similar products have been around for a long time and are not harmful to dogs that ingest it. It also does not stain most surfaces. This training tool is easy to use and since it's alcohol-based, it evaporates quickly. Spray the anti-chewing product on the area in which the dog chews most often up to four times per day. Keep dog toys in the same area to direct their attention away from these areas. Destructive dog chewing occurs in all breeds and ages of dogs. It is natural for a dog to chew, but important to have it chew the right items in your home. Dogs require consistent training to stop the destructive behavior. The destructive chewing stage can last for several weeks to several years, but typically ends by the time the dog is two years old. Until then, directing the puppy or dog to appropriate toys and trying other simple methods can help minimize the destruction."
17,Advice And Tips On Handling Puppy Separation Anxiety,pets," Training dogs is very important. Not only will your dog become more friendly and relaxed, but he'll be happier, too! It also helps strengthen the relationship you two have. Appropriately crate training your dog can prevent puppy separation anxiety. Start by allowing the dog to move freely in and out of the kennel. ""Bait"" the kennel with special treats or toys. When the dog is familiar with the kennel, try closing the crate. Allow the dog longer periods of time in the crate with the door closed. As the dog begins to associate the crate with pleasant experiences, and the assurance that you'll return, he'll be happy and comfortable waiting in his ""den,"" while you are away. Dogs with puppy separation anxiety should not sleep in their human's bed. Fido may be warm, but unfortunately, sleeping in bed often causes dogs to build unhealthy, obsessive fixations on their owners. By giving your dog a crate or bed of his own, he will have his own space and learn a little independence. If your dog suffers from puppy separation anxiety, an easy way to train them out of it is to avoid giving them attention immediately before and after you leave. It may seem mean to the dog if you don't say goodbye before you leave, but those long goodbye cuddles just give the dog a chance to get worked up. Crate-training is excellent for dogs with puppy separation anxiety. Crates effectively become safe spaces for nervous dogs. Blankets or dirty laundry that smells like their favorite people can be helpful during the crate-training process. Anxious dogs are also likely to be destructive when their owners are not home. A crate keeps anxious dogs out of harm's way. If your dog suffers from puppy separation anxiety every time you leave, try getting an additional dog. Sometimes, having someone else to play with while you are away, is all that is needed to keep your furry friend happy until you return. Most people find that, with a little bit of dog training, their relationship with their dog improves tremendously. And as you can see, training your dog, while not an intuitive process, IS a much easier process than most people think. So put some of our suggestions into practice, and you'll see for yourself!"

Just to scratch that spot on my back that’s been driving me crazy for the last 4 hours. The seasons mean more to us horses than bright scarves, new windshield wipers, the dreaded swimsuit ordeal and turning the clocks this way and that. As the days get shorter and cooler, our internal switch flips and things start to change inside us. Our coats become thicker and darker – no longer the sleek, flat look of summer and we look bundled up in our own hair. As a California horse and a Thoroughbred, I am spared a wooly mammoth likeness, however it is still an itchy and annoying mess come springtime. Karen, my owner, does her best to help with the shedding – a pumice to pull and scrape the old clumps of fuzz away from my skin, a soft brush to rid me of its prickly presence, and smoothing with my terry towel to regain the plush shine. I often wish people knew about the importance of the seasons and how our lives mimic nature. The exuberant romping in fields during the high-spirited spring of youth, excitement and newness around every tree that is typical for this time of birth. While summer resembles the bursting exhilaration of adulthood, families and careers – relishing the seemingly infinite abundance. As fall enters our lives, we reflect and ripen – perspective and contemplation take precedence. Winter brings an individual acceptance and realization that our significance is dependent on the fulfillment of our personal destiny’s duty. Not some vague general ""meaning of life"" concept removed from reality, but a private culmination of countless small daily choices that produces the worth of our lives. To distract myself from the incessant desire to scratch myself, I hang my whiskered chin over the stall door to watch the world. I take in the fervent activity around me – plump squirrels with stuffed cheeks, bumblebees intently rushing from one spot to another, butterflies and hummingbirds heralding the arrival of yet another blooming bush, and buds that whisper, ""Soon, Lukas, very soon, things will change again.""  Unbelievably another birthday has come and gone. All Thoroughbreds become a year older on January 1st – to keep the age groups easily defined for race conditions, though Karen waits for my actual birthday, January 17th, to celebrate with carrot cake. I try very hard not to think about birthdays and what they mean. The property where I now live is bordered with magnificent towering trees. Not just any kind of trees, Karen tells me, but her favorite, pine trees. It reminds her, she tells me, of a faraway place where she grew up. And almost before I can see it come and go, a look crosses her face that makes me want to cry. According to scientists, the only land mammal that sheds ""real tears"" are elephants; the poor things have it rough, I’ve heard. Dolphins and crocodiles are also given this distinction for water mammals by some accounts. ""Tear duct cleansing"" is what they call what horses do – deeming us not capable of the big five: anger, fear, worry, grief and joy. These are too complex for such simple creatures, it is claimed. Yet, new research shows that fish and even plants experience these to some degree. Aah, the folly of egotistical scientific theories. The only thing that stops me from bawling is Karen. She smiles at me, like she always does, and asks me if I want to go for a walk. Walking with Karen - this is what I live for. Everything about it still thrills me.  And so begins our special game, so touching and familiar it’s almost embarrassing to give the details here. Karen carefully buckles my halter so it doesn’t pinch my skin – the leather so supple and well-fitting. ""Oh, how handsome you are!"" Karen never fails to exclaim as I nod in agreement so I can hear her laugh. A kiss completes the ritual and I feel like a fresh colt again. The first step into the sunshine when I take a huge breath that reaches down to my hooves – even the air is better out here! – celebrates the exploits awaiting us. This trip leads us along the path under the pine trees – a lacy canopy of branches above us and cushiony needles under our feet that make muffled crackling noises as we amble along. Pungent aromas from decades of decomposing layers mingle with the fragrant scent of wild honeysuckle patches climbing on the ancient winding fence. Lost in our thoughts yet still linked together, our steps fall into a matching rhythm and even our breathing follows a similar pattern. Out here on the trail with the breeze to soothe us and the birds serenading lyrically, there is nothing between us and we are recharged once again. Four hawks nest in these trees and they float high above us scanning the fields for meals while calling for each other like children searching for their playmates. If you believe in legends (as all horses do), hawks symbolize strength and vision, and according to Native American lore they represent interconnectedness and reverence for life. Occasionally, we are treated to a fabulous aerial display of sensational swoops and seemingly motionless hovering – straight up and down with dizzying speed, sometimes so close their wings appear to touch and other times in a symmetrical loop balanced to a feather. Often, we notice that their flight has less to do with looking for food than the absolute pure joy of soaring together. When Karen and I are very still, completely absorbed with the spectacular scene, time melts away and we can glimpse into blissful eternity. It was during one of these magical outings that I finally understood birthdays and what they mean. Karen’s love for me has given me a way to see and understand many things, and in the process, I also became more aware of feelings and developed a broader range of emotions and experiences than is typical for most horses. While this deepened bond will no doubt cause much pain upon parting, what will make it easier to bear is the precious closeness we now share and hold dear. Had it not been for our miraculous convergence and unusual combination, birthdays would only mean the passage of time rather than treasuring each and every moment together. The honor and gift of real tears comes from the depths of true love."
20,Guide to Buying Horse Halters,pets," Horse halters are an essential equine accessory, but they are more than just a fashion statement. While horse halters come in a variety of different styles and looks to fit the personality of every horse, and horse enthusiast, their most important job is a functional one.

You can also look for either metal or heat-sealed grommet buckle holes in order to make sure the buckle is securely fastened. Comfort. The horse halter should fit snugly on your horse but should not be too tight. Consider purchasing an adjustable halter so you can make sure to get the right fit when you put it on. To add to your hoses comfort, you can also consider looking for a halter that has either flat or rolled throat straps. When you first purchase a new halter, make sure to watch your horse for any signs of pain or irritation and if your horse seems to react badly, consider a switch to a different halter. Secure Hardware: The strength of the buckles, rings and clasps has a direct impact on whether the halter is built to last and whether it will allow you to safely and easily lead your horse wherever you need to go. Adjustability: Most halters are sized according to a weight-range, so they fit horses of several different weights. In order to make sure your halter fits your horse properly, you should of course get one that is designed to fit your horse's weight. However, to maximize comfort and get the perfect fit, you should make sure it has both an adjustable crown and an adjustable nose band if possible.

1,Clicker Training Your Dog - Tips To Make Your Job Easier,pets," If you have never owned a dog before, the process of clicker training may seem to be an impossible task. There are many different ideas and theories out there, and the sheer amount of information can be overwhelming. Below are just a few tips to assist you in getting started at clicker training your dog effectively. Keep your dog challenged regularly. Quiz him to see if he remembers the commands, even if you're already sure he does. A clicker and a few treats can be a very effective method of training your dog. Because a clicker can be easier for a dog to understand than a voice command, lessons can be quick and productive. Clicker training sessions should not be longer than about fifteen minutes, since dogs do have short attention spans. Dogs will be dogs, so give your dog outlets to work out his canine behaviors. Dogs need a healthy diet too, along with a place to get exercise and lots of stimulation. Using a clicker is helpful in training your dog to learn new behaviors. Clicker training teaches a dog to identify which behaviors produce a reward, often his favorite treat. For example, if you give your dog the command, ""sit"" and he obeys, you click the clicker and he gets a treat. Anytime you hire a professional, you need to look into their background, check references and interview them, and the same is true for a behavior specialist for animals. Many animal behavior specialists have opposing opinions on how to correctly train dogs. Be sure to verify that the trainer you hire has similar ideas as yours, prior to implementing any of their tips. If you are welcoming a guest into your home, give them clear instructions about how to interact with your dog. These kinds of situations are confusing to the dog as he may not understand who is dominate. Your pet may also decide to leap on your guests. Do not tie more than one dog in the same area. The leashes or chains can become intertwined, causing harm to one or more of the dogs. If one dog happens to be much larger than the other, the small dog could get tangled to the point that it could choke to death. Make a point to enjoy your time with your dog while you are clicker training. When you engage in play with your pet, your relationship becomes stronger; your dog will often respond better to you while training because of this enhanced bond. Training may be a fun activity, but it's also good to enjoy your time with your dog. When introducing your dog to another animal, do so slowly and carefully. Weigh the pros and the cons before adopting another pet. For optimal bonding, select a new pet whose personality is similar to that of your current pet. When you are clicker training your dog, be mindful of the time spent in one session. Spending too much time just on one aspect of training will bore your dog and waste your efforts. Keep the lessons down to about 10 minutes or so. When housebreaking your puppy, accidents will happen. Any accidents should be cleaned up as soon as possible to help with the training efforts. Odor from feces or urine can stay in your carpet which will make your dog return to it when it wants to urinate. Visit a good pet shop to find products created especially for odor control. A dog has an inquiring mind and will look at one thing for quite a while until its attention is broken. Once your dog knows his attention command, you will be able to coerce him to ignore almost anything. Use these tips to help you to train the kind of dog you want to share your life with and share with others. Clicker training your dog makes ownership a rewarding experience. You can train your dog yourself or find someone else to do it. The training your dog learns will give him and your family many happy years."
2,Dog Skin Allergies are awful,pets," When people become dog owners, they have a lot of things they need to be aware of. Although dogs look tough, their bodies aren't as tough as they would like it to be. They are easily sickened and when they are ill, they are taken to their vet. Surprisingly, vets say dog skin allergies are the most common reason they see so many dogs in their clinic. Dogs have a very sensitive immune and digestive system. When they are exposed to something that their bodies can't handle, they have an allergic reaction. One of the symptoms of those reactions is when dog skin allergies begin. When a dog has been exposed to something they are allergic to, they begin to have dog skin allergies. This is one of the first signs they are allergic to something. Dogs that are experiencing these reactions often itch mercilessly when they inhale or rub against something they are allergic to. Dogs without relief from the constant itching normally get very moody. Many dog owners don't think that their dog's constant itching is a sign of dog skin allergies. Many tend to overlook it as something that dogs do. When a dog constantly scratches in one place, they are having a reaction to some sort of allergen. Another sign of dog skin allergies are hives. When they are around something they are allergic to, dogs can develop hives. These hives show up on their faces and bodies. In some places, hives can make their hair stand straight up and they can also make a dog's eyelids swell. Another cause of dog skin allergies are insect bites. Sometimes the insects have something that is on their bodies or leave behind a chemical that will irritate the dog. Because the allergy only occurs when they are bitten, it is wise for pet owners to be aware of their dog's behavior when they come in from outside. Dog food can also be the cause of dog skin allergies. With so many ingredients in different dog food, it can be hard to find exactly what they are allergic too. There are different reactions that can happen amongst different dogs but skin allergies are the most common. When skin allergies become an issue, it alerts their owners and veterinarians that there could be something wrong with the food they are eating. With so many things that cause dog skin allergies, dog owners have to be very aware of the way there dogs are behaving. When they see behavior that isn't their normal behavior, it may be an indicator something is wrong. When they are constantly scratching and biting their skin, it is time to take them to their vet."
3,Stop Dog Chewing: Learn How To Have A Well-Trained Dog,pets," Well done! What is the first step that should be taken when introducing your dog to his new home? The right training to stop dog chewing will make both you and your dog happy. These tips will give you all the tools you need to train your pet to stop dog chewing. Make sure that your dog is well prepared for trips to the veterinarian. Gently pass your hands over his entire body, praising him when he responds well. Help him to tolerate the vet handling his paws and mouth. Consider recruiting a friend's help, too. When possible, puppy training to stop dog chewing is the most effective form of dog training. Much like human children, puppies learn faster than adult dogs. The actual process of learning itself is much easier on a younger mind, hence the phrase ""you can't teach an old dog new tricks."" Your dog will carry his good behavior into adulthood. For dogs that chew inappropriately, try a training aid like a liquid that has a strong, bitter taste. Many pet stores sell holistic products that taste terrible to most dogs. Some people choose to steep pepper flakes in water in a spray bottle instead. Either way you choose to go, a bitter or spicy deterrent on furniture, shoes, or other items that you don't want your dog chewing or eating can stop this behavior in its tracks. Unless breeding is in your dog's future, make sure he or she is spayed or neutered before six months of age. Obedience training should be put off until this is done. A spayed or neutered dog is a better pet and a more attentive obedience student. This will make your dog easier to train to stop dog chewing. If you don't want your dog to chew your furniture, making it unpleasant, can help. There are many clear and odor free products on the market that you can put on an item. These products will make the item taste bitter or unpleasant, thereby, deterring your pet from chewing it. Keep your dog up to date with dog training, in order to keep him or her compliant with an established set of rules. People think that just because their dog has been trained once, that is all they need. You can encourage your dog to adopt good habits. This is why on-going training to stop dog chewing is important. Make sure you dog proof your home to reduce chewing or destructive behavior while you are away. Young dogs or bored dogs may chew when left alone just to have something to do. Take the time to close interior doors and put away items dogs like to chew before you leave to limit the opportunities for chewing while you are gone. The first step in training a puppy is to make sure he knows his name. Always refer to your dog by his name, and begin teaching him to come anytime it is called. These should be the primary words your dog needs to learn. By setting aside some special time for you and your puppy, you will give him the opportunity to get to know you, as well as trust you. This way he or she will be more open to some advanced training. It is dangerous to put more than one dog together in a close space. The restraints for each dog can become tangled and in an effort to free themselves, they can be injured. If a large dog becomes tangled with a smaller one they could wrap up to the point the airway of the latter is closed off and the dog would die. Try not to take your stress out on your dog by yelling at it because of your bad day or bad mood. If the dog has done nothing wrong, then it should not be treated as such. Making your dog feel secure enhances his loyalty, which will make for a better trained dog who will want to please you. If they do not feel safe, they may show bad behavior. In order to eliminate this, you should ensure that you put your dog in a safe surrounding. You want to make sure that you provide your dog a sense of security. When a dog is insecure about their safety, they could lash out with bad behavior. To help both you and your dog, always make sure your dog feels safe. Watch what sort of activities you are encouraging your dog to do. Sometimes we may perform actions with our dog without realizing that we are training them to do something we dislike. If every time your dog chews something up you send him outside, you are teaching him that chewing something up is the key to getting outdoor time. Be careful with the actions you take, especially ones that tend to be consistent practices. Make use of a crate when training your dog. For crate training to be effective, you must make sure to let the dog out frequently. Once properly trained, a dog that has been crate trained is less like to have an accident. As previously stated, dogs are trained for many reasons. Dogs are very well known for how much they wish to please those around them, which makes having one trained in that manner a good dog to be around. This article, hopefully, has helped you with some ideas that can make it less of a hassle to train your pet to stop dog chewing."
4,Different Types of Seizures in Dogs,pets," There are few things more frightening than watching your dog have a seizure. Once you realize that your dog has seizures, you may be concerned for their health. However, there are many treatment options available and seizures in dogs do not indicate a life of poor health or a shortened life. Most dogs prone to seizure have a long, healthy life. There are no real definitive answers for why some dogs get seizures. There are some factors that can be considered. Obviously, a dog that has a brain injury or a brain tumor is likely to be more prone to seizures than dogs without brain impairment. There are some breeds that are more prone to seizures than others. Realize, however, that all breeds have been known to have seizures. Seizures fall into one of two broad categories. These categories are focalized seizures and generalized seizures. Generalized seizures affect the entire brain. These seizures tend to be more intense and in some cases the dog can take several days to fully recover from a generalized seizure. Focalized seizures affect a portion of the brain instead of the entire brain. This means that the affect on the brain is less severe than it would be in a generalized seizure, which makes recovery faster. Focalized seizures, for this reason, are sometimes harder to diagnose but they still require medical treatment. In severe cases, your vet may refer you to a veterinary neurologist in order to receive more in depth care for your dog's seizures. This is especially common in cases where the issue is a brain tumor, as neurologists are more qualified to treat a brain tumor. Dogs that have generalized seizures suffer from one of two kinds of seizure. There are major motor seizures, which create a classic epileptic seizure, complete with muscle rigidity and twitching as well as involuntary loosening of the bowels or vocalizations. These are highly traumatic to watch. The other generalized seizure is less dramatic but no less serious. It is called an absence seizure and it results in the dog being still and unresponsive to outside stimuli. Focalized seizures consist of either simple or complex seizures. Simple focalized seizures are when the dog experiences a major motor seizure on a smaller scale, for example, on a single body part or a single side of the body. The complex focalized seizures are seizures that affect the behavioral areas of the brain, causing sudden psychological changes in the dog. Although rare, dogs have been known to become violent during complex focalized seizures. Seizures in dogs are hard to accept but with care and patience, your dog can live a happy and fulfilled life. With medication and attentive care, seizures can be minimized."
5,How Loving Your Pet Can Boost Your Health in 2012,pets," We’re only halfway through January, and you’ve already broken all your New Year’s resolutions. Oh, well. Better luck next year. Don’t give up so easily! As a pet owner, keeping one very important resolution is possible for you: ""I resolve to be more physically and mentally healthy in 2012."" I know. This sounds like a pretty tall order. But by loving your pet and being good to her health and well being, you can in turn be good to your own health, too. How’s that for a win-win situation? Here are three steps to loving your pet for her and your health’s sake in 2012. How Your Pet Benefits: An active pet is a happy, healthy pet! Inactive cats and dogs can quickly become obese. And just like people, obese pets easily develop problems like diabetes, heart disease, and other health dangers. These facts are pretty alarming when you consider that an estimated 54% of dogs and cats in the US are overweight. How You Benefit: When you get your pet active, you become active, too. Once you’re committed to your pet’s health needs, her health becomes your motivation to keep your own ambitious health resolutions. This means that when the familiar ""I-don’t-feel-like-walking"" feeling hits, your pet’s ecstatically wagging tail and ""Let’s-go-walking!"" sounds will inspire you to get into your jogging shoes. Need a bit more of a push in the right direction? My last post highlighted Project Pet Slimdown, a new weight-management program for you and your pet. Why not sign up for it today and let us know what you think in the Reply section below! How Your Pet Benefits: Your pet loves being loved. Besides keeping her physically active, keep her happy by petting her, teaching her new tricks, or by just being playful with her. When dogs and cats don’t get enough attention, they often become board. The result? Depression, clawing, chewing, digging, excessive barking or meowing, and other negative behaviors. Pet birds often resort to feather plucking and aggression when neglected. How You Benefit: Did you know that spending 30 minutes with your dog or cat can increase your production of serotonin? That’s good news for you because serotonin is a chemical associated with well-being. Studies have also suggested that pet owners have lower blood pressure than people who don’t own pets. So to boost your mood and reduce your mental stress this year, prescribe yourself some quality time with the one who’s always there for you. How Your Pet Benefits: You’ve heard the horror stories of pets getting dangerously ill from eating things they shouldn’t. Why not show your pet how much you love her by keeping fewer pet-dangerous items in your home? Some of the things that are very bad for cats and dogs include: Tobacco smoke Chocolate Alcohol Sugary foods and drinks Caffeine Salt How You Benefit: To truly bond with your pet, the two of you can cut back on unhealthy foods together. Let your love for her be an added motivational push to cut back on things that are bad for her and for you. Imagine yourself at the end of 2012 being able to say to your pet, ""I quit smoking, and I did it for us both!"""

8,Simple Pet Supplies,pets," When you get a new pet, you're also agreeing to purchase the accessories that go with it. There are almost endless pet supplies on the market and depending on what kind of animal you have, you might have tons of options and be unsure which you actually need. Fish are some of the simplest pets in terms of maintenance and supplies. There are different kinds of fish and they require different kinds of care. A betta fish requires nothing beyond a bowl of water. Other fish might require a filter or an aerator. Some fish also need a heater in order to keep the water in the tank within a specific temperature. There are some that require places to hide and you will need to get some plants or other hiding places. Cats require food and water bowls, as well as a scratching post or toy that allows them to scratch, unless they are de-clawed. They need to be able to scratch to wear down their claws, and it is imperative that you give them a way to do so. They also need a litter box, although cats that are both indoor and outdoor cats frequently use the bathroom outside. Anything else you get for the cat is a matter of personal preference. Some cats enjoy climbing toys or beds, but most are happy using your furniture for that purpose. Dogs require more than most other animals. Dogs will require, at a minimum, a collar and leash as well as a food and water bowl. However, dogs frequently do not use the furniture for their beds and therefore will also need a bed or something soft to lie on. Depending on the breed of the dog and the climate in your area, they might also need sweaters or jackets in the winter months, or portable water bowls in the summer months to get them through their longer walks. In addition, dogs will also need to have some grooming as part of their routine. Cats groom themselves, but you will have to bathe your dog yourself. You'll have to find a shampoo that is formulated for dogs. There are several distinct varieties of shampoo available. Some shampoos are designed to help with flea issues. Others are designed to help dogs that have sensitive skin. Dogs with white or light colored fur do best with shampoos that are designed to prevent dinginess in their fur. Choosing the pet supplies you need can be simple if you keep it basic."
9,"Dog Training Advice... Don't let your pet be the ""BAD"" dog on the block",pets," Dog Training Advice: Understanding your dog's behavior Have you ever tried to understand why dogs behave the way they do? Well here at dog training advice we will do our best to explain. Dogs are social animals with a high intelligence level. However, their behavior and views are very different from that of humans. The first thing a good dog trainer should do is try to understand the reason for the dog's peculiar behavior, whether it is barking, biting, jumping or dog aggression. If you want good dog training advice to train your dog effectively, it is necessary that you develop a strong bond with your pet. In addition to care and affection, dogs need to experience a sense of belonging. Dog training is a two way process wherein you have to respect your dog and in turn win his respect and confidence as a leader. Punishment and scolding is not the key. The best dog training advice is to encourage and reward your dog for his good behavior. Short training sessions can be taken up regularly. Once your dog grows to love the tasks, you can increase the session time. Dog Training Advice: Dealing with dog behavioral problems Jumping is a common dog behavior. It is their way of greeting others and showing their excitement. However, this behavior is not always welcome and can even scare some of your visitors, especially the little ones. Jumping is something you should correct as a puppy. If you have full grown pet, you can hold its paws every time it jumps up. Dogs don't like it and the jumps will automatically reduce over time. It is really frustrating to deal with a dog that is constantly whining, howling or barking. There are different reasons for excessive barking. Here are some dog training advice suggestions. Your dog may be lonely, bored, frustrated, anxious, over excited or simple seeking attention. If it's only attention seeking, then you can get your dog to be quiet by interacting with him. If he is too lonely, get him another doggy companion or a few playthings that he could chew on in your absence. Avoid tying your dog alone in the yard. It will make him boisterous. Have you noticed that your pet has started digging too many holes in your yard? Dog training advice states that lack of supervision and correction is one of the main reasons for digging. You can limit him to dog proof areas in the house or reserve a particular place for digging. Learn to say a stern ""No"" if this habit gets uncontrollable."

11,Who knew that they made so much stuff for dogs?,pets," I just visited a website that sold dog supplies. For fun, I decided to see how many different types of dog supplies this huge site carried and was blown away from the sheer volume of goods. The very first items on the list were 99 products for training and bark control. Here's a sampling of what I found: ultrasonic training aid - whatever that is. One was shaped like an egg. They also carried ""no chew"" sprays, sprays to keep your dog in, out, up, down or otherwise, products to keep your dog from barking and a treat bag that look suspiciously like a fanny pack. The website featured 187 beds and throws. The one that cost the most was ""The Refined Canine Outdoor Dog Chaise Lounger."" At first glance this looks cute and tasteful. It is only 38 inches wide, 26 inches deep and 21.5 inches high. It comes with bedding that is six inches thick. The price was only three hundred and nine dollars. It was available online only. I found out more about stain, clean up and odor than I cared to know. The website features 126 products including a yard odor eliminator, a ""spring breeze"" scented stain remover and my favorite, ""the Furminator"" accessory for your vacuum cleaner. Worst of the bunch was the covers for your furniture. These are made to protect your furniture but they look ugly and don't teach the dog to stay off the couch. Of the 331 harnesses, collars and leashes, I thought that the ""Hartman & Rose Haute Couture Collection Leather Dog Collar"" was overpriced at $149.99. However, it was said to be ""the highest quality canine attire"" and made of bone leather. It featured a smokey topaz octagon surrounded by clear crystal and 22 karat gold polish. Ms. Martha Stewart herself has her own ""line"" of dog clothing. Hideous examples that dogs will hate to wear include the pink ruffle tank and the cutie dress. Really? How can Martha endorse these products with a straight face? I say, go back to cooking. You'll find tons of dog toys online as well. These items include the tennis balls that are probably less expensive at a sports store and Christmas-themed toys. What dog is going to know the difference between his ""ordinary, any day of the year toy"" and a ""seasonal"" toy? You'll find 150 of these products on the site. Happy hunting. Saving the best for last is the gravestones for your diseased dog. One has a saying that says, ""If love could have saved you, you would have lived forever."" Really? Still if you are in need of dog supplies, this is your store."
12,So...this is where the pets go,pets," I had my first visit to a large chain pet store last weekend. Boy, was it an experience. Not only did the store offer cat and dog supplies, it had items from just about any pet you could imagine. From the moment I entered through the door, I knew I had entered another world. This wasn't a pet store for people who like their pets. This was a pet store for people who LOVE their pets. At first glance, it looked they had set up a salad bar near the entrance. Wrong. It was a ""treat bar"" for dogs. All types of meat flavored treats in every kind of shape imaginable. I had a dog once. He didn't care what shape his meat-flavored treat came in and I doubt that he would have appreciated the fact that it couldn't be have been purchased at a treat bar. For a pet store, I was surprised that they didn't sell puppies or kittens. Just birds, fish and rodents of every size and shape - much like the dog treat bar. I thought for a moment that it could have been a treat bar for cats, but decided against it. Venturing on, I came across what appeared to be a bulk cat litter section. A very big sand box with a giant scoop. I wasn't sure if you were to bring in your own bucket or what. Finally, just around the corner I found the cat food I was looking for. I had no idea how many companies made cat food nor why one store would need to carry them all. I grabbed by twenty five pound bag and moved on. The next row over was the dog  food isle and next to that, dog supplies. I was amazed not only by the number of dog beds that they made available for purchase, but by the sheer variety of such beds. Fleece beds, berber beds, outdoor beds, indoor beds, pads, mats, heated dog beds, princess bed, memory foam...a memory foam bed starting at $159! My old dog used to sleep on my grandmothers old coat and he thought it was great. Guess he didn't know what he was missing. Suddenly I began to wonder. Where were all the people? This was a very big store that allowed pets to bring their people with them. Instead of seeing little old ladies with small pooches stuffed in their purses, but all I found was one large dog on a leash. I guess I could have brought my cats here. I wondered how many people did that. I suspect not many. As I walked toward the counter to pay for my cat food, I came across a photographer setting ups shop. I guess getting your picture taken with your dog or guinea pig was bigger than just Christmas now. Somehow I missed the memo. Finally I made it to the front counter. The woman behind the counter looked more annoyed with me than anything else. She looked like the type that treasured her pet relationships over her friends. She wasn't friendly, but adequate and made sure to take my money just fine. The next time I need cat food, I think I will miss this venture altogether and stick with my local grocery store. Amazing. It was my first time AND last time I shopped there."
13,Choosing a Dog Shampoo,pets," As a dog owner, one of the more unpleasant recurring tasks in your life is the requirement to bathe your dog. Depending on your breed and the amount of outdoor time your dog has, this can happen as frequently as once a week, which makes the shampoo you choose to use on your dog extremely important. The pet store likely has an entire aisle of dog shampoos that can be difficult to choose from. You might begin to feel a bit overwhelmed with the large selection of seemingly similar shampoos but there are differences between them and the shampoo you choose will have serious effects on the way your dog looks. If your dog has fleas or has a tendency to pick up fleas when he romps outdoors, you'll probably want to get a flea killing shampoo. These can be a bit more difficult to use than other kinds of shampoos because in order to get the full flea killing effect, you need to leave the lather on your dog for several minutes. If you've ever been responsible for keeping a dog still in a tub for several minutes, you know how hard that can be. Some dogs, on the other hand, have dry, itchy, sensitive skin and normal shampoos can aggravate those conditions and make the dog uncomfortable and unattractive. For this situation, you can purchase a dog shampoo that soothes the skin of the dog and moisturizes the skin to keep it from becoming flaky. These shampoos tend to have more natural ingredients and less chemicals. If your dog is white or cream colored, you'll need to get a shampoo designed for light colored dogs. This is because dogs that have light colored fur tend to get dingy, especially when they spend a lot of time outdoors. They need a whitening shampoo to keep them from becoming too dingy. Long haired dogs have a tendency towards knots and tangles and there are shampoos that are designed to help prevent and reduce the amount of tangling in the dog's fur, which can save you valuable time when you're brushing your dog. If your dog lacks any of those issues, you can get a basic simple shampoo without any special ingredients. There are countless simple shampoos and you can choose any of those if your dog has no special issues and you can choose whichever shampoo you like and fits your budget. There are many different kinds of dog shampoo and you need to take into consideration the needs of your dog when you're choosing which to purchase and use."
14,Buying a Dog Bed,pets," When you get a dog, one of the first things you're likely to purchase after the food and water bowls is a dog bed. Dogs need a comfortable place to sleep and are less likely to sleep on your sofa, and for larger dogs, that might not even be feasible. Choosing from the many kinds of dog beds available might seem difficult, but it can be done. Most people buy a dog bed from a pet store. Some grocery stores even stock dog beds. This is a perfectly fine place to buy a dog bed. The first and most important thing to consider when you're shopping for a dog bed is the size of the dog. If you have a puppy, you should also consider the size the dog will become. Some people choose to buy a puppy sized bed when the dog is a puppy and then a bigger bed when the dog outgrows the puppy bed. This is not the best idea for a couple of reasons. First, your dog is going to be attached to his bed and will be upset when you remove it, and second, that plan requires you to buy multiple dog beds. There are many different styles of dog beds but some are more common than others. One of the most frequently seen styles is a two sided dog bed. In this situation, one side of the dog bed will have fabric and the other side will have fleece. You can either let the dog try both sides to see which texture he prefers or you can use the fleece side for winter and the fabric side for summer. There are also those that get beds that are thin, almost the equivalent of a folded blanket. This allows for more flexibility as it is easier to transport but it is not ideal if it's placed directly on top of a hard floor, like tile or hardwoods. There are some dog beds that come with raised sides, which create a bit of a den-like feel for the dog. This is great for dogs that want to be enclosed and prefer dens as their resting place. You can make this more pronounced by placing the bed inside a kennel or a crate to make it more enclosed. There are other dogs that deeply resist kennels, crates and cages in any form, and for those dogs it is important to get a flat bed where they can see around it. This is most common in dogs that have spent time in shelters. Dog beds come in many varieties and the kind that you choose depends entirely on your preferences and the preferences of your dog. You may end up trying a few beds before you find one that suits your dog and your home, but it is important to dogs to have comfortable places to rest."

16,Top 10 Reasons for Buying Pre-Drilled Aquarium,pets," I will highlight the top 10 reasons for getting your new aquarium pre-drilled vs. an over the tank set-up using a wet/dry sump system. You do not have to worry about which size and how many U tubes you will need for your overflow box(s).  In an Over The Tank Wet / Dry System (OTT-W/D-S) there is an overflow box inside the tank and a pre-filter box on the outside of the tank with a drain tube going down to your sump.  To get the water from inside the overflow box to the pre-filter box you use U tubes.  There are different sizes and shapes of U tubes and each size has a different flow rate.  In the pre-drilled tank there is a filter column inside the tank, no need for U tubes. There is no worry about bubbles in U tube(s) or starting the siphon flow.  To get the water to start flowing from overflow to pre-filter box you need to put water inside the pre-filter box and then suck or evacuate the air out of the U tube to start the water flow.  If you do not get all the bubbles out, the flow will be restricted and possibly cause your system to not function properly.  Also, while in use, you have to make sure no air bubbles are collecting in the U tube as this can cause a system failure.  If there are bubbles in the tube you have to evacuate them somehow.  In a pre-drilled tank the overflow is built into the column inside the tank, no U tubes requiring intervention to evacuate air and no bubbles to watch. There is no outside pre-filter box so tank can be moved closer to the wall giving you more space in your room.  As stated earlier in the OTT-W/D-System there is an outside box which can be anywhere from 3 inches square to 6 inches square.  Thus you need to have at least that much room from the back of the tank to the wall, plus 1 inch for cleaning and adjusting the box when system is outside of the tank.  In a pre-drilled tank, the drain and return flow tubes are inside the filter column so the tank can be as close to wall as you need or want. The overall appearance of the tank is cleaner from inside the tank, to the top or glass canopy, allowing a better seal over the entire top of the tank.  With the OTT-W/D Systems you can not completely cover the overflow box inside the tank, occasionally the glass canopy top has to be modified or water level lowered to allow for the overflow box to sit in the tank and have glass canopy on tank.   In a pre-drilled tank the filter columns are inside the tank and glass canopy top can cover the entire tank for less heat loss and water evaporation, also less risk for escape and injury of your aquatic pets. Less dead space in tank.  Overflow boxes only draw from the top of the tanks, making dead spaces in the tank.  This can create areas where the water does not move and debris builds up.   Pre-drilled tanks have the filter column that draws water from the top, middle and bottom of the tank, thus helping eliminate dead spaces. Water returns are inside of the filter column.  In the OTT-W/D System the return water flow from the sump is outside the tank and usually hung on the side of the tank either with a directional or water bar sprayer.  The hose clamps and plumbing outside the tank can have sharp edges and if bumped can leak or cause damage.  In a pre-drilled system the returns are inside the filter column and therefore safely located inside the tank. Filter adjustments are minimal.  In the over the tank system you have to adjust the 2 boxes for several variables.  One is for the water level inside the tank, height of overflow box, the distance the bottom of pre-filter box is from the back of tank.  There may be others to have your system at optimal flow rates.  In a pre-drilled tank the filter column has no adjustments, the only adjustment is how much water you want to have standing in the back column, drain tube height. Safer for large fish.  The overflow box inside the tank can sometimes be knocked off or dislodged by large fish and can cause the flow to either stop or become too great for the sump pump to handle and cause failure.  In a pre-drilled tank there are no filter parts outside of the filter column and cannot become dislodged. Drains are more secure.  On OTT-W/D Systems the drains come out from the bottom of the pre-filter.  If all the boxes and U tubes are not at optimum settings then the flow will be affected.  In pre-drilled tanks the drain is in the bottom of the tank and no adjustments are necessary. Do not lose siphon during power outages or disruptions, no water mess to clean up.  In OTT-W/D Systems if power is disrupted and your return flow siphon break hole is clogged or not there, or your overflow box is not adjusted correctly, your tank water level could be affected and cause too much water to empty out of your tank and into your sump, risking possibly overfilling the sump and causing water damage to surroundings.  In pre-drilled tanks there is no siphon break or overflow box to adjust."
17,"Your Pets Need Good Dental Care, Too!",pets," Did you know that February is National Pet Dental Health Month? Pet Dental Health Month is an initiative of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) to encourage pet owners to practice good oral care for cats and dogs. Why Practice Good Oral Care for Your Pets?
According to an AVMA press release, ""It is estimated that 80 percent of people brush their teeth every day, but far fewer pet owners do the same for their pets. Pet Dental Health Month, celebrated every February, teaches pet owners that proper dental hygiene is equally as important for their pets."" The AVMA also reports that ""periodontal disease is the most commonly diagnosed problem in dogs and cats. This can lead to painful infections of the mouth, and in severe cases these infections can spread and become life-threatening conditions."" What Are Some Signs of Oral Problems in Your Pet? Dogs:
The ASPCA lists the following six signs that your dog may have a problem in her mouth or gastrointestinal system and should be checked by a veterinarian: Bad breath Excessive drooling Inflamed gums Tumors in the gums Cysts under the tongue Loose teeth Cats:
Again according to the ASPCA, you should watch for any of the following signs that could indicate problems in your cat's mouth: Dark red line along the gums Red and swollen gums Ulcers on gums or tongue Loose teeth Pus Difficulty chewing food Excessive drooling Excessive pawing at the mouth area How Do You Brush Your Dog's Teeth?
You'll need a toothbrush made for dogs or a piece of soft gauze to wrap around your finger. You'll also need toothpaste made for dogs. (Toothpaste made for people can irritate a dog's stomach.) The ASPCA instructs dog owners to: Place the toothbrush or your gauze-wrapped finger at a 45-degree angle to the teeth and clean in small, circular motions. Work on one area of your dog's mouth at a time, lifting her lip as necessary. The side of the tooth that touches the cheek usually has the most tartar, and giving a final downward stroke can help to remove it. If your dog resists having the inner surfaces of her teeth cleaned, don't fight it—only a small amount of tartar accumulates there. Once you get the technique down, go for a brushing two or three times a week. How Do You Brush Your Cat's Teeth?
You'll need cotton swabs, a toothbrush made for cats, and toothpaste made for cats. The ASPCA instructs cat owners to: First get your cat used to the idea of having her teeth brushed. Start by gently massaging her gums with your fingers or touching a cotton swab to them. After a few sessions, put a little bit of cat-formulated toothpaste on her lips to get her used to the taste. Next, introduce a toothbrush designed especially for cats—it will be smaller than human toothbrushes and have softer bristles. Toothbrushes that you can wear over your finger are also available and allow you to give a nice massage to your cat's gums. Finally, apply the toothpaste to her teeth for a gentle brushing. A veterinary exam beforehand may be helpful to find out if your cat's gums are inflamed. Many cats have mild gingivitis and brushing too hard can hurt their gums. Want more information?

18,How To Add A Cat to Your Dog-Friendly Household,pets," It’s a common misconception that dogs and cats can’t live under the same roof harmoniously. Some pet owners have even avoided adding a cat to their family because they assumed their cat and dog would…well… ""fight like cats and dogs."" But by being patient and properly introducing them, your pets – whatever their species! – can become lifelong friends. If you’re soon to become a cat-and-dog household, here are 10 tips to help you start their relationship off right: When you bring your pet home for the first time, have the right mindset. Don’t get discouraged if your pets don’t become the best of friends over night. It’s important to realize that they’ll most likely need some time to get to know each other. Let your pets become familiar with each other’s scents before they meet for the first time. Put your cat’s blanket (or any object that’s been in contact with your cat) near your dog for a day or two, and vice versa. When they meet face-to-face, there will at least be a familiar scent between the two. When you first introduce your pets, your cat should be at your dog’s eye level. Keep your dog on her leash when she’s meeting your cat for the first time. As with all our friends in the animal kingdom, it’s hard to tell how your pets will react when they see each other for the first time. Always play it safe! Keep a firm (and loving) grip on your pets as they meet. This will help make them feel comfortable and secure. It’s possible for some posturing to take place when they first meet, and they may make a lot of noise at each other. This is normal. If things start getting too aggressive, separate them into different areas of the house. Patience is key! They may not take to each other at the first attempt, so don’t get discouraged too fast. After they meet, make sure it’s easy for your cat to get away from your dog whenever she feels stressed or threatened. Providing a small cat door she can easily escape through is one example. In fact, allowing each pet to have a location to call her own will be helpful for when they just want to retreat and get away from it all. Your pets should feel relaxed while eating. To prevent them from feeling defensive against the other with their food, let them eat in separate places at first. Let your dog hang out with another family member in a separate room for a half hour or so to give your cat a chance to safely explore your home by herself. You may want to do this daily, until both pets are familiar and happy with each other. It’s crucial to praise your dog when she exhibits good behavior with your cat (i.e., when she doesn’t bark or chase her.) Consistently rewarding her with a treat will go a long way!"

20,Animal Dental Care,pets," Did you know that good dental care can add years to the life of your pet? 80% of dogs, cats and ferrets have some form of dental disease by the age of 3. Since there are many health problems associated with dental disease, it is in everyone's best interest to practice good dental preventative care. It can take just minutes to prolong the quality and length of your pet's life. The most common problem associated with dental disease is pain from gum and tooth root infections which contribute to bad breath and tooth loss. You may only notice bad breath but dental disease in not something that happens over night. Since it can be a gradual process your pet may actually be used to the tooth pain and discomfort from dental disease. One of the most common comments after a pet with severe dental disease has a dental cleaning is that their pet has wonderful breath and seems so much more comfortable and happy! With dental disease bacteria from the mouth enters the bloodstream and causes havoc with internal organ systems. The bacteria lands on heart valves and causes heart failure. As the body fights the bacteria in the blood stream the body mounts an immune response, forming clumps of immune complexes that clog the filtering system of the kidneys damaging the kidneys causing kidney failure. Any chronic inflammation in the body can cause irritation to the liver. Liver disease contributes to decrease appetite, vomiting, and stomach and intestinal upset. Eventually inflammation of the liver, also known as hepatitis, or liver failure occurs. The bacteria from the dental disease can also seed the throat and trachea causing a chronic cough and exercise intolerance. If these infections are left untreated you can see permanent damage. Another scenario from the spread of bacteria are abscesses of the bone around the tooth root. This infection can cause a hole between the mouth and the nose called a fistula. This is very painful and often requires surgical intervention to help your pet recover. That's enough bad news. Here's the good news, YOU CAN HELP PREVENT DENTAL DISEASE IN YOUR PET! Preventative dental care is very effective. Some things are beyond your control, such as genetics, your pet's natural chemistry, breed and chewing habits. You can start with your veterinarian. During an basic exam your veterinarian can visualize the teeth and help you determine what will be necessary for your pet's dental health. Your veterinarian can show you how to brush your pet's teeth. Brushing your pet's teeth is fast and fairly easy, plus it is the most effective step toward dental health. Unfortunately only 6% of pet owners will CONSISTENTLY brush their pet's teeth. You need to brush your pet's teeth at least 3 times a week to be effective. The next best thing is flushing the mouth/teeth with oral rinses to kill bacteria in the mouth. Often these products contain zinc, which helps combat plaque and tarter, and odor eliminators to improve breath. The oral flushes can be additives for your pet's drinking water or they can be spritzed directly on the gums and teeth. Less effective, but still effective, are edible chews or chew toys. Anything your pet chews will help but many products at the pet store or your veterinarians office will contain enzymes to help kill bacteria in the mouth. There are even special diets formulated that help your pet with special ""fiber matrixes"" and enzymes to shear and rub the teeth and kill the bacteria in the mouth. One other product that needs to be mentioned is a product called Oravet. Oravet is a waxy substance that you smear onto the teeth once weekly. This product helps the bacteria and saliva (plaque) to slide off the teeth, the means less build up of plaque which means less tarter. Using this product alone can decrease plaque and tarter build up by 40-60% in a year. If you chose to do any of the above you will help improve your pet's dental health. The more you do, the better your pet's teeth. None of these preventative steps take very long. After you and your pet get into the habit, it can actually be a special bonding time to help improve the relationship between you and your pet with the additive benefit of improved dental health."

1,What You Need To Know About Yorkies For Sale,pets," Yorkies are members of classic and proud breeds of dogs and are among the initial breeds to become registered using the AKC. Yorkie dog breeders have for a long time been trying to perfect their Yorkies to the stage where they really are perfect little show dogs. Still despite their size Yorkies will come to be rather brave and loyal buddies. Before you begin searching around for Yorkie young puppies available, you need to discover more details about these little bundles of pleasure. As the Yorkie is really a rather small dog, it may still pack an enjoyable experience and excitement into that small frame. You will see that most Yorkies available include an extremely small mind that feels flat on top. For the nose, you'll find so that it is rather muzzled and never too large or not big enough. The tail of the Yorkie is sort of medium long and is commonly transported over the back for more often than not. The fine, glossy coat is among the most noticeable options that come with any Yorkie available. It's their coat which makes them appear so irresistible if you notice them at the local pet shop. Your hair around the mind of the Yorkie can occasionally get beyond control. Although some Yorkie proprietors decide to trim your hair on top of the Yorkie mind, other dog proprietors simply gather your hair in certain type of band or bow. In either case, you need to try to make certain your hair is not failing out on your house. One factor if you notice concerning the various Yorkies available is they don't appear to understand how small they're when in comparison with other dogs. Should you place a Yorkie alongside a threatening dog of the bigger size, the Yorkie would certainly not down again. Although this may appear like an optimistic trait to possess inside a pet and companion, it may really turn to cause more damage than good. Your dog must realize when it's over-matched up, but you've still got to admire the bravery from the Yorkie when they're outmatched by another animal or dog. Possibly it's their clever character which makes them think they are able to win any fight, but you can be certain that the Yorkie will guard you at each chance they get. Yorkies are extremely loyal pets, to ensure that is one thing you need to anticipate when you're searching through Yorkies available. Anybody who's accustomed to bigger creatures need and take time to realize the variations in treatment from a large dog, like a Lab, along with a Yorkie. A Yorkie requires smaller amount maintenance and can really help you save some cash over time on food and toys. From the crate towards the goodies could be more compact if you have a Yorkie that is always a general change in the best direction."
2,How To Choose The Healthiest Dog Food,pets," Several recent stories about dogs falling ill from dog treats have been leading some pet owners to wonder what to look for in dog-food labels. It's hard enough choosing healthy foods for yourself, let alone for your pet. To echo the sentiments of an article from pets.webmd.com, Pet store aisles are lined with dozens of brands of dog food. There's dry food, canned food, and semi-moist food. Then there are all the labels: natural, holistic, super-premium, organic. How do you know which one is right for your dog? Here are a few tips for dog owners who want to provide the very best ingredients for their pets. Don't Equate Price With Quality To start with, it's important to note that pricy doesn't always mean better. The pets.webmd.com article quotes Joseph Wakshlag, DVM, PhD, as saying: ""I've seen 'all-natural, holistic' dog foods that perform really poorly in dogs, and I've seen some dog foods that you might not want to feed your dog, that perform better. I don't think you get what you pay for."" Don't Equate ""Holistic"" Or ""All Natural"" With ""High Quality"" According to the pets.webmd.com article, ""Holistic,"" ""premium,"" and ""super-premium"" are merely marketing terms. There are no official definitions for them. And ""natural"" means only that the product contains no synthetic ingredients. So, if price and marketing terminology are not good indicators of the best dog food, what should pet owners look for? Healthy Ingredients A recent article in Modern Dog Magazine reveals many useful secrets to choosing healthy dog food. It states that you should be able to tell what type of meat was used in the dog food:      A higher quality dog food will clearly identify the source of the meat (e.g., chicken, lamb, duck, etc.) or the source of the fat (e.g., poultry fat, soybean oil, etc.) as opposed to just listing ""meat"" or ""fat."" A few other highlights from the article are: The Modern Dog Magazine article also addresses other important dog-food issues, such as weather or not dogs should avoid wheat, good fats vs. bad fat, tinned food vs. dry food, and fiber vs. filler. We highly recommend taking a few moments to read the article in its entirety. Finally, when reading dog food labels, keep this warning from Petco in mind: Be aware that the ingredients are listed in the order of their weight in the food, so the first ingredients listed may not be the primary ingredients. The first ingredient may be meat, but if the next several ingredients are cereal, it may not be a meat-based food. The total of all those ingredients may well surpass the meat content of the food, making it a cereal-based food."
3,Benefits of Grain Free Dog Foods,pets," When people bring home a puppy, it takes time to get used to having the puppy in the home. Over time, people forget that the puppy is a pet; they come to think of the puppy as a part of the family. When it comes to keeping their dog healthy, pet owners want the best. One of the best diet options available is actually a grain free dog food. Grain free dog food is simply a dog food that doesn't contain any corn and wheat products. Many people are surprised to find that dogs have a large problem with digesting grains. When it a dog has food containing grains, it is stressful to their systems and eating a grain free diet is a lot less stressful. Most pet supply stores have a variation of a grain free dog food available on their shelves. It can come in the form of a kibble. This is one of the most common types available. There is little preparation for the dog to eat it, just pour and serve. There are also freeze dried portions. These can come in the form of nuggets or pellets. These form of the food needs to be rehydrated before serving. Grain free dog food can also be found in a frozen form. This variation can be found with fruits and veggies added or just a meat variation. Pet owners find that grain free dog food is a food that is rich in protein. A protein rich diet is not a diet that is good for all dogs, especially aging dogs. It is a great diet for dogs that get a lot of exercise, working or competition dogs especially. For dogs that don't get a lot of exercise, this diet can cause an increase in weight and not recommended. Introducing a dog to a grain free dog food is something that should be done gradually. This is a major change in diet and can cause some upset stomach and diarrhea in dogs. Experts recommend that for the first week, 1/4th of the grain free food should be mixed in with 3/4ths of regular dog food. Each week, the owner should increase that until by 1/4th until it's all grain free. Complete introduction should take 1 month. The cost of grain free dog food sometimes comes as a shock to pet owners that want to switch to this type of food. The reason for this increase in price is because the ingredients used to make a grain free food is not cheap. These ingredients are premium, quality ingredients and the cost to make the food is passed to the pet owners. The cost to make a grain filled pet food is less expensive because of the ingredients. To incorporate grain and corn in a dog food isn't very expensive so the cost savings are passed along to the pet owners. The difference is because of the ingredients. There are many pet owners that believe that a grain free dog food is worth the extra money that is spent. The benefits of using this dog food have been reported as additional energy, better looking skin and shinier coats of hair. Pet owners also report their dogs experience less stools and fewer allergies. All these benefits help to increase their dog's quality of life as well as prolong their good health. A grain free dog food can interest people for many different reasons. Before a dog's diet is switched to something completely different, pet owners should speak with their veterinarian to make sure it's a diet that is best for their dog. They should also make sure that a grain free dog food is going to give their dog all the nutrients they need to live a long and healthy life."
4,Start Breeding Your Personal Chickens!,pets," Are you thinking about in commencing or raising one's own backyard garden chickens? Don't know where to begin and you just might need some help with developing your hen house. In many countries they make reference to Chicken Coops as Chicken Pens as well as in other places they think of it basically chicken houses, chicken pens, bird farming and breeding chickens.   No matter what the phrase you utilize, hen house, pen house or chicken coop is not important to the chooks who reside in it. Your feathered friends who are taking good care of humanity for years call it ""o nice home"" and usually you'll get among the best nutritious of meals humanity can get with a live chicken. The thing is my friend, hens are seriously worth more to you when they are alive and laying eggs as opposed to being roasted or dead. Some great benefits of using a chicken coop over-shadow it's disadvantages in a number of ways.   I would say the greatest benefit anyone will get through garden chickens certainly is the top quality organic eggs. You see the actual eggs that your birds lay down will be more wholesome as opposed to those within markets or grocery stores. The chickens a person raises tend to be more natural and organic, are totally free range and much less prone to illnesses. They are not confined into little cages and usually tend to live healthy life and are fed the very best grains along with leftover important home foods. The particular eggs from these chickens contain more proteins and vitamins and minerals compared to those received from other suppliers.  They offer any family members with real foods which in-turn allow you to lead a healthy existence. There are many quality recipes for cooking along with eggs. Backyard chickens can be a joy to own as a result. They substitute one the need to keep a puppy or a cat instead. Backyard hen chickens make good pets on top of that. Despite the fact that they may not be as wise as dogs and cats they can indeed be a pleasure to have in a back garden. Your kitchen and living area in your home stays clean. You can make use of any bird droppings in many ways as plant foods to grow wholesome green veggies. Vegetables and fruits really like environmentally friendly chicken droppings. Giving your family along with backyard hen eggs If you have far more eggs than you could possibly eat then you could start thinking about offering them in your good friends.   I do believe they will also take advantage of eating refreshing and healthy eggs for breakfast.   When you are not feeding your young ones with healthy and balanced, clean and organic eggs in that case you aren't doing justice to your loved ones. Consume good food in your life. Every day life is too short to have sickness in the household. Living healthy ultimately prevents one from being forced to visit a doctor. Finest medicine is taking in natural food.  Your body needs to have fresh and clean natural and organic meals you know you can provide. Household with a back garden can certainly obtain the most of healthy living. In case you have a house along with a backyard then you should look at having your hen pen.   I actually believe when you can put a nail and hammer in to wood then you can certainly begin to build your personal chicken coop with material you should buy from your garden hardware store. It is typically inexpensive to make your individual chicken house with a decent quality hen house blueprints and plans."
5,Holistic Dog Food Benefits,pets," There are many dog owners that are concerned about what their furry family members eat. When it comes to a question of how their food affects their health, many are finding that holistic dog food is their best option. They only want the best for their pets. All natural ingredients are what mainly make up holistic dog food. This is a dog food that doesn't have any added artificial preservatives, flavorings or fillers. When a person looks at this food, it isn't about the cost or how long it will last. The main concern is about the effects on their pet's health. When manufacturers make holistic dog food, they use some of the best quality ingredients available. Many of these foods are actually human grade foods. There are no fillers used in processing this food. With the lack of artificial ingredients and the processing, dog food that is produced is very high quality. Because of the ingredients that are used and the processing methods, holistic dog food is found to be very rich in nutrients. Many people find that this nutrient dense food is all that is needed to give their dog great health. With all the nutrients being very easily absorbed and digested, the difference in the dog is easily noticed. One difference that pet owners see is that their dogs begin to produce fewer stools. They are producing fewer stools because holistic dog food is made up things that a dog's body needs, nothing that isn't. There are not many wasted ingredients in this dog food. When this food is digested and the nutrients are absorbed, there isn't much waste that is left. With the absence of artificial flavors, preservatives and colors, many pet owners are noticing that their dogs have fewer allergy problems. The popular commercial dog foods contain things that irritate a dog's delicate body and when it is removed, their health is restored. Pet owners find that this is a constant benefit when their dog continues eating holistic dog food. The cost of holistic dog food isn't something that stops many dog owners from buying it. They feel that the cost of the food is offset by the lowered cost of vet bills and fewer medicines that have to be bought for their beloved dogs. Many people feel see their pet's health is improved dramatically and state that the cost of the dog food is worth the benefits it is giving their pet. As time goes by, people stop looking at their dogs as pets. They begin to look at them as a member of the family. As with any other family members, they only want the best for them. Many families look at their dog's diet and see the benefits of feeding them holistic dog food. When they see the benefits eating this food brings, they feel justified in their decision."
6,Excellence Found with Organic Dog Food,pets," There are many dog foods that are on the market for pet owners. With the different ingredients, they offer a host of different benefits to help improve the life of a beloved pet. Organic dog food is one of the most popular types of dog food available. With so many people changing their diet to an organic diet, it is reasonable they would change their dog's food to an organic dog food. The benefits that are reported in a human's organic diet have been reported to be found in a dog's organic diet. All these benefits can be a great thing for a pet, increasing their quality of life. An organic dog food is made with ingredients that have not been treated with preservatives, pesticides, hormones and antibiotics. In order to have a USDA's National Organic program seal, it has to be made with 95% of their ingredients organically grown or cultivated. Those dog foods are some of the best on the market for people interested in an organic diet for their pet. Organic dog food has been reported to be very gentle on a dog's body. Most of the ingredients in the food are organic and it is free from the artificial colors and preservatives that can be hard for their bodies to digest. With the organic foods being so simple instead of complex, a dog's body has an easier time to process it. This causes a reaction within their bodies and the results are amazing to their owners. Many pet owners state that after beginning an organic dog food diet their dog had an increase in energy. An organic meal will only provide an animal with the necessary nutrients they need for a healthy life. There is nothing extra their bodies have to expand energy processing. With the extra energy, many dogs become more active and exercise more. Many pet owners have reported their pets have had a significant change in their immune system as well. The nutrients that are in an organic dog food are enough to restore and balance their dog's internal resistance to sickness. There are also pet owners that say their dogs are experiencing fewer digestive problems when they began the organic dog food. This is a relief for many because their dogs are no longer experiencing an upset stomach or diarrhea after eating. These and other digestive problems seem to stop once the organic food has become a part of their everyday lives. No matter what a family's belief is about organic and non-organic foods, the decision to change their pet's diet should be based on nutritional value. Responsible pet owners should speak with their vet to make sure these foods will provide the necessary nutrients their dogs need. As long as their pet is compatible to the diet and provides their essential dietary needs, organic dog food is a food that many animals enjoy."
7,Cancer In Pets,pets," Imagine being at your veterinarian’s office because your furry friend is feeling a little under the weather. You’re expecting a fairly benign diagnosis, perhaps a viral infection requiring a few days of antibiotics and your pet will feel in the pink again. Then the veterinarian comes into the examination room and tells you the tests came back positive for cancer. Naturally you are in shock, after all cancer is a frightening disease that can bring up a lot of confusing emotional responses. Along with all of the feelings you are experiencing you are also faced with a number of decisions about types of treatments, financing those treatments, and care after treatment, it can all be quite overwhelming. Once the initial shock has worn off you will find that a diagnosis of cancer is not a hopeless death sentence for your pet. Though there are many types of cancer, about one hundred specific types, it is a relatively treatable disease. It is, in fact, the most curable of all of the chronic diseases our pets may acquire. If the disease is diagnosed early there are many treatment options available. There are advanced therapies available and new ones being developed all of the time and often times our pets will respond to these treatments quite well. What should you do if your pet has been diagnosed with cancer? First, you need to understand what you are dealing with so educating yourself about the disease is an important first step. Having a knowledge and understanding of the disease will help you in making decisions about your pets’ treatment. This will also make the disease less frightening and give you a sense of control over the situation. The word cancer is a very general term. It references any disease where cells reproduce out of control. For reasons that are not fully understood the genetic coding in cells that tells them when to stop dividing fails and the cells reproduce at an accelerated rate forming a large mass of cancer cells called a tumor. The problem that arises then is that this tumor can interfere with normal bodily functions and can damage other healthy cells. If the cancer cells continue to reproduce they can spread, or metastasize, to other areas of the body. Each type of cancer is a different type of disease and creates it own unique set of problems, also different types of cancer respond to different types of treatments. Therefore, it is vital that you know and understand the type of cancer your pet has and how it is treated. When seeking out information about your pets’ cancer there are several resources at your disposal. The most powerful and readily accessible of these is your Veterinarian. Ask them to explain any aspects of disease or treatment options that you may not understand. They are there to help both you and your pet through this situation. Ask if they have any pamphlets or other written information that you may have, read it several times and be certain to write down any questions that may come to mind when you are away from the veterinarian’s office. Of course, there is a considerable amount of information available online as well. The Internet can be a marvelous resource. You can search for forums and support groups of people who have either had a pet with cancer or help care for pets with cancer. However, as fantastic a resource as the web can be you must be cautious about believing medical advice offered there. It can be difficult to ascertain the qualifications of the advisor or the validity of the information. Always double-check your facts with your veterinarian before making any decisions about your pets’ treatment. Another source of information is the library; even with today’s technology it is still an excellent resource. There you can find books on cancer in general or cancer in animals. Also the librarian can help you find information about organizations that may be of help to you in better understanding your pets’ illness or local support groups. While having an understanding and working knowledge of the disease affecting your pet is valuable, the most important question pet parents have is ""How do we treat my pets’ cancer?""  The answer to this question is dependent on several variables in each situation. Each pet is unique and each type of cancer has its own characteristics, which dictate the type of treatment for that cancer. Besides the type of cancer your pet may have some other considerations in choosing the determining the best treatment are pets’ age as well as their general health. While there are many different types of treatments for cancer the three most commonly used are, surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. If a tumor can be removed without damaging other vital organs or tissue your veterinarian may recommend that the tumor be surgically removed. However there are instances where the tumor may be too large or has spread and to try to surgically remove it would endanger the animal. There are also times when the animal may be too weak to withstand the stresses of anesthesia or surgery. In those cases chemotherapy may be an option. With chemotherapy toxic chemicals are introduced into the body through intravenous methods. These chemicals are meant to kill the out of control cancer cells while leaving the healthy cells undamaged. Generally our pets tend to respond to chemotherapy much better than we do and more often than not are spared the unpleasant side affects that people often experience such as nausea and hair loss. With radiation therapy the cancer is bombarded with high doses of radiation.  This radiation can be delivered with a narrow beam aimed directly at the tumor or with radioactive implants placed next to the tumor. Along with the more common treatments there are many alternative types of therapies. Some of these therapies would be considered new medical treatments such as gene therapy, which tries to repair the flawed DNA in the cancer cells, or cryosurgery where the tumor is frozen using liquid nitrogen. Other therapies fall under the category of complimentary therapies such as massage, herbal supplements, and acupuncture. There are many people involved in the treatment of your pets’ cancer, the veterinarian themselves, veterinary technicians, pathologists, and veterinary surgeons. Along with all of these professionals you may also have friends and family to help with care after the treatments and moral support. No matter how many people are involved with your pets’ treatment and recovery you are the most important part of the equation. The best medicine for your pet is your love and attention. Keep them close by as you perform daily activities like watching television. Your touch is important so be sure to pet them often or set aside time to gently brush their fur. This will help your pet feel safe and secure and keep them emotionally happy which will aid in their healing as much as any treatment. The time you spend with your pet should be treasured because no matter what the future brings the memories you make with your best friend are yours too keep for a lifetime."
8,Betta Fish Care: Proven Tips for Avoiding Betta Fish Diseases,pets," As they say, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  And truer words were never spoken when it comes to betta fish diseases.  Because it is so much easier to keep your finny friends healthy and happy than it is to cure them of what ails them.  Assuming of course you can even figure out what ails them to begin with. Sadly there are many betta fish owners who are struggling with keeping their charges in the pink so to speak.  While for some keeping their fish alive for longer than a few months is proving easier said than done.  Again this is often because many do not know what to look for when it comes to diseases that bettas are prone to. But a lot of this grief for you and your fish can be avoided it you'll but follow a few common sense rules.  They are relatively simple to understand.  And following them can go a long way to keeping your fish healthy. So rather than get into all the ailments that can strike your fish, let's see if we can't help you avoid all that unpleasantness by taking a closer look at what steps to take to keep your fish healthy in the first place. Rule#1: Keep the water pristine at all times. Rule#2: Keep the water temperature tropical. Rule#3: Do not overfeed your bettas or risk violating Rule Number 1. Noww if you read anything about betta fish care you'll soon come across the words ""regular water changes"".  This applies whether you keep your fish in a gallon bowl, (not recommended) or a 20 gallon tank.  You see, betta fish need water quality that is a cut above.  Ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates all can build up.  And when they do the fish suffers. And a suffering fish is more apt to become a sick fish. This is why you want to change the water your prized crowntail occupies to keep the levels of those toxins to a minimum.  Zero is the target reading for those pollutants.  And you get there and keep it there by taking water out of the tank and replacing it with fresh. Oh and while we're on the topic of water ditch any notions you have that distilled water is best.  It's not. Zero minerals do not a healthy betta make.  So stick with conditioned or aged tap water. Your fish will be ""betta off"" pardon the play on words when you do. Next you want to remember that halfmoon bettas are tropical fish.  They need water that is consistently kept around 80 degrees F or so.  That's hard to do without a heater.  Even harder still to do if you insist on keeping your fish in a tiny bowl.  Not only will higher temps be more comfortable for your fish, they'll keep parasites that thrive in lower temps at bay.  Leaving you less health issues to worry about. It also helps to remember that all tropical fish are consummate beggars.  Bettas are no exception.  They can easily convince you they are starving.  And who doesn't like to feel good by giving those flashing fins a treat?  Problem is when the treats aren't all eaten you are just contributing to water problems.  Not to mention the risk of overfeeding and all that entails.  So the way to your fish's heart isn't through their stomach.  It's by taking the high road to health and only feeding what they need, not what they think they want. There are few things as fulfilling as seeing a healthy betta fish recognize and greet you when you enter the room.  Remember these three rules and you too can enjoy that feeling for years to come."
9,Puppy Pampering,pets," Leaving a dog home alone during vacation is always an ordeal for everyone involved. You need to find a trusted friend who has enough time to come over and care for your dog, make sure that said friend can cater to your dog’s specific dietary and playtime needs, you need to convince the kids that the pet will be fine on his own, and you constantly worry in the back of your head about what the house will look like when you get home. Did the dog get out enough, or are there mystery puddles somewhere in the house? Did the dog get too bored and decide that your sofa could use some ""antiquing""? All this and more contributes to the desire to just bring the dog with you on vacation, which can easily present an entire new host of problems, especially if you had been planning on staying in a hotel, most of which do not allow pets. That being said, a middle ground is easier to find nowadays than ever. While you could put your dog in a kennel which are generally run by capable, compassionate people, there are places where you can ensure your dog is getting as much of a vacation as you: the aptly named dog hotel. A dog hotel function a lot like kennels in that they provide room and board to your pooch while you’re out of town, and cater to your specific instructions as to dietary and medical needs. The difference is that these hotels do so in a rigorously dedicated fashion. Not only do they provide all of the above listed services, they also go so far as to offer things like fitness programs, training, and grooming. Furthermore, the problem I mentioned earlier about assuring the kids that your pup would be fine while you were out of town? Many of them take care of that too, offering live-streaming webcam footage of your dog whenever you want to check in on him or her. The amenities your dog are provided are also generally much more cheery and conducive to a happy dog than the stacked wire crates of a kennel. Dogs are often provided their own pillows and blankets, a carpeted floor, and much more room to move around than the tiny enclosures you’re used to seeing for pet boarding. Does it really count as a vacation if you have to spend the whole time stressing about whether or not one of your loved ones is safe and happy? Granted it’s not (for most people) like leaving the kids behind, but these dog hotels offer such a host of great services for your pup, it’s hard not to be impressed. Of course this level of care does come at something of a premium, but search around for some coupons and you might find yourself seriously considering putting your doggy up in this lap of luxury at a dog hotel.

10,Man’s Best Friend,pets," There’s a lot to be said for the loyalty and companionship of dogs. Even if you live with a loving family, it’s possible that nobody is as excited for you to walk through the door after a hard day’s work as your faithful pooch. You also may have noticed that when you’re sick or having a bad day, nobody goes out of their way to keep you company like a dog. This is because dogs are very good at picking up on body language cues and adapting their behavior to them; while scientifically speaking they may not ""know"" you’re sick, they certainly know that something is off. It’s easy to forget all this however because they are so faithful. Dogs are kind of underappreciated for the amount of affection they give; if you live by yourself, you come home to your dog and he or she is happy to see you and gives you all the love you can handle, despite the fact that you’re going to leave him for eight hours, again, tomorrow. So what’s to be done? Does anything have to be? I mean, after all, it’s just a dog. Puppy Services will not be showing up just because you left your dog home alone all day with nobody to play with. That being said, this is less of a practical matter and more one of simple ethics. For all a dog does for you from keeping you company when you’re sick, to statistically lowering your blood pressure, doesn’t he or she deserve a little bit of a kickback? Yes, I know you feed them, pet them, and maybe let them up on the sofa if your significant other isn’t around, but does this really make up for the fact that they’re alone for fully half of the time when you’re not asleep? Luckily, there are alternatives; dog daycare is taking up a big spot in industry as people begin to respect their faithful companions. Not only do dogs get to interact with other dogs (something extremely important to dog psychology that might not happen very often depending on how busy you are) they get a human to cater to their needs. Even if you have more than one dog and you think: ""Oh, they’ll just entertain each other,"" there’s still the question of what would happen if one of the dogs got dangerously sick while you were at work. Could the other dog drive him to the vet? Putting your dog in another human’s hands while you’re at work is really the only humane option; remember, though dogs may have been domesticated a long way since then, their ancestors are wolves, pack animals that rely on each other. Even if it is no longer for the purpose of hunting, their communal needs are often not met sitting at home alone. Dog daycare is a burgeoning market as people come to see their pets as codependent creatures rather than mere possessions. Caring for a dog involves more than food and trips to the vet, they should be nurtured as the friends that they are."

12,What to Expect from A Pet Sitter,pets," The love of our pets is a well know aspect of family life and having them taken care of while we work or vacation has become a big industry. With dog walkers, doggie day cares, and overnight boarding, the idea of leaving our furry family members in unknown environments can cause great stress to both owner and pet. Pet sitters are becoming a less expensive alternative to animal boarding.  Having someone come into your home to take care of your pet in its own environment is a great way to have the best of both worlds. Your pets have less stress and suffer less separation anxiety and it eliminates worry from an active owner’s life. What does a Pet Sitter Do? Pet sitters care for your animals just as a caregiver would care for your children.  While pets do not require the same degree of care as a child, a certain degree of supervision and physical and social requirements for the health and safety of all animals. Depending on the animal your sitter may simply walk your dog and make sure its physical needs are met.  Replenishing food and water is mandatory for all sitters and often socializing with attention and affection for 30 minutes can help keep pets happy. Pet sitters also provide specialize care by following schedules and administering vitamins or medicine at specific times.  There are even sitters who will stay at your home  to provide an easier transition when you are away. The Cost? You can expect to pay anywhere from $12 -15 for a daily visit which normally would include a short walk. The cost for multiple animals is often several dollars more and if your sitter needs to come twice a day, there may be a reasonable package fee. If you require overnight services, expect to pay $50 per night and there may be additional charges for major holidays throughout the year. Most often any overnight fee will include collecting mail and watering plants, which can provide peace of mind for the safety of not only your animals but the security of your home while you are away. Locating a Pet Sitter The best way to find a pet sitter is through referral or word of mouth.  You can also check your veterinarians office or your groomers for advertisements in their offices. It is in your best interest to interview your sitter and check all references as you would for anyone you allow in your home. A good pet sitter will offer to visit with your pet to allow the animal to bond with them before they are signed on.  If your sitter does not make the time, then they are not right for you. Any time we bring someone into our home to take care of someone we love, there is a level of trust we must extend.  By taking the time to get to know your pet sitter you can find the best fit for your pets that will keep both pet and owner happy."
13,Raw Dog Food Temptation,pets," There are many people that are passionate when it comes to caring for their beloved pets. They ensure that those animals are seen by medical professionals when they need it and get the right amount of exercise on a regular basis. They are very particular about the food that they receive. Many of them are curious about the raw dog food diet. The raw dog food diet is made up of things that a dog would eat in the wild so it's not an unheard of thing. It's filled with raw meats, bones, veggies and fruits. It's a diet that is not universally accepted and many are in favor of it for different reasons. The raw dog food diet has many benefits that have dog owners switching from their current diet. This is a diet that reportedly produces a shinier coat, healthy skin and more energy in the dogs that eat it. The nutrients and other enzymes that are in the foods aren't changed by the heating and preserving process of processed foods. Some of the changes the raw dog food diet produces are visible but there are important ones that take place in the dog. Because the foods are raw and there aren't many additives and preservatives, more of the food is broken down and absorbed into the body. With not much left as a waste product, a dog's stools are much smaller than they normally are. Some of the most popular dogs have been fed a raw dog food diet for many years and people see the way these dogs respond and what the same for their own beloved animals. There are many racing greyhounds as well as sled dogs that have been given this diet. These dogs enjoy great health and have been seen as a visual of benefits for this diet. With all the great success that is enjoyed by many dog owners on the raw dog food diet, there are just as many people that didn't have the same results. Not all dogs respond well to this diet. Dogs that have a bad immune system shouldn't be put on this diet. Puppies also shouldn't be placed on this diet. Both of these dogs need special things and diets that the raw food diet won't give. Once a pet owner decides they are going to put their animal on the raw dog food diet, they are often surprised at the cost of it. The raw food diet is more expensive because the ingredients used are fresh rather than processed. These ingredients can be bought individually at a local grocery store, like any other groceries. They can also be prepared and waiting in a freezer at the local pet store. There are some pet owners that aren't convinced of the benefits of a raw dog food diet for their pets. There are some times that nature provides everything that is necessary. There are other times that nature needs a little help. Before any responsible pet owner decides to switch their pet to this diet, they should talk to their vet."
14,What Is It About Catnip?,pets," Have you ever tried giving your cat catnip?  If so, what was their response? Statistics show that about 50% of cats seem to be affected by catnip and the behavior that results varies widely between individuals. I don't know about you, but catnip has been a life-saver for me and my feline family. I never questioned what or why my cats were so strongly attracted to catnip. I just knew that when my three diva girls were in a snit, I could always rely on catnip to mellow them out. I know, it sounds so 70's but it's a fact. A couple of sprinkles of a good grade catnip and ""the girls"" were rolling around, rubbing on everything they could and then settling in to a serene state of peace. It was like magic! Just what is it about catnip? I know it is in the mint family and that the active ingredient that draws the cats to it is nepetguealactone. The plant itself is a perennial herb that is considered a weed by many gardeners. It has the general look of mint with long stems and bilateral leaves and but it is identifiable by it's characteristic clusters of white-purple flowers on the stem ends. How does catnip work? The alluring scent of catnip's active ingredient,nepetalactone, must be inhaled to effect the cat. The scent is received by the vomeronasal organ, also known as the Jacobson's organ, which is located in the back of the cat's nose. The subsequent stimulation causes the Flehman response, which is the funny face your cat makes when he curls back his lips and slightly opens his mouth. This action presses his tongue against the roof of his mouth, forcing air through the vomeronasal organ. Your cat is actually smelling and tasting at the same time. Yes, he has a Sixth Sense!! When a cat sniffs nepetalactone, it can act as a stimulant. However, nepetalactone acts as a sedative if eaten.  Cats will frequently rub against or chew on catnip to bruise the leaves and stems, which then release more nepetalactone. The behavioral response is said to look like the cat is ""intoxicated"" or ""drunken"" and cats have been seen rolling around in ecstasy after having indulged in the herb. Some people will buy their cats toys stuffed with catnip and watch as little kitty prowls around to find the best method of attacking the toy and batting it around.   Some will sprinkle a little catnip on a rug and let their cat sniff, eat and rub around on the leaves.  Catnip is also known to be a digestive aid and can be sprinkled on your cats food.  So that's what it is about catnip."
15,Selecting Grain Free Dog Food for Your Doggy,pets," Like homo-sapiens, dogs need nourishing nutrient dense diets. If homo-sapiens ate nothing but fast food all the time, all we would have was sugar flowing through our bodies. Because dogs can't digest grain or wheat very well, it turns into sugar, but with grain free dog food, dogs get nutrient dense diets just as if they were in nature. In the wild, dogs eat raw meat from animals that they have killed or found that are dead. They eat a wide range of animals, such as fish, deer, and farm animals. Though, your house pet may not be wild by nature, he derived from the wild, and needs the same nutrition as a wild dog does. Because raw meat can be unsanitary, grain free is a healthy alternative. Because your dog will be getting a great amount of protein, and a high calorie diet, you will have to change their eating routines marginally. Though changing your dog to a new food, makes it essential for a few alterations, the nutritional value of grain free significantly offsets the changes you will have to make. Because grain free foods are high in calories, your dog may gain weight if you feed it the amount you did on regular dog food, however, if your dog gets a lot of physical activity or training, it will devour about the same quantity. Just like wild dogs, grain free nourished dogs get proteins and fiber. Changing exactly how much your dog consumes and how often will fluctuate by dog. Many individuals ponder why grain fee is superior and if there is any visible alteration between a dog that eats regular dog food and a dog that eats grain free. The answer is yes. There remain significant obvious differences between the two dog foods. Dogs that eat grain free have polished coats, healthier skin, fresher breath, higher energy levels, and fewer stools compared to dogs that don't. Because grain free fed dogs spend less of their energy trying to break down the grains in their bodies so they can use it, they are healthier in all the other areas they were once lacking in. Providing adequate nutrition gives your dog a longer healthier life, and you will be able to see the difference. As you go to the store, you will see many different brands of dog food. Each one will assure you the optimum nourishment for your canine; many of these tactics are just marketing strategies. When in doubt, read the label. Many bags will say organic, but that doesn't mean grain free. Even if it says grain free, check the label. To ensure your dog gets the best make sure there are no grain or wheat ingredients. Do you want your dog to live to see your grandchildren? Feeding them grain free dog food is the first step to optimizing your dog's life span. Pets are part of the family and they ought to have just as much adoration and nutrition as anyone in your household. Give your dog an enhanced life; feed them grain free."
16,Aquarium LED Lights Comparison,pets," Do aquarium LED lights really cost more than other aquarium light fixtures? This comparison takes into account the initial setup, and continued cost of lighting a beautiful aquarium over a 1-2 year period.   It will show that LED’s are actually the cheapest to keep and maintain. Currently fluorescent light fixtures (VHO) are the least expensive to purchase while LED is the most expensive with Metal Halide (HQI) somewhere in the middle. The first thing to be considered is bulb replacement.  The VHO and HQI bulbs need to be replaced every year, while the LED lasts 7 -10 years. The second consideration is heat.  You might not think of heat when referring to lighting, but heat is an issue for aquariums.  HQI produce so much heat that chillers are often used to help lower aquarium temperatures.  This often requires an extra pump to help run water through the chiller itself.  VHO fixtures in general do not produce enough heat to require a chiller but some of the high output fixtures that use ballasts, will also produce heat.  LED fixtures have little to no heat, so no heat transferred to the aquarium. The last consideration is power.  Electricity runs all of the lighting fixtures, but by far the most energy efficient is the LED, then the VHO, and then the HQI. I myself had an HQI fixture on my 260 gallon fish tank.  I switched to standard (VHO) bulbs, and then to LED, which I currently use and like.  My electric bill dropped by half, from a budgeted amount of $900 / month, to a current $450 /month.  I eliminated the chiller, and two sump pumps used for the chiller and skimmer. One additional aspect to consider other than cost is the effects on the aquarium inhabitants.  For instance, the VHO bulb gives an even light distribution along the entire bulb, giving the tank a constant light throughout the entire aquarium.  The HQI gives a more concentrated beam of light, more like the sun, has a more natural shaded area and a shimmer effect on the surface of the water.  LED’s also give a shimmer effect to the surface of the water and can be set up to simulate cloud cover, sunrise, and sunset. All together, the overall benefits of LED light fixtures make up for initial cost in future savings.  By the time you add in the cost of replacing bulbs every year, extra pumps, chillers, and the electricity it costs to run such devices the clear winner is the LED fixture. Thank you for reading my article, I hope it helps you in choosing the right lighting fixture for your aquarium."

20,Barrel Racing Horses,pets," Whether you are a beginner or a seasoned barrel racer, your success in competition will greatly depend on you choice of Barrel Horse. Barrel Racing Horses are almost as diverse as the human race itself and it is imperative that you consider many factors in making the final decision on a Barrel Racing team mate. The first consideration is your target level of competition. Is it your desire to go out on Saturday afternoon and compete in the local play day? If your main ambition is play days then your choice of ideal horse will surely be different than if you compete weekly in a major organization such as NBHA.  If you're just looking for a play day horse, an older, seasoned horse may be your best bet. Older horses are much calmer and can often be purchased at a significant discount from their younger brothers. If, on the other hand, you are looking to place in the 1D bracket on a weekly basis then you  need to be prepared to pay considerably more for a well trained, proven Barrel Horse. If you are a beginning barrel rider, and you feel you have the patience and skill set, it may be best for you to purchase an untrained horse and do the training yourself. Barrel Racing is a team sport. The team consists of one horse and one rider. What better way to become a great team than to learn the sport from the ground up. It is not difficult to train a barrel horse. There is plenty of information out there to help you be successful. But it will take time and patience. If you are wanting to compete immediately then a trained horse is certainly your best option. When purchasing a barrel racing horse to train, you will probably be purchasing a horse that didn't quite work out at some other job. A reigning horse, cow horse, or race horse that for whatever reason didn't live up to their trainers expectations. That doesn't mean they won't be an excellent Barrel Racing Horse. The horse may not have been perfectly suited for the job they were being trained to do....or possibly the trainer did a poor job and fell short in the training department. The horse may still make you a great Barrel Racing team mate. Purchasing a trained horse does not mean you can jump on, enter a barrel horse race and expect to place first in 1D, even if you have spent a great deal of money on a 1D horse. As stated earlier, barrel racing horses and riders are a team and as such need to know each other and work together. It will take some time for your new horse to learn your mannerisms, riding style, and signals. Once done, you will work together as a well oiled machine and rake in those prize checks and buckles, week in and week out. The most popular barrel horse breed is the Quarter Horse. The quarter horse is followed by the Arabian. Although they are often good barrel horses, Arabians tend to be hard headed and difficult to manage. When selecting your new Barrel Racing Horse, be sure he is trailer broke and loads and unloads without a great deal of fuss. Although some horses that have trailer issues can be ""fixed"", many have been traumatized by poor trailer experiences which may even include injury while being trailered. Often times these earlier experiences cannot be overcome and you will be purchasing a frustrating problem which you will need to deal with every time you load up to and from a race. This can completely ruin the experience of the sport for you. I speak from experience on this subject. Once you have determined what your needs in a barrel horse are, you need to consider the important features of a good Barrel Racing Horse Heart: Your horse must have heart....Want to.  You should have to hold him back in the alley until you are ready because he knows his job and is eager to please you. Athletic:   Your Barrel Racing Horse needs to carry himself evenly with a minimum of wasted motion. He should keep his hocks, knees, and hoofs as close to the ground as possible. Age: Older horses tend to be calmer and better suited to the inexperienced rider. Many barrel horses compete effectively well into their 20's. Breeding: Just because a horse comes from champion blood does not automatically make him a champion. Be sure you are considering the horse you see in front of you and not just the horse you see in the paperwork. The horse in front of you is the reality. This article has just skimmed the surface of Barrel Racing Horses, but hopefully the information I have offered will help you in the selection of a quality Barrel Racing Horse that suits your wants, needs, and goals."

1,How to Care For Your Ragdoll Cat,pets," Ragdolls are exceptional animals who demand unique care and consideration.  Their characteristic fur, character, and medical needs mean different methods of care. Let’s investigate all of these three things specific to Ragdolls and how to care appropriately for your cat. Ragdolls have long, soft, rabbit-like fur.  As their fur does not mat, the Ragdoll doesn’t need a lot of grooming.  However, it’s a good to groom your Ragdoll at least every few days.  This alleviates hairballs and aids in bonding. Many folks think that Ragdolls don’t shed.  This is not always true.  It actually depends on the specific cat.  For example, I have two Ragdolls.  One sheds gigantic masses of fur, and the second sheds not one hair.  Because it’s hard to know if your cat will shed, it’s a good practice have a vacuum and lint roller ready just in case. The Ragdoll character can be defined as: respectful, outgoing, perceptive, needy, and passive.  Due to these distinctive characteristics, special care should be reserved for Ragdolls. Due to the their sociable and friendly character, we shouldn’t let these cats outside unless they are supervised.  The Ragdoll breed does not grasp self-defense.  They probably won’t recognize danger or comprehend the occasion to battle or flea from a risky situation. The perceptive and needy aspects of the Ragdoll character may present challenges if leaving the cat home a long for a large part of the day.  Usually, a couple hours home by alone is the longest time you should leave them alone. If responsibilities such as work or school have you away from the home for greater than a couple hours, it preferable to adopt another pet to stay home and keep your cat company.  Usually, Ragdolls are welcoming of other pets, including dogs. Generally speaking, there are no health problems associated with the Ragdoll breed.  Nevertheless, be aware of the disease called HCM or Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.  This is a genetic disease found in some Ragdoll lines.  Disappointingly, a cure has not been found for HCM and there are no treatment options available. The survival rate is very low.  HCM typically claims the life of the Ragdoll when they are still a kitten – sometimes younger than one year old. Ragdoll groups have donated tons of money to research and find the HCM gene.  In the end it payed off: the Ragdoll HCM gene was isolated. Now that genetic testing for HCM is available, a good breeder will test the parents for HCM before breeding a cat.  If you are breed a Ragdoll, it’s tremendously important to test the cats for the HCM gene.  If you want to purchase a Ragdoll, be certain to ask for the medical paperwork indicating that both parents tested negative for the HCM gene."

Start addressing inappropriate soiling, destructive chewing and puppy separation anxiety as if they're likely to happen, and make sure your environment makes those things hard to occur! Crate-training is excellent for dogs with puppy separation anxiety. Crates effectively become safe spaces for nervous dogs. Blankets or dirty laundry that smells like their favorite people can be helpful during the crate-training process. Anxious dogs are also likely to be destructive when their owners are not home. A crate keeps anxious dogs out of harm's way. If your dog seems depressed or gets anxious when you are about to leave the house, your dog might suffer from puppy separation anxiety. To help your dog go through the day, leave something that has your smell on it, such as an old piece of clothing. This could mean that your dog will not miss you so much.

3,Principle Aspects that Start the Majority of Young Puppy Biting,pets," A lot like a young baby, a puppy wishes to explore its new home. On the grounds that just about each and every thing seems new, it is all totally exciting to them. Puppies utilize their mouths to examine everything they come across. They regularly taste, experience, and see just how everything responds to them. Commonly, this pattern turns into a game for a dog. Some of the responses trigger unruly behavior. In addition to their craving to explore, they may be in physical pain because their teeth are coming in. It is relieving and relaxing to gnaw on things, which is usually called teething. Not too long after you get your new pet, many of their first teeth have arrived. Soon after, they are likely to start to drop out and become replaced by their new grown-up teeth. They might look to find comfort by gnawing on your favorite shoes. You have to remember that they are certainly not doing this to get you furious. If you don’t catch your puppy instantly, they truly don’t know they are doing something bad. That is why you should not punish them after you find the torn up shoes. Also, the furniture does not have any reaction. If it was another animal it would have used a sound to let them know it’s not desirable. However, if you don’t notice them right away, it has as of now become self gratifying behavior. This could easily ensue to the point where they will think that they're doing something good. This explains the importance of catching them right away and redirecting their poor behavior. Our next driving factor backing what makes your new puppy bite is that it is simply a lot of fun for them. The truth is it happens to be the most amusing game they could possibly engage in. No, they don’t really like tormenting you. They simply assume you love it equally as much as other animals. This is when it turns out to be your role to teach them to discontinue biting and chewing on inappropriate things. Telling your puppy to not bite is a bit more imperative than you might believe. Keep in your mind that if you do not teach them now, then they could end up being an adult canine that bites. This habit could end up getting them put to sleep. The best way to teach most puppies is referred to as the yelping technique. A supreme way of getting your puppy to end biting is by making a big yelp sound the moment your puppy bites you. This directly results in letting them be aware that they harmed you. In the event that they don’t stop biting promptly, you will know that your version of the yelp is not currently similar enough to a real dogs yelp. There is something you can use called the Bite Breaker, which produces the noise for you personally. The very next thing you do is eliminate your extremities from their mouth and turn your back towards them. This lets them understand that not only have you been hurt, but you will not play anymore if that is how they are going to act. At this point you recognize that puppy biting usually is not malicious behavior. It is simply something very instinctive that they will do since they are puppies. A second bite only ever occurs because their first bite was never corrected or supplemented with the use of a better option. Don’t forget how to get your puppy to stop biting is an easy, but prominent lesson in your puppy’s life."

Using voice and motion, encourage your pet to look straight into the camera, slightly off to the side or with head turned for a side-profile picture. Experiment with lighting and props. When your pet becomes uninterested and drifts off to sleep, keep going for some last photographs. There is something very adorable about a pet slumbering comfortably with one leg draped over a beloved toy or the nose nuzzled right into a soft blanket. Maybe you have the perfect hat to top it all off. You're going to be so encouraged by the results that you'll most likely take the chance to shoot more quality portrait pictures of your pet to decorate your space. Whether sitting in special frames on your desk or enlarged into attention-grabbing wall posters, your pet photos are going to drag smiles out of everyone. And the best thing is there are so many options for printing you'll never run out of new ideas!"
5,Throw a Dog Pawty!,pets," Tossing a party for your pooch is a great way to show your furry friend how much you value them. Not only will your pooch enjoy themselves, but planning and throwing a dog party can be a lot of fun. Having a pooch party is also a fantastic way to get in some social time for you and your furry friend. Toss a dog party to celebrate a birthday, a reunion, a graduation, or you could throw a dog party just for the fun of it; don't waste any time hesitating and get started today! Prior to hosting a successful dog party you must thoroughly plan and prepare for the event. Think of guests to invite, including your pup’s favorite doggie playmates. Get artistic and put together your own doggie party invitations with colored paper, stickers, and ribbons; your guests will appreciate the personalized touch. Put together party bags packed with delicious dog treats and dog toys for the doggie guests and complete the mood with party favors, like fun party hats for all the invited company. Decorate the designated area with signs saying ""Wipe Your Paws"" or ""Beware of Dogs""and put up bright balloons and streamers, you can even find ones with paws or bones printed on them. Cake is a necessity at almost any party, and there are several flavored dog cake mixes and dog frostings perfect for serving hungry hounds. Complete your doggie cake look with a bone-shaped cake pan and topping it off with delicious sprinkles for dogs. Don't forget to whip up a tasty cake to enjoy for you and your fellow dog owning guests with your pooches. Enjoy your cakes over crafted placemats of white paper cut into dog bone shapes to add a nice feel. If you want to being creative, you could even bake an extra cake and put together a cake walk to music like ""Who Let the Dogs Out""  and ""How Much is That Doggie in the Window"" - have the doggie guests play the game with guiding owners! Gather some fun games for all to enjoy, it's a great way to get all of the guests in the mood for a good time. For outside parties you can set up some entertaining activities like paw painting and water relays. For paw painting, secure big pieces of paper on a flat surface, like the patio or deck, and mix cornstarch, water, and food coloring until its evenly smooth and runny in a bowl. Give your guests with sponges for applying the ""paint"" to doggie paws and then allow each pup a turn to move about the paper until they are finished; let owners bring home their dog's artwork as a souvenir. Piñatas packed with dog goodies are also a great idea; dogs will love the treats and owners will get a kick out of making the treats spill. No worry, the paint is safe and washes off easily with a hose or kiddie pool, remember to have towels ready afterward. If the party is indoors try playing doggie dress up or pin-the-tail-on-the-cat; guests will get a kick out of dolling up their doggies (you can even vote for best dressed!) and a good ole game of pin-the-tail never fails. Thank all of your guests with the goodie bags you made and enjoy a calm moment with your pooch (and some leftovers!)."
6,What Colors Are Australian Labradoodles,pets," Australian Labradoodles are growing in popularity among dog owners. They are suitable family pets with an athletic and graceful demeanor. When choosing a Labraboodle puppy, potential owners often wonder about the right coloring for the animal. The breed has several standards when it comes to the dog's coat. Australian Labradoodles are available in a wide array of colors. The dog's coat is preferably one single solid color, with little or no additional colors sprinkled throughout. Their coat colors at birth, however, are often not the same as their true adult colors. The topic of acceptable coloring is more concerning to owners and breeders of show dogs, as there are certain preferred standards. Apricot Apricot or gold coats comes in varying shades, but is ideally the same color as the ripe fruit's interior. The coats of older dogs lighten as they age, but Australian Labradoodle puppies should have this golden color without the roots being lighter than the top fur. Blue A rare color for this breed, pups are born black and have a blue undertone. As they get older, the fur becomes a medium to dark smoky blue. Cream or Chalk The light-colored coat is found in many shades, including apricot cream. The chalk hue is often thought to be white until it's compared to a true white tone. Chocolate Considered rare among Labradoodle breeders, these puppies are born almost black. They become and remain a dark chocolate color. There are several variations on chocolates, such as the cafe coloring. These are usually milk chocolate as puppies and develop a silvery chocolate coat with natural sun highlights by the time they are about three years old. Lavender fur also develops from chocolate-colored puppies, and may be hard to predict until the coat begins to turn a pink or lilac color. Parchment is another one that begins as chocolate in pups, but pales to a beige with a creamy or smoky complexion after about six weeks. Red and Caramel Rich red fur is found as a solid color, without lighter roots.  A deep caramel candy coloring is also one of the common shades in Labradoodles. Silver Puppies born black with a gray skin tone may grow silver fur as they get older. One of the only color groups where a mixture of shades is normal, dogs develop silver coloring by the age of three, with platinum and silver hairs throughout the coat. Other Body Coloring Eyes vary from hazel to brown to black. Noses  and pigment should coordinate with their coat colors. Pigment is pink with caramel and chocolate-hue dogs. Black pigment is preferred with black, silver, blue, red and apricot fur. Deviations Some dogs may have a white toe tips or a small amount of chest hair. Parti, or patches, are also considered acceptable with a white face, body or head. Since Australian Labradoodles typically enjoy spending time outdoors, they often develop lighter coat colors with natural bleaching from sunshine, especially as they age. Coat highlights from the sun at any age should not be confused with kemp. Kemp is a light, coarse hair sometimes sprinkled throughout a dark coat. While it is permissible for show dogs, it is not a desirable trait in these circles. Phantom tones on dark or black dogs is also a possibility."
7,Advice And Tips On Handling Puppy Separation Anxiety,pets," Many people want to raise a healthy, happy and well-adjusted dog. It is not too hard to do this at home, as long as you know what you are doing. Read on and you will find a large collection of tips that have been used in training dogs all over the world. Dogs with puppy separation anxiety experience extreme stress when left alone. This can result in extremely destructive behavior, both to the dog itself and to your property. Make sure your dog has plenty of exercise before being left alone. Treats that provide mental stimulation may also ease puppy separation anxiety. By preventing boredom, you can ease the stress of separation anxiety. If your dog suffers from puppy separation anxiety and gets restless when you are about to leave the house, you should feed your dog right before you leave. This will keep your dog busy while you prepare and distract it from the stressful situation. This should make the separation much easier. You shouldn't wait for bad behaviors to start to begin preemptively addressing them. Most new dog owners can expect at least one bad behavior to crop up during their time as a dog owner! Start addressing inappropriate soiling, destructive chewing and puppy separation anxiety as if they're likely to happen, and make sure your environment makes those things hard to occur! Crate-training is excellent for dogs with puppy separation anxiety. Crates effectively become safe spaces for nervous dogs. Blankets or dirty laundry that smells like their favorite people can be helpful during the crate-training process. Anxious dogs are also likely to be destructive when their owners are not home. A crate keeps anxious dogs out of harm's way. If your dog seems depressed or gets anxious when you are about to leave the house, your dog might suffer from puppy separation anxiety. To help your dog go through the day, leave something that has your smell on it, such as an old piece of clothing. This could mean that your dog will not miss you so much. You now have the knowledge you need to train your dog in a happy, healthy and productive way. Keep your patience, and you and your dog will find the work brings many rewards. Make sure to apply all the tips with compassion and common sense, along with consistency, and you'll do great."
8,Praise Our Pet Heroes,pets," Adoption is one thing, but gathering, rescuing and then relocating small dog breeds to avoid  becoming euthanized  is nothing short of divine intervention, I think.   California is becoming known as the state where many dogs are being regularly euthanized and one of the reasons for this unfortunate trend, is our declining economy.  Statistics are showing that well meaning dog owners are just guilty of falling in love with a puppy,  and then resort to abandoning the young dogs, when the novelty wears off or they can no longer maintain or afford the lifetime responsibilities.  Shelters are overcrowded when these dogs are dropped off and become the responsibility of others.  Fundraising events and donations have become part of our ongoing culture but this has enabled Animal Rescue programs to sprout up and start implementing strategies to get these dogs into loving homes.  There is a great pet rescue hero by the name of Jan Folk who lives in California who heard about places like Alberta, Canada where many people like their animals large which has created a shortage - but no lack of love - for small breed dogs. Jan has begun successfully chartering jets and flying dogs to countries where dogs are in short supply and adoption families are ready and waiting to receive new family members.  At last count, by chartering 5 jets so far, she has deserved the honour of pet hero giving almost 400 of the furry creatures a new leash on life.  This is an act of love unprecedented and such a worthy cause that few of us could have ever imagined.   I’m not sure how enough dog crates and supplies could be found and/or donated to accomplish the relocation process and it would require great organizational skills to load up all the dogs and prepare them securely and safely.  I should cast my vote and suggest that all family puppies and adult dogs should have their own personal crate, whether for flight purposes or for home or kennel care.   Every dog, big or small feels safe within their own crate and on their own bed or whatever material they prefer to sleep on.   I have used many inexpensive quilts and blankets purchased from used clothing stores in the past, but crates and beds are sold almost everywhere these days and prices are reasonable now.  I hope during flight, there were human companions to tend to the dogs but since one rescue group is responsible for almost 400 dogs over the course of 4 flights, I’m impressed if volunteers are ready and willing for such a commitment.  I hope to hear about more organizations repeating these dog adoption transfers.  We can only learn from those who have pioneered and perfected this adoption program and are willing to share their successful strategies with others.  It would be a thrill though, to see dogs going to new homes in far away places, and successful adoptions awaiting their arrival.  Dreams for dogs do come true and I add my sincere and heartfelt thanks to our pet rescue and adoption providers."
9,Dog nail trimming: How to do it?,pets," Are you wondering about dog nail trimming? Well then you need nail trimmers or clippers which are important tools when it comes to nail grooming. These clippers are used both by experts and also at home. There are many types of clippers available for nail trimming. It is all about deciding on the model which best suits your pet's needs. Medium-sized trimmers usually focus on all dog breeds except the larger ones. An alternative option for clippers is grinders and a lot of groomers use them for more sensitive dog nail trimming duties. Clippers can cut well whereas mills can smooth away the edges. Dog nail trimming is a bit complicated and it generally requires a mixture of tools for effective results. There is a safeguard attached to a few clippers that prevents too much of cutting the nail. But because of this guard, you might not see the toe nail when you cut and you might injure your dog’s toe blood vessels. Such mishaps are regular in the process of grooming because of the incorrect use of the resources. More advanced gear for dog nail trimming can stem the actual bleeding and also cauterize the vein if the trimmers touch it. The main issue with the nail trimming is that you have to be careful and increase the dog's comfort and ease, or you might end up making your pet nervous or agitated. This would reduce the likelihood of trimming the nails properly. Nevertheless, dog nail trimming should not be neglected. Long nails can be very unpleasant for dogs particularly when they live inside your house and have the chance to smoothen them against the floor. Incorrectly trimmed nails also have the risk of in-grown nails that are unpleasant and inconvenient. If you can listen to the pet's nails clicking against the ground, then you need to cut all of them right away. Occasionally, dog nail trimming demands smoothing or even filing simply because lots of dogs have really brittle nails that splinter whenever you cut all of them short. Think about your dog's patience levels and temperament when cutting the nails. Do not even attempt to cut them all at the same time; breaks are often necessary to be able to allow the pet to relax. There are cases when pets injured even experts during this type of grooming tasks. With many pets, it takes considerable time to get accustomed to nail cutting. Tolerance could be helped with cautious handling, however this doesn't usually work. Go for the incentive system and provide your pet a little treat following each nail cut session. Wait for a while, after that, move on to the following nail. This is how dog nail trimming has to be done. So, make sure that you take the necessary precautions before you actually set out to do the task of trimming your pet’s nails and make sure that you know everything related to the subject so that you won’t end up hurting yourself or your dog.

This is something that many people are starting to choose for their dog. In evolutionary times, dogs and cats diet consisted of raw foods and this diet returns them to the eating habits that their ancestors once had.

Ordinary food, which may seem promising at the time, does not offer your dog much at all, especially when it comes to nutrition and protein. Your dog has to have protein in order to have energy and be active as it should be. Many ordinary food brands contain corn meal as a substitute of protein for meat which is definitely not a good thing.

Your dog can suffer from a number of health conditions after eating this form of traditional dog food. Your dog will also be at a greater risk of getting sick and having health problems which is something you want to avoid. Another problem with ordinary food is that most of the ordinary food contains food coloring and flavor enhancing ingredients.

15,Reef aquarium DIY auto-top off,pets," As you know, evaporated water in your reef aquarium or fish only marine aquarium needs to be substituted with fresh water because salt does not evaporate. I have seen many people use electric float valves directly plugged into their sumps which turns on a water pump when the water drops below a targeted point. In my opinion this is a a problem waiting to happen unless there are several safeties built in, this can be expensive and still not 100% fail proof. If the float valve or pump fails OPEN not only will you flood your floor you will also more than likely harm all your animals due to the fact the salinity levels will drop drastically. If you still insist on using an electric float and pump set-up, I suggest to look any further then the Tunze osmolator auto top-off. I have some friends who use it and they are satisfied. If you want a Do-it-yourself gravity auto top-off, don't hesitate to keep reading. I have been operating a gravity feed along with a float set-up for the past 4 years without any issues. If kept really clean (clean algae and causations off the sump float valve) it will in no way over fill your sump with fresh water unless some freak accident occurs. Here is a checklist of what you will need to build your own auto top-off. An RO / DI unit (for both top-ups and water changes) a small water reservoir, an auto shut off pressure valve, a ¼"" 1 way valve, an optional ¼"" solenoid to switch main water to RO on and off, an electronic timer to control the  solenoid, two plastic float valves, a bunch of ¼ tube , a 1/4″ bulk head to connect the ¼"" tube from the reservoir to the sump valve. How does it all work? It’s simple actually. In order to keep my reservoir filled, my RO-DI runs for about 1 hour per day ( via electric solenoid). I do not procure much evaporation so that is a bit more than I need. It fills up the top-off reservoir tank up until the float valve blocks the RO tube causing backpressure, this pressure is what triggers the auto shut-off , therefore turning off the RO unit. It is fairly hard to explain this without pictures. The best way to get your RO-DI all plugged up with the 1 way valve and auto shut-off is to pay a visit to your RO-DI supplier website for instructions. Search for the filter guys, they have some great tutorials and schematics on their website. I have the 2nd plastic float valve drilled into my sump, the other end connects into my reservoir. The ideal part about this set up is that it is gravity fed, no pumps. The valves work in such a way that they open ever so little as the water evaporates. Which is why the water trickles in at the same rate it evaporates. Salinity is very consistent! To recap. There are basically 2 systems in play here. The 1st one is the RO that fills up a reservoir tank that holds your top-off water. The reservoir has a float in it that when closed causes the RO-DI to switch off. On top of that you have an optional electric solenoid controlled by a timer that turns off the water supply to the unit. Overkill? Possibly, but I’d rather not risk my livestock and floors for a $20 switch. The second is moving the water from the reservoir into the sump when the sump water evaporates. With the set-up stated above you now have filled up your reservoir. In order to get it to top-off you will need to join a ¼"" line to a bulkhead drilled into the reservoir tank and the other end of the line into the float drilled into your sump. As the water level of your sump lowers, the float will open slightly allowing water in. Notice the double fail safe? Truth be told there are doubters but I love this set-up. No extra pumps, it’s secure and affordable. Happy reefing and enjoy your own reef aquarium auto top-off."
16,The Symptoms of Pet Mange and Remedies,pets," Pet mange is a disease which is caused by the parasitic mites. If you are unsure whether or not your animal is experiencing the symptoms of mange, ask yourself if your dog is expecting any of the following: Excessive Itching Usually cats and dogs itch and scratch themselves but if you find them scratching excessively, too hard or too often then perhaps they might have mange. Hair Loss When the mange attacks a pet, one of the most common indications is hair loss. You will notice that your cat or dog’s hair will thin in some areas, or may also find a lot more shedding in areas that your dog frequents. Sores and Blisters Besides the hair loss, if your pet’s skin is having skin disorders like sores, blisters and reddening then it might be mange. If the problem gets worse these blisters may turn into wounds and there might blood oozing from the area. Bad Skin Odor Also mange infection will cause your pet’s skin to develop a bad unpleasant odor that stands out. The odor should be a large indicator of this mite. Pet Mange Remedies Should you discover that your pet does have mange, there are plenty of ways for you to treat their condition, with spending a lot of money.  Some common remedies for mange include: Bathing Begin with just a regular pet bath. Since mange is typically found in cats and dogs a bath in warm water with shampoo and conditioners that contains mange treatment solutions is ideal. It is vital to keep your pet clean in order to prevent it from further infections. This will ensure that during the bath, the dead, and flaky skin on your pet’s body will fall off. You can also add one percent of hydrogen peroxide with borax and water and after dissolving completely, give your dog a bathe with this mixture and this will help a lot. Brush Make sure you brush the animal’s fur regularly as this will help in further removing the pests and dead skin. Medicine in food There are also some medicines or supplements which can be included in pet’s meal for the treatment. You can also add 1 tablespoons of unpasteurized apple cider vinegar in its meal which will help in reducing the pest. Treatment for Ears Ears can also be the target of the mange, but if you take 2 tablespoons of yogurt containing acidophilus and rub it on the ears it can help a lot. Massage Vaseline can also be applied to the areas where you find your pet is itching the most as Vaseline suffocates mange mites and they die. Should you feel as though your pet has mange you can try out a safe mange treatment such as one of the aforementioned, or you can call your vet for confirmation and more treatment options."
17,Dog hair brushing: Is it essential?,pets," The relationship shared between humans and canines goes long back in history when canines used to be a part of their family not only for protection but also for hunting purposes. Canines had always been an integral part of the lives of the cave men. This is validated by many artifacts left behind by the inhabitants of that age. From then till now, dogs have become the most loved pets and their masters offer their utmost care and love towards the well being of the animal. In the events of taking care of the animal, it has been noted that the fur of dogs is extremely delicate and dog hair brushing is an essential part of it. There are many institutions which offer professional services in improving the health and hygiene of the animal. Apart from that, most of the owners take personal interest in taking care of the health of their beloved and extremely loyal four legged friends. The fur of the dog is dependent on the geographical location from where it originates. The arctic dogs have a much thicker fur which protects them from those extremities. This is in contrast to the dogs belonging to the Mediterranean climate, where the fur is minimal so that the animal does not feel hot due to the fur. The problem of hair fall also persists; therefore dog hair brushing becomes a concern for the dog owners. Apart from the health and hygiene of the dog, dog hair brushing is considered to be one of the best ways to bond with your beloved pet. Nothing would ease the animal more than feeling a soft touch helping it smoothe sections which it finds unreachable. This is considered to be one of the best ways to get closer with the dear animal. The animal not only feels healthier after a clean coat through the thorough dog hair brushing but also looks healthier. After being groomed by the owner, the animal’s responses are full of love and affection towards the master. Another advantage that comes along after the Dog Hair Brushing is a better circulation of blood within the body of the animal. It gets all the more crucial for older animals since they need a better circulation than the younger ones. Last but not the least; matted hair which is caused due to extreme dirt and filth is completely avoided. Apart from brushing, clipping the hair off the animal is also essential. Matted hair can turn out to be a painstaking experience for the canine. Care should be taken while cleaning off the hair. The hair can be cleaned off either by moving the hair brush through the hair or if the hair has been matted for a very long time, it would need to be shaved off. There are many steps which are to be religiously followed while cleaning the dog and the area where the animal resides. Canines are very susceptible beings and need a lot of love and care to lead a healthy life."

1,Precisely what is considered a Nano reef aquarium?,pets," What is considered a Nano reef aquarium? How small is a nano reef aquarium? Is my tank to big to be a nano? These are the questions you will always come across when reading a nano reef forum or any reef forum at that. I do not believe there is a definite answer to this, I do however personally feel that anything more 20 gallons is not a nano and 15 gallons is pushing it. In my view, a true nano, in every sense of the word is up to 10-12 gallons (not including a sump). Can a nano reef aquarium be as successful as larger tanks?  Do I require a protein skimmer, what about a filtration syatem? Do I have to dose any calcium or alkalinity? Just how much water to do have to change weekly? Unfortunately there is no decisive answers for these particular concerns because every aquarium is different. There are though general arguments to follow for every reef tank. The most important factor in keeping any reef tank is water quality. You can have the coolest lights, the ""best"" additives, etc, if your H2O quality is not just right, you will not have a healthy reef. The easiest way to maintain optimal water quality is by performing water changes. Since nano's have such low water volume, one can perform 50% water changes once a week without even drawing a sweat! All you would have to keep up your nano reef aquarium is salt and an RO-DI unit! Yes, you still need the obvious items such as lighting, temperature control, water motion, regular food, etc, but you will most likely not require any type of filtration. No protein skimmer, no carbon reactor, no phosphate reactor and no mechanical filtration as well. You will most likely not even need to worry about dosing for calcium, alkalinity nor magnesium! But just how? Simple, you will get EVERYTHING you require from a simple and easy water change! Remember, you have a 10 gallon tank. Even if you mix a 5 gallon bucket of fresh salt mix weekly, you will be changing out roughly 50% of your H2O. A 50% water change will most defiantly boost any calcium, alkalinity and magnesium and it will also get rid of all the ""bad stuff"" that a skimmer or sump would have gotten rid of! The only issue I have with large 50%+ water changes is they could dramatically alter your water chemistry. This would be ok for a fish only aquarium, but if you have any type of coral, I would certainly not suggest it. What you can do is mix your 5 gallon bucket of fresh salt once per week BUT only change a couple of gallons at one time, say every couple of 48 hours. This way you still get the benefit of a 50% water change once a week without shocking your corals with any large changes. Important note** Keep the mixed seawater covered to protect it from debris getting in and to minimize water evaporation. If water evaporates, your salt mix will generally be comprised. As you are probably already aware, salt does not evaporate, only water does. Make certain you check your salinity before dropping it in!"

5,African Grey Parrot Diet,pets," When considering what things to provide your parrot to eat, give thought to what he ate in the wild. He ate fruit and nuts. You might believe that all fruits are satisfactory for him to eat and most fruits are safe. Notwithstanding, avocado is not suitable for parrots and neither are the seeds of fruit. Many seeds contain cyanide and although it doesn’t hold enough to damage a man, your parrot is a lot smaller than you are and as a result it will create a great deal of damage. You should give your parrot organic pellets as a chief food source. Fruits, nuts and vegetables, cooked or raw are given more as a additional food source. Avian as a whole need a lot of calcium, vitamin A,  better known as beta-carotene, and green leafy vegetables and mustard greens are a good source of the two. Broccoli is the best source of both of them. By supplying your parrot fresh fruit and vegetables, you certainly will boost his level of immunity as fresh vegetables and fruit include phyto-nutrients. This is identified to assist in promoting healing and is thought to help prevent diseases. You are able to give your parrot cooked rice and a very small quantity of cooked (never raw) meat and fish for necessary protein. This must not be given on a daily basis as in the wild parrots do not eat meat. Many parrots have been known to appreciate a bone with tit bits of meat on it. Apples, berries (all berries that you can eat) banana, oranges, seedless grapes, melons, kiwi, mango, papaya (remove the skin off the mango and papaya), almonds and unsalted peanut or other nuts, are good for your parrot. Spinach, beans, sweet potato, peppers (red, green and chili), peas, lettuce (not ice-berg or head) celery, collard, kale (fantastic source of calcium), butternut, zucchini and cucumber are the right vegetables for your parrot. Boiled eggs with the shell still on is a good source of protein and calcium. DO NOT give your parrot coffee or chocolate: as it contains theobromine, this is an alkaloid that is poisonous for your parrot. Alcohol and salty foods are harmful to your parrot, birds do not have sweat glands and as a result are not able to get rid of the iodine in their bodies. Furthermore, if you supply pellets, fruit and vegetables you don't need to complement your birds food intake with other supplements. Too much vitamins would lead to a lot of problems. Before supplementing his food, go see a avian specialist, they are going to be in a position to instruct you if it is essential."

This article will give you many tips that you can use when learning how to train your family dog. Have fun when doing this with your dog, and in time you will see wonderful results. Appropriately crate training your dog can prevent puppy separation anxiety. Start by allowing the dog to move freely in and out of the kennel. ""Bait"" the kennel with special treats or toys.

7,The Different Types Of Parrots,pets," Within this article, we'll concentrate on the distinctive types associated with the African Grey Parrot. The initial African Grey Parrot would be the Congo African Grey, Timneh African Grey Parrot, Ghana African Grey and the Cameroon African Grey Parrot. Nonetheless, by far the most renowned is the Congo and the Timneh African Grey. The Ghana African Grey is similar to the Congo African Grey however smaller in size with a deeper colour. Then there's the Cameroon African Grey, which is quite a uncommon parrot. Within the natural environment, all of these avian survive on fruit, nuts and vegetables which can be located in the uppermost parts of the trees. They are very outgoing birds and group together. They live in the rainforest and has a mate for life. Domesticated parrots will occasionally pull out their feathers when ever bored just to entertain themselves. Simply because they are intellectual birds, they need to be stimulated or they will simply get bored. They are able to duplicate a large number of sounds and this is the rationale that they are so more expensive. African Grey and most parrot groups are temperamental and challenging birds at times. Once you own an African Grey you can assume to have a life- long relationship with your parrot if it is taken care of. As a result of their high demand, breeders readily breed them. Toddlers and the aged should take care around parrots as they have very sharp claws and beaks .Parrots want a lot of dedication and commitment but most of all love. Bear in mind you are answerable for your parrots requirements, and the most essential thing he requires other than food, is fresh water daily as he not only drinks of his water but also bathes in it. Clean out the food and water dishes frequently, as these are idyllic sites for harmful bacteria to grow. Like I said this is a long time relationship therefore his cage which is his home is of upmost relevance. Needless to say, the larger the bird, the bigger the cage. When purchasing a baby parrot, take a look at the size of its parents to know how big the bird will grow so that you can know what size the cage needs to be when the bird is completely grown. You are able to purchase a smaller cage at the start when the parrot is a baby never the less you will need to switch it more rapidly than you think."

9,Stopping your Dog from Cowering at Fireworks using simple accessories,pets," When the firework season is upon us, people often despair about how their pets will react. While some dogs are not bothered much, just as many are petrified by the bangs and flashes which seem to get louder and brighter year after year. My Labrador was so scared of fireworks that he would refuse to go outside after nightfall over the whole of the winter period. I will now explain how we cured him in the hope that, in future years, you can train your dog to ignore (and sometimes even enjoy) the firework season. The secret of this training is noise association. For this you will need a CD of firework noises and other scary sounds that are available from many dog accessories on-line shops (e-bay for example). There are various CDs about – search for names like ""Sounds Scary"", ""Fear of Fireworks"" or ""CLIX Noises and Sounds"". I used the ""Sounds Scary"" CD and helped it along with a DAP diffuser plugged into a socket in my training room. Now this method takes a bit of patience, but it works. Firstly you adjust the volume level of your CD player so that it is barely audible to you. Dogs have much more sensitive hearing, so they will still be able to hear it. Next you can close the curtains so the room gets a bit darker, but not too dark. With the CD playing and your DAP turned on, play with your dog with its favourite dog toys, always being positive and enthusiastic. When your pet plays back, give it a dog treat to reward it for playing and not worrying. Do this for about half an hour per session per day. On day 2 you would turn your CD player up a notch and repeat the play pattern. If you start sensing fear, then reduce the level a bit and play a bit harder. Maybe fill a Kong toy up with squirty cheese or Kong Paste and play with that. This will give a really good positive link between the firework noises and being rewarded. I hope you see where we are going with this now. Keep making the noises louder and louder (at a notch a day) until you are at about half the level that YOU can tolerate. In the next session, keep the noise level the same but try the session with the DAP turned off. Hopefully you will not notice any difference in the behaviour now. Right, now is the time to get a bit noisier. Next session you may want to jump to about 70% maximum noise level. Keep on playing and rewarding with your pet. Then after about a week, you will have completed your training. Hopefully you have now programmed your dog to associate all the loud noises on the disc with having fun and being rewarded. If you are doing the training outside of the firework season then try a little refresher session about half way through October to re-assert this training. Then it will be time to put it to the test. When the fireworks start, you may want to turn your diffuser on to begin with, but only to begin. Play with your dog for the first couple of nights and reward accordingly. Your dog should now be ready to go it alone…Good Luck!"
10,"Tropical Fish Lovers - If You’re Gonna Have a Saltwater Aquarium, Do It Right!",pets," Not just any goober can be a successful and savvy aquarist.  This is a hobby for real men, and in some cases women.  Having said that, it is truly one of the most rewarding hobbies around.  Saltwater aquariums are known for their therapeutic effect on everyone that sees them, and there are few things more gratifying than creating a ""mini ocean"" in your home. Although a successful saltwater aquarium includes many different parts – saltwater fish, of course, or if you prefer a reef aquarium you may only have a variety of rare coral, live rock which literally grows a harvest of healthy bacteria and miniature creatures that keep your ocean balanced, live sand which absorbs toxins from your crystal clear water, and of course a cleaning crew of invertebrates.  But the ""piece de resistance"" – the component of your saltwater aquarium system that is the lifeblood of it’s inhabitants, and the key to your success, is the aquarium’s lighting.  Although you can certainly get started with whatever aquarium lighting comes with your saltwater aquarium tank, later you will want to know how lighting choices can enhance your saltwater aquarium experience. Luckily for you, huge strides have been made in aquarium lighting recently.  While LED aquarium lighting  has long been popular for nighttime aquarium lighting, they have recently become the best choice for daytime lighting also.  One main reason is that it takes less capacity to run an LED light, and as a result the savings can be as high as 70%!  They have a longer operational life and give your tank a huge advantage when it comes to overheating.  Saltwater aquarium lighting is a broad subject and any decision should be accompanied by research.  You can find lots of great articles online – just google article directories.  Another great way to get started is to talk to the crew at your local fish store.  After all, they’re going to be your support group in your new hobby, and they will know a lot more off the bat about what you need to do to get started with your new mini ocean.  And local fish stores are the best way to really get a feel for the effect that saltwater aquariums can have on your mood and your life.

Much in the same way that you would train and correct your children, it is important to do that for your dog as well. How can you expect them to behave if you haven't taught them what that means? Read on for ways that you can start training your family dog. Train your dog by reinforcing positive behavior. This does not mean to punish your pet when he does something bad; instead, simply do not reinforce negative behavior. Negative enforcement might just make your dog scared of you. Positive reinforcement will ensure that your dog will want to do good things more often in order to receive treats and praise. Never cave in to bad behavior. Your dog will always love you, but it needs to know that you're the boss. Don't encourage bad behavior and let your dog know that any such behavior will be met with punishment. At the same time, make sure you reward good behavior as well. It is important to note that telling your dog ""no"" does not give him any information. For example, if someone comes into your house, and your dog starts to jump, saying ""no"" is not enough information. Whereas, saying, ""sit"" is a better alternative, because it gives him something he can actually do. If you tell a dog what you want him to do with a command, this avoids confusion, and he will learn to listen. You shouldn't wait for bad behaviors to start to begin preemptively addressing them. Most new dog owners can expect at least one bad behavior to crop up during their time as a dog owner! Start addressing inappropriate soiling, destructive chewing and separation anxiety as if they're likely to happen, and make sure your environment makes those things hard to occur! Potty training a puppy can be a harsh task at times, but not impossible. You have to remember that the puppy doesn't know that when they go to the bathroom inside that it is wrong. Try your best to keep an eye on your puppy and if it starts looking like it has to go to the bathroom let it outside, after the puppy goes to the bathroom praise the puppy so it knows it did the right thing. Recall training with your dog should always begin in a safe, enclosed space. A fenced backyard or other outdoor enclosure is the perfect place to start. This will allow you to keep your dog safe while you practice the recall command until the dog is 100% trustworthy, while still challenging him with outdoor distractions. Make your dog training fun for both you and your animal. If you are not having fun then more than likely, your dog is not either. This can lead to you both having a bad experience. The more fun you can make your dog training the faster it will go for both of you. Try to look at dog training as a game, and not as a chore. Young puppies can be quickly potty trained by keeping them with you all the time and carefully observing their actions. When very young they might need to be taken outside as frequently as every hour! By carefully watching them you'll quickly learn how they act when they need to relieve themselves. Since you have learned these new facts, you will now able to enjoy having a calmer more obedient dog that will surely provide better benefits that you and your whole family can enjoy. Put this information to use today and see firsthand just how much easier it is to train your dog"

Employed canines are important additions to human workforces and are taught accordingly to promise the utmost efficiency. Jobs have been designed for canines in momentous fields, allowing furry friends to work alongside police, firefighters, search and rescue teams, border control, and even military units. Working dogs exhibit bravery and provide help for the government and public; certain canines are even awarded honors for their actions. Modern police forces employ canines to support with tracking down criminals, sniffing out illegal materials, and searching buildings, as well as additional tasks a human officer may not be as competent of completing. There are presently thousands of working police dogs helping cities all over the United States, let alone the world. Typically police dogs are unneutered male German Shepherds, although Labrador Retrievers, Belgian Malinois, Bloodhounds, Beagles, and Rottweilers are also used based off of the assigned task; all police dogs must possess intelligence, aggression, strength, and a keen sense of smell. Special training classes are offered for canines selected to serve as a working police dog where the dogs are capable of achieving certifications and honors upon graduation.

Since canines have a scent almost fifty percent stronger than humans, they are perfect for helping reveal smuggled people, goods, and drugs that try to make it into the United States otherwise undetected. As with police dogs, a Border Control dog is given a handler to work alongside; Belgian Malinois, German Shepherds, and Labradors are the preferred breeds for U.S. Border Patrol pups and their career is typically six to eight years. By the age of ten most Border Patrol dogs are retired; usually a retired Border Patrol canine will live out their life with their handler. Firefighters also work with four-legged friends, solving arson fires with K-9 units that consist of trained arson dogs, typically Labrador Retrievers, who are taught to sniff out evidence at the sight of an alleged arson crime. When a fire is suspected to be set on purpose an investigation goes underway and arson dogs are permitted to assist with their smelling skills, searching for the scent of an accelerant, including materials such as gas, butane, kerosene, and naphtha. Before a dog can become an arson dog they must finish necessary training; once on the job, arson dogs are involved in different types of searches, including fire searches, equipment searches, vehicle searches, crowd searches, clothing searches, and area searches. Proceeding graduation an arson dog is paired up with a handler, most arson dogs even stay with their handler, and go to live with them upon retirement.

18,5 Things Every Dog Needs,pets," Adopting a dog is pretty much like taking on the responsibility of raising a child. It is a wonderful experience, but there are so many things you need to get right if you want your dog to live a happy, healthy, and fulfilled life. In this article we discuss five basic things that every dog needs. This is not an all-inclusive list, but if you cover these five areas, you’ll have gone a long way towards being the best guardian you can be. The Best Nutrition Let’s start off by talking about nutrition. In this regard, you have three broad options, you can cook for your dog, you can feed your dog a raw diet, or you can feed your dog a dry kibble. As most dog guardians don't have time for the other two, so they'll likely end up feeding their dog a branded kibble. And that’s okay, as long as you understand that not all dry dog foods are the same. If you’re going to go this route you want to feed your dog the best quality food you can afford, so ask your vet for her recommendations. Veterinary Care You will have to ensure that your puppy gets all his vaccinations and follow up yearly or three-yearly booster shots. You’ll also have to take your dog for a veterinary check up every year, and make provision for any medical emergencies that may occur. Veterinary bills can be expensive, so you are strongly advised to take out a pet health insurance policy. Exercise Whether you have a hyperactive terrier or a laid-back mastiff, your dog needs exercise! Make sure that you have time in your busy schedule to walk the dog, and the fitness levels required to keep up. Choose a breed that matches your own level of activity and time availability. Don't, for example, choose a dog that needs hours of activity per day if all you can spare is 30 minutes. You're just setting yourself up for a major problem. Dog Training All dogs will benefit from training. Not only does it teach them to be obedient and well mannered, but it is also a great way of bonding with your dog. In addition is provides physical activity and, as most dogs love to learn, a mental challenge as well.Use a proven methodology, like clicker training, to train your dog. And always use a positive, reward-based approach. Love, Affection and Companionship Dogs are pack animals used to living in a social structure. They are only happy when they can interact with others. Depriving your dog of companionship and affection is incredibly cruel. He needs to be close to his family, not locked outside on his own. Take care of these five basic areas and you'll have every chance of raising a happy, well-adjusted dog. Your reward will be the love, loyalty and devotion you get in return."
19,The Joys Of Coton De Tulears??,pets," Most of you will probably be asking yourselves - what on earth is a Coton de Tulear?  You would be right to ask!  It is a very small dog!  History lesson coming up! Arriving in Madagascar - these little dogs appeared from over the seas on the ships where presumably they hunted the rats - who knows really?  There are many stories about them, but suffice it to say that they were beloved of the royal family and no-one else was allowed to have them. Possibly because they were carry size, lap size and very pretty - mainly being pure white, long haired and extremely pretty! One story which always amused me was that the  dogs - which used to roam in packs - not terriers I hasten to add - came across a broad river which they could not cross, there being no bridge and the water full of crocodiles.  Very clever these little dogs - so they started barking (which believe you me they are extremely good at - and loud!) and running up and down the bank until the crocodiles started to follow them. The main body of the pack then appeared at the edge of the water and rushed across on the backs of the crocodiles to the other side!  The crocodiles being stunned by this made no effort to stop the few who had been barking at them also running over their backs!! True or not - a lovely story to have a little dog outwit a large, ferocious crocodile!! Back to mine - yes, I have two of them! Another story, but this time it is absolutely true as to how I got my first one, Alika.  I used to have tibetan terriers who lived to a ripe old age and upon their demise - my life was awful!  I felt so lonely - no reason to go walking again as I felt.  However, one day several months later, I was having lunch with my sister when she tapped me on the arm and pointed.  I turned to see what she was looking at and my heart melted!! There, looking directly at me was this tiny, white ball of fluff with a shiny black nose and the biggest eyes I have ever seen on a little dog!  However, the strange thing was that they looked exactly like the eyes of my beloved tibetan.  Tears poured down my face and there followed the strangest of stories from that first encounter with a Coton de Tulear. Needless to say I wanted to know what, where, how much etc etc and was horrified when I was told that a puppy would probably cost me around £1500-£2000!!  They are, to this day, a rare breed in England and so command huge prices. Undeterred (??) I wanted to know if there was a breeder anywhere near the area and was told that there was one about 20 minutes drive from my home - where this puppy had come from in fact. No money - but that didn't stop me!  I got on the 'phone and called that afternoon.  In my mind I knew exactly what I wanted - small, white (ok that was a given!), female, not a puppy and with the right name - I am not a lover of dogs names being the same as human ones - I like them to be relevant to where they come from. Anyway, as it happened (as it always does!), she had a family pet Coton, called Alika (perfect!) who she was looking to home as felt she needed to be the sole dog.  Alika was 21 months old at that time.  Could I wait to visit?  No, I could not! I found my way to the breeder's in the next couple of days - was ushered into a large room where there was a fabulous Italian bloodhound - which she also bred.  I was informed that the dog would bark at me as it was very nervous and only responded to her - wrong!!  I am very much a dog person and I think it actually horrified here when she came back into the room and the dog was sitting at my feet being stroked!  Ho hum! She brought Alika into the room eventually (I was sitting on pins by this time!) and as soon as Alika saw me she let out this enormous howl and rushed over to me - straight onto my lap.  The breeder said that she had never heard the dog make that noise before and couldn't understand it (I did - it was the noise my tibetan made if I left him alone too long!) Alika then promptly refused to go to her owner, would have nothing to do with her and stayed firmly on my lap.  Then the rest of the family came in - about 10 of them altogether - and naturally wanted to say hello to me.  Alika was having none of it!!  'She's mine!  So she growled at them all until the moved off!! Finally, to cut a long story short as I don't want to bore you - it was very obvious to the breeder that Alika was meant to be mine but she wanted to think about it - as they do!  As I left Alika followed me to the door - crying.  At home I then spent the next 4 nights sending mind messages to Alika - misbehave; be impossible, show you are miserable etc.  Then I got the call - 'are you still interested in Alika?' Absolutely I said - she then told me how Alika had behaved once I was gone! Impossible, disobeyed everything, wouldn't eat, howled etc etc!!  Great! So she was obviously meant for me!  Down I went to collect her and got the deal of a lifetime as a result of Alika not being right for anyone else - half the price with 4 months to spread the payments - and Alika and I went home and she didn't even give a backward glance! After 4 years together - the bond is so intense between us - I felt that it needed to be lightened so I got a puppy.  Careful to avoid showing Alika any less affection than usual -she has utterly accepted him and they are amazing together!"
20,At Home Dog Care,pets," Every dog deserves to be pampered and while preserving a pristine puppy calls for extra TLC, the results are well worth it. Doggie grooming basics will keep your furry friend feeling invigorated and healthy. Just like us, canines call for brushing, bathing, nail clippings, and ear cleanings. Many dogs don't enjoy these grooming processes, so praising your pooch with love and a treat is suggested. If you lovingly work with your dear pal on the grooming process it will become a quick and easy routine that your dog just may grow to enjoy. Certain breeds even require some extra care. If you need some assistance on giving your pooch the works, look no further! Brushing your dog will do more than get rid of knots; tending to your pup's fur will assist in removing harmful dirt particles. Grooming with a dog brush will even help increase natural oils throughout your canine's coat for an unbeatable shine. While you are tending to your dog's fur, it will be an opportune time to know your buddy's body (new lumps will never go unnoticed). There are numerous types of combs and brushes accessible for grooming your deserving dog. Dog bristle brushes are generally used on all dog types; the longer the coat, the more spaced out and lengthy the bristles should be. Wire pin brushes work well with medium to long haired pups that sport curlier or wooly coats. No matter what kind of coat your canine has, remember to be gentle and avoid tugging. Almost all dogs should be combed against their fur's grain. When you first start grooming keep the brushing time short and sweet, eventually your furry friend will love the attention. A dog shedding blade is used as a regular dog brush for canines with double coats. At least once a month (depending on the breed and activities of the pooch) you should set aside a chosen bath time for your furry friend. Avoid using human hair care on your dog, instead utilize the dog shampoo and dog conditioner brands available. There's even doggie hair gel if you want to get super fashionable. To keep from drying your pup’s skin out, don't wash your pal more than once every two weeks, and use dry dog shampoo if you feel like they need a little sprucing up. Another way to provide a water-free bath is to sprinkle baking soda on your dog's coat and then brush off the excess; your pooch's first bath should not be until after five weeks of age. Keep bath water moderate rather than hot and fill the tub to just under knee level. Be sure your darling dog is calm and comfortable; you may have to ease them before bath time begins. During scrub down, remain gentle and understanding. Let your pup know the cleansing procedure is completely harmless by talking in a kind tone and handling them with love. Massage the dog grooming products into your canine's coat with your fingertips and then rinse accordingly. Always remember to have a towel around for drying off afterward (we don't want Spot to catch a cold!). If your pal is brave enough, there are also pet dryers available for a quicker finish time. Many dogs dread a nail clipping, although you should try to maintain your dogs nails once a week with dog nail clippers. Helping your pup get use to regular nail trimmings may take patience, but it can be done. Instill the practice early on with your dog by giving treats afterward, along with hugs, scratches behind the ear, and words of encouragement. Always use the nail trimmers with awareness on your pup's paws, trimming too close will result in pain for your pooch. Know where to cut down to before taking on the assignment of trimming your dog's nails. If you look at the nail you will notice a pink area further down where the vein is; trim above the pink. Cutting the nail too short is known as ""quickening"" and is severely painful for your dog. If there is a misfortune make sure you have a nail cauterize handy (it will stop the bleeding with heat). Your dog may not like the idea of having an ear cleaning, so be sure to remain tolerant and affectionate. Try petting your pal while you clean their ears. Doing the cleansing in the bathroom is the best idea; it will help for an easier clean-up. There are doggie ear cleaning washes and doggie ear cleaning powders available (or you may concoct your own wash using half white vinegar and half rubbing alcohol). To start, put a generous helping of cleaner into your dog's ear and rub at the base for thirty seconds. After the half minute rub, allow your canine to shake their head free of excess cleaner. With a cotton ball, wipe down the noticeable part of the inside of your dog's ear to finish the cleaning. Don't use Q-tips on your dog and maintain a gentle touch throughout the process. Some dog breeds require extra attention when it comes to grooming. If your canine bears an unruly coat, extra wrinkles, or sensitive eyes/ears, you may find yourself taking on some additional work. Professional groomers are always available to take the load off your hands, or you can tackle the tasks yourself if you are confident of your efficiency. Grooming doesn't have to be dull; there are many fun accessories to add to your canine's cleaning time. There are a wide variety of scented dog shampoos and conditioners, as well as designer doggie colognes for extra good smelling pooches. Drying your pal off can be efficient with a pair of microfiber dog drying gloves instead of the everyday towel. After some fun in the tub there are cozy dog bathrobes to lounge around in until clean coats have dried completely. If your pup gets icky eyes, use some doggie eye wipes to clear up any messes. Top off a solid cleansing with a fresh breath tablet for dogs, everything about your canine will smell nice!"

1,Dog Wheelchair Reviews,pets," When deciding on what kind of dog wheelchair, dachshund wheelchair, small dog wheelchair, canine wheelchair or wheelchair for small dogs, would best work for your dog you need to consider the following points: Weight of the wheelchair? How strong are your dog's good legs for propelling itself around? Can you clean the wheelchair easily; are the straps removable and washable? How strong is it constructed for your dog's weight? Are there any lower bars, straps, and etc. that can get in the way of bathroom chores? Time constraints. How long will it take to get the chair? How easy will it be to get your dog in and out of the wheelchair? How strong are the wheels and do they have ball bearings for easy of pulling? Appearance? Will it be comfortable for your dog? In considering the above points we compared the top 7 Internet dog wheelchair manufacturers. Most of the aluminum units were very similar in construction and seem to be well build and attractive chairs. What we noticed mostly was the complex nature of the units and difficulty in assembly and or placing your dog in the chair. The biggest down fall of these units are their price. The approximate price of the lowest cost unit with shipping is $210.00, the next two were around $280.00 and the two most expensive were closer to $400.00. Some of these prices are too expensive for the average person to afford. There were two PVC dog wheelchairs, one of which had two lower bars that would definitely get messy when your dog would go to the bathroom. Plus it was quite clumsy and the price was around $240.00. Some units have bars that support the dogs weight that go right over the belly area that we believe would definitely be uncomfortable instead of straps which we believe would be very uncomfortable. All in all I believe for the price the PVC units are easier to use less price and very light weight. The other PVC unit by wheelchairs for small dogs met all of the above criteria, with a price very reasonable price. I believe the most important factor is your dogs comfort. Secondary is the dog's ability to use the wheelchair. Be careful on picking your wheelchair. When chosen correctly for your dog a wheelchair can give him or her the mobility and quality of life they deserve. A final point when researching on the Internet for a dog wheelchair be sure to check different search phrases. Dog wheelchairs are called many different things. There is not any one definitive phrase to describe a dog wheelchair. Many terms are used such as Dachshund wheelchair, wheelchair for small dogs, dog wheelchair, dog wheelchairs, canine wheelchair, wheelchairs for dogs, disabled dog cart and many more. This being such a new device there is no one phrase that the industry has settled on and customers have learned. So in searching try different names. Usually though the phrase dog wheelchair or wheelchair for small dogs will get you adequate results."
2,You are the TOP DOG - Letting your wolf dog know you are the Alpha,pets," By Edye Marin, Professional Wolf Hybrid Breeder Your Wolf Hybrid Dog needs to know that you are the leader of its pack, thus giving it the proper perspective of its place and yours in the world. You may find this list of rules helpful to ensure your dog understands your mutual places. If you own a wolf hybrid, you should consider heeding these rules. Canines need to have a clear understanding of their place in the pack.  A wolfdog lacking that insight will not be happy or fulfilled. Some wolfdog behaviors might not be what they seem.  For example separation anxiety may seem like your wolf dog is destructive when you leave the house. When in reality it is nervous being left home alone.  Wolves are social animals which live in packs, thus they do not do well being left alone for extended periods of time. The primary way to communicate with your wolf dog that you are its pack leader is to take it for a walk. Now, don’t consider the typical walk most humans take with their dog, where the dog is actually taking the human for a walk.  You are going on a pack walk where the wolf is made to heel beside or behind you. This is most important for all dogs, as in a canine's mind, the pack leader will always lead the way. A dog must not be allowed to sniff or eliminate anytime it wishes, but when you allow it. The dog should be concentrating on following you - the human pack leader. This pack type walk should be done daily. Not only will this release built up energy, but it will satisfy the dog's instinct to migrate, which all dogs possess. Dog's who have excess energy bottled up inside them and who do not have their migration instinct met will develop various instability issues that most people mistake for being breed traits. All pack leaders eat first.  When you give your wolfdog its food, eat a small snack first while it is watching, lay the snack near the wolf’s food so that it thinks you are eating out of its bowl. Remember, the leader always eats first.  As it is eating push its face out of the food bowl and mix the food with your hand.  That lets it know the food is yours but you are done and it can have the rest. It also leaves your scent on the food, making it yours. Don’t feed table scraps to the wolves during a meal, as tempting as it may be.  If there are leftovers you want to give it, put them in its bowl when you are through eating and ready to leave the table.  That way the alphas have eaten first and it eats last. Feedings must be at a scheduled time, as you determine when those in the pack eat. You should not let the dog go through any doorway first. The leader of the pack always goes first. If the dog does not stay behind the humans, the dog must be told to ""stay"" and given the command to ""come"" after all humans have passed through.  If the dog is allowed to go first it is then in the place of pack leader. You should never go to the dog, it should always come to you. A basic obedience command such as ""Sit"" or ""Come"" should be given before pleasurable interaction with the dog. The children should give the dogs commands at least once a day and reward with a treat when the command is followed. This builds a child’s position as the pack leader as well. A simple ""Sit"" will do. No treat should be awarded if the dog does not follow the command.  Show your dog it does not get anything for free. Its food, water, treats, even praise/love have to be earned by doing something. Even something as little as sit or  come. Make sure the dog takes the treat from your hands gently. Do not ever allow the dog to snatch the treat from your hand. You should not lay on the floor to watch TV when the dog is around and no one should roll around the floor playing with the wolfdogs, as a human should never put himself in an equal or lesser height position than the wolf. You are the one who greets newcomers first, your wolf-hybrid is the last who gets attention (the pack leader is the one who greets newcomers and lets the rest know when it is safe to greet the newcomer) If your wolfdog is laying in your path, do not walk around the wolf, make it move. During the time you are establishing your higher pack position, no hugs should be given to the dog by you, as a dominant dog may consider this a challenge of power. If you establish eye contact with the wolfdog, the wolf must avert its gaze first. If the human averts first, the wolf will feel like it has a higher power position. Tell the children not to have staring contest with the wolf, as if they avert or blink first, it will only reinforce, in the wolfdog’s mind, that it is pack leader. Ideally, wolfdogs should not sleep in your bed. In the wolf world, the most comfortable place to sleep is reserved for the higher members of the pack. If a wolfdog is allowed to sleep on the bed, the dog must be invited up and not be allowed to push the humans out of their way. Making them sleep at the foot of the bed rather than, for example, on your pillow, is best.  The wolf-hybrid should never be invited to get on the bed before the human. Wolfdogs must never be allowed to mouth or bite anyone at any time, including in play. Any attention given to the wolfdog, including petting should be given when the human decides attention is to be given (absolutely no petting when the wolf nudges or paws you or your hand. This would be letting the dog decide and reinforcing, in his mind, that he is higher on the scale than the human.) You, not the wolf, must start and finish all games of fetch or play with toys. Wolfdogs should not be allowed to lie on your furniture, except by invitation of the leader of the pack who always gets the most comfortable spot. Dogs belong on the floor. If you do decide to allow your dog on the furniture, you must be the one who decides when it is allowed up and you must be the one who decides when it is to get off, by inviting it up and telling it to get down. No tug-of-war, as this is a game of power and you may lose the game giving the wolf a reinforcement (in its mind) of pack leader (not all trainers agree on this). Wolves need to be taught a ""Drop it"" or release command. Any objects the wolfdog has in its possession should be able to be taken away by all humans. Wolves own no possessions, everything belongs to you. They are all on ""loan"" from the human family. You should be able to handle or remove any item at all times from the wolfdog with no problems from the animal. Even if you are taking a chicken bone out of the wolfdog's mouth. Wolfdogs should not be allowed to pull on the leash. When they do this they are leading the way and it is your job to lead the way and show that you are higher up in the pack order. (In the wild, the leader of the pack always leads the way; the pack leader leads the hunt.) When you put its food dish down, it must wait until you give the ""OK"" to eat. Place its food on the ground and tell it to wait. If it darts at the food, block it with your body. You can point at it and tell it, ""No, Wait"" They read each other’s energy by reading body language, and your dog can read yours. Yes, your dog can read your emotions. So stand tall and think ""Big"" and stay confident. Do not be nervous, your wolfdog will sense this and assume you are weak. It is this weakness that triggers a wolf to try and take over (for the good of the pack, the pack needs a strong leader). Give the wolf-hybrid a previously taught command before giving them their food. If a wolfdog does not follow the command (i.e. to sit), he does not eat. When he does respond to the command, you invite him to eat his food. Wolfdogs should never be left unsupervised with children or anyone who cannot maintain leadership over the dog.  Sometimes family members also need to be trained. Last but certainly not least... when you are around your wolfdog avoid emotions such as fear, anxiety, harshness or nervousness. Your wolf can sense these emotions and will see you as weak. This will escalate your problem as your wolf feels an even stronger need to be your leader. Think Big and Powerful and be calm, assertive, and consistent. Remember, there is no hiding your emotions from your wolfdog. They can in a sense, read our minds, in reading our body language. Picture yourself, in your own mind as big, powerful and very sure of yourself. Pull your shoulders back and stand up straight. This is your number one resource when it comes to communicating with your wolfdog. Your wolf-hybrid will be happy and secure knowing he has a strong pack leader to care for him or her.

3,Some Things To Know About Dog Allergies Treatment,pets," Having a doggie for a companion can be one of the most enjoyable experiences a person can have and you want them to be healthy. When they develop skin conditions it might be time to consider the possibility of dog allergies treatment. Let's take a look at some of the causes for canines to have allergic reactions. Regular bathing prevents many diseases. Humans usually take a bath every day to prevent odors, but bathing also helps to keep people from developing skin conditions. Canines also need to be bathed regularly to prevent build up of dirt and grime in their coats. Make sure to clean their ears so they don't get ear mites which cause them to scratch them constantly. Try changing brands of dog food. Take the time to read the labels on the brands you have been feeding. Certain artificial preservatives are known to have allergic reactions in canines. Those which use grape seed extract are a better choice because it is an all natural preservative. Also take note of any human foods you allow them to have. Sometimes table scraps can contain something the dog is allergic to. Nervousness can result in skin conditions and allergies. Certain breeds of dogs are just naturally high strung and all of this energy needs a healthy means of being released. It might not be enough exercise to just take them for a walk around the block. Try taking them to a dog park, and allow them to make canine friends. This can help calm them down and avoid itchy skin conditions. Proper exercise can keep your dog healthier. There are some months of the year when weather conditions make it impossible to get outside and spend enough time getting exercise. Indoor dog toys can help keep them occupied, but mental energy can be used up by play games with them that require them to think things through. Hide and seek can be great fun for a dog, especially if the objects to be found are their favorite doggie treats. Provide them with plenty of water. The human body is made up mostly of water and this is why we are told to drink plenty of liquids. The same holds true for canines, who actually do sweat from glands in their paws. If you are gone to work during the day, make sure they have plenty of water until you return because dogs can get serious skin conditions from lack of sufficient liquids. Give them a good vitamin and mineral supplement. Most people think that a good brand of dog food will supply all of the vitamins and minerals needed by their canines. Some dogs need more of these supplements than others. A lack of some vitamins can cause skin irritations, so find out about giving them supplements. Whether your furry friend needs dog allergies treatment or not, they should have regular visits to a qualified veterinarian who will examine them for possible skin conditions. Each year requires vaccinations, and they should be checked for worms to keep them happy and healthy."
4,Dealing With Dog Hot Spots,pets," On a regular basis, your dog is likely to cross paths with any number of sticky situations. No, we are not talking about sticky foods, but a more serious conversation about skin problems, such as dangerous allergies or bacteria that may cause infections you were not anticipating. Where these infections localize are called dog hot spots. Dog hot spots are some of the most uncontrollable areas of an infection that create discolored rashes on your dogs skin, creating a day of painful scratching and burning. The worst part is, a day of scratching for a dog is nothing out of the ordinary, not in the least, which means one needs to do more to care for their dog. To be preventing the likeliness of these dog hot spots, as owners, you can do a couple of things, which are pretty basic seeming in scope, but can go a long way. The first is to bathe your dog on a more regular basis. If you can provide your dog with a specialized shampoo to help treat the skin, or toughen it, you really improve your pet's chances in fighting off these hot spots. The second is basic. Check! Just by moving around your dogs fur to see if any anomalies appear, you are saving yourself time and your dog a bad day of illness. What you should try to avoid doing though, is writing off your dog's illness as just another case of fleas. While common, fleas are not always the case and you could end up prolonging treatment of the real case. That said, when you think you have encountered a single hot spot, or a number of dog hot spots, it is extremely important to know exactly what it is you are dealing with. Due to the significance of needing to know, we highly, highly recommend a good veterinarian. After all, who could possibly say a vet has not gone through proper training to know what the rash is? We certainly wouldn't, not when they have invested a great portion of their life's time, energy, and resources to attend medical school! A vet will be able to tell you right off if you are dealing with fleas, or if the hives, rash, inflammation, what have you, is the result of a larger issue. If it is, they can usually prescribe you a special cream or medication to eradicate the infection and target the dog hot spots. While the cost of prescription drugs is never the most welcomed circumstance, it is often the most effective, and letting the condition go untreated could allow for a bigger medical expense to enter the door by way of your dog's infection. In the end, it is all about caring for your pet. While dog hot spots can arise from any number of sensitive issues or reactions, they will only go away thanks to one, and that's you. So do not let your dog go through its day without at least taking the time to pet it down and really make sure it is in good health. You will thank yourself for it later, and so will your dog!"
5,Learning About Dog Skin Allergies,pets," If you are dealing with a sort of skin problem, or just reflecting on when you did, you are probably wandering into memories of pubescent life and teenager angst when your face was covered with zits and you were getting nervous about going into the public eye with them. In a nut shell, worrying about skin problem before major events was high school. Only, you were probably not considering those pimples to be skin allergies. And if that's true then you definitely weren't thinking that your family pet could get such a thing, or maybe that dog skin allergies were much like humans. And that's the truth of the matter that many do not realize, and that's that dog skin allergies can be just as critical a concern as human's. Not to mention the fact that dog skin allergies have symptoms that might actually just appear to be regular dog behavior. Let's be honest, when was the last time you looked suspiciously at a dog scratching its ear? With all that hair covering up their actual layer of skin, it can be a difficult game to detect rashes. That is how dog skin allergies seem to turn up. The dog might attract the allergy from a random source, and then the days go by that he or she is experiencing the effects of the allergy. Only no one exactly notices because there is nothing visible, and there is nothing out of the ordinary about a dog taking its hind leg to the back of the ear. In fact, it could be more alarming if your pet is not demonstrating such a habitual love. But, dog skin allergies are serious and can be brought on by many factors. Let's just go to the main thought when we see our dog scratching up and down, and that's fleas. However, while fleas may be a serious concern at times, they can also get in the way. Many people will treat for fleas not grasping that it could be a different allergic reaction all together, putting off really tending to the situation at hand. How did those reactions occur? Simple, from allergens in house dust, in pollen outside, or just grass outside that the dog was rolling around in. It's almost impossible to tell what triggered it. Lastly, there are your basic food allergens. These can result from the brand of food you have your dog on, whether it is wet food or raw food. Or, they can result from giving your dog that table scrap he or she begged so intently for. Just so you are not left in the dark though, let's talk about some quick symptoms in addition to the causes other than increased scratching. Those would include swelling, which will be most noticeable around the eyes, hives, and rashes. There you have it, a new thing to worry about on your plate. We promise that was not our sole intention, but one needs to understand dog skin allergies so that they can prepare properly for their pet. And that is a mission we are happy to be a part of."
6,What to do About Those Dog Skin Problems,pets," Take a moment to recall the most recent morning you work to feel a dabbing pressure on a part of your face. Then, as you made your way out of your bedroom and into the bathroom, you naturally found that pressure to be pimple you were not sure what to do with. Well, consider that scenario for a dog. Sounds bizarre right? Maybe a dog doesn't have to deal with the same social pressures, but could you imagine not being able to find your pimple or rash, or itch and treat it in any way? Many people do not realize the difficulty of dog skin problems and the larger effects that they can sometimes have. Now, there are plenty of reasons surrounding the topic of dog skin problems, and it does not have to do with some kooky theory about fried food after five in the evening or about having an excess amount of chocolate. Actually, just as a quick extra rule of thumb, dogs and chocolate do not mix. Moving on though to our original point of topic. Dog skin problems present themselves in a number of ways and likewise can be traced to a number of different sources. It isn't so important whether the reaction deals with hives, a set of rashes, or even some less likely inflammation. The point is that they are still experiencing an allergic reaction and you need to know the correct source of the reaction in order to do the right thing about it. However, as likely as the problem is to be fleas, which dogs are quite susceptible to, and come in continual contact with when outdoors, one can never be sure. In fact, a good number of people tend to treat every skin problem they find as if it is fleas, sometimes adding to the problem, or, at the very least, prolonging its improvement. To no one's surprise, dog's love to get into every corner and crawl space, and most of the time, any stranger's petting hand. These are where allergens are found unfortunately. Yet, what does one have to look out for you may be wondering, and the answer is pretty extensive. For example, when your dog is out just on one of its daily walks and looking about, they are already exposed to a whole number of elements one would not have thought would cause dog skin problems. Let's see, on the basic neighborhood walk a dog will find pollen, dirt filled with insects, various grasses that may have been treated with chemicals, other dogs, other people, free floating dust, and, lets not kid ourselves, the waste or urine of other dogs marking their territory. So where could a dog come into contact with a bacteria or allergen that could cause harm to their skin? Take your pick. In short, there are any number of causes and symptoms in your dearest pet's daily life that may cause dog skin problems. Sure they may have a range of seriousness, but anything left untreated can cause some ugly problems. Don't put your dog through the hassle, they wouldn't do it to you!"
7,About Your Dog's Allergies Treatment,pets," As we navigate through the hectic schedules of our days, it can be a frustrating routine to maintain our health, especially if it ever lingers on us like a bad cough will. Knowing what it can be like for us then, means that when the one who has bad health is our pet, is our family dog, then everything gets murkier. After all, we can't just assess the dog like we can our own bodies. A common problem for dogs then are allergens, just as with humans. So when such a thing surfaces on our dogs, it is vitally important for us to find a dog allergies treatment that is going to correct the situation. However, allergies can be a really tough topic to tackle, and even more so when you take into consideration where it is a dog hangs out during the day. That means we generally need a dog allergies treatment that is going to keep fighting long after its first use. A misconception is that dogs are only allergic to foods. The truth is that they are allergic, or can be, to anything they come in contact with. That means as soon as you let them off the leash, you have to know that wherever they wander off to or decide to sniff out and investigate will be combated against. Let's just think in terms of a limited scope of a dog's day, which so often includes to local park that is up and around the corner. Once free to roam in a park a dog can stumble upon any number of allergy producing causes. They can have a bad interaction with an insect, with the pollen floating in through the air, with the lake water should they lap some up, with picnickers, and especially the food left behind of the picnickers, and then just outdoor crossings with nuts and berries and mushrooms. It is almost impossible to say where to draw the line about what they may find in a local park. For this reason, one must err on the side of caution. Being lenient with your animal's health and care can lead to a whole host of problems, but when you throw in the unpredictable nature of allergies, you can see where the dangers double. As described once before, dogs take on similar allergic reactions as humans, meaning their level of dog allergies treatment can also require a certain level of need. The treatment might have to work to eradicate unwanted swelling to any juncture of the body, large rashes beneath the dog's coat, and just spare hives. All of these conditions gone untreated could situate into something far worse if not cognizant. Now that you have learned all this, it is time to take the time to meet with a vet. They have the resources and the knowledge to get your dog the best possible dog allergies treatment and keep their daily life sustained. So, what exactly could you be waiting for? This is your wake up call."
8,Nurture a Healthy And Happy Baby Bearded Dragon With These Simple to Follow Tips,pets," The latest rage among the pet owners is to have possession of a bearded dragon. There are many who look out for baby bearded dragon. The little pet reptile requires extra attention and care as compared to the adult and juvenile bearded dragons. Many reptile pet owners have been constantly checking out the little bearded dragons because they are cute and fun to play with. However lagging of experiences on the care of these baby reptiles can cause life threatening risk. For the first few months after the bearded dragons have born, you need to devote more care such as avoid too frequent handling to reduce the stress, small prey size, and more calcium intake. Even when the bearded dragon baby is at age of 8 weeks, they are considered hatching or very young. They are most likely prone to anxiety, and it would affect its growth and health. If you are chasing one for yourself, make sure that it is at least 8 weeks old, and take good care of the pet. There are numerous points to be considered while adopting baby bearded dragon which can help in making him a happy pet like: Housing: They do not require big enclosure size and ambience space. If the cage is too large, they may find it difficult chasing down and hunting for the prey. If the enclosure is too big, they may feel insecure living in it. Smaller enclosure will make them feel more secure. They do not require big enclosure. If the cage is too large, they may find it difficult chasing down and hunting for the prey and may feel insecure living in it. Smaller enclosure will make them feel more secure. Try to avoid place that is busy and high footage traffic, especially when there are children running around and may get a chance to hit the enclosure. The disturbances may always stress them up. Feeding: A baby bearded dragon feeding should be done more often as they need more fats and protein from the food for rapid growth. They should be fed atleast 2 to 3 times a day. The main concern in feeding baby bearded dragon is the food size, especially insects such as crickets. The proper food size should be 1/3 of the hatchling’s head and the length should be smaller than the distance between their eyes. Feeding hatchling with small prey is a must as large items can lead to paralysis and even death. Besides small crickets, small bearded dragons need greens, fruits and vegetables at this time as well. One of the feeding principles for baby bearded dragon is to offer them plenty of water. You may mist their head, cage wall, and decorations with water until they start to lap the water droplets. Handling: When it is the first try to hold them, they may resist, but approach them slowly. Try to pick them up from side instead of top. This will reduce the risk of being scared. Reach out the bottom of the body part, and support their body with another hand, let the body feel that it is standing firmly on your hands."

12,Cats and Dog Can Coexist,pets," As animal lovers we have had an assortment of pets throughout the years but cats and dogs have been the primary choice when it came to our 4 legged children. Having deciding early on to only adopt rescue animals, we often had behavior issues to address before peace would reign. When you are introducing new members to your home there are facts that must be considered. Dogs are territorial and will often be aggressive to any new addition to their home. Cats have the same tendencies and will fight to defend their territories and mark their spaces to show their dominance. There Is Hope It is a challenge to get dogs and cats to coexist but it can be done with time and patience.  The usual process is to separate the two physically however this is not a practical long term solution. Though caging and closed rooms can be used in the beginning for safety, creating a plan of action for new behaviors can help you achieve harmony with time and practice. The First Steps Obedience in the most important factor when introducing your older pets to the newest member.  Both cats and dogs can be taught basic commands and NO must be understood immediately.  Chances are your new pet will understand the command by word or by tone but it can also be reemphasized with treats and affection. While the older pets are contained, allow the new pet to slowly acclimatize themselves to the new surroundings and smells.  By letting them wander on their own for short periods, they can scatter their own scent within the home which allows the other to become familiar to the new scent. Once the new pet is secured, allow the older pet to investigate  and acquaint themselves to the new scents and reward them positively for acceptable behavior.  This stage may take some time for both cats and dogs to adjust but the more they feel safe the faster the process. The Introduction Once you see signs of acceptance you can introduce physical contact.  With each pet being held securely and only when they are calm in each other’s presence, you can allow them to sniff each other. Be ready to correct negative behavior and offer protection from aggression swiftly. By repeating this process often and increasing the time in each other’s company, they will begin to learn to adapt to the new situation. Dogs are pack animals and are happy to be with their families and though cats are aloof, they too enjoy affection from their owners.  In time you will begin to see that your dog and cat can coexist peacefully without fear or aggression. You may find they become the best of friends and they may agree to give each other a wide berth. Whatever the case, you can teach both dogs and cats to be comfortable in their new home safely."

As carnivores, cats need: Protein from meat or fish Fatty acids Vitamins Minerals Water Taurine As meat eating animals, cats don't really need carbohydrates such as rice and grains.

16,Owning a Pet Sugar Glider,pets," Choosing a pet is not a simple decision.  It is very important to carefully consider what kind of pet will suit your lifestyle well and whether it will fit in with your family if applicable.  You also need to be prepared for the responsibility that comes with owning a pet, such as feeding and grooming it and ensuring it gets sufficient exercise and attention.  Pets should not be considered a fashion accessory or something that fills the here and now.  They are a long-term responsibility and should be treated as such. If you think you can handle the responsibility of having a pet, an unusual pet choice that is often overlooked is a sugar glider.  Sugar gliders are classed as exotic pets but they are extremely social and they often bond well with their owners.  Many owners choose to carry them around in their pockets or in a bonding pouch and it’s easy to see why – they have cuteness in spades! Sugar gliders are marsupials that are initially very vulnerable after birth and depend heavily on their mothers.  Luckily for them, they get to spend the majority of this vulnerable period safe and warm within the mother’s pouch. Sugar gliders are native to Indonesia, Australia, and Papua New Guinea.  Their bodies are about 6 inches long when they are fully grown, as are their tails. Adults weigh about 5 ounces.  Sugar gliders have opposable thumbs, which makes them excellent climbers.  They really love to climb, with a skill that would make any free climber proud, and therefore you need to ensure they have vertical climbing space in their cages, which helps to keep them entertained and provides them with exercise. They have skin known as pantagium which stretches from their wrists to their ankles and they use this skin for gliding.  Sugar gliders often glide between trees in the wild but since the pantagium is flexible this allows the sugar gliders to walk and climb unrestricted. The lifespan of a sugar glider is about 10 to 15 years in captivity.  They are nocturnal so they are asleep for most of the day but when they are awake they are very sociable and thrive on attention.  If you do not have a lot of free time to devote to a sugar glider, consider buying a pair of gliders so that they can keep each other company as it is not fair on the sugar glider to leave it alone for long stretches of time without any attention.  It is important to highlight however that unneutered opposite-sex pairs will breed quickly so make sure to check they are neutered if you don’t want to find you’ve become a breeder! It is always a good idea to fully research a pet and how to take care of it before you decide to get one.  Sugar gliders are relatively easy to care for and are extremely sociable creatures, so if you can provide the attention and care they require, sugar gliders make sweet pets that are sure to glide into your affections."
17,Training Your Dog? Try These Ideas For 100% Success,pets," Dogs of all breeds think the same way. Once you get a better understanding of how a dog thinks, you will be more efficient in training your dog. For those that don't understand that mindset, read on to gain some insight. It is vitally important that your dog is treated in the same manner, given the same commands and rewarded similarly by every member of your family. This is the only way to ensure the training sticks. Consistency is important in your training method, as dogs respond the best when their training is consistent. If a dog is treated differently by his trainers, he will become confused and unsure of the correct behaviors. If you are trying to train your puppy, never play a tug-of-war game with it. This type of game will encourage your puppy to bite your hands, and think it is okay. Any type of chasing or wrestling game will also do the same. Once your puppy is older and well trained, you can play rough games. Crate training is very beneficial, but there can be difficulties that the following tips can help with. If the dog doesn't want to get in the crate try putting a chew toy in it and close the gate when they're not there. If a dog sees something in the crate that they want, they will desire to enter it. Open the door, and praise them when they go inside. Implement dog training methods which will lead to a successful outcome when dealing with chewing. Even more so, an inappropriately-chewing dog needs to be protected. Some household items can be harmful to your dog if they are chewed upon. If you pour too much information and training into your puppy, it will actually be counterproductive. A puppy only has short bursts of energy and doesn't have a long attention; you've got to keep your training sessions positive and short. If you try to do too much, the puppy will probably not remember much except that it was an unpleasant experience, and that will make it more difficult when the time comes for the next training session. A dog needs to be trained from the outset. Dogs find it much harder to break existing bad habits than to learn new, positive ones. For example, if you are adamant about your dog not being a beggar, then never make any exceptions to handing him food from your table. Your dog must feel secure and confident to be able to absorb training correctly. When the dog feels insecure, they will be more likely to exhibit bad behavior. Make your dog's surroundings comfortable and safe in order for this not to happen. You may have to consult a professional when training your dog. Dog training may not go as you had planned and this is when you need to consider seeking a professional. A trainer can help with your training efforts, and show you where there may be problems and give you the solutions you need to be successful at dog training. Learning your dogs individuality is an important step when training your dog. When you know and understand this principle, you will be more successful in your efforts. Make sure to tailor the training to a dog's specific personality."
18,"How To Have A Happy, Well Behaved Dog Using Positive Dog Training",pets," A dog can mean a companion waiting for you when you get home, a walking buddy, and a pal you can always play with. However, it can also mean torn-up shoes, incessant barking, and a general lack of obedience. Positive dog training can alleviate these problems, but it sometimes feels like your dog just won't learn. This article will provide some advice that will help make your dog a friend, not a foe. Spaying or neutering your dog can stop a lot of behavioral problems before they even start. Territorial marking, inappropriate soiling and even aggression can be a result of sexual maturation. By neutering or spaying your animals, you can stop your animal from roaming if they ever get out of your house by accident. Spaying and neutering is relatively painless with modern veterinary technology, and your dog will benefit from it for life. Be sure to take the time to teach your dog his name from the start. You are going to use his name in all of your future training. Use his name when you feed him, calling him for walks and for play time. Be sure to use his name at least twenty times a day and never punish him for coming when you say his name. Make sure to get everyone involved in positive dog training. If you are the only member of the family working with Fido's behavior, then the other members of the family are giving him mixed signals. Consistency is extremely important in dog training. Also make sure that everyone is using the same key words and rewards so that the behavior will be reinforced correctly. Off and down are two different things to a dog, so make sure you aren't confusing him. The earlier you start training your dog the better. It is much easier to train a young puppy than it is an older dog. This is not to say that older dogs cannot be taught new things, however, it does take longer and more perseverance to train a dog the older it is. Remember that your positive dog training is going on 24 hours a day. Do not make the mistake of thinking that you are only training your dog during your obedience classes and practice sessions. Your dog is watching and learning from you during every interaction you have with it, so be sure you are always reinforcing good behavior. A great tip for positive dog training is to make sure you do not use conflicting command words towards your dog. For example, do not tell your dog to do something you do not want and then punish him for it. This will just confuse your dog and lead to failure. Allowing your new dog gradual access to all areas of your home will greatly aid you in positive dog training and will spare damage to couches, shoes and floors. As your dog learns not to do things like jump, scratch, and chew, open more doors to him. Many make the mistake of allowing full reign of all rooms, which really just offers the dog more opportunity to do the wrong thing. Now that you have found some useful positive dog training tips, it is time to put them into action. Before starting any training, make sure that your dog does not have any health issues that can make training harder. Read up on the specific breed of dog that you have and have fun with him."

1,How to Teach Your Bulldog Hand Signals!,pets," The combination of hand signals and voice signals seems to work the best. This is assuming your not working with a deaf dog. Hand Signals can come in very handy in public places, dog parks for example where many people are yelling commands to there pet. Directions: Teaching hand signals should be easy and fun. You can try teaching only hand signs but it will likely take much longer then a combination of voice and hand signals. The quickest way to teach your dog hand signs is to simply first teach the trick using a vocal command. Once Lucky is proficient with the command, simply begin using the hand signal each time you say the command. Lucky will soon relate the signal with the vocal command. At this point you can begin practicing with the hand only. There are countless hand signals you can use. Such as make an ""OK"" sign with your hand or making a sweeping gesture with your arm. There is no set standard for canine hand signals simply make some up as you go. But to get you started here are some examples: Signal for DOWN, with your hand palm side down, raise and then lower your hand. Make the gesture of pushing down. Signal for SPEAK, with your hand make the duck quacking or the old sock puppet talking movement. This movement is accomplished by repeatedly touching all of your fingers to your thumb all at once. Signal for SIT, raise your index finger (like saying wait) and then point down. Signal for GO POTTY, use one hand, make a fist and place your thumb between the index and middle finger then rock your fist back and forth. You can also make the fist as described then move your hand in a circle as your arm is pointing to the potty spot where you want your dog to go potty. Consistency is the important thing here; give the same signal each time for dog goes potty. These are just a few examples. You can really be creative here; the key is making the signal a clear gesture. You will notice professionals with field dogs for example make fairly large gestures likely so the dog can see the gesture from a distance. You don't want to make the signal for ""return the ball"" a slight signal such as wiggling one figure as your dog will not be able to see the gesture after you throw the ball 100' away! Have fun with this and as always have patience with your dog."

When you choose the right dog training classes, it also can help to build the bond between you and your animal even further. So regardless of whether you are in Fort Lauderdale, Florida or Oakland, California, be sure that you choose a dog trainer that is going to assist you through the process. The food that you feed your animal is also going to be something that needs to be considered as well.

What you should do is some research into the types of foods that are available and what is going to be a reasonable choice in this regard. Some people go all out, feeding their dogs a raw food diet, while others will simply want to choose a dog food that is well-known for its quality and ethical practices. It may cost a little bit now, but it will make up for it in the long run because of the health and happiness of your animal. Specific problems may occur with an animal, which would include aggressiveness, barking, or the tendency to want to run away. These are things that often need to be addressed by the dog trainer specifically. It is important for you to handle these problems instead of simply ignoring them and hoping that they go away. These are difficulties that can not only hurt you and your family, they can be a burden on anyone in the area. Finally, make sure that you're looking after the health of your dog by taking them to the veterinarian regularly and making sure that they are protected against some of the problems that are indicative of canines. This will include parasites as well as specific health problems that will vary from one animal to the next. Choose a veterinarian that is going to take their time with you and your animal, providing what is necessary to ensure the health of your pet."
4,"My Dog Has Lupus.  No Really, He Has Lupus",pets," My wife used to joke about my 8 year old German Shepherd (""Toby"") as she stated that she wanted to go and get him a nose job.  This past year, his nose started to get extremely dry and the skin actually started to peel.  Being the bad pet owner that I am, I just thought it was due to the weather and kept on as normal.  I figured if it was something that was hurting him he would show signs of pain or discomfort and I would get it checked out.  My wife’s joke became common and we went on with our lives as normal. A few months ago, I received a telephone call from my wife.  She stated that Toby’s nose appeared to be extremely irritated, that it seemed to be causing him discomfort, and that she believed that he had Lupus.  I was very attentive to her until she said ""Lupus"" at which point I began to laugh hysterically.  Not that Lupus is funny as it is not.  It is a serious autoimmune disease that inflicts approximately 5 million people worldwide.  The reason for the laughter is because of HouseMD.  This is one of our favorite television shows (and those of you who watch it will understand) and the most common diagnosis (when the doctors on the show cannot think of anything else) is Lupus.  It has become a trade mark of the television show and a ""House MD Lupus"" montage can even be found on YouTube.  I just naturally thought that my wife was joking.  However, she wasn’t. After I stopped laughing, my wife told me to look it up on Google.  I type in the search ""lupus in dogs"" and went to ""Google images"" (do it yourself and see what I saw).  The enormous amount of images that returned was mainly German Shepherds with noses exactly like Toby.  My laughing quickly turned to concern as without an actual diagnosis, I was instantly convinced that my dog had Lupus. There are many symptoms of Lupus in dogs; however, here are a few of the most common (obtained from Petwave.com). Depigmentation (paleness) of the skin on the bridge of the nose Skin redness (erythema), especially on the bridge of the nose, face and lips Skin scaling and flaking, especially on the bridge of the nose, face and lips Skin erosions (sores), especially on the bridge of the nose, face and lips Skin ulcerations, especially on the bridge of the nose, face and lips Skin crusting, especially on the bridge of the nose, face and lips Scarring, especially on the bridge of the nose, face and lips Pain at affected areas Itchiness (pruritis), may or may not be present Scratching at affected areas (variable) Secondary bacterial infections (pyoderma) After spending approximately $400 at the veterinarian (OUCH!!!), I was given some medicine that I was to apply to his nose on a daily basis.  This was done for the 1st couple of days however there did not appear to be an improvement.  As we were told by the veterinarian that the dog would be fine as long as we kept him out of the sun, we believed that this was the only thing we could do as the medicine did not appear to be working. A couple of weeks ago, my wife was in the bathroom with a tube of Aquaphor in her hand.  The dog came in at that time and my wife decided to jokingly apply some to his nose.  Hey, Aquaphor got us through the 1st 4 years of our daughter’s life so why wouldn’t it work on the dog’s nose?  This was just about as funny as when she first told me he had Lupus.  The next day, to both of our disbelief, the nose of the dog looked almost completely healed.  It was black, wet, and there was little sign of peeling or irritation.  This has now become a ritual that we do every couple of days and his nose looks normal. Throughout this whole situation, I learned some important things.  The first is that dogs can get Lupus.  The second is that sometimes there are inexpensive ways to take care of expensive problems.  And finally……always listen to your wife (she is right most of the time)."
5,The Importance of Vitamin C for Your Guinea Pig,pets," The distinction between the animals is particularly significant when housing rabbits and guinea pigs together.  Rabbit food is not supplemented with Vitamin C unlike the rations prepared for guinea pigs. A further complication arises because Vitamin C is a relatively unstable compound.  It is, therefore preferable to buy small quantities of food regularly. This will ensure that the guinea pig receives a relatively fresh diet containing the optimum level of Vitamin C - about 200mg per kg of food (approximately 90mg per lb). Check the expiration date recommended by the manufacturer if you buy the food in packaged form.  The maximum shelf life is likely to be no more than two or three months. Keeping the food in a cool, well-ventilated spot will help to prolong the vitamin content in prepared diets. Apart from causing skin lesions, an early but unseen effect of Vitamin C deficiency is that it appears to render the body more susceptible to infections. Studies suggest that the average guinea pig weighing up to 1 kg (2.2lb) requires 10mg of Vitamin C daily, while during pregnancy this figure can increase threefold. If the guinea pig appears unsteady on its feet and reluctant to walk, with haemorrhages evident in the mouth and elsewhere on the body, it may have a Vitamin C deficiency. Direct dietary supplement of the vitamin -usually as part of a multivitamin powder but, in severe cases, in tablet form - tends to be more satisfactory than giving it in drinking water, where it rapidly oxidizes and loses its potency. To be beneficial, a solution would need to contain at least 200mg of Vitamin C per liter (114mg per pint) of water and should be changed once, possibly twice, daily. An added complication results if the water has been drawn through new copper pipes and so contains relatively high levels of this metal  since copper acts as a catalyst for the breakdown of Vitamin C. Ensure that the condition never arises, therefore, by providing fresh green leaf food throughout the year. Broccoli is particularly valuable because it has a very high level of Vitamin C, averaging around 250mg per kg (114mg per lb). Also provide root vegetables, notably swedes and to a lesser extent, carrots. These should be sufficient to keep your guinea pig healthy, especially when fed alongside a good-quality supplemented dry ration."
6,What Owners Need to Know About Dog Acne,pets," Dogs can easily develop acne.  In fact, many dogs have been known to suffer from this condition.  In most cases, your dog will only develop a mild case of acne, but it is possible for a severe infection to occur.  This condition usually affects younger pups more often, but they usually get over it by the time their first birthday rolls around. Acne affects dogs whenever they start producing too much sebum.  The skin is usually kept hydrated thanks to sebum.  Acne is a condition that develops whenever too much sebum is produced though.  Hormone imbalances or poor grooming are also responsible for causing acne.  Some of the other possible reasons include stress, skin infections, and allergies. The main sign of acne is the development of blackheads which can appear on virtually any part of your dog's body.  Most dogs develop blackheads on their lips or chin.  If parts of your dog's skin start to swell because of the condition, then scabs may also develop.  Your dog won't be affected much by the scabs unless they lead to a bacterial infection.  The area will be itchy enough to prompt your dog to scratch it as much as possible. Acne is a condition that's pretty easy for vets to diagnose.  It's very easy to notice the appearance of the blackheads over various spots of your dog's body.  A skin biopsy may be conducted to ensure that there's not another underlying condition that is causing the problem.  Dogs need to be sedated in order to submit to a skin biopsy though. If your dog has acne, it won't be able to be cured, but it can successfully be managed.  In order to start managing the condition though, the vet will need to find out what's causing the problem with acne.  The vet may elect to conduct a food trial to ensure that your dog's diet isn't to blame. An anti-seborrheic shampoo or soap will come in very handy if your dog is suffering from acne.  These shampoos or soaps help limit the amount of sebum on the skin.  Owners that want to manage acne successfully will also need to pay attention to their grooming habits. If your dog is unfortunate enough to have a more severe case of acne, then medication may be needed to deal with it.  Some dogs will also need to take antibiotics to ensure that they don't go on to develop a bacterial infection.  Dogs that are suffering due to itching can get relief thanks to anti-inflammatory medications.  Dogs that have a more severe case may require topical steroids."
7,3 crazy dangerous south american animals,pets," Piranha Despite the fact that only a small number of of the numerous or so kinds of piranha are considered to be unsafe to humans, the red-bellied piranha is one of those. It just so happens to reside in the waterways of South America. Cinema flicks and fables have villianized this sharp-toothed beast -- and to some quantity, with reason. The myths range from schools of piranhas utterly devouring the first of a herd of large animals to cross a river to indiscriminate assaults on people. Piranhas inhabit many of the freshwater streams of South America, swimming in large schools that are attracted by blood and disturbances in the water. Its reported that they only a hazard to human beings if the water levels are low from their river drying. Or perhaps when humans are swimming near places near the shoreline where fish are being skinned and their guts tossed into the water. For the most part, though, you’ll be safe from a hit-or-miss attack by a school of ravenous piranhas. Take good care, though, in getting into the waters. The piranha truly is one of the most dangerous south american animals. Anaconda This South American monster of a beast is straight out of the films - or your nightmares. Despite the fact that they generally don’t grow incredibly large, anacondas have been known to break the scales at over 230 kilograms. It is often considered to be the biggest snake on the planet. You certainly don’t want to get trapped unawares with this serpant due to their procedure of attacking and detaining their its next meal. It is positively a unusual type of snake type as it usually coils around its kill, slowly-but-surely increasing the strain up to the point its victims suffocates. It jaws are powered by muscles that generate sufficient enough strain for its in excess of 100 razor-sharp re-curved fangs to go through the thick skin of an alligator. They do not have poison sacks, only taking advantage of their forceful jaws to capture and keep their prey. Anacondas commonly prey on any type of animal that it can prevail over, but more often than not they are no threat to humans. Most of the time they would rather to camouflage and rapidly withdraw when people are near. Poisonous Frogs The Golden Poison Frog of Central and South America is richly covered by using a strong alkaloid poison. But this is not only any poison! This little frog, not exceeding 55mm in size, packs enough thump to take down a pair of African Bull Elephants … don’t touch it. Actuality, its poison lining is a lot more life-threatening versus the great sting of a box jellyfish. This apparently safe frog continues to be known to be a killer of persons who have touched it directly. Its also been confirmed that domestic birds and pet dogs have perished by contacting a paper towel on which a Golden Poison Frog had walked! Bizarre. As well as the Golden Poison Frog is among the most-harmful South American Animals, it also has other poison frog neighbours. They are also enclosed in the same poison layer, but are not quite as harmful. All in intense hues, they would undoubtedly look relatively easy to capture and touch, but really, stay at a distance. Its been said that in fact majority of these frogs may appear to possess a sense of their own invincibility. Whereas other jungle animals tend to hide from predators, quite a few unsafe frogs will plainly walk right out on the woodland ground. Its very nearly as if they are daring someone to touch them."

9,You and Your Dog: Have a Happy (Safe) Holiday Season,pets," The holidays are full of tradition that can lead to chaos if not arranged thoroughly. Stay conscious of holiday doggy dangers to keep celebrations fun and safe for you and your pooch. Avoid potential holiday hazards by maintaining a secure, but still festive, environment for your inquisitive canine. Always be informed on unsafe foods and seemingly harmless decorations that could pose a threat to your pup, and take the necessary actions to avoid any disasters that could arise. No need to stress, you and Rover can enjoy the holiday season with a few simple steps. Food is a huge part of the holiday celebrations, but be aware of which edibles don’t work well with your pup.  Foods that are rich and high in fat, like gravy, can cause your pup to experience issues varying from an upset stomach to pancreatitis, which causes vomiting, pain, and dehydration. If the pancreatitis is serious enough it often requires hospitalization. Keep those holiday truffles far from your pooch; chocolate contains Theobromine, which can result in diarrhea, seizures, or even death if consume by your furry friend. The holidays are a huge time for homemade meals, but prepare raw meat, fish, and poultry away from Rover to avoid accidental consumption that could lead to E. coli. Don’t share any fish, meat, or poultry bones with your pup, as these bones tend to splinter and could tear through your dog’s intestinal tract. Instead, stick to rawhides and dog bones for your canine to chew on. If you leave dough to rise, be sure to stow it distant from your pooch since gobbling down yeast dough can produce painful gas in the digestive system and possibly even rupture your dog’s stomach or intestines. Candy canes contain an artificial sweetener, xylitol, that can be very toxic to your pooch, and macadamia nuts are another toxic threat to dogs and should be kept out of your canine’s reach. For safety measures, always put any extra food away immediately and pet-proof your garbage. Everybody loves holiday decorations, but certain decors can be dangerous around an unmonitored dog. Put away all wrapping supplies after your gifts are packaged neatly to avoid any doggie disasters. While yarns, strings, and ribbons are great for adding a fancy touch to presents, they can result in intestinal problems that could be fatal if consumed by your pooch. Animals tend to be attracted to adhesives and glues, but these are toxic and should be stored carefully out of your dog’s reach. Curious canines may snack on potpourri, which has oils that are toxic to dogs. If your holiday decorations include potpourri just be sure to place it somewhere that your pup can’t get to. As always, lit candles shouldn’t be left unattended to prevent burns and fires. For those celebrating the Christmas season, take precautions when setting up your Christmas tree. Tinsel is a gorgeous touch to the Christmas tree, but if your pooch decides to ingest the shiny decoration it may cause blockages that could call for surgery to correct. Fake Christmas trees have become commonly popular, but for those insisting on a real Christmas tree just remember that the tree’s needles can be toxic and even create mouth and stomach irritation. Watch your pup around the tree to ensure that no branches or fallen tree needles are being ingested. A Christmas tree wouldn’t be complete without festive Christmas lights, although be sure to unplug the decorative lights when you aren’t in the room and invest in pet-proof extension cords to deter any chewing that could cause electrical shock. If your canine is an avid chewer, spray the cords with bitter tasting products that are made to discourage chewing, and offer a rawhide or dog bone in place of off-limit cords. Ornaments are the icing on the cake when it comes to Christmas trees, but certain ornaments may propose danger if handled by your furry friend. Hang glass ornaments, along with sharp and small ornaments, more towards the top of the tree to steer clear of any unfortunate disasters. Save the lower half of your tree for ornaments that are larger and pose less of a threat for your puppy’s safety. You should avoid using candy canes, gingerbread people, and popcorn strings as Christmas tree decorations; otherwise your curious canine may ingest the décor and suffer preventable consequences. Once you have gone through the essential precautions, enjoy the holiday season with your happy hound."

11,The Truth Regarding Liver Disease in Dogs,pets," The liver is responsible for performing various functions. Your dog will experience many different health problems if it isn't working correctly.  Canine liver disease is one of the top five leading causes of death in dogs.  Generally speaking, this condition usually affects older dogs.  However, younger pups can also be affected. Other health conditions are usually the reason why dogs develop liver disease.  Some of these include hepatitis, pancreatitis, and anemia.  Parasites such as heartworms can also cause liver disease in dogs.  Dogs that ingest toxins or chemicals like antifreeze will significantly increase their risk also. Sometimes, medications can lead to canine liver disease.  Dogs also can't break down fat properly.  Therefore, liver disease can develop if dogs eat a lot of fatty foods.  A few of the other health conditions responsible for the disease include cancer and diabetes. Liver disease usually doesn't cause many noticeable symptoms in its early stages.  Once diseases do appear, they include lethargy, weight loss, and loss of appetite.  It is also common for the dog's abdomen to swell up.  If you happen to touch his abdominal area, you may notice that he is in pain. As mentioned earlier, the liver is responsible for many different functions.  It produces bile pigments that give feces and urine its color.  If your dog has liver disease, kissing and will be very orange and his feces may turn gray.  Jaundice, a condition that causes white or pale skin, can also occur. It is hard to diagnose liver disease in its early stages.  Since it isn't usually caught early, dogs can very easily die from it.  Vets will need to take a medical history and perform a physical exam in order to start diagnosing the disease. A urinalysis will also likely be performed.  He may take an x-ray of the abdomen or an ultrasound of the liver if he suspects disease.  Your dog may also have to submit a biopsy of the liver. The underlying condition will need to be dealt with in order to treat this condition in dogs.  If trauma is the underlying cause, hospitalization until recovery may be required.  Bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics.  If your dog has any other underlying conditions, then the vet will need to treat them too for the liver will heal. If your dog suffers from liver disease, it's a good idea to adjust his diet.  You will need to pay attention to the amount of vitamins, carbohydrates, minerals, and fat that he consumes in his food.  The liver won't have to work as hard if your dog eats a proper diet."
12,The Truth Regarding Dog Hypothyroidism,pets," The thyroid is a gland found in your dog's neck.  The metabolic rate is controlled by the thyroid gland.  Hypothyroidism is a condition that occurs when the metabolism drops significantly due to the fact that the thyroid gland isn't producing enough hormone. When it comes to hormone imbalances in dogs, hypothyroidism is a common culprit.  Elderly dogs are commonly affected.  Certain breeds are also at an increased risk of developing the condition.  Some of these include the Great Dane, Boxer, Golden retriever, and Doberman pinscher. Hypothyroidism in dogs usually develops because of an immune disorder.  The immune system will treat the thyroid gland as if it were a foreign body and start to attack it.  Hashimoto's Disease or autoimmune thyroiditis are two other names for this condition. Canine hypothyroidism usually causes dogs to have problems with skin infections, oily hair, hair loss, and dry coats.  It is also relatively common for dogs to experience lethargy and become obese.  Some dogs suffer anemia and cardiovascular symptoms such as decreased heart rate and abnormal heart rhythms. Your dog may even have chronic ear infections.  Depression and other behavioral changes may also occur.  Dogs may start behaving more aggressively, tilting their head, or even having seizures. The vet will need to take a thorough medical history and physical exam in order to diagnose your dog with this condition.  A blood test can help achieve an accurate diagnosis if hypothyroidism is suspected. This blood test is useful for various reasons such as checking the level of thyroid hormone.  Even though dogs may have the condition, they may show a normal level of this hormone on a test.  Fortunately, there are numerous other tests that can help diagnose canine hypothyroidism accurately. In order to treat this condition, your dog will need to take thyroxine twice a day on a daily basis.  This is also a synthetic thyroid hormone.  Frequent vet visits for checkups are also mandatory.  It is sometimes necessary to adjust the dosage of medication.  As long as your dog keeps taking the medication, he should have little problems in life."
13,"Dog Tartar Removal at Home, not at the Vet’s",pets," What kind of lousy dog owner are you?  Don’t you care about your dog’s life?  Obviously not or you wouldn’t do what you just unthinkingly did to your dog!  Do you want him to die? What did you do?  Leave your dog chained outside all day in the cold rain?  Leave him locked in a hot garage all day without water?  Let him eat chocolate or feed him xylitol, either of which can kill him?  No, you did what thousands of pet owners do every year without thinking of the possible consequences.  You took your dog to the vet’s for a teeth cleaning. You go to the dentist twice a year and placidly lie in the chair with your feet above the level of your head, your mouth open while the dentist scrapes the plaque off your teeth.  Nothing untoward has ever happened to you and you feel the same way when you take your dog to get his teeth cleaned.  Nothing can happen, right?  You don’t even give it a second thought.  It’s just a simple cleaning. Wrong!  There is nothing simple about this procedure.  Your dog isn’t going to obediently lie with his mouth open for the vet, so the vet puts him under anesthesia. There is a 1 in 233 chance the anesthesia will kill your dog.  Those odds may not sound so bad until you compare them with humans, where only 1 in 10,000 people die under anesthesia.  The odds are worse if your dog has any health issues.  Several years ago a dog of mine with a slight heart murmur nearly died during a cleaning.  Your dog will probably be okay, but maybe he won’t. On top of the risk, there is the cost.  A cleaning will set you back several hundred dollars.  If extractions are necessary, the vet is going to do it while he has the dog under rather than wait to get your permission.  If there is bleeding from extractions or nicks to the gums, the vet will prescribe antibiotics to ward off any possible infection.  All of these add to the cost.  It isn’t uncommon to pay upwards of $500, and I doubt you have pet medical insurance to cover the costs. A trip to the vet is not the only option you have for dog tartar removal.  There are alternatives that are safe, effective, inexpensive, and you can use at home. One option that immediately comes to mind is brushing.  A doggie tooth brush isn’t expensive, nor is toothpaste for dogs.  Don’t use your toothpaste on your dog.  Toothpastes for humans often contain ingredients that are not suitable for dogs, and in fact can be harmful, such as xylitol. Brushing is inexpensive and won’t pose a risk to your dog’s health, but it does have its downsides.  Unless you start brushing your dog’s teeth from an early age, he might not be agreeable to having someone poking around in his mouth, and brushing could become a test of wills.  Brushing won’t get the inside of your dog’s teeth as well as the outsides simply because it’s harder to get the brush on the inside of the teeth – unless your dog is very cooperative.  As a preventative, brushing works well, but is of limited value if your dog already has tartar buildup. Another option is a dog dental spray, like Plaque Attack.  Plaque Attack dog spray costs in the neighborhood of $20 for a three month supply, a far cry from a $500 vet visit.  The ingredients are dog-safe and are designed to work together to loosen and remove tartar buildup and prevent its re-occurrence. Typically, you will simply spray your dog’s teeth twice a day for two weeks.  You will notice your dog licking his lips.  This mixes the spray with his saliva, ensuring that the spray is spread throughout his mouth, covering all his teeth.  In a couple of weeks, you will notice the tartar begin to disappear. To hasten the process, you can gently brush your dog’s teeth before spraying to help loosen the built up tartar and help the spray to penetrate better.  You can reduce the spray applications to two or three times a week once the tartar is gone.  This ongoing maintenance program will help prevent tartar from building up again. Don’t just blindly assume that a vet teeth cleaning is the best option for assuring your dog’s oral health.  As pointed out here, there are other perfectly satisfactory options available.  If you decide to take your dog to the vet, fine, but do it from a position of education and knowledge, knowing that you are making the best decision for the health of your dog."
14,Raised Dog Beds - 4 Needs Met at As soon as,pets," If you have been researching raised dog beds for your K9 friend, good for you!

Physical Well being - One enormous benefit that raised dog beds offer you is that they are off of the floor. Your dog doesn't must plop or fall down onto their pillow and then try to manipulate the material to get comfy.

15,Tax Write-offs for the Animal Lover,pets," At the end of July of 2009, Rep Thaddeus McCotter brought out the HAPPY Act (Humanity and Pets Partnered Through the Years) bill. The HAPPY Act bill aimed at allowing a tax write off of up to three-thousand five hundred dollars every year for pet care-related costs. The current status of the bill at the date of this publication: ""Referred to House Committee on Ways and Means."" It appears, this isn't the first priority at the House of Representatives, you could have a divergent opinion on that. So what kind of pet- and animal-related expenses are eligible for a tax deduction? The family pet is near and dear to us. Some may think our family pet worth its weight in goldpriceless). But, pet-related expenses are, in some circumstances, eligible for tax write-offs. For example, when moving, a pet owner could file for a tax deduction for the expenses borne by moving a family companion, in tax law to this purpose, a pet can be deemed a personal effect, and therein our pet cat or dog is counted likewise. Also a company may very well be permitted to deduct for the costs related to having a guard dog. Or a volunteer sponsor of an animal that serves a theraputic function, such as a guide dog, may be able to write off the veterinarian bills, and similar unreimbursed expenses (these are considered charitable donations). And there have similarily been court rulings which have permitted tax write-offs for costs associated with caring for animals serving the physically-impaired, visually-impaired, and hearing-impaired persons. And there are as well tax deductions in expenses related to the care of animals considered part of an animal-breeding business. TheCat Lady Case--Van Dunsen vs Commissioner In 2004, Van Dusen shared her living space with nearly 80 cats and kittens (seven of them she called personal pets). She volunteered for a charitable organization (called ""Fix our Ferals"") with the main intention of fixing wild cats. The volunteer wrote off about $12,000 on her return. The Internal Revenue Service argued that Ms. Van Dusen was rescuing cats of her own volition rather than incurring expenses as a volunteer for a charitable organization. The court refused the stance. The court did agree with the Internal Revenue Service, however, that quite a few of the expenses (DMV fees, Costco membership dues, wet/dry vacuum repair cost, and State Bar dues ) couldn't constitute exclusively charitable expense. Ultimately, all of the individual expenses which exceeded $250 were disallowed because Van Dusen failed to provide corresponding required verification for these charitable donations (like a contemporaneous or simultaneous created acknowledgment from the donee organization.) For this write-off to be permissible, the donee must also file a return with the IRS reporting the similar information comprising the written acknowledgment, such as: 1) the amount of cash contributed; 2) a good-faith estimate and description of any goods or services received in exchange; and 3) if the donee supplies any intangible, immaterial or religiousbenefits, a statement to that effect). So if you want to deduct the expenses for your fifty cats, make certain you are acting on the part of an satisfactory charity and be sure you receive the necessary documentation. How can I distinguish between non-tax deductable and tax deductable animal care-related expenses? So you see there are avenues for tax write offs associated with the expenses incurred by the care of animals and pets. And there are instances when these expenses are non-tax deductable. If you are looking into a tax write-off related to the expenses of taking care of pets, seek out the guidance of a certified public accountant. Do not imagine that because your neighbor owns 15 cats, she or he is able to give you qualified pet-related tax deduction information and counsel. In one peculiar illustration, a gardener attempted to write off for the expenses of attending to a dog which helped him pull a wagon on the job, presumably without the counsel of his CPA. This rewarded the lawn specialist an audit. We may assume that this brought about some working-relations pressure, however we are unable to authenticate this possibility. And assumedly it is not likely that either dog or boss will speak out anytime soon."

This choice should come down really to providing the best comfort for your dog, and then secondly, on your personal preference, as some beds may just look out of place in a perfectly styled home. When choosing a dog basket of any kind, be it plastic or wicker, it's important to fill the bed with some kind of mattress or blanket, as on their own, these types of dog beds can be cold, hard and uninviting.

2,Horse Studs: How to Choose the Right One For Your Mare,pets," Breeding a foal can be one of the most exciting times in a horse owner’s life. You have the ideal broodmare, you have your eye on a couple of stallions that will complement her, and you have all the facilities set up at home to accommodate a proud mother and her youngster’s first wobbly explorations. However, it has to be remembered that these are not the only aspects that need to be considered when planning a mare’s pregnancy. The horse studs, the yards where the stallions reside, have to be of sufficient quality as well. This is vital whether your mare will be remaining there for the duration of her pregnancy or is simply visiting for a few hours or a couple of days. When it comes to the horse stud you leave your mare at, never accept second best. Do make sure you visit each stud and stallion in person, if at all possible. This not only gives you a better idea of the stud’s level of service and expertise, but also allows you to see the stallion in the flesh. Up close, he might not be all that you imagined from the glossy magazine photos. Always trust your first impressions of a place, as those instincts are very often accurate. Make the most of the time you have visiting each horse stud as you will usually only have a relatively short time to ask questions, form your opinions and decide which of the horse studs is best for you and your broodmare. Before you even look at the horse studs, make sure you know exactly how much you will be paying as there is where a lot of novice breeders get caught out. The stud fee only covers the stallion serving your mare- ask the horse studs to tell you exactly what other costs would be involved, preferably on paper. How much are livery charges? Will there be a groom’s fee? Do they offer a No Foal No Fee or a No Foal Free Return option? If you can’t see evidence of the following points when you arrive at a stud, it might be worth looking elsewhere. Every respectable horse stud should be able to offer: Knowledgeable, helpful staff’Good quality grazing and well maintained pastureland.Safe fencing (preferably post and rail- although check that the wood is in acceptable condition, no splintering, protruding nails or warped, weak looking spots).Have a look at the stallions and other horses on the property. Are they in good weight and overall condition? Do they seem happy and alert? Or are they listless with dull coats?The horse studs should have a specific place to examine mares- somewhere safe that the vet can use to carry out pregnancy tests etc.They should be able to provide evidence of an experienced visiting specialist stud vet.Good stud hygiene and cleanliness should be evident.Last but certainly not least- they should provide customer service that is polite, helpful and consistent.Most well known, established horse studs will have good facilities available and will conduct themselves in a reliable, professional manner. This level of service is what they have built their reputations upon. Consequently, they understand the importance of keeping their tools up to date and having experienced staff on hand. These horse studs usually demand slightly higher livery and stud fees, due to the amount of money they invest into their facilities. While it might take a little longer to save up, it can mean greater peace of mind in the long run, as you know your mare will be well cared for. That’s not to say that a lesser-known horse stud can’t come up trumps. You simply might have to do a little more of your own homework as a younger yard won’t have had time to build up a widespread positive reputation just yet. If you put the work in, you will track down a suitable horse stud in no time, and be confident that you and your mare will receive the best service possible."
3,Agility Builds Assurance in Your Puppy,pets," Is your doggy timid around people or other doggys?  Is your puppy sensitive to sounds?  activity training can provide the surroundings and structure to build confidence in your doggy.  Agility classes are a great place for people to learn about the sport and learn how to train, but the timid doggy may take a long time before he is ready to venture from under your chair or off your lap. A timid or shy puppy can only learn inside their comfort region.  So, training must begin where they feel free from harm and behaviors must be taught in very small increments. Home will probably be the best place to train and have learning take place for your pup. So, how do you train at home?  You will need guidelines and apparatus. There is a multitude of websites that can give you information on agility training.  There are also books and videos that will give details and visual aids and lesson plans for beginners thru expert levels. There is a variety of facilities that is useful and helpful to have at home.  Facilities recommendations are based on your available space and location of training.  Do you have a large garden that will hold 10 obstacles? Do you have a small courtyard where you will need setup apparatus and then tear down before you can setup again?  Will you be training in your garage or basement, or as some activity addicts, in your living room. For the timid dogs make sure your equipment is safe and sturdy.  The pause table is a good place to begin your activity training.   A 12"" high pause table, with adjustable legs for later use, is a good starting place for all size puppys. Bear in mind with your shy doggy, setup your table in an area that is very recognized to your puppy.  If your puppy barks at anything new, just leave your pause table in your house or terrace for several days, let your doggy inspect and smell it on his own or with a little coaxing, but don’t push to fast, keep in mind baby steps with the insecure puppy.   With treats in a dish or his favorite toy placed on the table encourage your pup to get up on the table.  This may take more than one lesson, be patient.  If your timid doggy looses interest in food or toys when you attempt something new, trying holding him and you sit on the table.  If your pup is too big to hold, have him on leash and you sit on the table.  If he backs away coax him, only treat or reward him when he comes to you, never when he’s pulling back away from you or the table. Eventually, you want your puppy to be able to jump on the table with your cue word, ""Table"", ""Box"", ""Kennel"", whatever word you use, Stay on the table as you back away and then Come when you call. Build your distance bit by bit so that your doggy is not pushed to soon. From Pause Table to Contact Trainer is a nice transition for shy puppy.  A Contact Trainer comes in different designs.  We recommend a 3-Piece Contact Trainer that has one mini A-frame side, a Pause Table, and then a mini Puppy-walk side.  Your puppy can Sit on the table and then be coaxed down the A-frame side or the Dog-walk side.  Just keep in mind with the shy doggy, training is done in increments, bit by bit and comfortably, with a little push to stretch him, but not enough to overwhelm him to cause a shutdown. You can follow the above techniques introducing new obstacles as your puppy is able to succeed.  As your pup succeeds on each new piece of apparatus you will see his assurance grow."

Recognizing health issues and knowing how to deal with them will help your four-legged friend live his golden years with comfort and happiness.

This will keep their mind sharper and from becoming lethargic. Massaging your dog will help with joint stiffness and improve blood circulation…Not mentioning that he will love it! Blindness and deafness A bluish, hazy film on his eyes is normal and he can see through it. However, a whitish, heavy growth of cataracts can lead to blindness. You should learn the difference. Because sight is not a dog’s primary sense,(smell is), most dogs becoming blind will learn the land layout and will be just fine. Just remember not to move things around the house and yard. Your dog’s hearing might diminish as he ages. He will start not responding to his name, verbal commands and even bark for no reason. Lumps Most are usually benign fatty tumors which are round, soft with well define edges. Any change (especially fast) of size or shape should be check by your veterinarian. Stiffness and Arthritis These two conditions are very common in older dogs. Although there are no cure for them, treatments are widely available. Glucosamine Chondroitin supplements and anti-inflammatory medications will help considerably. Make sure that he gets daily moderate exercise, but moderate his play dates, as he could get painfully stiffed next morning if he plays too rough with other dogs. Weight Do not let your dog get overweight as extra weight will add extreme stress on his joints. Feed him a well balanced diet, low fat and that contains vitamins and anti oxidants. If he shows difficulties bending to reach his food or water, get him an elevated dog feeder which will help him tremendously. Such a feeder will relieve strain on his neck, shoulders and joints. On the opposite, sudden weight loss could be a sign of internal problems. Make sure to check it with your veterinarian. Skin and Coat Your older dog might get a duller coat and dryer skin. A daily dose of Omega 3 fish oil will keep his coat shiny and his skin healthy. Grooming and bathing on a regular basis is also a good idea. Cognitive Dysfunctions Dog can develop these conditions just like Humans (Alzheimer’s). 70% of 16 year old dogs become more disoriented, getting stuck in corners, starring into space. You can help your dog by guiding him and talking to him. It is sometimes difficult to see our best friend going through all this, but we will grow old also. Remember that love is the best therapy!"
6,Understanding Dog Eye Infections,pets," As a responsible pet owner, keeping the dog healthy and away from possible dog eye infections should be a primary concern.

Some breeds maybe prone to certain eye problems compared to others, so it’s important to consult a veterinarian if the symptoms persist to avoid any more serious health problem. There are some general signs to look out for dog eye infections. Check if the dog is blinking too much or squinting. There might also be an infection if the dog appears to be in pain and refuses to be touched on the head. Check if the dog is also avoiding light or rubbing its eyes against the floor or furniture and see if there’s any redness in the eyes or there’s no obvious abnormal bulging. A clear loss of appetite and constant whining can also mean a dog eye infection or injury. If there’s an opaque membrane over the eye or it appears cloudy, or if the eye looks red and inflamed, this could be conjunctivitis. The change in pressure inside the eyes can affect the firmness of the eyeball. A softer eye can mean uvetitis while a harder eye could indicate glaucoma. Conjunctivitis, also called pink eye, is one of the most common dog eye problems and can also be caused by allergies or parasites. This infection happens when the membrane inside the eyelids and in front of the eye are inflamed. Symptoms for conjunctivitis could be one of the following: inflamed red eyes, excessive tearing and a thick yellowish or greenish mucus discharge. The usual treatment for this dog eye infection is with antibiotic eye drops, given several times a day. There might also be some allergy medication or oral antibiotics given, depending on the cause. Home remedy for conjunctivitis involves cleaning the dog’s eyelids and wiping away the discharge with a cotton ball moistened with lukewarm water. There are also over the counter eye scrubs, which can be applies at least twice a day or as many times as necessary. Applying a damp and warm compress to the affected eye for five minutes can provide relief to the dog. Another common dog eye infection is dry eye or otherwise known as keratoconjunctivitis sicca. This is what happens when natural tears aren’t produced to keep the eyes moist, which can cause damage to the tear ducts. This dog eye infection should be treated immediately otherwise it can lead to more serious problems like corneal ulcers and even blindness. Treatment for dry eye or KCT includes surgery and medications to keep the eye lubricated. Cherry eye is when there’s protrusion of the dog’s third eyelid out of the corner of the eye. This can be easily treated with surgery and has a high success rate. Another dog eye infection is entropion, where the eyelids roll inward and cause the eyelashes to come in contact with the eyes that can lead to irritation and pain. This disease can be inherited so it’s best to check if the dog is prone to this condition. Entropion can be treated with a simple surgery but it’s important to have this treated right away or it can become a worse health problem. Meanwhile, ectropion is a dog eye infection when the eyelids roll outward and exposes the inner eyelid. Breeds with drooping eyelids such as St. Bernards are prone to this infection but this can be treated with eye drops and ointments. Glaucoma is one of the more serious dog eye infections, and can cause blindness if not taken care of immediately. This canine eye problem happens when liquid builds up inside the eye that increases pressure inside it and can ultimately lead to a more serious damage. As much as glaucoma is painful for people, this is even more painful for dogs. Surgery is usually needed as treatment for glaucoma to reduce the build-up of fluid in the eye to save the dog’s vision, plus there are also medications for the pain and pressure. Early signs of glaucoma can be mistaken as conjunctivitis, but other symptoms include cloudy cornea, and the dog is visibly in pain and eyes look bloodshot. Another common dog eye infection is the cataracts and, like with humans, is normally due to the aging process. Cataracts is usually genetic but other factors include canine diabetes, any infections or injury. The symptoms to watch out for are the opaque or cloudy membrane covering the dog’s eye and check if the dog has difficulty seeing its way around. This can be treated with eye drops or surgery, depending on the cause, the severity and the dog’s condition. Corneal ulcers in dogs usually happen when the infection or injury causes lesions in the cornea and gives extreme pain to the dog. Canine corneal ulcers may be a little more difficult to detect but a few symptoms include the dog rubbing their eyes against things like carpet, tear-like discharges and squinting. It has the best chance to be treated when detected early, because if not, it can lead to loss of vision. Ointments, eye drops and antibiotics are also needed to treat this dog eye problem. Doing some preventative eye care is still the best way to maintain the dog’s health. One way would be to gently and carefully wipe the dog’s eye with a clean, damp cloth at least once a day to remove any build-up of material or gunk around the eyes, without scratching or rubbing the actual eye. Another way would be to keep the hair around the eyes short to prevent it from scratching or irritating the eyes. Mixing a teaspoon of sea salt into a pint of water can be used as a quick saline solution to wipe around the dog’s eyes. If a foreign object is already stuck in the eyes, take the pet to the veterinarian right away because pulling it by yourself could be more damaging than helpful. Keeping pets away from any injury like dog eye infections is an essential part of being a good pet owner, and even pets deserve all the best possible health care they need."

On the contrary, supplying 1 of these beds to your preferred pooch will really enhance their well being. Would you rather sleep on the floor or up high on a mattress frame? I can't answer for you, but I'd prefer being higher up off of the floor. I couldn't envision attempting to get up off the floor in the morning. In addition, I highly doubt that I'd even get a great night's sleep. Oh, a dog pillow? No, I don't think I'd do that either simply because they grow to be lumpy and smelly too. Would you need to sleep on a lumpy, uneven bed that stinks? So why would you let your dog? What Is a Raised Dog Bed? A raised dog bed is really a special method that's constructed of a strong frame and very durable fabric that's attached to the frame. The frame has extended legs that lift the sheet of fabric up off of the floor and into the air. Believe of a cot but with significantly shorter legs. Don't take into account it a waste of money; contemplate a raised dog bed as an investment in your dog's life. The subsequent time your dog lays down on the hard wood or tile floor, watch what he does when he hits the floor. Does he ""plop"" down when he hits the floor and does he make a pitiful sound in the same time? Advantages of Employing a Raised Dog Bed The availability of this kind of bed will let your dog to gently lower himself onto the fabric. When his body reaches the surface of the material, it won't be a grunt you hear but a sigh of relief.

Compared to a regular dog bed pillow, a raised bed won't hold odors or retain moisture or mold. Additionally, these unique beds are easy to clean.

8,What You Should Know About Dog Knee Ligament Tears,pets," Dog Knee injuries are more common than you think. Just like athletes frequently tear their ACLs, dogs on the other hand are prone to tear their CCLs (cranial cruciate ligament). Now the CCL provides a vital function as it prevents the cranial drawer motion, or the forward and backward sliding of thigh bone on the tibia or shin bones, and gives stability to the knees. A torn CCL is one of the most common orthopedic problems in dogs. If your dog has been diagnosed with CCL rupture, you should always take steps for the problem to be addressed immediately. Delaying surgery may lead to the CCL rupture of your dog's other limb that can result in debilitating lameness. Below are some of the things that can contribute to knee ligament tears. Most of these factors are not seen by many dog owners until it's too late. Ask yourself these questions to see if your dog has is high risk for a knee ligament tear: Our dogs need sufficient physical activity every single day. Regular exercise builds up muscles that supports the joints. Excess weight puts extra stress on your dog's stifle joints.. Many dog owners aren't really aware of the consquences of obesity for their dogs such as putting undue strain to the knees. Although any breed of dog can have a ruptured CCL, Labrador Retrievers, Rottweilers and other large dog breeds are more prone to the problem. CCL ruptures are more common during middle age. Ligaments, muscles, and bones deteriorate as dogs age and are thus more prone to injuries. There are several treatment options which are tailored to correct a torn CCL And they are Tibial tuberosity advancement, Lateral Imbrication, intra-articular grafts, arthroscopic reconstruction, extra-capsular suture stabilization, medial meniscal release and Tibial Plateau Leveling Osteotomy (TPLO). The procedure produces better results than other surgeries for correcting CCL rupture. Dogs that undergo TPLO surgery have been observed to recover faster and achieve a better range of motion of the affected joint. TPLO has also been linked with lesser incidence of arthritis. Dogs that engage in sports and competitions are also able to return to their activities sooner. The procedure is used to correcting the anatomical abnormality of the tibial plateau. Once the loose bits and pieces of the ruptured ligament and damaged tissues are removed, the sloping tibial plateau is flattened with the aid of a special tool. To complete the procedure, the surgeon will place a metal plate and screws to keep the bone in place. Veterinarians and dog owners alike have observed that many dogs which underwent TPLO surgery start to use the operated limb a day after the procedure and start to put weight on it within the next 5 days. Post-surgery is a critical period of rehabilitation and repair. It has been observed that dogs which undergo a good rehabilitation program were able to heal and regain full use of the affected limb earlier than expected. They were also less prone to CCL rupture of the other limb. Complications can still arise after the surgery, such as arthritis and other degenerative joint disease. If your dog has been diagnosed with a torn cruciate ligament, the benefits that your dog can possibly achieve with TPLO surgery will definitely overshadow the minor complications that can possibly occur after surgery."
9,How to Care for Dumbo Rat Injuries,pets," Dumbo rats can suffer a wide array of injuries and can cause stress, worry, and panic in their owners. While their wounds can get easily infected and turn into abscesses, a pet rat without an infection actually heals tremendously fast. Nevertheless, here are some common injuries of pet rats, as well as the best thing to do in the even t of an injured dumbo rat. Common injuries: Sometimes there comes a time when big fights happen between two of your beloved dumbo rats. Males are usually guilty of this. When they suffer wounds from the fights, it is best to keep them separated following the incident in order to promote healing and to prevent more fighting. If their wounds seem raw and red without any improvement, it would be best to see your veterinarian as their wounds might be infected. This is not uncommon and is also not very serious however these can be extremely painful for your dumbo rats. A broken claw or tail is usually a result of their getting stuck somewhere or being stepped on or nipped.  You must first very gently disinfect the broken part by rinsing it in a non-abrasive antiseptic, like lemongrass distillate or tea tree oil.

As for bucks, sometimes they can get an entire leg broken as result of playing or getting stuck somewhere in the cage. You may want to visit your veterinarian who will assess the severity of the injury while you keep your dumbo rat in a safe leveled area in the cage for the meantime. More serious injuries: Also known as aural haematoma, this is when your pet rat’s ear can blow up and swell like a big blister of blood. Usually, it will take a couple of days for the blood to subside and go back into the skin, however leaving a thicker ear. If the swelling is severe and tends to flop or block the ear hole, antibiotic cream must be applied. This is even more excruciatingly painful to your poor pet rat than a broken leg.

10,Common Fish Diseases And How To Deal With Them,pets," Pet fish are one of the easiest pets to keep and with diligent cleaning and aquarium upkeep you can minimise the chance of them catching disease. However no matter how careful you are there is a chance that your fish may develop a disease and it is essential to be able to identify and deal with it quickly. The Two Types Of Fish Disease There are two categories of diseases with are infectious and non-infectious. If the disease is infectious then you could end up with all your fish very ill or worse. Infectious diseases pass from parasites and other fish, whereas non infectious diseases are usually as a result of poor cleaning or diet. If your fish develops an infectious disease then it will not go away unless it is treated. If you don't treat it then it will continue to get worse and your pet may die. Non-infectious diseases may go away if cleaning/diet routines improve. If you notice any symptoms of disease the most important thing is to act quickly. If you notice any symptoms the first thing to do is separate the ill fish from the other fish in the aquarium, and then identify the problem. Here are some common fish ailments you need to be aware of: Ick ""White Spot"" This is the most common fish disease. White spots appear on the fish, that look almost like grains of salt. There may be other symptoms such as cloudy eyes or fast breathing. There are plenty of medications available from the pet shop for this disease because it is so common, and usually clears up once treated. Fungus Fungus usually develops as a result of a wound on the fish, so treating injuries immediately is essential to preventing fungus. You can do this by removing any sharp objects that the fish could be wounded on and having real plants as opposed to plastic ones. Fungus appears as white patches that are fuzzy in appearance. Again these are easily cured with medications available at the pet shop or online. Fin and Tail Rot Tails and fins can be damaged from fighting with other fish, however there is another possible cause. Fin and tail rot eats away at the fish and is often fatal. Antibiotics are required to treat the infection and are readily available. Bacterial Infections Bacterial infections are usually as a result of a parasite and are not easy to identify. You may notice red blotches on the fishes body or damaged fins which resembles fin rot. You can treat this with medication but often it can be treated by changing the water. However doing both of these methods is the most effective."

12,Veterinarian Recommended Or The Most Recommended Dog Food Is Not Always The Best,pets," If you notice, most of the recommended dog food by veterinarian's are usually the most popular and most advertised. I can't help but think that since a veterinarian is running a business, and that business is about making money and showing a profit, would this be a conflict of interests? Or put another way, just another profit center and built in revenue generating tool. He is recommending to you what he is selling. We are deluged with advertisements, promotions television commercials and rhetoric about who manufactures the best dog food. Even going to the local grocery store and walking down the pet food isle, in itself very confusing. We generally then begin to look at price to be the determining factor.  Buying on line isn't much better either, if you don't know what to look for, what ingredients are good and what are bad. As dog lovers, we tend to listen to other people, and the flood of advertising that all claim to be the most nutritious, well balanced and healthy dog food on the market. This is wonderful to hear, because, we all want that for our best friends, don't we. On the surface and in reality, this makes it simple and easy for us to take the easy way out. By that, I mean, we don't have to do any research or spend any time to verify what we are feeding our best friend, and the ingredients contained therein, are in fact, healthy, nutritious and promote a long lifespan. Most dog food in grocery stores, on line or recommended by your veterinarian, canned or dry are all the same. They are for the most part, not a good choice for your dog. While they all claim to provide 100% of their daily dose of vitamins and minerals, they also provide dangerous ingredients for your dog. Most all are loaded with cheap, non nutritional, and toxic fillers, that not only hurt your dog, but provide no nutritional value what so ever.  In fact, these additives, fillers and preservatives are so toxic, they can cause severe illnesses and in some cases, even death. Finding out if a veterinarian recommended dog food or any other dog food is right for your pet, you must first start with the ingredients. The only thing left may be to alter what you feed your dog, based on any allergies, or any abnormalities he or she may have. Don't despair, the task before you is really quite a simple one indeed.

15,Lukas’ Knows He’s Lukas: World’s Smartest Horse Passes Self-Awareness Test,pets," Lukas, the World's Smartest Horse (according to the World Records Academy) and Guinness World Record Holder (""Most numbers correctly identified by a horse in one minute: 19""), has joined an elite group: those with the capacity for self-awareness. He has proved that he is able to recognize his own reflection in a mirror as an image of himself. To date, only humans (after the age of eighteen months), great apes, bottlenose dolphins, orcas, elephants and European magpies have successfully passed this test. For this experiment, Karen Murdock, Lukas' owner/trainer, utilized the mirror test, developed by Gordon Gallup in 1970 (based on observations by Charles Darwin). It determines whether an animal can recognize its own reflection in a mirror as an image of itself. Lukas' four by six foot Plexiglas mirror, two inch round stickers and the following steps were used: Covertly marking Lukas with two odorless spots: the test spot was on a part of Lukas which was visible in front of a mirror, and the control spot which was placed on an accessible but hidden part of his body (to rule out tactile involvement). Videotaped recordings documented whether Lukas reacted in a manner consistent with his being aware that the test spot was located on his own body, rather than on the mirror, while ignoring the control spot. Indications of awareness included: turning and moving his body so he could better view the marking in the mirror, or poking at the marking on his body with his muzzle while viewing the mirror. If Lukas didn't recognize his image, Murdock would have attempted to teach this to him. No prior access to mirrors and not having the necessary previous experiences to use them could possibly have been a factor in the event of Lukas' non self-recognition. For conclusive duplicable evidence, Murdock included additional preliminary steps: Teaching Lukas the spot touch (held in different locations). Lukas learning to go to the mirror and looking at himself when requested to do so. Lukas standing immobile in front of mirror, despite trainer's movements. Lukas recognizing test spot when held in reflection (spot initially put on paper plate which was gradually trimmed down) and attempting to touch it. Lukas going away from the mirror to trainer and returning to mirror when requested to do so. Lukas standing immobile in front of mirror even with trainer's hand touching and stroking him (to prepare for covert test spot application). Trainer in front of Lukas and touching Lukas' chest without him moving. Covertly placing the spot on Lukas (both at the mirror and away from the mirror) and waiting for his response. According to most animal intelligence ranking scales, equine statistics are dismal: horses rank anywhere from fifth to ninth in intelligence comparisons between species. In addition, the horse population in general is thought to be a typically reactive group at the mercy of flight instincts and walnut-sized brains. Murdock believes that the commonly used repetitive machine trials to assess horses' learning capabilities are missing some important components: a social and interactive element, voice prompts and reinforcement variations. Furthermore, she proposes that the prevailing methods of force training are inadequate and even counter-productive. In contrast, Lukas' lessons resemble those used for children: enjoyable, gentle and a mutual exploration into possibilities. A rather unscientific, yet significant supportive substantiation of Lukas' self-awareness abilities includes the fact that he is entirely intolerant of any horse near ""his girl,"" yet, in the test, he gave no indication that he believed his reflection to be an interloper. The most difficult aspect of the test according to Murdock involved Lukas remaining immobile when the test spot was absent: ""He always wants to do something to please me,"" says Murdock, ""and he's used to trying out different behaviors to get my attention."" In this case, a compromise was reached as the video below will demonstrate. As always, Murdock, a psychiatric nurse for the last twenty-six years, and an animal trainer for over forty years, used her own particular blend of techniques. Sessions with her dear friend were brief, fun and tender and included the following guidance: ""That's you in the mirror, Lukas. You're a horse. I love you.""

16,Color Forms of Fancy Rats,pets," Compared with mice, there are relatively few color forms of the Fancy Rat. They can be divided into two groups: the basic colors and the recognized pattern markings. Basic Colors Rats are, certainly, among the most popular varieties with the pet owner - possibly because they appear clean! There is a Pink-eyed White, which is also known as the Albino. Young rats of this variety tend to become creamy in color as they get older. There is also a distinct Self Cream strain. Most of the colors developed in mice are also seen in rats. The Agouti most closely resembles the ancestral Brown Rat, but the depth of brown coloration has been increased, becoming richer overall. A Silver counterpart, known as the Silver Fawn, has silver guard hairs set against a rich orange fur. The pink-eyed mutation here again exerts a diluting effect on overall body coloration. The Cinnamon mutation has an intermediate effect, creating a russet-brown shade of coat color with longer chocolate guard hairs. Among the darker colors, Self Blacks (ideally as deep as possible) and Self Chocolate (showing no trace of white) have been developed. Other varieties corresponding to the colors seen in mice are the Champagne and the Pearl, the latter being one of the more recent innovations. A color unique to rats is the Self Mink.

20,Understanding Your Lizards’ Social Behavior,pets," Most desert lizards are territorial which means they will protect some part of their home range from others of the same species. Research in the Mojave Desert of California has documented that large male chuckawallas will actively defend large rocky outcrops from other male chuckawallas, but will allow several females and even juvenile males to inhabit their area. Although this is commonly thought to be a male behavior, females can also be territorial. Desert lizards exhibit a variety of behaviors to discour­age other males from trespassing. Head bobbing, accompa­nied by flattening the body to give the illusion of larger size, is observed in many species. If the visiting male does not leave the area, as most will do, then a fight will ensue. The resident male is usually the winner and the trespasser quickly leaves. In captivity, lizards are forced to live in a confined area that is usually much smaller than the territory they occupy in the wild. If more than one male is present, the animals will often fight until one individual establishes dominance and then aggressive behavior will decline. In effect, an un­easy truce is declared because the submissive animal can not flee the area as it would do in the wild. Although this truce may appear as a harmonious rela­tionship to us, it can be extremely stressful to the submis­sive lizard. A hierarchical relationship is not natural to most lizards, since they will most often separate them­selves in the wild with each defending its own territory. The submissive animal will often suffer stress that is exhib­ited by an increase in the size of the adrenal glands, a de­cline in the efficiency of the immune system, decreased growth, and increased mortality. Researchers at the San Diego Zoo found that young male iguanas exhibit de­creased growth rates if they are even in the same room with a large male iguana. They detect the other males by sight and smell. The best approach to dealing with desert lizards is to keep males separate from each other. Captivity in itself is stressful and the presence of aggressive males can increase f the stress and decrease the health of your lizards. If animals must be kept together for short periods, provide hiding places and rock piles that will allow them to avoid viewing each other if they so desire. Once again, the best approach is to keep males separate. In addition, females will often show aggressive behavior toward other females if they are gravid. Gravid female spiny-tailed lizards are very aggressive toward both males and females and can inflict serious injuries upon their cage mates. Separate gravid lizards if any signs of aggression are shown."

2,Loving Our Pets Too Much,pets," Obesity is becoming an epidemic in our country today but it has not only affect the two legged species.  As we have begun to over indulge ourselves with our hectic lifestyles, we have also begun to over indulge our pets and this unhealthy habit is particularly destructive. Almost 25% of the pet population is considered obese and many under veterinary care for this reason.  With our tendency to treat ourselves with food as a reward for a challenging day, we are doing the same things to our animals.  But as we are doing so, we are putting their lives at risk. Our Busy Lives As we run through our lives juggling more daily expectations we are not only neglecting our own health with fast food and less relaxation but the health of our pets. With the lack of time for ourselves, our dog walks become short strolls to the nearest park or a quick jaunt around the neighborhood.  Our hectic days don't leave much play time for our pets so we offer treats to keep them busy and assuage our guilt. Animals are creatures of habit and quick to learn this type of behavior. They easily attach a play time with treats and begin to demand treats more frequently. Their vocal demands are then rewarded just to keep the peace and a cycle is born. As we move and downsize, our spaces leave less room for play.  Apartment living may seem suitable for cats but even cats need  room to exercise.  The less room there is to move, the more sedate they become and excess weight becomes a problem. A few pounds may not seem to be much for a large breed dog, but for small pets, 5 pounds can decrease their life span considerably.  As with humans, obesity can lead to diabetes, arthritis, kidney problems and heart complications. The more obese the animal, the less they are able to groom themselves and this can be a frustrating life for fastidious cats. What We Can Do If you suspect your pet may be overweight, take them to your local veterinarian for an assessment.  There are many types of food available to help get their weight back under control.  They will also be able to advise you of tips and tricks with different toys to help along the way. Get off the couch.  Going for a walk with your dogs at the end of the day is one of the best ways to reduce stress and increase your physical well being. Use favorite toys to play with your cat to encourage exercise. No matter what kind of pet you have, you must be careful not to overcompensate for our lack of time with food and treats. Be sure you are feeding the proper food for the age and condition of your pet and most importantly take the time to enjoy some play time. It will do both of you a world of good."

4,Iams dog food recalls may lead to dog insurance claims,pets," Recently, the Procter and Gamble Company (P&G) issued a recall for certain varieties of Iams dog food. However, no canned food, supplements, biscuits or treats were affected by the recall. The recalled products had been made in a single, specialized facility which the Food and Drug Administration, in cooperation with Procter and Gamble determined that some of its products had the potential for salmonella contamination. Although no illnesses relating to salmonella have been reported, this recall only serves as a precautionary measure. Procter and Gamble thereafter decided to recall all the products that have been made at that particular facility. The public has therefore been advised to stop feeding this food to their pets immediately, if they had already purchased it. Although most pets have a good resistance to diseases relating to salmonella, pets that get affected by the illness tend to display loss of appetite, lethargy, fever, vomiting, bloody diarrhea and abdominal pains. Healthy pets which have been infected may also serve as carriers which infect people and other animals. It is therefore important for dog owners to avoid contact with such dog food as well as wash their hands thoroughly in the event that they do come into contact with such food stuffs. If your pet consumed Iams dog food and displays symptoms listed above, you should immediately contact your veterinarian for assistance. Most dog owners are disappointed that the Iams dog food recall had not been made more public which would have enabled them to avoid the products and prevent their beloved pets from getting sick in the first place. Following the Iams dog food recall, various dog owners have posted their complaints about the handling of this matter. One owner who had been using Iams dog food for a while had been satisfied with how her lab’s stomach handled the food as it had stomach problems which only allowed it to eat certain foods. On visiting the local pet store, she found leftover Iams dog food being sold by the store which had been told that it was simply a shortage and not a recall. Thereafter, her lab spent an entire week throwing up until she figured out that he had eaten contaminated food. Another dog owner shared a similar story of how she had bought a bag of Iams Weight Control for her nine year old lab that became violently ill within four to five days. The dog displayed symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting and lethargy and was consuming copious amounts of water which were four to five times her normal intake thereby having accidents around the house. Believing her dog to be suffering from a urinary tract infection, the owner took her urine sample to the vet whose urinalysis report found glucose but no infection, while her blood work showed her liver and kidney enzymes to be dangerously high. The dog continued to show lack of appetite and was getting sicker by the day. After receiving the right treatment, she improved but had to suffer injury to her liver and kidneys."

So, if you have an aggressive dog, training him will not be an easy task. Follow these pointers on aggressive dog training and you'll have your answers in no time. Aggressive Dog Behavior Before getting into aggressive dog training, it is important to know what causes aggression in dogs. This will help you understand your pet better and lead to better dog care. Some of the reasons that lead to aggression in dogs are: •	Sometimes, the pet owner's behavior to the pet dog will lead to aggression. These behaviors include, constant chaining, excessively punished or poorly fed dogs. •	Aggression can also come about as a reaction to other dogs and pets. This is because the dog wants to prove it's territorial rights and be recognized as the alpha male. •	Being in an unfamiliar situation, surrounded by unknown people might lead to aggression in a dog. •	Dog health could be one of the other reasons for why you would require training aggressive dogs. Suffering from a disease or being affected by an ailment might cause the dog to exhibit aggression as a result of the pain that he is experiencing. Aggressive Dog Behavior Training These were some of the reasons that could lead to aggression in a dog. Once you realize that your pet dog has aggression, you will need some methods of aggressive dog behavior training. Here are some of them: Prevent Aggression It is possible to prevent the onset of aggression in your dog from early on. When the dog is new to your family, make sure that you introduce him to a lot of people and take him into different environments. This will train the dog to not show aggressive behavior traits when he meets new people or is taken into unfamiliar territories. So also touch him in a cuddling manner as often as you can. This will help the dog to become habituated to being handled. Recognize Aggression A dog will exhibit aggression by exhibiting signs like barking, growling, barring his teeth. More subtle signs include - standing rooted to one spot, pinning its ears to the head, stiff body, a hard, long stare. These signs of aggression are given as a signal to tell others to 'back off'. Learn to recognize these signs in the dog. Never Punish When a dog shows these signs of aggression, never ever punish him/her. That will only stop the dog from giving any signs and rather leading to a direct attack. Punishing a dog is not the correct way of dealing with aggressive dog training. Stop the Biting Training a dog when he is a puppy is the best method of aggressive dog training. At this stage, when a puppy starts to administer dog bites on your hands or nips at your toes playfully, it can lead to the bites developing into something more aggressive. When this happens, use this method for employing effective dog obedience - After he bites you, be firm and say 'NO' loudly. Usually a pup will get the message. But if the biting still does not stop, then put him in a room and lock it for 30 seconds. This will make him realize that this behavior is not acceptable. So also, making the dog understand that you are the alpha leader and not him, is very important. Conditioning Behavior A very popular method that is used in psychology is called the conditioning method. In this, you condition the mind to think in a particular direction. In aggressive dog training, it works this way - If you find that the aggressive behavior of the dog is caused due to territorial aggression and the other presence of dogs, use the same aggression to change his thinking. Associate that aggression towards other dogs to a positive thing. For example, whenever you find that there is dog barking, or dog fights or the dog lunges at other dogs, simply give him a treat. With every incident that this happens and you give him dog food in the form of a treat, he will start associating the presence of other dogs to being treated and the time will come when he will no longer bark at other dogs but simply expect a treat when other dogs come onto the scene, thus changing his dog behavior for the better. Reinforcing Good Behavior Whenever your dog follows an order or behaves according to the way in which he is trained, reward him. This will help to reinforce the good behavior and ensure continued good behavior. Dog Training Class It is always a good idea to sign up a new puppy for a behavior training class. This is because , the trainers are professionals who can teach your dog the proper and right manner of behavior. The practice and bringing the behavior into practice can be done by you at home. These were some of the aggressive dog training tips that you can use for effective training. Be assured that if you train your dog well, the returns of having a well trained, obedient and well behaved pet are incomparable.

8,Teach Dog by Using Books and Videos Training Techniques,pets," Teaching Your Dog by Using Positive and Humane Training Techniques!Training Your Dog Beyond The Basics , is very important, including these three things that all dogs should be familiar with in order to be happy and healthy.This How to Teach Dog by Using Books and Videos Training Techniques. Raising a healthy, happy, well adjusted dog is important to ensuring a lifetime of joy and companionship together. Training your dog creates a strong human-dog relationship based on trust, cooperation and well defined roles. Having a well-trained dog also helps you to feel confident and comfortable in any situation, whether around kids or other dogs. Whether you are getting your new puppy off to a good start in life, or helping your older dog learn to overcome a behavioral problem, training him creates a line of communication that serves to set boundaries that educate your dog to relate to you, other dogs and humans, and to help them become responsible members not only of your family, but of society. It sounds strange, but dogs truly are ever-increasing parts of society, especially with dog parks, doggie dates, doggie daycare and other defined socialization opportunities. Most people will teach their dogs the basics like sit, stay and house-training. These are very important, crucial things that all dogs should know. But in addition to these basic things, here are three things that go beyond those basic things but are imperative to the health and happiness of your relationship with your dog, in no particular order: Leave It Teaching ""leave it"" to your dog is valuable for many reasons. It keeps your dog safe. If you accidentally drop medicine on the floor, he will leave it alone if you tell him to. If you break a glass and tell him to ""leave it,"" he will walk away and not go near it. It also makes anything safe that you don't want him to destroy. Suppose he's eyeballing your slippers. Teach him ""leave it"" and he will let them be. Socialization This is extremely important because your dog is going to be exposed to people or animals other than your family. Whether your dog is taking a walk around the neighborhood or going to the vet, he will come into contact with other humans and animals at some point. Teaching your dog how to act in these situations is essential to his well being and safety, as well as the safety of the people or animals that he comes in contact with. If your dog is well socialized, he will greet people properly, without jumping up on them and he will be able to meet other dogs without creating tension or possibly a fight. Loving their Crate Many people have a belief that crating your dog is inhumane. Studies have shown that this is simply not true. Dogs are derived from wolves and wolves, in turn, live in dens. If properly trained to love their crates, dogs see them as a cozy den-like place where they can relax. Crate training helps with house training (since most dogs won't soil their beds), as well as keeps them and your stuff safe when you're not home. There are easy techniques to use to help your pup feel safe and secure in his crate. Never keep them in there for extremely long periods of time, and NEVER use the crate for punishment. Everything that you teach your dog brings you closer together. Always teach your dog by using positive and humane training techniques. There is a plethora of books and videos to help along the way, as well as numerous professional dog trainers in every city. Every minute spent showing your dog how to live properly in this world creates a deeper bond that lasts a lifetime.

9,Useful Dog Training Tips to Manage Excitement of a Pup at Home,pets," Points for House Training for Pups! Useful Dog Training Tips to Help Dogs Understand and Obey Commands. Dog owners need not feel frustrated trying to manage the excitement of a pup at home! Here are some useful dog training tips to help pups understand and obey commands. Having a dog as a pet in the house brings joy in more than one way. Dogs are amongst the most common pets due to their many qualities, their loving nature being one of them! Imagine the joy of a cute, cuddly puppy, nuzzling a wet nose against your body! These cuddly puppies are completely dependent on their owners once they are separated from their mommies! Whilst they whine and cry, many new owners of such puppies are often perplexed about handling young pups. Besides, managing a cute but moody pup around the house spells nothing but trouble! Therefore, dog training should begin as early as possible. Puppies when trained early on, can turn out to be the most obedient and loving dogs ever. So, before you grumble and mumble when your little pup chews your slippers or barks for no reason, take a look at these important dog training tips to learn some vital points for house training for pups. Dog Training Tips: House Training a Puppy House training for a pup is comparatively easier than training adult dogs. The first thing you need to do is keep aside time for your pup. Crate training is often the basic method of making the pup get used to the indoors and outdoors. You can begin by placing the pup in the crate for short periods during the day. If the pup wishes to defecate, you can take it outdoors in the yard. Teach your pup to use the yard or a sand box (in case you don't have a yard). For this, you will need to use different tonal variations in your voice. If the pup follows the right method, shower it with praise and love. If it doesn't, then you need to make your voice as stern as possible. A loving 'good doggie' or a stern 'bad doggie' can help it to understand your commands. When you see the dog turning around in circles, sniffing at a spot, you need to take it as a signal that it needs to urinate or defecate. Be kind and help it to identify a suitable area. Some pups are an overexcited lot! This is reflected in the way they jump and lunge at a person. Small-sized pups may not really harm a person. However, a large-sized pup can injure a person, unknowingly. Here's a simple tip for this situation. Ignore! Turn away from the pup. Ignoring the habit rather than screaming a 'no' will help you to make it understand. If it does, don't forget to reward the pup with a loving hug or praise. This is when you can experiment with commands such as 'sit' or 'stay'. Gradually, the pup will be well-behaved, in the presence of friends and guests. You need to make your pup understand that certain kinds of behavior are unacceptable. Constant communication with your pup will help control behaviors such as excessive barking. We come back to the same solution in this case, which is to disregard the behavior of the pup. Shouting or even hugging your pup when it is barking its head off gives a wrong signal. Instead, opt to leave the room or hide somewhere. Repeat this process over and over again till your pup realizes this behavior is totally unacceptable. Meal times should revolve around making the pup understand that the food given, also needs to be eaten. Mark a separate area where your pup can have its daily meal. You can even hand-feed the pup, when it turns moody. Always avoid overfeeding your pup. A few doggie treats can be given even during the day, when it displays good behavior. Training on a leash can be a fun activity. Begin by training it around the house. Avoid hurting the pup by pulling the leash too hard. Be good to your pup, and it will love to follow you around the house. This habit will help the pup understand your commands, when you take it for a stroll outside. Some understanding combined with love and care will make the house training for your pup an enjoyable activity. Treat it lovingly, like a child and you will be surprised with the results. Your pup is one of the most loyal friends you can ever have! fOR Professional Dog Trainers and Behaviorists Resources. Get full access to Doggy Dan's Online Dog Trainer.

10,How to Assist Dogs to Create their Own Forms of Fairness,pets," Train Your Dogs to Establish Their Own Form of Sharing!Ways to Create a Form of Fairness Among Dogs. To understand why fairness does not work too well with dogs, you must first have a little insight into the canine hierarchical structure. Having more than one pet in your household means that one is the dominant one and the other is more submissive If you live in a multi-pet household, especially one with multiple dogs, then you may try to practice fairness. If one pooch gets a tasty bone, then the other one gets the same exact bone. Teaching fairness is okay with children, but doing so in the dog world can lead to problems. So, next time you try to take a toy away from Fido and give it to Spot, rethink what you are teaching through this action. You may be setting your home up for a dangerous war zone. To understand why fairness does not work too well with dogs, you must first have a little insight into the canine hierarchical structure. Having more than one pet in your household means that one is the dominant one and the other is more submissive. You, however, should establish yourself as the pack leader. That way, you have control over your pets. The dominant dog may pick his favorite resting spots and push the other out of the way, or he may be the first to be petted when you arrive home. You may not feel that this is fair for the other dog, but you must understand that it is part of the structural rules the dogs have already set in place. If you intervene, then you could be asking for trouble. So, let your dogs establish their own form of sharing. They will come up with ways to create a form of fairness within their own hierarchy. If you'll notice, they may take turns lying on the favorite sofa spot, or they may each have their own spots within your home. Even if Fido gets to chew on both of the bones before he hands them over to Spot, you must realize that this is the way your dogs are handling things. Problems can arise when you favor another dog in the name of ""fairness."" Taking Fido's bones away and giving them to Spot can create an aggressive situation, hurting the relationship between the dogs. Now, there are times when you can practice fairness without shaking the hierarchical structure. It is important that you spend time with each dog individually. The dogs both need love and attention, but they may not get it at the same time. Obedience training is one such time when you need to practice fairness. One pooch should be confined while you work with the other. You can do this by leaving Fido indoors and taking Spot outdoors for obedience training. You can also confine one with a pet gate while you practice with the other. However, the problem with a pet gate is that the dogs can still see each other. You may have one dog howling and barking while you are trying to get the other to pay attention to you. Yes, your dogs do have their own ways of sharing, but there are times when you may need to intervene. Spot may steal Fido's bone to provoke a playful chase, not to start a fight. On the other hand, Spot may become aggressive and protective over the bones. The former is okay behavior; the latter is not. If either dog begins to exhibit aggression, then it's time for you to step in. Never physically intervene between two dogs! Instead, step in with professional training and help. A dog may exhibit aggression over his toys, his food, his bedding or favorite resting spot, or even you. This type of aggression is not healthy, and it can cause violence within your home. If you think your dog has become too territorial, then seek a professional's help. Dogs create their own forms of fairness; there is no need for you to step in and play that role. You may not like the fact that one dog gets to play with all the new toys first, but that is not something that requires your intervention. You should intervene, however, if one dog begins to show violent or aggressive tendencies. Aggression is an issue that often requires the help of a behavioral specialist. Instead of trying to be fair with the dogs together, be fair with them independently. Spend time training and playing with each dog individually.

11,Puppy Training Basics,pets," Because our puppy is still young, it learns quickly. This is why we have to use this time to properly teach the puppy what is acceptable and what is not, how it should behave in certain situations etc. In this article I will give you some instructions about the most important things that a young dog has to learn during its first few months that will determine not just the puppy's life, but its owner's as well. The first thing a dog owner expects from his or her dog is not to relieve himself inside the home. This is the first step in housebraking a puppy. It is important for a dog owner to know how to house train a dog. Many people who lack this skill abandones their dogs eventually. This may be a little bit longer process because we have to wait until the puppy is old enough to establish proper toilet habits. It's a good idea to confine the puppy to a separate area until we can start this aspect of house training. This does not mean that the dog should be isolated. Remember that a dog is a social being and needs to be around people and other animals. There are great waterproof training pads available that we can put on the floor to reduce the mess a young puppy may make. Once the puppy is older, we should follow its daily routine so we can predict when we will have to take the dog outside for a walk. Mostly puppies will need to go outside in the morning, shortly after eating and drinking, after waking up from a nap or before night. We need to feed the puppy always the same time so we can establish their daily routine. Do not punish the puppy in case of an accident. Remember, it's not their fault. On the other hand, always praise or treat the puppy when he uses his designated potty area. Another very important thing a young puppy must learn is not to jump on people. To prevent this, the puppy must be caught in the act. Don't punish the dog, just confidently tell him that it is a bad thing to do. Socialization is another vital element in the life of a puppy. If the dog is not well socialized during this time, it may become too shy or too aggressive later. The dog has to feel comfortable around people. When teething, a puppy can cause a lot of damage in our home. While this is very annoying, and the owner can get angry easily, it is not the puppy's fault. We have to make sure that when we leave the puppy alone, he won't be able to get near any furniture or other objects that can be damaged with chewing. There are useful toys for this purpose and we have to teach the dog to chew on them instead of furnitures. Don't forget to treat the dog when he chooses his toy to chew on."
12,How to Hire a Pest Control Company,pets," When it comes to hiring a pest control company, there are several questions that one should ask himself before going ahead and picking one of the many companies that are sprawled all over America. Most people think that they can just go ahead and eradicate these irritating pests by themselves but this is not a feasible solution that you should consider. Firstly, you will have to engage in a trial and error method when selecting the correct pesticides to use. Secondly, you have to be extra careful that the pesticides you have bought do not get into the wrong hands e.g. your lovely children. Thirdly, you will have to come up with the right spots to apply the pesticide. Finally, you must play a balancing act when it comes to using the right dosage so that you don’t put your family at risk and one which is still effective to terminate those disturbing pests. With all these hindrances to contend with, it is wise that you give the job to an experienced company which will eradicate the pests professionally. In order to select the right pest control company, ensure that you bear the following points in mind. Firstly, enquire from them what sort of treatment cover they offer. Usually, one package could cover such pests as roaches and ants while another will be used for termites. Due to all these varieties, you need to be certain that the company you are hiring will have the pests you want wiped out among their packages. Secondly, make sure that the company you are going for comes with free treatments in between the planned ones. This will take care of any recurrent problems that may spring up in the course of drug administration. Good companies will always offer you free services in case you are still getting trouble by pests before the next treatment. Thirdly, make certain that the pesticides being used by the company are not hazardous to your kids and pets. For example, some Phoenix pest control companies will tell you from the onset whether their pesticides are harmful to your children therefore necessitating evacuation in affected zones or if your kids can still play around and not get hurt. Finally, always go through various customer reviews to find out what those who have used the pest control company have to say about their services. In case of lavish praises and positive feedback, you should feel free to contract the company since it implies that they perform a wonderful job."
13,How to Choose a Termite Company in Phoenix,pets," There are a lot of  Phoenix pest control companies to choose from when you want your termites’ problem dealt with. Due to this number of exterminators to choose from, it pays to have knowledge of what to look for when contracting them. Failure to carry out your research well may see you moving from one termite company to the next to no avail. As you well know, you could end up incurring a lot of expenses when termites invade your home. Apart from paying for the exterminator, you will still have to repair the damaged sections. In regard to the current economic conditions, one must therefore be careful when it comes to parting with his or her hard-earned money. The following are the main points that you should look at when hiring a termite company in Phoenix. For one, always ensure that any company you shortlist comes with a guarantee. There is no use hiring an exterminator if they are not keen to give you a guarantee that the termites will bug you no more. This will protect you from having to deal with the same issue once the termites emerge again. In such a case they will still offer their services to you at no cost since you contracted them to eradicate termites from your home. Secondly, check whether the firm enjoys a good reputation in the marketplace. This will mostly come from contented clients who are willing to hire them again due to the quality of their services. In case of numerous complaints, you should drop such a company like a hot potato and move on to the next one. A good way of looking at a company’s reputation is to check out such services as Better Business Bureau to scrutinize the track record of the pest company. In addition, it will do you no harm to visit the Department of Agriculture in Phoenix and check out the profile of this company. Next, always ensure that the company you are seeking to contract belongs to the Phoenix pest control association. Legal companies are sure to register with this association while bogus ones will appear shady from the onset. Additionally, you should organize a face to face meeting with those companies you have shortlisted to find out if they know their business to the last detail. Ask them such questions as treatment procedures and the most infested sites in Phoenix. This will give you a clue whether the company is run by professionals or quarks. Although the above factors are not exhaustive, they will certainly point you in the right direction when it comes to selecting the right termite company in Phoenix."
14,Find Termites Before They Find You,pets," Realizing that you have termites in your home before they wreak untold havoc will help you to avoid big costs later on when the problem escalates. Termites are known for operating under the surface for ages before they emerge at the top or before you have a chance to see their traces. In most cases, spotting termites might mean that the damage has already been done. In order to avoid getting caught by surprise, here are a few tell-tale signs that will help you to spot the problem much quickly. Firstly, the easiest way to find out whether you have termites in your house will be by observing any kind of termite waste. Look out for elongated hard pellets which are regularly shaped and come in six sides. This will be a sure-fire way that termites have paid you a visit and you should therefore locate the closest pest control company before the issue gets out of hand and you find yourself dealing with much more than just termites. In Arizona, there are several options that you could go for when you want to eradicate termites. For example, Phoenix pest control companies are always eager to get you out of such a mess at very affordable rates. Secondly, observe around your house whether there are mud tubes. Termites construct mud tubes so as to move from one region to the next and they should only spell one thing to you: TERMITES! In case you don’t know how they look like, visualize a combination of mud and water (saliva in this case) and you are almost there. As the name suggests, mud tubes are made of mud and you will usually spot them on the wall or ceiling. In fact, if you happen to break a section of these tubes, you will come face to face with the little beasts as they go about their pesky business. After concluding that you have termites in your premises, the next thing will be to find out what type of termites they are. The most popular type in such areas as Arizona and Phoenix is the drywood termite. Its name is derived from its preferred habitat which is on dry wood. These termites are therefore found mostly in warm areas where they can feast on some dry wooden structures. Apart from this species, other types include: Formorean termites which prefer wooden particles as well and the Subterranean termites which can be spotted on underground places where there are wooden structures."
15,Do You Need A Professional Pest Control Company?,pets," When it comes to issues to do with money, many people do not want to hand out their cash to someone else. Rather, they would prefer to go for DIY (do-it-yourself) methods over hiring a pest control company. While saving money is certainly a commendable deed, doing so at the expense of your family safety and short-term gains is not to be recommended. Once you try to get rid of pests in your home and fail, you risk exposing your family to safety concerns and incurring even more costs in future. This is because pests like termites will eat their way in the wooden structures of your house which may cause the wall to collapse on your dear ones. In addition, the future costs to repair such a house will be over the top. Other reasons why you should go for a professional company are listed below. For one, exterminators have extensive knowledge when it comes to identifying various pests and are thus better-placed to deal with them. Since they have many years in experience, these companies will locate where pests are hidden in your residence and go about dealing with them expertly. For your case, you could find that there are many more pests you have left concealed in various places that you can’t think of. Secondly, you are most likely going to buy your pesticides from the local stores. Such pesticides only last for a short duration before they run out of power. This is in contrast to those used by pest control companies which even go up to 60 days. This difference may mean a lot when it comes to eradicating pests in your home as they will soon come crawling back if you decide to go for ineffective locally-purchased pesticides. Next, you should know that one of the common problems that homeowners get to deal with is the issue of recurring pests. Going for a professional company will give you the benefit of being on their maintenance program where they will be paying you a visit to check if the pests have resurfaced again. This is actually the case in such pests-infested areas like Phoenix where Phoenix pest control companies pay planned visits to their clients. Finally, exterminators will offer you a guarantee that they will wipe away the pests which are bothering you. Such companies are confident of eradicating pests after years of experience doing the same. You therefore stand a higher chance of getting your problem solved when you contract them than if you decide to save some few bucks and do the job yourself, a decision which could come back to haunt you in future."
16,Finding Your Lost Dog,pets," It’s every dog owner’s worst nightmare: losing your dog. Canines are curious creatures and if you aren’t careful they could disappear in a split second. Every year there are millions of pets who wander from home and never find their way back. There are precautions you can take to assist in a swift recovery if your dog ever goes missing, including microchipping your pet and providing a collar tag. If your pup gets loose without a microchip or collar, your best bets are calling the local shelters and utilizing the internet to your advantage. Try to remain calm and keep faith that your loving pooch will be found. Microchipping your pet has been around since 1995 and millions of conscientious pet owners are getting in on the action. Veterinarians and animal shelters encourage pet owners to provide their animal with a microchip for emergency situations. The process includes a microchip implant that contains an identifiable integrated circuit which is placed under the skin of your pet; the chips are roughly the size of a large grain of rice and are supported on inert Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. If you adopt your pet, most shelters will include microchipping with the adoption fee. Each microchip contains a unique ID that can be identified with a special scanner, and the owners are given a tag with the microchip number for personal proof. There are enrollment papers that go along with the chip number for the owner to fill out that includes information like contact information, name and description of pet, and an emergency contact number. Any lost animals brought to the shelter can be identified with the help of this handy invention. A collar tag is worn on the dog collar  and is essential to have on your pet if they aren’t microchipped. There are many places you can get a personalized collar tag from; some pet stores even have one-stop machines that can generate your request in a matter of minutes. Collar tags typically contain important information of your furry friend, including the name of the pet and owner contact information. If your pooch goes missing a pet collar tag will help whoever finds your wandering pal in identifying and returning them. Give your pooch’s personalized pet collar tag an even more personalized touch with all of the different color and style options available. If your dog doesn’t find their way back within twenty-four hours, start calling local shelters in the area. There is a chance that somebody discovered your buddy and brought them to a shelter for safe keeping. Only fifteen to twenty percent of lost dogs that have been brought into shelters are recovered by their owners.  Most of the retrieved dogs were matched back to their owner in large thanks to microchips and collar tags. If your pet hasn’t brought into the shelters and days continue to go by, try back with all the shelters, and even branch out to call shelters further away  (animals travel quick!). Also call local veterinarians and animal control facilities in addition to the shelters, people also tend to bring lost animals to these places as well. Call around and even call around again if more time goes by. The internet is a useful tool for anything, so exercise it to your advantage during your search. There are existing websites, like helpmefindmypet.com, out there that were created to help in the search of finding lost pets. Search your local area for your lost pal and have someone stay at your home in case your pooch finds their way back during your hunt. Post on social networks, make signs to put around town, and even place an ad in the newspaper. Maintain a positive outlook while your pooch is gone and continue to do all you can do for your search. Spread the word and have trust that your pup will be found. Don’t wear yourself out, after you put forth your best efforts to find your furry friend, ease off and wait. If some time goes by and you are still without your pal, begin your search again. Sometimes pets are lost for months and travel further than expected before making their way back home. Good luck on your search!"
17,6 Dog Training Obedience Behaviors That Family Dogs Should Learn,pets," There are six basic obedience behaviors that every family dog should learn in their lifetime. Life with a dog becomes much simpler when your dog listens to you and your family members. And besides teaching your dog these skills may potentially save his life someday. This article is for anyone who has a family dog and wants him to obey certain commands. Studies have demonstrated how basic obedience training can help to lower the risk of a dog biting and other bad behaviors. Obedience training teaches you how to reinforce good behaviors and how to eliminate the bad behaviors. The six basic obedience behaviors are: Heel and walking on a loose leash. The difference between the two is that when a dog is heeling he is walking directly to your left side and following you every step whereas walking on a loose leash means that the dog can walk anywhere around you as long as there is no tension on the leash. Heeling is one of the most important obedience behaviors that you must train in any obedience training class. Sit and sit by your side. The sit command is very important because it allows you to have control over your dog whenever you want to. He cannot jump up or bother someone if you get him to sit down. Getting your dog to sit by your side is also an obedience skill that is highly effective. It allows you to begin your training sessions with more control over your dog and to get him to easily focus on you. Down and down stay. Teaching your dog to lie down is very effective at controlling the dog since he has to get out before he can do anything else. And when you train this behavior it is very easy to tell when the dog is about to stand from the down position which makes it easy to reprimand the dog. The best thing about teaching your dog to lie down is that it also allows you to teach the stay command. Leave it. A very important but sometimes neglected command is to teach your dog to leave a certain distraction alone. Let's say you are walking down the road and your dog suddenly looks at a squirrel, telling your dog to leave it would instruct the dog to ignore the squirrel and to keep walking. Look at me. There is no other skill more important than your dog's attention on you. If you plan on participating in any type of dog show or dog sport then you will need your dog to look at you for information. This behavior is easily trained by constantly rewarding the dog for looking at you and at your face. Quiet. Another obedience training skill is to teach your dog to be quiet and to stop barking when instructed to. This is great when you have somebody delivering something at your house and you don't want your dog barking the entire time that they are there."
18,How To Get Your Dog To Give You A High Five,pets," Your dog giving you a high-five is something that every household dog should know. And to be honest with you, everybody that owns a dog is able to teach this trick in only 5 to 10 minutes. It only requires a couple of treats and some time and effort on the part of the dog owner. The first thing that you want to do to teach your dog to give you a high-five is to bring your dog in a quiet environment where you can train him without any distractions. I recommend that you practice in your living room or somewhere that your dog is accustomed to. If you try to train him outside or in a place that your dog doesn't know well, then he will be distracted by the many different smells and sounds of the environment. The goal is to get your dog to focus on you and the training at hand. Place your dog in a sit position and ask him to shake paw. If your dog doesn't know how to shake paw yet, then all you have to do is grab his paw and then give him a treat. After a couple of times he will learn that lifting his paw is what earns him the treat. Then you will want to move your hand higher and higher and put your palm towards him in a high-five manner. Your dog will begin to differentiate between the shake a paw and the high-five depending on how your hand is positioned. You want to go from the shake a paw position and gradually move to a high-five position. The most important thing to do while training your dog is to reinforce him with treats, lots of encouraging praise and petting him anytime that he does something that you like. To better the accuracy of your training, you can use what is called a marker signal which tells the dog exactly which behavior earned him the reinforcement. For example while you train your dog you can say the word yes at exactly the moment which your dog touches your hand with his paw. Once your dog learns your hands signal and can easily give you a high five then you need to incorporate a verbal command. This command can be anything but it is usually the name of the trick. In this example the command high-five would be well suited. To really do this successfully, you will need to say your command high-five just as your dog moves his paw towards your hand. We're talking about a fraction of a second here but the closer your command is given to the behavior then the quicker your dog will learn it. Once your dog has gotten the hang of giving you a high-five, you can get him to do it even more spectacularly. Get him to do it from a standing position on his hind legs. This has the appearance that your dog is actually jumping up to give you a high five. To do this all you have to do is move your hand higher and higher until your dog performs the trick flawlessly."

20,Aquariums: Freshwater or Saltwater,pets," Keeping fish is a great hobby and one that can be enjoyed from a young age.  Though relatively easy to keep, there are a few choices that need to be made before you head to your local fish store and purchase your aquarium. There are differences between having a freshwater and a saltwater aquarium and the types of fish that are required in each setting. If this is your first time with an aquarium many expert recommends that it is best to choose a freshwater aquarium in your initial set up. The primary reasoning behind this is that freshwater tanks are the easier of the two to maintain and secondly, the cost of freshwater fish is more reasonable for a first attempt. Keeping fish successfully is learned by trial and error and losing less expensive fish is easier on the budget. What to Consider Beginners should go with the most common rectangular 55 gallon tank and choosing an all glass aquarium will ensure easier clean up with very little effort. Fish are active and require space to grow so keep in mind your surroundings and adjust the size of tank accordingly. Freshwater and saltwater aquariums can both be fish only aquariums but many choose to have a more colorful environment with plants, rocks, and coral.  Be sure to discuss your choice of tank with knowledgeable staff when you stock your aquarium, as each requires a different set up for best results with saltwater being the more involved of the two. Basically the same filtration, heating and lighting is needed for both aquariums but a saltwater tank will need more advanced equipment. Depending on how well you stock the aquarium, your filtration system should be able to handle the waste matter that the fish will produce. Check with the staff for the best system that will fit within your budget. Salt is obviously the most common difference between the two tanks and also the critical levels of ph, saline, nitrates, calcium and temperature need to be balanced to keep your fish healthy. Both tanks have different parameters and it's important to learn the different elements required for each. Choosing the right kinds of fish for a harmonious tank is just as important. You must not overcrowd the tank and you cannot select a group of fish to live together based on your likes. Predatory and aggressive fish will attack the meeker fish so gather information on which species adapts wells with each other to avoid the unnecessary loss of fish. It is important to remember that a fish tank should never be in direct sunlight,but artificial lighting that can be regulated with a timer is a perfect solution for lighting as well as maintaining a healthy eco system. The Pros of Each Fresh water fish are less costly, easier to breed and maintain and are more tolerant to errors to their environment. Saltwater fish are more colorful, and keeping their environment pristine is an advantage for those who prefer a more hands on approach to having an aquarium. Deciding which tank is right for you needs careful consideration. Take the time to do some thorough research before making your decision and think ahead for future tank expansions while in the planning stages. Starting small may well be the best way to approach this new hobby. You can learn the types of fish you enjoy most and grow from there."

1,How To Get Your Dog To Stop Being Possessive Around His Food Bowl,pets," A very challenging problem that can occur with any dog is food possessiveness. That means that the dog thinks that the food is his and you may take it away so he has to protect it. Of course your dog is not born this way which means that the behavior has been taught with time, whether knowingly or unknowingly. A big concern with food possessiveness is the potential danger that the dog may snap at the dog owner or worse at their kids. Sometimes dog owners are busy people and they forget that dogs view their kids as other dogs. When a kid is crawling around on the floor and is playing with the dog food bowl, the dog only sees another dog trying to get his food. So this is a very important topic that should be thought of and properly handled to prevent potential problems. There are several methods to stop this behavior. The first thing that you should do as a dog owner is regulate the amount of food that is available to your dog at one time. You should feed him twice a day and if there is anything left in his food bowl after 10 min., then you should take it away. There is no point to letting your dog eat whenever he wants to. The second thing that I highly recommend that every dog owner do, is while you're dog is eating his dinner, to walk to his food bowl and drop a couple of treats in it. It has to be something that he values highly so that he learns that when you walk up to his food bowl something pleasurable is going to happen. The last thing that you want to do is take away the food bowl while the dog is still eating, as that will teach him the opposite: that you come to take the food away. If you have leftovers that are good enough for dogs, then you can use that instead of treats which will be even better. For example, when I make a beef stew I sometimes keep just a little bit so that I can practice this exercise with my dogs. If you've never trained this exercise before, I recommend that you do this every day for one week. It's a very simple thing to do since your dog will be eating every day anyways, you might as well use this as a training opportunity. Practicing this exercise will help tremendously down the line. If you have a puppy, then this is an even better opportunity to train. Get your family involved! Ask them to practice the same exercise with you, and with a variety of treats. I would recommend that you do this with everyone in your family under, your supervision of course. If you think that your dog is uncomfortable with the exercise, you can leave treats nearby his food bowl instead of in it. Don't worry, he'll know that there are treats nearby and he'll get them whether during or after his dinner."
2,Houses for Dogs – How to Easily Set-Up Your Dog Kennel for Over Twice the Usable Size,pets," I have discovered a really functional and efficient set-up for a new dog kennel and dog house. I struggled with where and how to best arrange my dogs house and kennel. The issues I was considering and felt were priorities were; Close to the house would make it easier to let my dog in and out. I wanted as much room to run as possible for my dog. Cleaning the dogs kennel and dogs house would be easier if a water hose was located nearby. I also wanted to incorporate the dogs’ house into the dogs kennel without using room inside the kennel. I wanted a location that would enable the dogs’ view of the street and entrance so he wouldn’t bark as much, and at the same time would enable me to admire the nice house I got for him. Any other ways I could minimize the work of caring for my dog as far as this setup is concerned? After many changes on the drawing board I settled with what seemed to be a plan that would accomplish all of my concerns. It would start with the location. I chose to put the kennel on the side of my house, attached to it, with a door and water hose nearby. I placed the kennel END section with the door directly next to my house door. Since it is attached to the house I gained another 8' in length so the dog can really run. The house also protects the dogs’ house and kennel from some of the wind and rain. I set the two 4 ft. kennel END sections as the ends of the run and the two ""long"" 8' kennel sections running parallel with my house connected to each other and to one of the END sections. To gain another couple of feet in the length of the run, I placed the dogs’ house at the end of the SIDE sections nearest the kennel door and house door, and attached the fencing to posts at the front of the dogs’ house. The dogs’ house faces towards my house door so I can see my dog while he’s in his home. Another configuration that would have suited my situation is with the dogs’ house between the two 8 ft. sections of dog kennel. I just preferred the dogs’ house to be close to my house door but I believe my dog is happier this way because he is so close to the entry point of our house, he can hear us inside and everyone who enters must walk right past him. Now he usually gets a lot of attention from our guests. It is also very easy for us to hear him as he jumps on his kennel gate when he wants to come in or if he notices something that worries him. For a smaller dog, a pass-through door would enable him to go in and out whenever he wants. You could also pass his food out that way. I tried the set-up out for a month to be sure I didn’t want to change it, after this I made a concrete slab with a 4"" grade draining away from the house so it would clean up easily. At the same time I anchored fence posts in the ground on the sides of where the dogs’ house would be and attached a section of plywood above the dogs’ house so nothing can pass through that area. With this method no holes needed to be drilled in the dogs’ house. A few things I added after the initial build for convenience and efficiency are; • A flex hose to the end of my house gutters downspout that ends at the kennel edge so that the slab is cleaned with every rain. • An altered spackle bucket with part of the sides cut out for his food dish, this can be lowered from a window so I don’t even need to go out the door. • Some shrubbery around his house to keep the sun from overheating him, which also makes the whole set-up look fantastic. The dog kennel is now 18'x4' instead of the original 8'x4' The square footage is now 72' instead of 32' or even less if the dogs’ house was inside the kennel. Since the rain water does such a good job cleaning, I only have to do a major clean up every 2 weeks instead of the usual every few days. Even feeding him is much easier. For obvious reasons you should feed him near the window or dog house door. This set-up gives him more room to run, and me, more time to play with him. I hope this experience can benefit some of you. I would love to hear about your dogs house or kennel ideas."
3,Putting Together A Winter Horse Feed Regime,pets," The colder months can be a tough time for horse and pony owners. Unless an individual has a background in equine nutrition, it can be tricky to know which types of feed and precise quantities to provide the horse with, to ensure they remain warm and in good physical shape throughout winter. However, if a few key rules are kept in mind, the horse should cope very well with the chillier months and come into spring healthy, happy and in good weight to start the new season. Being exposed to freezing, damp and windy weather conditions can significantly increase the amount of food and energy a horse requires because it is much harder for them to maintain their body temperature. Horses that are staying out 24/7 must be given a constant supply of high energy roughage and concentrates as needed on a regular basis. Good quality horse feed along with a block of vitamins and minerals in the field will help them to digest their feed properly, maintain condition and keep warm. Older horses will need extra attention when the temperature dips. Some veteran animals have problems with dental health which can make things difficult for them over winter. With the increased reliance on long stem forage, such as hay, they might not be able to ingest enough roughage to keep them warm. If an older horse starts losing weight over winter a dental check is recommended, along with a vet check and worming check to pinpoint any other problems. It may well be that the equine requires a higher energy horse feed. Many horse feed companies now manufacture feeds especially for veteran horses which can be a convenient solution. At the other end of the scale, fit competition horses may also need some additional support throughout winter. These horses usually have minimal body fat and are often clipped at the beginning of winter to prevent excessive sweating during exercise. Body fat and hair are both fantastic insulators that these athletic animals will not be able to benefit from. Consequently, they must have a constant supply of hay when they are turned out to keep them warm. A well fitting, wind and rain proof winter rug will also go a long way to keeping a horse warm and comfortable. Along with roughage and concentrate, it is vital that horses receive enough water over winter. Springtime grass contains a large amount of water, meaning the horse doesn’t need to rely as much on its water trough or bucket. During winter, the water content in grass is much lower, meaning they must be provided with a constant supply of clean, fresh, uncontaminated water. If temperatures enter the minus figures, owners must check the trough every morning and night to break any ice that might have formed. If an owner is at a complete loss when it comes to winter nutrition, horse feed companies can be a great help. Most brands have nutritionists available that are qualified to give advice on what a particular age and breed of horse or pony needs. The most important thing to remember is to monitor your equine carefully over the winter months. Rugs and thick winter coats can hide a multitude of sins. Check a horse’s condition score regularly, ensuring that ribs are well covered with a nice layer of warm, insulating fat. If a close eye is kept on the horse and any potential problems are dealt with straightaway, there is no reason the equine shouldn’t make it through winter without any health issues whatsoever."
4,Canine Sniffers– Your Best Weapon Against New Jersey Bed Bugs,pets," Summary: There are many ways to eradicate New Jersey bed bugs. The most efficient way of detection is through the use of specially trained canine sniffers that can localize infestations, within a three foot radius, allowing you to surgically clear the affected areas efficiently. New Jersey bed bugs are quite a menace, because they tend to infest in great numbers, and affect a lot of places inside the house. There are many methods that can be adopted to get rid of these pests. For example, the use of diatomaceous earth for use in treating carpets and box springs. The problem with this method is that prolonged use can cause skin irritation, and is also a known carcinogen. New Jersey bed bugs can also be gotten rid of through the use of insecticides, like pyrethrin and roach powder, such as boric acid. The downside of all these methods is the fact that you are only treating a general area, where you think these bed bugs live and lay their eggs. If you don’t get rid of all the nesting areas, chances are, these pests will come back and infest your home once more, at a later date. The most efficient way of detecting New Jersey bed bugs is through the use of specially trained canine sniffers. These dogs have undergone the same training techniques used in bomb and drug detection. A recent university study states that these canines, if properly trained, and supervised by certified handlers, have a ninety eight percent chance of detecting your bed bug infestation. These dogs undergo rigorous training and certification standards set by NESDCA or the National Entomology Scent Detection Canine Association. You may be curious to know how these canines detect the New Jersey bed bugs. They do it through familiarization of the scent left behind by bed bug droppings, skin cast offs, and eggs. The great thing about using these canines is that you can get the confidence needed to know after bed bug extermination treatments, if there are still pockets of infestation left that could pose a greater danger later on. Another advantage of using these canines as New Jersey bed bugs sniffers is that they can detect the pests within a three foot radius which means, you can localize where the exact infestations are, saving you time, money and effort in eradicating these parasites from your home. Canine sniffers, used against New Jersey bed bugs can cover more locations and infestation sites at a much faster and efficient rate than by simply using a technician and carpet bombing your building with chemicals. These highly trained and efficient dogs are indispensable assets in the war against these parasites."

Breeds that can be trained for this peculiar exercise of hunting New Jersey bed bugs are Puggles, Beagles and Border Collies. Beagles have one of the best developed senses of smell. Beagles are better at ground-scenting (following a trail on the ground) than they are at air-scenting. The long ears and large lips of the Beagle probably assist in trapping the scents close to the nose. Border Collies have immensely developed sense of smell. Their high drives make them outstanding and easily motivated tracking dogs. Border Collies need to be trained and they have to be given considerable physical exercise daily. They also need a lot of mental stimulation. These New Jersey bed bugs crushers are one of the most intelligent breeds. They are extremely acrobatic, energetic and perfect bed bugs finder.

8,Options for Dog Tartar Removal,pets," Most dog owners think the only option for dog tartar removal is a professional cleaning at the vet's.  This is absolutely not true.  There is an alternative that is safe, effective, and inexpensive.  It is Plaque Attack for dogs. Before explaining why Plaque Attack is a better alternative, let’s look at the pros and cons of teeth cleaning at the vet’s.  First of all, it’s very expensive.  A cleaning can run several hundred dollars, often over $500, depending on whether or not tooth extractions are necessary or if a course of antibiotics is prescribed to prevent infection from gums nicked by the dental tools. Then there’s the risk to your dog’s life.  When the vet cleans your dog’s teeth, he gives your pet an anesthetic.  Your dog wouldn’t obediently lie with his mouth open while the vet scales his teeth, so he is put under anesthesia.  With anesthesia there is always the risk of death.  Approximately 1 in every 233 dogs dies under anesthesia.  That may seem like a safe ratio, but when compared to 1 in every 10,000 people dying under anesthesia, it isn’t a good ratio at all.  Chances are your pet will be okay getting his teeth cleaned, but you are putting his life at risk when he has this procedure. On the positive side, when the procedure is over his teeth will be clean. Using Plaque Attack for dog tartar removal, there is no risk to your dog’s life.  Plaque Attack contains only all-natural ingredients that are designed to work together to loosen built-up tartar and prevent its re-occurrence once it is removed. Just spray your dog’s teeth twice a day for the first two weeks.  You will notice your dog licking his lips, which helps spread the spray throughout his mouth, covering all his teeth.  After a couple of weeks the tartar will begin to disappear.  You can speed the process a little by gently brushing your dog’s teeth before application to loosen the plaque and allow the spray to penetrate better.  In a few weeks, after the tartar is gone, you can reduce applications to two or three times a week to prevent new tartar from building up. The cost is nominal.  Even though we want only the best for our dog’s health, often cost is a consideration, especially in these economic hard times.  Plaque Attack costs less than $20, a far cry from $500 for a vet cleaning. When you consider all the options and factors for dog tartar removal, Plaque Attack spray for dogs comes out as the clear winner.  It is safe, effective, and inexpensive.  You will ensure your dog’s oral health without stressing him our or putting his life at risk.  It’s almost a no brainer."
9,How To Teach Your Dog To Yawn On Command,pets," One of the easiest dog trick that you can train your dog to do is to teach your dog to yawn on command. This trick can be taught to any dog of any size or breed and by anyone, and by anyone I mean children and adults. What you are going to need before training this trick is treats. You can also use something that your dog likes, like a favorite toy or praise, depending on how your dog responds. For simplicity, I will use treats in my article but you are welcome to substitute it with whatever works with your dog. Place your treat nearby, preferably somewhere near that you can access easily. What I do is I put my treats on the table by my couch, in a little jar so that I can access it very easily and without having to open a bag to get to them. When your dog goes for a nap or is sleeping nearby, watch closely and wait until he wakes up. Once your dog wakes up he will most likely yawn. This is the perfect opportunity to reward your dog for yawning since that is the behavior that we want to reinforce. All you have to do during this time is to say the word ""Yes!"" at the same time that your dog yawns and immediately give him a treat after. Your timing has to be very precise in order for your dog to learn to yawn. If you do this several times a day for a week you'll notice that your dog will actually start yawning on his own without even being tired just so that he can get a treat. Once that happens, it is a golden opportunity to associate the command ""Are you tired"" with the behavior of yawning. Once you see your dog yawning, say your command ""Are you tired"" and immediately give him a treat. It should take about a week to fully condition your dog to yawn on command. Obviously this is relevant to the amount of times that you train per day or if your timing is perfect, but in an average you should expect to have a fully trained trick like this in two weeks time. Now that your dog has learned to yawn on command, you might want to show it off a little bit to your friends and family. The best way to do this is to actually do it with several other tricks so that it looks more like a performance. For example, you could ask your dog to shake his paw, roll over, turn around, give you a high five ... and finish with ""are you tired"" from all of these tricks, which your dog will inevitably yawn in approval. Well there you go, this is an extremely easy trick to train your dog and I encourage you to train as many tricks as you can since training is one of the best ways to build the relationship with your dog and to connect with him. Have fun!"

(The ideal size should be about the size of a pea.) Next, you will want to do his touch your dog and then ONE SECOND LATER give him a treat. Your timing has to be exactly precise otherwise your dog will not learn that the touch actually earns him the treat. You want to be careful and pay very close attention that you DO NOT touch and feed at the same time. There should be a very distinctive one second period between two. I recommend that you start by touching a place that your dog is already comfortable like his back or on his head, depending on how much he likes that. Eventually you will want to gradually move from his back and head and move on to more sensitive areas, like his paws and nails. Then as you progress, touch your dog's ears, his tail, and nose and lips. Think of every area that your veterinarian touches when you go for a visit. You want to train your dog to accept being touched to all of those places so that the next time you go your dog will be very comfortable during his examination. I also recommend that you ask a friend or someone that your dog doesn't know to practice this exercise so that your dog learns to also love being touched by strangers. It won't take that much time until your dog actually learns that touch = treat, which means lots of pleasure! This will work for dogs would are very scared of people or who have had something horrible happened to them as puppies. I've personally condition a local dog who didn't allow anyone to touch her head and after only a week of practicing this exercise, I could do almost anything to her. It was like a completely different dog but all it took was two training sessions per day for a week. So practice this every day for about 5 to 10 min. and ask a family member or a friend to tell you if they see any differences. If they don't, then make sure that your timing is perfect."
11,Got A Dog? Train Him This Easy Dog Trick In A Few Minutes Without Any Experience Whatsoever!,pets," Today, I'm going to show you the easiest dog trick that anyone can train their dog to do without any prior dog training experience. If you have a dog, then you will be able to train and this trick very easily and you won't need anything besides treats and a positive attitude. The dog trick is called ""target"", and it teaches the dog to touch a target with his nose where ever you place it. The first thing that you want to do is to get an old Tupperware, margarine container or one of those colorful cardboard that you may have lying around the house. Cut a circle about 2 to 3 inches wide which in the end will give you a target to train your dog. Then you will need a bag of treats. If you own a dog then you probably already have a whole bunch of those around the house. Make sure that you cut the treat in very small pieces so that you can train your dog multiple times without him getting stuffed or full from eating. To begin your training, have some treats in your pocket or nearby that can be accessed easily. Take your target and position it about the same height as your dog, he should be able to touch it with his nose with ease. Then, you will need to pay very close attention to your dog and at the exact moment that he touches the target with his nose, you will want to say the word ""yes!"" and then give him a treat. This exercise teaches the dog that touching the target with his nose gets him a treat. To make it even more challenging for your dog, you can move the target in different positions. You can move it to the left, to the right, a little higher or a little lower. Don't forget to keep saying the word ""yes!"" and giving your dog a treat each time that he touches the target. Finally, you will need to train your dog that the word ""target!"" means to touch the target. The way that I like to do that is by saying it just before the dog touches the target. It's a little tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it, it works very well. Step-by-step example: Have the target ready in your hand and your treat nearby. Bring the target where your dog can easily touch it with his nose. Wait for him to start walking towards the target. Once he starts walking towards the target, say your command ""target!"". Pay close attention and as soon as his nose touches the target, say your word ""yes!"" and give him the treat. I recommend that you practice this exercise several times to really associate the command with the behavior. Remember to have fun with this, dog tricks are all about connecting your dog and having fun.

12,What Is the Best Tartar Remover for Dogs?,pets," If you polled dog owners and asked them, ""What is the best tartar remover for dogs,"" the vast majority would probably say a cleaning at the vets is best.  They wouldn't even give it a moment's thought before answering.  But is it really?  Let’s look at the pros and cons. PROS Your dog’s teeth will be clean. CONS Your dog will have to be put under anesthesia.  One out of every 233 dogs put under anesthesia dies.  If you have your dog’s teeth cleaned at the vet’s, he’ll probably be OK.  But what if he isn’t?  Is your dog a senior citizen?  Does he have some health issues, however minor?  Anesthetic for him may not be such a good idea. A cleaning at the vet’s is not cheap.  It will cost you several hundred dollars.  If the vet thinks a tooth or two needs to be extracted, he won’t ask your permission, he’ll do it to save having to bring the dog back for another session.  Those extractions will add to the cost.  Often, after a cleaning, a course of antibiotics is prescribed.  That adds to the cost.  We all want the best for our pets, but let’s face it, in these tough economic times, money is a factor. What about brushing your dog’s teeth?  Is that the best tartar remover for dogs?  Yes, you can brush your dog’s teeth.  But will your dog like it?  Generally dogs are not particularly cooperative when someone sticks something in their mouth.  In addition to the dog moving his head around, you are only able to brush the outside of the teeth, not the inside.  At best, brushing just delays the buildup of plaque. Is there a better alternative to teeth cleaning at the vet’s for dog tartar removal or brushing?  The answer is yes.  Plaque Attack is such an alternative. Plaque Attack for dogs is a spray that is applied to your dog’s teeth twice a day.  Its ingredients are all natural – nothing that is harmful to your dog.  If your dog has a heavy plaque buildup, spray twice a day, concentrating the spray on the heaviest areas of tartar.  Otherwise, spray once a day.  You will notice your dog licking his lips, which helps spread the Plaque Attack over all his teeth.  You should begin seeing positive results in about 2 weeks. When you use Plaque Attack, your dog’s teeth will be clean.  You won’t have to take him to the vet.  There’s no worry about him being harmed, and the cost is very reasonable.  The one downside, if you consider it a downside, is that positive results will take a few weeks.  All things considered, Plaque Attack is the best tarter remover for dogs."
13,"Houses for Dogs, 5 Tips for Noisy-at-Night Dogs",pets," If you have had dogs in your family before, chances are you have had problems with the sleep all day and up all night puppy. I want to list a few tips that might help you get some sleep at night when FIDO wants to play. Dogs are very similar to children, they respond to stimulus from their environment but with some proactive planning you can help them to sleep at night like you do. Normalize their eating and duty times especially towards the end of the day. I like to walk my dogs in late afternoon, and then feed them as soon as we get back inside. They get energized again from the food and being inside with you. This is good; everyone can have some fun after a hard day at work. It won't be long before their dinner is digested and they need or just want to go outside again to relieve themselves or just run and play some more. Try to schedule this for shortly before you want to retire. No more food or water after this point, maybe just a very small chewy treat for a reward. Now try to let them relax near you for a little while. Try to reduce stimuli so they get more relaxed. Turn the volume down on everything including your voice. Turn some lights off but not all, darkness tends to put them on alert if it's sudden. If possible limit the visitors you receive and also your own physical activity. Some white-noise can help drowning out the sounds your puppy hears from outside. No vigorous play for an hour before bedtime. Dogs houses are a calming place for them so if possible an indoor house for dogs (puppy crate) that would be near you would help greatly. You BOTH can sleep better when you have a designated house that can be his bed...again it helps them relax if they are near you. You can use his pad to show him that he should be in the house or crate. Move it during the day so he knows where to go. Giving your dog more of his food in the morning (protein) and less at night (carbs) will make your problem puppy a little sleepier at night. More activity during the day actually helps them sleep better at night, again similar to a child, or even for us adults. It is best to exercise your dog at a high exertion level several hours before you plan on his last meal, the wind down period should be regular and limited to short, low paced walks at the most. If you consistently use these tips it shouldn't be long before you have a routine that helps you have a better night’s sleep and gives you a great mental outlook when you awaken each morning. A good night’s sleep is one of the biggest controllable health factors you can provide, for you and your dog. I would love to hear any suggestions for methods that worked for you."
14,Save a Dog and Adopt Today,pets," Each year an estimated eight to ten million dogs are given away to shelters. Dogs find their way to shelters for a variety of reasons; a death in the family, financial reasons of the owner, a family move they cannot join, or they have simply been lost. According to the Human Society, about four to five million of those dogs are euthanized yearly because they don't find homes. With such a large sum of dogs staying in shelters, it should be a unanimous decision to skip the pet store. Many pet stores acquire their dogs from puppy mills, which have recently earned recognition for animal cruelty. Adoption is the obvious choice if you are thinking about bringing a dog into your home. In fact, October is Adopt-A-Shelter Dog month and the American Humane Society is encouraging people to visit their local shelters and pick out the right furry friend for them. Anytime of the year is a great time to adopt a worthy pet, so do some research and visit the shelters in your area to discover that perfect match for you. Many people opt out of picking their furry friend from an animal shelter because of specific breed or age preferences that they feel a shelter won't offer. These viewpoints are actually quite untrue considering animal shelters take in dogs of all types, ages, and sizes.  It is estimated that about forty percent of the dogs that are found in shelters are actually pure breeds and just not announced as such due to lack of paperwork proof. Puppies are sought after when bringing in a new canine to the family and despite assumptions there’s a great deal of young pups hoping for homes in animal shelters. Families should never rule out all of the adult dogs available for adoption. Animal shelters house many adult dogs that are already trained and lost their homes due to deplorable circumstances. Senior dogs may even be a good fit for an older owner who isn’t capable of going through the process of training a young pup. Just because these dogs have found themselves in animal shelters does not mean they are no good, they are great pals simply in a search for new loving homes. Puppy mills are a rising concern. These mills mass produce breeds of puppies and have been accused of animal cruelty. It is rumored that they store their dogs in dirty cages with no exercise, respect, or love. Cages rest in tight rows vertically and horizontally, piled high with dogs who receive inadequate food, water, health care, and attention. Female dogs are bred to their limit and then disposed of. Puppy mills have been known to lie about some of their dogs being pure bred and they also promote in breeding. Conditions these mills maintain their pups in often lead to genetic and health issues down the road that will not only promise costly to upkeep, but will also be upsetting to deal with. Puppy mills sell their young offspring to pet stores where they are then available for purchase to the public. By adopting a dog you will not only save a life, but you will be aiding in the battle against puppy mills. Aside from saving a life and promoting anti-animal cruelty, adopting a loving dog from the animal shelter is also beneficial on your wallet. Purchasing a dog from the pet store can cost a fortune, especially after the vet bills are taken into account. Most adoptions through shelters include medical costs (updated shots, spaying/neutering, microchips) in the adoption price, which is a great financial advantage. Purchases from a pet store are much more than the price of adopting and do not offer all the great inclusions shelters do. Just the initial trip to the veterinarian with your new puppy could cost upwards of a few hundred dollars. Typically adoption fees stay around two hundred dollars or less, which is an unbeatable price! Those cute puppies in the window may be alluring, but there are endless amounts of animals ridden to shelters that are in need of a new place to call home. Plus, buying a store puppy helps promote the inhumane existence of puppy mills and their cruel ways to make a quick buck. Adopting is also a huge money saver when deciding to bring in that new pet to the family. All dogs are worthy of a great home with a loving family to spend their years, and any pup in the shelter would be grateful for such a chance. Make the right choice and save a life; who knows, maybe your pooch will be the one who saves you."

18,Dog Bowl - How To Choose The Right One,pets," Choosing the right Dog Bowl can be overwhelming. There are so many different options at your local store, on-line or at your vets. How do you know which one is right for your beloved dog? Should I get an raised dog bowl, plastic, stainless steel, slow eating or a traveling Dog Dishes? Below you will find ways on choosing the right one. Raised Dog Bowl Do you have a large or older pet? Using a raised stand will help with back, neck and joint problems. Having their dishes elevated will help with their digestive system. The food won’t have to go up then back down again with the dish raised. With larger dogs try using a heavier dishes so he/she won’t knock the bowl over as easy. Your dog will love not having to bend all the way to the floor. Plastic Dog Dishes Are you looking for less expensive Dog Bowl with color and style? Plastic is the way to go. You can choose from a variety of shapes, colors, sizes and most are dish washer safe. The only down side of plastic is if you have a pooch that loves to chew. If he/she chews the bowl two things may happen. May develop some bacteria that hides and your dog may swallow some of the plastic. Try using a stainless steel bowl if your pooch likes to chew. Stainless Steel Dog Bowl Do you have an outdoor dog or is he/she rough with their dishes? Use a durable stainless steel bowl. Some dishes have a slip proof bottom so their food won’t move around quite so much. Bacteria won’t collect on stainless steel making it a sanitary bowl. When your dog drinks a lot, the dish may become slimy. You will need to clean more often. Slow Eating Dog Dishes If your best friend eats to fast, get him/her a slow eating bowl. They are designed so that they can’t take such a big mouth full of food. These dog dishes have internal dividers or raised areas in the dish. There are risk factors when your dog eats to fast. Some of the risks are chocking, digestive problems, canine obesity and the list goes on. For more information talk to your veterinarian.

19,"Purebred Dogs Show in Macerata, Italy",pets," The 2011 edition of the Italian dog show in Macerata was held on the 25th of September achieving great success. Dogs are said to be the man’s best friends, and considering the success achieved on the 25th of September by the 19th Dog Show in Macerata, Italy, this must be true. Many people, not only owners of purebred dogs, but also many people that simply love dogs, gathered in the fairgrounds of Villa Potenza in Macerata, also attracted by the nice September day that was nothing like one of the first days of autumn. The event, which was held along with the 67th Exhibition of Birds and Dogs, has been an unforgettable event for all the people that took part in it, most notably for children, who are often more and instinctively aware than adults of the deep relation that connects them to other animal species, especially to dogs. Moreover, children get often more astonished by the colours of the many species of birds that can always be admired during the event. However, the protagonists of the event have been dogs: the show, which was born of the collaboration between the Province of Macerata, the dog-lovers club of Macerata and the Italian Association of dog lovers, has brought many purebred dogs to the Italian city, dogs that have been divided into categories and judged. There were many different breeds, form herding dogs to pinschers, from terriers to dachshunds, from hunting dogs to pointers, from retrievers to companion dogs. A summary of all the breeds of dogs, with over 500 dogs that have been accompanied by 400 breeders and private owners. In addition to the competition, which has attracted many people wanting to watch the dog parade and admire some wonderful animals presented in the best possible way by their owners, the event also had another ace in the hole that has certainly caught the attention not only of experts, but also of the rest of participants, and also this event has been much appreciated by children. We are talking about the agility-dog competition, which was held open air with the participation of about a hundred dogs. Children and adults have watched with attention the deeds of the pets, which carried out an obstacle course showing their ability and agility. The dogs’ performances scored a hit: spectators were very involved in the show and supported the dogs, which had been asked to carry out a course - similar to the courses of horse racings - as quickly as possible and trying to commit the fewest penalties. A day characterised by the love for dogs and entirely dedicated to these pets, which was meant to enhance these animals for both their aesthetic and agility peculiarities, as well as to develop the pure breeds of dogs and the breeding of these breed also for sport and zootechnical reasons. After the success achieved by this year’s show, the Italian Dog Show of Macerata will be held again next year!"
20,"Houses for Dogs - Considerations Before You Buy. Owning A Dog, Is It Right For You?",pets," One of the largest expenses facing new dog owners are the houses for dogs. Sure he will be with you inside your house a majority of the time in most cases but for an alternate safe place a dedicated house is just plain wise to plan for. The main purpose for dogs houses is to protect your new friend from the elements, so having a covering over the site you choose would give the houses dogs love some added protection. I have seen instances when a poor location for the dogs house, such as a hidden spot behind the house caused the dog to bark excessively.You also want to use Cedar Dog Houses if possible, they smell good, resist bugs and rot, and also add some insulating from the climate. They should be elevated to stay dry underneath and on a stone base that doesn't accumulate water. Ideally you should get a dense, moisture-proof, washable foam pad for your pets comfort as well as to retain body heat. Remember that moisture, and darkness will attract harmful fungus, mold and insects. One often overlooked consideration in buying pet dog houses is how will you clean it out? A removable or easy to open roof makes this task much simpler so it can be done as often as needed. Also consider the expected size of your dog after he is full-grown and make sure you purchase the correct sized dog house. Make sure you can give your dog the adequate amount of time. Plan on at least a few long walks with 1 or 2 play sessions each week. This is also one of the biggest positives for owning a dog, it adds to your health both mental and physical. Many programs i.e.; Pets on Wheels and Therapy Dogs International have sprung up that find it's very helpful to have interaction between seniors and pets. Studies have shown that when people pet animals, their heart rate, blood pressure, and even temperature decrease.  The effect: weight loss, lower blood pressure, heart rate, and anxiety for pet owners. We enjoy returning love and attention, especially the dogs houses, special food treats and even holiday gifts such as  pet-clothing. Even trips to a dog park are becoming quite common. Considerations for the traveling pet owner are; 1-Fewer accommodations are available (www.dogfriendly.com) and often a pet crate helps if traveling with your pet. 2-Responsibility or oversight of your dog while you are doing activities that must exclude your pet such as dining out or a work meeting. 3-Cost and tasks involved with care of the pet if left at home or boarded. Dogs have been used for home security for as long as there have been domesticated dogs. Dogs often work together in alerting an entire neighborhood to the presence of a stranger. A dog can be a deterrent and a source of defense as well. Just seeing a big dog house in the yard could even deter thieves. Having a dog in the home can make a family feel like they have their own personal source of protection. In addition, a dog is not simply an impersonal alarm system. Dogs can be used in amazing ways if properly trained such as sniffing out drugs or weapons, certain cancers, missing people or even other pets. I once helped locate an Alaskan Malemute that was lost in a several thousand acre park by bringing my Malemute there and just walking her, amazingly they found each other within an hour. They are a great way to boost someone's outlook even relieving depression or speeding recovery after a stroke. A well-mannered dog can even help make you more popular, attracting many people who wouldn't usually bother into a conversation. Pets and people have a lot to give to each other. Research and experience has shown that animals and people can share their time and affection, living full and happy lives. Even though pets aren't a replacement for human relationships, for most people, they can certainly enhance them, and they can fill a person's life with years of rewarding, unconditional love. It is obvious that dog ownership is definitely worth the costs and every process involved can and should be enjoyed, including purchasing that first quality dog house."

2,How to Breed Corn Snakes,pets," When it comes to reptiles and having them as pets, the corn snake is one of the easiest to breed.  No one knows how many are bred in captivity each year but the number is, easily, in the hundreds of thousands. Breeding your pet corn snake will give you the opportunity of seeing babies being born and the surprise of seeing what they look like when they hatch.  Hopefully, this is the main reason behind your interest in breeding pet corn snakes because the chances of making a profit from this hobby is very small.  You have thousands of other breeders to compete with and this, often, creates environments that are unhealthy for these reptiles. Before you attempt to breed your snakes you will want to make sure that their health is up to par.  Sick or unhealthy snakes can create health problems in the offspring or the mother or both.  Through the summer and fall, slowly increase their diets by feeding them larger prey or by feeding them more often.  When it is time for the brumation, make sure that your corn snakes have emptied their digestive tracts and move them to another tank with a temperature between 65 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit.  Keep them here for about a week. After a week has passed they need to be put in temperatures of 55 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit for around a month and then about 50 degrees Fahrenheit for another month or two months.  You want the entire brumation period to last three months or a little less. Following the cooling period you will, essentially, go through the same process in reverse.  Take them from the 50 degree temperature to 55 to 60 and then up to 65 to 70 for a week.  After this put them back into their normal tank or at their normal temperature.  After two or three days you can try to feed them a small serving.  After another couple days you can resume their normal feeding schedule. Once the female has eaten three or four times it is a good time to place the male and female together.  Leave them together except for during feeding time.  Copulation usually takes place during the night so you may not even notice that it is happening.  Watch carefully and once you notice swelling in the abdomen of the female you can separate the snakes for good.  Once this happens you can increase the frequency of feeding the female to help her provide the nutrition she needs for herself and her eggs."
3,Coping With The Loss Of A Pet,pets," Many people consider their pet to be a close friend or a member of the family. For many pet owners their pet may be the only family they have. These pet owners know the incredible pain and sense of loss when their beloved pet passes. In this article we will discuss ways to cope with those feelings. It is important to acknowledge your feelings. In the time your pet was with you they became an integral and significant part of your life. Our pets provide us with so many things, a sense of companionship, a source of comfort, they offer us unconditional love and accept us for who we are. For these reasons experiencing intense grief over the loss of a pet is absolutely normal and should be accepted as a normal part of the grieving process. People who don’t understand the human animal bond may have a difficult time understanding your sense of grief. All that truly matters is what you are feeling. Under no circumstances should you allow anyone to make you feel silly or overly sentimental for grieving the loss of your friend. Grieving is a process and needs to be worked through. While individuals may experience grief in different ways, however there are some basic stages of grief that the majority of people feel to various degrees. Often people feel guilty over the loss of a pet. They hold themselves responsible in some way for the pets’ death. It is sometimes referred to as the ""What if syndrome"".  You question your choices and actions in regards to your pet. ""What if I had been more careful coming in the door?"" ""What if I had taken them to vet more often?""  The fact is accidents happen and illness occurs and is out of our control. To burden oneself with the responsibility and guilt for those things is pointless and only serves to make it more difficult to deal with your grief Denial is a common step in the grief process. It makes it difficult to accept the fact that your pet is gone. You may find it hard to imagine your pet not being there to greet you at the door or seeing the wagging tail at mealtime. There are instances where pet owners have been known to take denial to such extremes that they believe their pet is still alive and suffering somewhere. Still others have a difficult time with the idea of choosing a new pet in the future fearing disloyalty to the pet that has passed. Anger is a natural and necessary part of the grieving process. The source of this feeling of anger is your pain over your loss. You may be angry with the driver of the speeding car or the veterinarian who failed to save your pets life. Grief often makes you feel lost like a small ship at sea and anger often serves as source of strength, and anchor. However, carried to extremes, such as attacking loved ones or friends, it only serves to alienate those who support you and hinders you in resolving your grief. A common and natural aftereffect of grief is depression. Depression can leave you feeling hopeless and powerless to deal with your feelings. In extreme circumstances depression will rob you of your motivation and sap your energy causing you to dwell only on your sorrow and loss. It is vital that you deal with your feelings. One of the most important things you can do is to be completely honest with yourself about your feelings. Do not deny your sense of loss, your pain and anger in an effort to appear strong for those around you. When you acknowledge, examine and come to terms with your feelings you can begin to work through them. Do not deny your grief. Hiding it will not make it go away. Express it in a way that helps you the most, whether it is by crying, stomping on the floor, or talking it out with someone. Don’t avoid the feelings of grief by not thinking about your pet, try reminiscing about all of the good times you had with your pet. This serves to help you understand the depth of your loss. There are many ways to come to terms with your feelings of loss. Here are some common ways that work well for a lot of pet parents. Some people find it very helpful to share their feelings and memories by writing stories, or poems. Create a memorial honoring your pet, such a collage of photos to hang in a prominent place in your home. It may also help to rearrange your days schedule in such a way as to fill in the times you would have been with your pet with other activities. If you know other pet lovers there is no doubt they will understand your feelings, find a friend or family member to talk with. Be sure you choose someone you will feel comfortable crying or grieving with and will accept your feelings without judgments. If none of these things help you, or you are alone without family and friends, or simply need more help in dealing with your loss ask your veterinarian or the local humane association to recommend a pet loss counselor or support group. Ask for grief counseling from your church or a local hospital. It is vital that you understand and accept that your feelings of grief are authentic and you deserve support in your time of need."
4,The Difficult Choice Of Pet Euthanasia,pets," Our pets are important to us. For many people pets are friends, companions and family members. A pet may be the only family some people have. We care for them, feed them, take care of their health and daily needs and in return we are rewarded with loyalty and unconditional love. Sadly, there are times when pets become seriously ill and tough decisions must be made on their behalf by the pet parent. When it comes to your pets health your veterinarian is the best judge of their physical condition. However, as a pet parent your evaluation of their daily quality of life is of paramount importance. Often if a pet has been diagnosed with a serious illness but still shows enthusiasm about eating, seeks out the pet parent and is responsive to attention, plays or is involved with day-to-day family activities the pet owner will often decide that this is not the appropriate time. However, if the pet is in pain, is unresponsive to affection, seems unaware of its environment, suffering through treatments that are not helping and generally seems uninterested in day-to-day activities a caring pet parent may want to seriously consider ending their dear friends suffering. If you, as a pet owner, feel the time has come to make such a decision it is important that you evaluate your pets health with unselfish honesty with your veterinarian. Nothing will make this choice easier but putting off the decision and prolonging your pets suffering in order to avoid the pain and grief that will follow is of no use to you or your pet. As difficult as this choice is to make it is important that you understand that it is an act of love for your pet. Once the decision to euthanize has been reached you must decide whether or not to be present during the procedure. Be sure to discuss this prior to any commitments to the procedure. Most veterinarians and clinics allow the owner to be present, some do not. If your veterinarian is not able to accommodate your wish to be present ask them for a referral to one that does. Many pet parents believe that their presence is the ultimate act of love and comfort for their pet. Some pet owners find comfort themselves in being present because it gives them the knowledge that their pet passed peacefully and without pain. In some ways this is also helpful in the grief process for many pet owners because witnessing the death and seeing the body helps them to more readily accept the fact that their pet is gone. While being present can be helpful it can also be traumatic for some people and you should ask yourself if you truly believe you can deal with the situation. While being upset in the circumstances is totally natural, uncontrolled tears and emotional upheaval are likely to upset your pet. Once a pet is euthanized the difficult choices are not over. Now you must choose how you wish to handle the remains. Often, in the emotion of the moment, it seems easiest to leave the pet at the veterinarian’s office. If you choose this option be aware that there will probably be a charge for them to handle the remains. Many pet parents prefer a more formal and dignified option of which there are several. Some people want their pet with them and choose to bury them at home. It is less costly and allows the pet owner to create a service to honor their pet as they choose. Be aware though that this is not a viable option for people who rent a home. It is also wise to check city ordinances as many have regulations against pet burials. Pet cemeteries offer a sense of dignity and many pet parents find this comforting. Many pet owners find this choice pleasing because of the calm surroundings and the fact that the gravesite will be maintained and well kept. The costs for these services vary widely based on the specific services you decide on and the type of pet have Cremation is gaining popularity with many pet owners. It is less expensive than burial in a pet cemetery and gives the pet parent more options in handling the remains. They may bury them if they wish (even where there are ordinances against pet burial), they can scatter the ashes in place that has meaning to them, for example, the pets favorite place to walk, or they can keep them in a decorative urn of which there are many beautiful choices. When deciding the best way to handle your pets remains it is important to find out what options are available in your area. You may also want to take into consideration your current living conditions, your personal and spiritual values and finances. It may seem difficult and even unnecessary but it is probably wise to make plans ahead of time rather than have to make these decisions in your moment of loss and sorrow. While the loss of a pet is heart rending, and the decision to euthanize difficult it is important to bear in mind that those decisions are based in love of your pet and in the end will make the transition easier for both you and your beloved friend."
5,Dog In the City,pets," Energetic canines aren't all staying in suburban houses with huge backyards; some are living the urban life alongside their owner. Some feel keeping a dog in the city is animal cruelty, while others argue that a happy hound isn't based off their home address. It is true, deciding to raise a pup in the city over the suburbs will have its differences, but as long as the situation is correctly treated there shouldn't be many difficulties. As with any dog, patience is a virtue and learning is a continuous procedure with constant evolving and room for development. Whether you settle on raise your pup from the gecko within the city walls, or if you are making the switch from a suburb lifestyle to an urban atmosphere, make sure to do your research so that your canine can live contently. The prime argument owners have with raising a city pup is the lack of wide open space available. Most urban residencies do not have a generous backyard for Fido to romp around. Dog energy will have to be burned on the city sidewalks during habitual strolls to make up for the restricted space. Luckily the majority major of cities supply dog-friendly areas to treat your pup to, including dog parks and dog beaches. It is more cramped when walking your dog in the city so make sure you not only have the best dog lead for your pup, but that you are confident in utilizing it properly. Taking walks in the city are much more risky due to the extra congestion of people and car traffic. Just as with anywhere, be sure to take a bag for easy pick up so the city streets don't collect anymore mess than needed. Getting your dog trained is always a recommendation, but it is especially important for city owners. Living in a noisy, busy, and jam-packed city is quite a distraction for dogs with little training.  Obedience will assist in smoother walks with less commotion. There are endless options for training courses in the city - research different places in your area and find which one best suits your dog’s needs, as well as your funds. You can even take it upon yourself to teach Rover things solo; just remember to have patience, treats, and goals. Aside from ensuing obedience, dog training companies in the city are great for dog sports classes and extracurricular activities for your dog that will keep them active and socialized. Dressing your dog accordingly isn't just for fashion in the city; it is for comfortable safety. Putting paws in some dog shoes will help keep puppy's pads safe from wounds that the busy street's scattered debris may cause. A pair of dog boots will also keep steamy summer streets and icy winter roads from taking a toll on your canine's feet, not to mention all the jagged terrain and potholes lurking about that could render harm. Dog boots will keep your pal's paws safe and comfortable at the same time. No matter what city you live in, there is sure to be useful dog clothing for your friend. Hot days call for a dog tank to help guard skin against sunburn on those summer strolls. Cold days are worthy of a dog coat to help keep your canine from catching a cold or suffering through extreme temperature drops. Dog clothing is a sensible choice for city dogs. With so much going on, a city could be overwhelming for pups. Since the surroundings are much more congested the risks of hazards are higher, so being alert at all times is key. Although, dogs are capable of staying in the city with the right training, exercise, and attire. Remember: always remain patient and loving towards your pup and they will return the favor."
6,Fun Fall Times With Your Furry Friend,pets," It always seems like the transition from summer to winter is short-lived. Before fall escapes us, we should all take a minute to enjoy the great weather with our pooch pals. Cooler air circulating about allows canines to caper about freely without becoming overheated or tired. Just make sure your buddy is prepared for the great outdoors by taking routine safety measures. Since fleas amplify in fall temperatures and ticks take a liking to leaf piles, make sure to keep Fido out of harm’s way with a flea and tick preventative of your choice. Remember to always have a pet first aid kit around so any encounters are cared for correctly. Also, keep plenty of water readily available for your thirsty pal, and make sure there is an identification tag on their collar in case their enthusiasm finds them lost. Once you have taken the required actions to enjoying a safe fall season with your pup, throw on your hoodie and get ready for some final fun in the sun (this time without the heat)! Fall is a wonderful time to enjoy some camping before Jack Frost finds his way into the air. Make a checklist of camping supplies (water, food, sleeping bags, leash, etc.) and pick out a key spot to set up shop for some camp fire action. If cabins are your thing there are pet-friendly places to spend the fall nights on your camping trip. With nothing but the wide-open space there will be much time to throw a Frisbee or ball around with your pooch. Take a walk with your pal and discover all the attractive sights of nature together during the brisk days.  Hold your furry friend close when everyone gathers around at night for ghost stories to ease any scares that might ensue. Don’t forget to toss your canine a tasty dog treat while you indulge in a traditional s’more. Fall camping has never been so good! If you want to camp but just can’t spare the extra time off, cut down the experience with a worthy day hike. As with camping, remember to pack the needed supplies before taking off on your shared day in the wilderness. While strolling through nature’s paths try to maintain your pooch on a leash to avoid any mishaps. Doggie hiking boots may also be a good idea to avoid any sharp objects, shattered glass, or rough terrains. Excessive heat has left for the year, so let the cool air relieve your workout all the way through the trails. There is so much to see in the fall time on a hiking trip with your pal, so don’t forget to take breaks for enjoying the picturesque surroundings. After the day is ended your pup will be on sight and smell overload, and a wagging tail is in order for the ride home. Ever visited to an apple farm? If not, try it out this fall! If you have been before and like apple farms, perhaps your worthy dog will, too. Most places are home to lovely apple farms that only exist during the fall time. Canines love the free room of farms, nice people, and great smells around. Plus, most pups like to help on your apple picking adventures. The mass of apple picking farms also have hay rides, pumpkin patches, and other homegrown veggies and fruits (peaches, squash, plums, and more!). There are usually baked goods available for purchase – everything from cakes to jellies. To keep your pup from growing envious of all the human delectables around, bring a few dog treats to share and enjoy a day of fall apple picking. End the fall season with doggie football, leaf jumping, geese gazing at the park, and (of course) trick-or-treating. With so much to get involved in and so little time to do it before the climate shifts yet again, you better grab your furry friend and make the most of these limited days. Fall is a wonderful opportunity to share time together sans the beads of sweat."
7,What To Feed Your Hamsters,pets," Hamster are easy to feed. Most species will eat a wide range of seeds and fresh foods, including green plants and fruit. The use of hamsters in laboratories has given us a clear picture of their nutritional needs and has, in turn, provided the financial stimulus for the production of pelleted diets for each species. These pellets contain all the known dietary requirements, but it is generally a good idea to supplement them with other foods. However, as laboratory feeds are not widely available to the pet keeper, it may be necessary to use rabbit pellets mixed with a variety of seeds and nuts as a substitute. In addition to a basic seed ration, feeding your pet with various other foodstuffs will be beneficial. Wholemeal bread dried out in an oven and offered dry, is an excellent source of carbohydrate energy and. being hard, will also help to keep hamster's teeth in trim. Dog biscuits are also useful, especially if they are supplemented with vitamins and minerals, which are likely to be deficient in a diet made up mostly of seeds. Alternatively, in some countries, special vitamin and mineral chews are produced for hamsters. Similar products are also widely available in powder form. If you do use the powder, remember that it is best to sprinkle the required quantity over damp green plants, as it will not adhere readily to dry seed. Your pets will appreciate a wide range of fruit and vegetables. Always wash fresh food. Apart from the risk of pesticide residues, diseases may occasionally be transmitted from contaminated fruit and plants. There is little nutritional value in lettuce, however, and other alternatives such as cress are preferable. You can give your pets cabbage occasionally, especially the coarser outer leaves, which are the most valuable in nutritional terms, and the coarse stems, which are a challenge for their teeth. However, as with all such foods, offer only a restricted amount, since regular usage of brassicas (cabbage family) could have a depressant effect on the thyroid gland. If your pet hamster is not used to grass and plants, start with only a little at first, otherwise diarrhea is almost certain to result. Among wild plants that can be given in moderation are dandelions (Taraxacum officinale) and chickweed (Stellaria media). Some plants, such as buttercups (Ranunculussp.) and ragwort (Seneciosp.), are poisonous though, so only feed those which are known to be safe. Root vegetables such as carrots are also valuable as food items, being available throughout the year when plants and vegetables may be in short supply. Always remove perishable food from the cage before it shrivels or becomes moldy. This is particularly important with bread and milk, which is sometimes provided for breeding hamsters to satisfy the higher level of protein they need in their diet. It is not essential, however, and is very messy if the food bowl is knocked over. Clean up any such spillage before it can turn moldy. If you make up a soft food of any kind for your pet, ensure that it is moist, but not awash with fluid."
8,Need a cart? Low on funds? Here's some tips!,pets," If you haven't watched my video yet and heard how bad off I was when I started in the hot dog business, here's the link: Free Training If you are in a bad way right now or you can see the writing on the wall and want to get into the hot dog vending business, but you have limited to no funds; here's some help. First let's say you have limited funds, less than $1000. Start looking on Craigslist or check out Crazedlist for Craigslist searches over a multi-city or even multi-state area at one time. Search in the business listings for ""concession"", ""hotdog"", ""carts"" and ""vending"". Search separately each keyword, then also search under the general listings also. Note: Beware listings for concession stands at ridiculous low prices that give a gmail address but no phone number, these are usually, ok always, SCAMS!!! Follow my instructions and tips before purchasing: here (look for the video on used carts) Also check out E bay, but look only in your area. You always want to be able to go and see the cart first when dealing with used carts. Ebay is also full of scams operating as real manufacturers of new carts, always check first on Google, Road food and even Rip Off Report before buying. Don't always rely solely on these resources as anyone with an internet connection can post negative stuff, but if you find similar stories on multiple sites from multiple people, then be-AWARE. This time of year like no other is the best for finding great deals on used carts. But you want a new cart, I certainly understand. If you are handy at all and have some tools at your disposal, then maybe building a cart would be your best bet. My friend Steve offers a course with video instructions with complete parts list on how to build a cart for less than $1000. See it here, and by the way, I make not one dime off this, I truly have nothing to gain by sharing this with you other than it warms my heart to help someone else. I almost forgot, consider placing a free ad on craigslist in the wanted section: I am looking for a hotdog cart! Please contact me thru craigslist if you have one and are willing to sell or rent. Please send pictures and contact info. Note: Do not put your email or your phone number on this type of listing, let them contact you thru craigslist first before divulging your contact info."
9,Veterinary Equipment Maintenance Offer a 'Preview',pets," Veterinary equipment maintenance may provide a preview of what service a certain clinic may provide. While some may view it as pure prejudice, it's also deemed as a good warning sign by some pet lovers. After all, it's the life of their beloved pet that could be on the line. Here are some of the reasons why you should be scrutinising the tools and equipment in the clinic before you even take your pet for a regular check-up. Why do you need to take a look at the clinic's veterinary equipment? One of the reasons is hygiene. We all know that the practice of medicine, whether on humans or animals, revolves around hygiene. Dirt breeds bacterial infection and sickness. It causes and worsens ailments. That is why veterinary equipment maintenance is important. The tools must not only be well maintained but also very sterilised. The clinic must have a germ-free feel. Everything should be hygienic. If the tools say otherwise, then that's a good sign that that specific clinic may not be practising good hygiene. Another reason why you should check their veterinary equipment supplies is for convenience's sake. It won't do you harm if you inquire about what machinery and tools that clinic has. The range of veterinary equipment they have will give you a good preview of what services they can offer, and what they can't. It will also tell you what services they can offer excellently. For instance, if the clinic says that it does not have an X-ray machine, that means it has limited diagnostic services. For you, that means having to transport your sick pet elsewhere to have it properly examined. You should also have a close look at veterinary equipment maintenance because can be a sign of higher rates. Imagine you're in this scenario. You enter the clinic and you're greeted by a receptionist. Behind her you see a digital weighing scale that looks like it was just pulled out from the box. It's pure white. You see a huge machine beside it. You're not really sure what it does but it does look expensive. Then, veterinary equipment supplies are lined up properly in shelves. You ask for their rates and you almost faint. While these equipment are beneficial for your pets, they might also lead the vet to charge more. After all, these machines are worth a fortune most of the time. With these in mind, you'll get a bit if a preview of what service your pet can get from a certain clinic. But don't base your decision solely on these signs. The best thing to do is still to ask."
10,Should You Buy Discount Pet Medications On Line,pets," Discount pet medications when bought on line will save you a lot of money. Pet medications on line, is an extremely intelligent alternative to store bought medications. Pet medications are very expensive, just as our human medications. We try to save money anywhere we can for our own medications and we should extend that to our pet medications as well. So, it is a given, that you should purchase your pet medications for as little as possible, while still maintaining the highest of quality. The good news is that the Internet is host to a myriad of websites, that can fulfill your every need. The question is, not whether you should buy on line, but from which website. Like anything else, there are the good and the bad merchants catering to this need to purchase your on line pet medications. I am sure, if you are like me, that you regard your pet like one of your children. In fact, they are our children; just as precious and loved. The only difference is that our pets cannot tell us what is wrong with them, or what their needs are. They rely on us to see to it that their health care is provided. In this article, I will explain how to find the most appropriate website to offer you the highest quality products, at the lowest prices. NOW THAT'S REAL VALUE. On line purchases, can not only save you money, but most will offer free shipping, and in most cases, your purchase will be free of sales taxes. Throw in the highest quality, cheapest prices, no sales tax and trusted major brands, and you have a winning formula. Why is it possible to buy such products on line at a discount? The answer is simple, on line discount pet medication websites, have much lower overhead, elimination of many of the fixed payroll costs, administration costs, no normal advertising campaigns, large physical facility warehouses and buildings, property taxes and employee health costs. None of these high overhead costs are added on to the cost of their medications. Even if they did have both an on line business and a store front business, their websites would still offer discount pet medications at a significant reduction in cost over their store front business. Like anything else in life, proper planning and some thought given, will further add to your ROI (return on investment), as it relates to your overall expenditure. Such things as planning your pets medications, scheduling their re-orders, will add up to further savings. Ordering all of your pets products at the same time, cuts down on handling charges, shipping costs (if there are any, as most will offer free shipping). This will avoid you from running out of any medications, causing you to run to the local store, or ordering on line and having to upgrade your free shipping to overnight or second day, which would surely eat up all of your savings, and then some. So you are now convinced to purchase your pet medications on line. Now what. Well, it would seem that the next logical step would be to decide how to pick out your on line website. Examine the sites text or verbiage, is it written by someone professional, someone educated, and do you get a good feeling when you read and review the sites content. Are the products on their site well know national brands with good reputations? Are their products they are selling somewhat competitive. You want the best deal you can get, but you don't want the ridiculously low give away prices that usually result in an inferior product or maybe even the use of some placebos. Remember, you wouldn't take these medications yourself, or give them to your ""other"" children, so why give them to your pet. Follow these guidelines, and you will save huge amounts of money, while obtaining the highest quality pet medications, and pet prescriptions.

11,One Way To Protect Your Dog From Allergies Is To Delete Wheat From His Dog Food,pets," The absence of Wheat in your Dog's food, can help him in many ways.  It can help fight allergies that are associated with dog food containing wheat. There are other areas of your dogs nutrition that also suffer from feeding him dog food containing wheat. As humans we have always been told to eat wheat in our diet.  Whole wheat is far different that the wheat used in your dogs food. There are a host of ingredients added to your dogs food.  These contain wheat gluten, proteins, toxic fillers, non nutritional additives and fillers for bulking the food. Is there such a thing as wheat free dog food?  Sure there is.  But it is harder to find and usually less common to find.  Why? Because the major pet food manufacturers, don't care as much about your pets health, as they do about profit.  This certainly includes puppies and adult dogs. Some dogs are actually very allergic to wheat and wheat fillers.  I am not sure, that in today's day and age, that public demand for a greater diet or that greater restrictions be implemented by  the manufacturers will in fact change anything.  I say this, because it's the bottom line profit that will dictate ingredients, fillers, non nutritional proteins and the like that the manufacturer will use.  Some of the major brands, and the higher end dog foods, have already begun implementing just such measures. How do you know which ones have responded, and to what degree?  It’s really quite simple, and not as difficult as you may think.  If you would like to know how to get past all the smoking mirrors, advertising hype, bloated advertising budgets, and who really does have your dog's best interest and health in mind, read my resource box attached to this article.  It will direct you to where you can find these answers and many, many more.  This is critical, it's not just a wheat free dog food that you want to find,  but how to analyze everything that is being used in your dog's food. After you have used the tools on my website, you will know what you want and need for your dog.  If you can't find it in your local stores, or if you live in a small rural town, don't worry.  There are plenty of resources to use, the Internet is one of course, and they will ship directly to your door.  In most cases, it will not cost that much more, as most offer free shipping. By doing what I am saying, you will in most all cases, insulate your dog from the melamine catastrophe that was killing so many dogs in the dog food recall of a few years ago.  The only way you can truly see to it that your dog is getting safe, nutritional and very healthy dog food, that will give him/her all the nutrition per serving they need, and be complying with the highest health standards is to become involved.

12,Choosing a Pet Memorial in Your Time of Need,pets," If you've recently lost a cherished and loved pet, then you're probably filled with loss and sadness. This time can be devastating and it may require time to recover from the death of your best friend and companion. Understanding the process of this time may ease some of your discomfort. One of the first things that you'll need to decide is whether you would prefer to have your pet buried or cremated. Most towns and cities have pet cemeteries available that can be located through the yellow pages or an on-line search. If you would actually prefer to have a cremation, then you will need to locate a pet crematory, also available through your local phone book or on-line. Regardless of which method you prefer, you will want to pick out a memorial grave marker, or an urn for your pets ashes. Choosing the right memorial can be a painstaking process.

13,Dog Food For Puppies-What Do They Need And Why,pets," A healthy and nutritious dog food for your puppy is more critical than an adult dog food is for an adult. A puppy's development and overall longevity is dependent on the proper balance of protein, fat and carbohydrates your dog is fed. Hopefully this article will be of great interest to you. We sincerely hope the following will be a great and simple aid to you in selecting the right dog food for your puppy. Why is it so essential that your puppy be fed such a food? Because when they are a puppy, it is mandatory that they get the nourishment and necessary vitamins, minerals and wholesome ingredients, during their process of maturing into adulthood. Their beginning years are formidable as they transcend into adulthood. Just like a new baby, their formula and proper administration of vitamins, minerals and nutrients, catapults a baby into a healthy adult. An adult with all the antibody's and necessary good things it needs to resist illnesses. Well, your puppy deserves the same treatment. A diet that has been specifically formulated to meet the needs of a puppy, as compared to an adult dog are higher in fat and protein. A puppy's life stage requires more protein and fats than does an adult dog, mainly, due to their overall energy and the fact that they grow so quickly. They need a puppy food that can fuel these needs while providing the proper nourishment as their digestive system breaks down their food very quickly. They have less time to fully absorb the nutrients through the normal process of digestion. This means that you have to become an earnest and knowledgeable label reader, carefully examining the ingredients used in the puppy food you may be considering. You must now be wondering how you are going to accomplish what seems to be a Herculean task, especially when you browse the isle at your super market or pet store. Just how will you know what the right ingredients are, and how valuable or harmful will they be to your puppy? The answer to this question is much easier to get than you think it is. Arm yourself with the proper guides and then take the time to read the ingredients listed on the label. Your task will be an easy one once you know what to avoid, and what your puppy really needs. As a rule of thumb, after ruling out the bad ingredients, all you have to do is find the proper balance in percentages, of protein, fat, and carbohydrates. Again, ruling out the bad ingredients is very, very easy. There are many articles available to demonstrate what to avoid. As good practice goes, find a food that has no more than 25% protein, and that the protein is easily digestible. When you read the list of ingredients, you will see which are the good protein sources, and which are the cheap and harmful bone meals offered by so many of the puppy food manufacturers of today. Also, remember to avoid fillers. They are just that, fillers, and are a waste of money and a non nutritional source for your puppy. In some cases, fillers may even cause gastric and digestive problems in your puppy. Look for products that meet the minimum necessary ingredients that your puppy needs. This would be a line of dog food that offers a wide variety of all natural, organic, raw dog meals all blended into a very healthy and nutritious diet. Would you eat food that was not of high quality and nutrition, of course not? So don't give your puppy this kind of food. Instead, the brands that manufacturer the kinds of products mentioned in this paragraph, usually follow a human grade and quality standards of care and processing. In short, they care as much for your pets welfare as you do. Well, almost. Remember to tailor, your puppy's life stages to its food. Their needs constantly change as they progress closer and closer to adulthood. A good meal, consists of carbohydrate's, vegetables, fruits and chicken and turkey free of grains. These are the kinds of diets that are highly recommended by veterinarians, and is what they generally feed their puppies. You will also find that a gluten free meal works very well for a puppy with a sensitive stomach. Again, remember to avoid the highly advertised and highly promoted commercial dog foods, unless, you have diligently checked the ingredients being used. If they are very low on nutrition and quality ingredients, then avoid these manufacturers as they are only interested in high company profits, and not the welfare of your dog. Don't despair, the task before you is really quite a simple one indeed. If you are armed with the free tools at my site, then trust me, your job will be a very easy one.

14,Best Dog Food-Detailed Info And Advice,pets," This article deals with basic information and detailed advice on selecting the best dog food for your best friend. We sincerely hope the following will be a great aid to your insight as to the right dog food for your dog. As a dog owner, you should always be on your toes and seeking the best information, and advice on how to determine what is the best and healthiest diet for your best friend. You should not only be concerned about your pet's health, but, it is your duty to make sure what you are feeding him or her. You need to know the food, what's in it, what are the ingredients and are they nutritional and healthy or will they harm your pet and shorten his life span. There is a lot more that goes into your dog's well being. Good teeth, shiny coat, clear and bright eyes, lean body free of fat, good digestive system and lots of energy. If this is what you seek for your best friend, then you must begin with what he or she eats. To do this properly, you need to understand terms that are used in the ingredients on the bag of food. If it says ""all natural"", does that mean it is a good ingredient? Or if it says ""high in protein"", is this a good thing. The answer is no.  The answers to  many, many more such questions, can be answered by viewing AAFCO Definitions of Dog Food Ingredients which is free and available on my site. This will explain the misguided and confusing terms used in the dog food industry. Are there ingredients you should definitely avoid feeding your best friend? You bet there are, and many, many more than you can imagine. There are many harmful and even fatal ingredients that need to be avoided at all costs. This is what I will show you how to do, so, you can proceed with confidence as to what is healthy, and what is very dangerous and even deadly for you dog. What is the best dog food? How do you know, with every manufacturer all claiming to produce the ""best dog food"" on the market? Kind of confusing isn't it? Maybe, it's the brands with the biggest budgets that can advertise, market and promote their product. You guessed it, this does not mean it is the best dog food. You could go crazy, researching, reading and the like from all of the large budget manufacturer's, that are yielding huge profits from inferior and very low grade dog food. Why, it is the ingredients being used. Don't fall into the old marketing scheme that dogs should only eat dog food. Not true at all. In fact, they do their best to confuse and misdirect the consumer. The truth is, you have a host of different scenarios you can avail yourself of. Such as a commercial natural ingredient, organic, raw, frozen, freeze dried or a combination of these foods. It doesn't matter whether you purchase pre packaged foods that are specially formulated for a dogs nutritional needs, or if you produce your own meals using the proper ingredients. This I will also teach you. The key point to remember is, that in order to obtain good health for your pet, you must first provide good nutrition and avoid dangerous ingredients. Good nutrition lowers vet bills and avoids many health problems caused by an inferior product. Most owners think that offering such high quality foods will be too costly and unaffordable for them. Not in the long run, and not if you wish the best for your friend. Canned and Dry Dog Foods Whichever one you are considering, remember to check and see if the ingredients on the label contain whole, real recognizable ingredients that comply with known high standards. This means, no by-products and no grains are the first thing to eliminate, as they will surely wave the red flag as a low quality product. The main ingredient should consist of specific meat meal, or, meats as the main ingredient and not unspecified meat meal. Any whole meats such as chicken, beef, lamb, duck, turkey, pheasant, bison, venison, salmon and the like are all good ingredients. Also look for a variety of fruits and vegetables. Probiotics And Nutritional Supplements While probiotics and nutritional supplements are added to most dog diets, the more reputable and higher end manufacturer's provide detailed information for each and every supplement, and how, the supplement will benefit your dog. Avoid the nasty preservatives and supplements that are used. Any preservative used, should be natural and healthy and not some of the deplorable chemical additions. Good natural preservatives such as ascorbic acid, vitamin C and vitamin E, are acceptable ingredients. Where To Buy The Best Dog Food You need to arm yourself with detailed information, advice and the knowledge I will give you to properly begin your search at feed stores, veterinary offices and natural food stores. You will even be able to search online once you know, what is good and what is not good in your selection of a dog food.   You will be able to easily see through the many claims that ""we offer the best dog food"". Do you honestly think, that if you do what has been suggested here, that you can be anything but right on target in your selection? I don't think so. Commercial Dog Food Remember, they are in most cases, nothing but flashy advertising and mostly fluff. If they have the budget and the money, they can claim whatever they want to claim. In fact, most of these major manufacturer's have had recalls on their products, in 2007, 2008 and 2009. Most of the low end, cheap and low quality foods are made up of mostly by-products, meat meals, fillers and grains. Raw Dog Food Many dog owners are now getting into raw dog foods more and more each day. They believe that by doing this, raw is more natural to dog's, and they know exactly what their dog is getting. Some also believe that raw meat, will allow their dog to grow stronger with a leaner body. I am not too sure I subscribe totally to this belief, but used in combination with other foods, it can be a healthy alternative as well. Just remember, that if you do this, the meat must be very fresh as to avoid any possible food poisoning. You may even want to throw in a raw bone occasionally, so long as it is not cooked. When it is cooked, it becomes brittle and splinters, thus causing harm to your dog. Homemade Dog Food Here is another big plus. Expenses can be cut dramatically when doing a homemade dog food. While it is cheaper than commercially manufactured products, you can tailor a diet that fulfills every one of your dog's nutritional needs, while giving him a variety of fresh made wholesome meals he can look forward to every day. You can see to it that his meals are chemically and filler free. You thought homemade dog food recipes were hard to do, time consuming and expensive.  Think again.  Let your dog live much longer than he normally would.  For your dog's sake and well being, do it now. You can find a host of resources both on and off line featuring recipes to choose from. Many experts in the field believe that a diet of homemade food coupled with an occasional treat of raw dog food is a great combination both in nutrition and variety. Don't despair, the task before you is really quite a simple one indeed. If you are armed with the free tools at my site, then trust me, your job will be a very easy one. Print out your free downloads from my site below, and take them with you when you go analyzing the ingredients used by the dog food manufacturer's.  It is as simple as that.  You will then be properly armed with all that you need. Now go out and do it right. I hope the information contained in this article, has been informational, meaningful, and helpful to you.  It is my design, that you use this article in any way that you feel will benefit you.  I only ask, that you don't plagiarize its content, and that you keep the author box and back link in tact."
15,A Guide To Dressage Horse Breeding,pets," If everything comes together, dressage horse breeding can be the perfect way to find that next competition superstar. It can be significantly cheaper than purchasing an animal that has had any event exposure, or even an older youngster that is ready to be backed and ridden on. There is also a special kind of satisfaction that comes from producing a homebred foal. If it goes on to achieve any accolades, the success is often so much the sweeter. Despite the benefits of dressage horse breeding, it can be something of a minefield and there is an awful lot that can go wrong. For example, the foal might not be suitable for what the breeder wants to do with it, it might have weaknesses or conformation faults. However, if horse breeding is something that the mare owner is committed to doing and they are knowledgeable enough horse people to take on the responsibility, there are a number of things that can be done to increase the chances of the mare having a quality foal. The broodmare is hugely important and what she brings to the foal should never be underestimated. Only a sound mare with good conformation and a stable temperament should be used. Ideally, she will have shown talent under saddle, but even a mare that has not excelled in this area should at least have a pedigree that shows known performance bloodlines. Top notch conformation and performance ability are obviously closely aligned, as a horse or pony must usually be well put together in order to have the necessary agility to perform well. As far as breed goes, the best dressage horses do tend to be warmbloods although if an equine has good basic paces it certainly has the potential to hold its own, whatever breed it is. Once it has been decided that the mare is suitable to breed from, it is time to find the second half of the horse breeding equation, the stallion. Firstly, make sure as much as possible is known about the mare. What are her bloodlines, performance history, behaviour and conformation? Which of her weaker points could be improved with the right stallion? Once the breeder has an understanding of the specific qualities needed from the stallion, it will be easier to make a shortlist of potential studs. Budget is another factor that will have to be taken into consideration. Stud fees can vary enormously and reflect a number of things including value of the stallion, his past winnings, value and success of his offspring and the facilities offered by the stud itself. It’s important to calculate what can be afforded and to stick to that amount. Young upcoming studs will often be much better value for money than an established international Grand Prix dressage stallion, so these can be a very good bet if the mare owner has a good eye for future potential and conformation etc. Given the right combination of mare and stallion, plus a large dose of good luck, producing a dressage foal can be hugely rewarding. The whole process can be emotionally draining and a lot of hard work but many involved in dressage horse breeders would stress that when everything turns out as it should, the results make everything more than worthwhile."
16,Veterinary Equipment: A Great Marketing Tool for Vets?,pets," Have you ever thought of using your veterinary equipment to market your business?

17,A Guide to Keeping Desert Iguanas,pets," As with chuckawallas, desert iguanas are not often available in the pet trade. Only Nevada allows the commercial exportation of this lizard. Several states allow a few individuals to be collected with a hunting license. Not many herpetoculturists work with this beautiful species of lizard but hopefully more will do so to ensure that captive-born animals are available. Taxonomy and Natural History The desert iguana (Dipsosaurus dorsalis) is the only member of the genus Dipsosaurus, and is a very attractive whitish colored lizard that is 4-5.25 inches (10-13 cm) snout to vent length. The tail is almost twice the length of the body and is ringed with keeled scales. Males usually have more angular and broader heads and larger femoral pores than females. Both sexes may develop pink areas on the sides of the belly during the breeding season. They are most often found on sandy plains but also occur along rocky stream beds, lower slopes of hills, and silty floodplains. In the northern part of their range, they are found in association with creosote bushes, whereas in the southern portion of their range they are found in sub-tropical shrub areas. They seek shelter in rodent burrows where they will often plug the burrow at night, possibly to secure it from predators. Desert iguanas are diurnal and often not found abroad early in the morning. Their body temperatures have been recorded at 108°F (42°C), which is the highest known active temperature for reptiles. They are active when most other lizards have retreated from the heat. Care in Captivity Desert iguanas should be kept in a desert environment with some kind of burrow constructed of plastic or clay pipe. These lizards like it hot, so an end of the cage should have a hot basking area with temperatures in excess of 120°F (49°C) and the other end should get no hotter than 95°F (35°C) during the day. Ultraviolet light should be provided by exposure to the sun or through full spectrum bulbs. Research shows that desert iguana behavior is influenced by ultraviolet light (Alberts 1993). Their femoral pore secretions are illuminated by UVA that then allows other members of the species to locate them. These secretions are messages between lizards that probably indicate territories and advertise the presence of a male in breeding condition. Desert iguanas are omnivores and consume the buds, flowers, and leaves of desert plants including the creosote bush. In the northern part of its range, the spring diet may be composed predominately of creosote flowers which they will climb into the shrub to find. Insects, other arthropods, and its own fecal pellets form significant parts of the summer diet. In captivity, they can be fed the salad and insects such as crickets or super worms several times per week. Reproduction Desert iguanas should be hibernated for 3 to 4 months to stimulate reproduction. In the wild, desert iguanas can often be found in pairs from April through mid-July and breeding occurs in April and early May. Females usually retreat underground in June to lay three to eight eggs that hatch in August. Moist sand and dirt should be placed at the end of the cage away from the basking light so the female can construct a burrow and deposit her eggs. The eggs should be incubated in slightly moist vermiculite. Hatchlings should be fed the same diet as adults with special attention given to appropriate calcium supplementation during the first year. Hatchlings that were not hibernated reached sexual maturity in 1 year (personal communication, 1998, Tom Greb)."

Owners really should socialize these dogs as greyhound puppies to prevent any timidity and fearfulness in to the future. With correct training course and awareness, greyhounds will mature to turn out to be the perfect household puppy dog. Isn't going to call for an excessive amount of physical exercise Simply because greyhounds are bred for running, many people believe that they have to have hours of exercise to discharge their energy. However, greyhounds only need to be walked a few occasions every week, very much like any other dogs. Permitting them to run around inside a fenced property will be adequate physical exercise for them. Just do not forget that greyhounds have to be on the leash because they may be prone to chasing smaller animals. Indoors, greyhounds are often known as couch potatoes and therefore are not as hyperactive as you may think. Can adapt to any indoor setting An incredible facet about greyhounds is that they are going to adapt to any setting. You'll be able to locate these dogs in a major home or even a little apartment and so they will do very well. These dogs are extremely sensitive to anxiety, so you will need to preserve their surroundings totally free of stress, which consists of heated arguments or fights. As long as they are in a peaceful and loving environment, these dogs will thrive in pretty much any indoor setting. An added bonus is the fact that greyhounds tend not to bark often, so they are really incredible to have around even when you might have close-by neighbors. Effortless grooming Grooming for canines can develop into a demanding activity for house owners. Luckily, greyhounds, due to their short hair, usually do not need day-to-day grooming. These dogs have one coat of hair, which means that they tend not to shed easily and tend not to smell bad. This will likely reduced the amount of work that house owners need to put in to their dogs. A bath for each 6 months is sufficient to help keep your greyhound thoroughly clean and smelling fresh. Overall, greyhound puppies can make amazing companions for you personally and any fellow member of your respective family. These canines are amazing family pets which have wonderful personalities to match their elegant looks. If these very good characteristics match what you want within a puppy dog, then the greyhound will be the perfect choice."
4,Health Issues Associated With Staffordshire Bull Terriers,pets," Although Staffordshire Bull Terriers are a hardy breed, they are susceptible to conditions and diseases that are age-related and also common to this breed. You have to be very careful in choosing a breeder when bringing home a Staffie pup. Responsible breeders will do all they can to weed out or minimize the chances of the animal falling prey to genetic conditions such as Persistent Hyperplastic Primary Vitreous (PHPV), hereditary cataracts (HC), and L-2 hydroxyglutaric aciduria. Select a pup from a breeder that is willing and able to produce related documents certifying that the parent dogs are free from genetic conditions. All dog breeds with a short muzzle and a snub-nosed appearance are susceptible to a condition known as brachycephalic syndrome and it's no different with Staffordshire bull terriers. The syndrome can take the form of a number of conditions such as elongated soft palate, stenotic nares and everted laryngeal saccules. It results in difficulty in breathing. Surgical treatment can usually correct the situation. As mentioned above, HC and PHPV are two genetic conditions that you have to guard against. Of these, the HC gene is found only if both parents are carriers. PHPV is inherited through a complex pattern. The animal is born with it; however, it is not a progressive condition. Urolithiasis is a condition in which crystals block the flow of urine at different points in the urinary tract. It is a painful condition that can lead to bleeding during urination. The animal can become weak, appear depressed, and lose appetite. Proper diet, medicines, and surgery are the possible treatment options. Hip dysplasia occurs due to age and wearing out of the hip joint. It is also possible that the problem may be present from an early age due to improperly formed hip joints. A worn out femur and pelvic socket arrangement in elderly Staffordshire bull terriers can cause them to walk with a limp and with great difficulty. It is a painful condition. Diet and medication can help to alleviate the condition. L-2 hydroxyglutaric Aciduria is a condition in which the substance L-2 does not get metabolized instead it builds up in the animal's plasma and blood stream. This neuro-metabolic disorder can lead to seizures and muscle stiffness. Inherited deafness is an issue with Staffordshire bull terriers with white coats. All dogs belonging to the terrier breed are candidates for skin allergies leading to itchiness and possible skin infection. Remember, your Staffordshire Bull Terrier may never have to experience any of these issues if you are alert when purchasing a pup and keep taking it to the vet at timely intervals for checkups and preventive measures."
5,How To Feed A Horse Or Pony During Winter,pets," With the warmer months slowly coming to an end, it is time to start considering winter horse feeds. The horse or pony’s requirements will be slightly different during the colder part of the year. One of the most significant changes is that they will be expending more energy keeping warm and dry, especially if they are being turned away without a rug. It is vital to keep checking an equine’s health and weight throughout winter. This is particularly important if the horse is not being brought in everyday. Unless the horse is closely examined on a fairly regular basis, weight and horse feed problems can be difficult to spot under layers of thick winter coat or rugs. During winter, grass loses its nutritional value. Even if paddocks contain lots of grass, it will probably not be great quality so owners must buy plenty of top notch hay or add something like Fiberpro to their usual horse feeds. Any horse that is staying out will need extra rations. Not many horses will get through a winter in good health without hard feed, even if they are out of work. Most horse feed companies and equine nutritionists will be able to offer advice on how much horse feed a particular individual will need over winter. It is well worth getting a professional’s opinion if you can as they will set you firmly on the right path. One of the key things to remember is that fibre should make up the bulk of the horse feeds. Chaff or sugar beet, added to the grain or premixed feed; will keep the horse’s digestive system in top shape. Digesting the fibre will also help keep the horse warm. Another thing that should not be overlooked is the horse’s water intake over winter. Dehydration and impaction colic can be an issue over winter as horse’s can be reluctant to drink when the water in their trough is icy cold. Often, it isn’t even possible for them to access water because their water bucket is frozen over. To encourage horses to drink the appropriate amount (12-15 gallons per day), try offering them tepid water. Warmer water will be more appealing to the horse, meaning they drink more and don’t suffer from any complications associated with not drinking enough. Even if you think the horse is healthy, don’t stop monitoring the amount of water they are taking in. It is far better to identify and deal with problems early on, than further down the track. Along with all the aforementioned horse feed requirements, paying attention to every other area of the horse’s health will ensure that they remain in good shape throughout winter. Regular worming and teeth rasping will mean that the money spent on horse feeds is not wasted."

8,Got a New Puppy? Now What?,pets," The breeder should give you a cloth or fluffy toy that they had rubbed on your puppy's mother or littermates, so that it smells like them. It will  be familiar and very comforting to the puppy as it leaves its comfort zone for a new life! Puppy proof the area: put the things you don’t want the puppy to get to, away or anything that could harm him. It is your responsibility to keep the puppy out of things you don't want disturbed or destroyed! Remember it will be curious and playful. The best thing you can do for yourself and the puppy is to purchase a crate. It will be a safe place for him and you will know where the puppy is while using it. Get a size big enough for him to be comfortable and be able to turn around. If it to big he might use one side for sleeping and the other as his bathroom…A fluffy pad a the bottom of the crate will do until he is ready for a real dog bed. Puppy food: be sure you have some food and tiny treats! Ideally, get yourself a bag to start with of whatever the breeder uses. Puppies' stomachs can get easily upset by a switch, so when you do switch, it's best to gradually do so using less of the old and more of the new food. Food and water bowls: stainless steel is best: it is sanitary and tough enough for those little puppy teeth. A flat cloth collar that will fit with about 2 inches of room to spare, not enough that the puppy can wiggle out of it. Measure your puppy's neck with a tape measure and then add the 2 inches. You might as well get a non expensive one for now, since you puppy is going to fast and go through a couple of them before you get him an adult dog collar. And a short leash to go with the collar. An ID tag to go on the collar. Even if your puppy doesn't have a name yet, it's a good safety measure to get that ID on. A enzyme cleaner to neutralize any urine that gets onto floors or carpets. The enzymes greatly reduce or eliminate the odor that would draw the pup back to the same place for the same purpose. And of course some toys. Get the kind that he will not be able to destroy (too easily) . Play nice with him, no tug and war games for now that might develop an aggressive behavior. We have found that every time you see your chew on something he not supposed to, replacing it with one of its own toys will teach him what he can chew and what he cannot. You might want to purchase a dog toy box to keep his toy all in one place, which teach where they are instead of being spread all over the house. Do not let him jump on people: it might be cute now, but not so much when he reaches 80 pounds… Housetraining: if your puppy is not housebroken yet start right away. This is when its crate comes in handy. Take him outside to do his business every time you take him out of the crate. He will not ""go"" in his crate (that is if you didn’t buy him a Mansion). Teach him to go outside and encourage and praise him when he does. Make an appointment with your favorite veterinarian for a puppy check-up. If you do not have once ask for a recommendation from the breeder or dog owner friends. Enroll your puppy for training classes: they are a lot of fun for you and him.  The handlers will teach him and you, basics commands and behaviors. It’s also a great way to socialize him with other dogs. All these tips and recommendations are basic information, and in no way complete. They are books, trainers and more to help for you and your new puppy in having a wonderful life together.

10,A Guide to the Staffordshire Bull Terrier,pets," The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is a dog breed with a very interesting history. The breed has been around for more than three hundred years. It came into being as a cross between a bulldog and terriers. Originally, these dogs were bred for dog fighting in England. Animal welfare laws put an end to such activities over time but the breed prized for its game attitude flourished. Staffordshire Bull Terriers were recognized as a breed in England in 1935. These dogs have a life expectancy of 12 to 16 years. Apartment owners that can ensure daily exercise for the animals will have no problems in managing their Staffordshire Bull Terriers. The first impression of the Staffordshire Bull Terrier is of an incredibly strong-looking dog with a muscular body. The dogs have a broad head and a short foreface. The neck is muscular and gives way to square shoulders and a deep chest. The dogs have clear, dark, and round eyes. The jaws give the impression of firmness. Small ears usually stand drooped. The dogs display coats with short fine hair in colors such as brindle, fawn, piebald, red, and black. Grooming the dog is easy; the animal does not shed much. The males stand 14 to 17 inches in height at the withers and weigh between 14 kg to 18 kg. Females can weigh between 11 kg to 15.4 kg and measure 11 to 15 inches in height. These dogs epitomize the qualities that make dogs such well-loved animals by us humans. They are courageous, playful, loyal, and obedient. They are very energetic and will throw themselves into any enterprise with gusto. One of the most beautiful features of these dogs' temperament is that they are very tolerant towards children and perfectly safe for families with kids. You will have to housebreak these dogs gently and quite often firmly, particularly to ensure that they do not get aggressive with other animals when you take them out for walks. Because Staffordshire Bull Terriers are full of energy and have an independent streak, they should be made to realize from early on that you are the boss. These dogs are not known for their swimming abilities. Since they are very people-friendly these dogs are not the best option for a guard dog. These dogs should preferably be kept on a leash when taken out for a walk. Dogs have to grapple with health issues typical to their breed and it's no different for Staffordshire Bull Terriers. Hereditary Cataracts (HC) and Persistent Hyperplastic Primary Vitreous (PHPV) are eye problems found commonly with dogs of this breed. The conditions can be surgically treated. Hip dysplasia and luxating patellas are hereditary joint problems with this breed. L-2 hydroxyglutaric Aciduria is a metabolic disorder that can lead to seizures and tremors. The best way to avoid health issues from cropping up is to follow good breeding practices and use healthy and disease-free dogs and bitches for mating."
11,The Right Way to Approach Building Chicken Coops,pets," If you look around on the internet you’ll find plenty of advice on building chicken coops. There is advice from every type of coop, cage and hutch you can think of – from the small to the large there is a plan, design or article geared toward helping you build one. A chicken coop, if you haven’t already discovered, isn’t a very complex dwelling. But like anything that you’ll house a living creature in, it should be built the right way. Your birds, after all, rely completely on you for their safety and well being. So it does warrant some level of experience or expertise to put into a coop, cage or hutch, the right features. Not only the right features that are needed for a well constructed chicken house but features that are built the right way with the right materials. You can go as cheap as you want and ignore all the advice that’s out there and you will have a coop of some kind in the end.  Now I don’t know about you, but I hate doing the same thing over again especially if it’s because I took a shortcut, instead of doing it right the first time. Some people are really good at building and all you have to do is describe what you’d like built and they’ll build it just how you pictured it in your mind. Then there are the rest of us, who need a set of instructions that not only tell how to put something together but in what order it should be put together in. If you are not one of those people who was born with a hammer in their hand, you may want to think twice about brushing off all the chicken coop sages out there giving away their advice. Granted some of the information available may not lead you in the right direction, but there is an awful lot of really good information, free information to boot, available on the internet. There are several really good forums where members share their advice and experience that you can draw from, or you will also find lots of great articles on online, that will point you in the right direction. It’s really a matter of what you want to do and your experience level.  If you are like I was when I first started, then you really don’t need someone to guide you every step of the way, but still need some good information to keep you on the right path. Then doing a little research on your own will probably get you what you need to build and excellent chicken coop. If you have never picked a hammer up but are just chomping at the bit to build your own coop, taking your first steps toward self-reliance, then a set of plans can be had for a fairly low price. A good set of plans will guide you along and help you avoid spending to much money on material or having doors that won’t shut, windows that don’t open or a leaky roof. Having and raising chickens is one of the most fun and rewarding hobbies there is and not only because of the eggs and meat you get, but also because of the piece of self-reliance you gain by learning a skill that you’ll have the rest of your life. If you have a coop, cage, hutch or some other chicken house that is poorly constructed I guarantee it will be no fun raising your chickens because you’ll be dealing with sick birds, predators and fixing what’s wrong instead of enjoying your birds."
12,Memory Foam Dog Beds,pets," The majority of dogs sleep for approximately fourteen hours a day, so it is important to buy your dog a dog bed that will be snug and functional.

I always make sure my dog’s bed is of a good size so that she has plenty of room to stretch out or curl up if she wants to.

A machine-washable dog bed cover can also be a very beneficial addition when buying a new memory foam dog bed, especially if your dog frequently gets dirty or sheds a lot of hair. Covers for dog beds should be washable, removable and very durable.  Long-haired dogs are often more suited to a cool cotton cover as this material can help prevent dogs from overheating too much when they are staying indoors. Short haired dogs typically get cold quite easily so they are generally better suited to covers made of warmer materials such as suede or fleece to help keep them warm throughout the year. If your dog lives outdoors it is more important than ever to buy a suitable bed and all of the previous tips should be considered.  A memory foam dog bed could be the perfect choice as they mould to your dog’s body and thus avoid any pressure points, giving your dog maximum comfort and support. Please don’t forget a memory foam dog bed is especially good for the more mature dog. Our beautiful dog Amber, a first cross Golden Labrador/German Shepherd, is now almost seventeen years old and consequently, she is a bit arthritic.  I decided to buy her a memory foam dog bed because we have had a memory foam mattress on our bed for about five years now and find it really comfortable.  Indeed, we wouldn’t want to go back to a more conventional mattress.  She really loves her new bed and looks so comfortable that I know it’s one of the best things I could have bought for her to ease her old, aching bones."

15,Monkeys in Space,pets," In the early years of space race between USA and Soviet Union, many scientists theorized that human body could not survive long periods in the harsh space environment. To observe and calculate influence of weightlessness and space radiation, both of those countries started launching flights that carried live animals – mostly monkeys, chimps and dogs. While USA focused its efforts mainly on short-term monkey test flights, Soviet Union’s testing with monkeys came 20 years later, where they tested long-term space influence on flights that lasted between 5 and 14 days. First monkey astronaut that was launched toward the space was small rhesus monkey named Albert I. On June 11, 1948, he reached the altitude of 39 miles, but sadly, he suffocated during the flight. His successor, Albert II managed to enter the space on the altitude of 83 miles, but he died during impact. During the early 1950s, several more flights we made, all using the modified German WW2 V2 and specialized Aerobee rockets. All missions of monkeys Albert III-VI received some sort of malfunction that ended with the death of their passengers. Only the Albert VI managed to survive the landing, but even he died from overheating while he waited for the rescue party to reach his capsule. Introduction of the new class of Jupiter rockets in 1958 brought the new wave of animal testing. One of the most successful flights from that time was 1959 mission that successfully returned monkeys Able and Miss Baker from the space. Their flight attained the altitude of 300miles, and in the following years, media and USA scientists heavily promoted this mission as great success. Although monkey Able died during the scheduled post-mission surgery, Miss Baker continued to live for the next 24 years until she died from kidney failure in 1984. With the impending arrival of the first human space mission, NASA scientist begun testing several crucial parts of their launching and landing equipment. For that purposes, two monkeys (Sam and Miss Sam) flew on missions to test the landing parachute systems and LES (launch escape system). Final preparation flight for Alan Shepard happened on January 31, 1961, when first chimpanzee called HAM went to space aboard the Mercury Redstone rocket. During his 16-minute flight, Ham reached the altitude of 157 miles and experienced over 6 minutes of weightlessness.  After the successful mission of Alan B. Shepard, Jr., on May 5, 1961, another chimp was launched to the space. Enos orbited the earth two times on November 29, 1961, and then successfully landed in the Ocean. Two smaller space programs involved monkeys during the end of 1960s. Two French monkeys managed to reach the altitude of around 150 miles before returning successfully to Earth. Argentina had less luck. One of their monkeys survived flight to the height of 60km, but the other one died when his landing gear malfunctioned. More than 20 years later, Soviet Union used 12 monkeys on their ""Bion"" space program. Their experiments were focused more for long-term exposure of space environment. From 1983 to 1996, twelve squirrel monkeys were sent into space - Biosatellite 3 with Abrek and Bion, Bion 7 with Verny and Gordy, Bion 8 with Yerosha andDryoma, Bion 9 with Zhakonya and Zabiyaka, Bion 10 with Krosh and Ivasha, and finalyBion 11 withLapik and Multik. Of all those monkeys, only Multik died during the scheduled post-landing operation."
16,Your new ferret: Finding the best ferret diet,pets," In the last fifty years or more... as the ferret has gained popularity as a pet... owners have grown increasingly dissatisfied with the food choices for them. Nothing is available, it seems, that meets all of their nutritional requirements. So it is not surprising to find a rapidly growing segment of ferret owners who have decided to take the nutritional health and status of their beloved pets into their own hands. Just as you find natural health enthusiasts in the human realm, you will meet the same type of people in the pet sector. And I only have one word to say to them, ""More power to you."" (Okay that is more than one word.) But, these individuals try as much as they can, to provide their ferrets with the meats, the organs and the bones needed for their pets' health. They do not feed their ferret kibble using the very simple logic that kibble was not a part of any ferret diet some 2,500 years ago. I will try to explain, as concisely as possible, what they believe the benefits of a natural alternative diet for their ferrets are. Some people refer to this alternative diet as an ""evolutionary"" diet. It ensures, according to its proponents, that the ferret is receiving the nutrient essential to his continued good health. They like to explain that the ferret needs nine essential amino acids. Essential amino acids are those the ferret's system cannot produce itself, so it must get from its diet. There is just no other way. These substances are normally found in foods that the ferret's wild relatives eat quite frequently. They include rabbits, mice, rats, birds, frogs, lizards, and even squirrels. Calcium is another aspect of the diet that your ferret may be lacking. You may be surprised to learn that many manufactured canned cat foods -- and even ferret foods -- do not have any type of quality bone meal included. This means ferrets may be lacking in calcium. A healthy ferret diet does not necessarily mean that a ferret needs to have food available to him 24/7. A ferret who eats the proper diet may not want to eat again for another 10 hours. The untamed variety of ferret, or polecat, only ate once, sometimes twice a day. Additionally, health conscious individuals say that the natural variety of foods that are a part of this evolutionary diet -- from bones to meat to skin -- helps to ""flush out"" the intestinal tract of the animal. This means that your ferret will have less hairballs and other unnecessary obstructions. It also may take care of some nutritional needs that the ferret has, that science has yet to detect. Not only that, these people say, just look at design of both your ferret's jaw and his teeth. This leaves him with a limited chewing capacity. His teeth, they say, definitely evolved to cut meat and bone. Not to smash kibbles for up to ten hours a day. The other pretty amazing aspect of this diet is that it does not lead to dental cavities or other tooth problems. It is thought that the different textures of the prey foods help to massage the ferret's gums and therefore clean the teeth in the process (Isn't Mother Nature wonderful?)"
17,Build the Ideal Lighting Conditions for Aquarium Organisms Through LED light,pets," Aquarium LED lighting has been employed for certain types of lighting fixtures e. g. nighttime. Because products has enhanced, it can be a competitor for being the principle source of light and is a popular issue on the tank servicing world. It can not only make your aquarium appear more desirable but is additionally very energy efficient, durable, sends out little high temperature plus it is very customizable and it is both adaptable and light. Aquarium LED lighting may be used to make a moonlight effect that is a unique look for a aquarium and enables you to watch what happens inside your tank through the night. Whatever the lights you choose, be careful as water and lights/electrical rarely mix well. Aquarium LED lighting Could Add to the Benefit of your Aquarium. Many people love maintaining fish tanks. These people do this not only to have seeing the fish (or the reef) inside their environment but also because it enhances the attractiveness within their house. Until lately a lot of people have used fluorescent tubes for their fish tanks in order to see the style of the fish tank and the fish clearly. Aquarium LED lighting has increased substantially throughout the last few years and they may be used to light the tank and actually catch your vision without being glaringly bright. Some people claim that the light they provide for soft coral reef tanks in particular is wonderful. Several positive aspects of LED Aquarium Lighting Your illumination should not improve the temperature within the tank as fish, coral and plants might be temperature sensitive. LED aquarium lights are a great choice as they produce little or no heat, and gives great lighting while consuming minor electrical power. LED's last for years - a common estimate you will note can be 50, 000 hours which is well past the lifetime of tubes or bulbs. The truth they provide off minimal heat which is absorbed from the water implies you simply won't obtain temperature adjustments and also have to waste time by using chillers. It must be explained that any type of illumination will simply do so much. No illumination in the world will likely make a messy tank seem good. It may simply highlight the dirt in the tank. For that reason ensure your aquarium is clean: remove every hanging dust, trim your plants when you have any and clear the edges of the fish tank. This will also involve changing out portion of the water regularly. You can apply this yourself. A lot of people know that the time they preserve for themselves is worth it. Get an advise with various resources or professional on LED lighting."
18,Gerbils - The Best Pet Option for Young Children,pets," If you have young children under foot begging for a puppy, you're likely concerned that even after they've promised to feed it, walk it, and clean up after it, you'll in fact be the one taking care of the poor creature. Then you'll have a furry child to add to your brood. As a dog person - allergic though I am - I'm an advocate of children growing up with one (maybe even 2) but that said they are a lot of work, and where younger kids are concerned they may not be the best option. As kids get older and can appreciate that a dog or cat requires a lot of care and work, and is in fact a member of the family once adopted, this idea may be more appealing. However, if your tiny loved ones are just that, tiny, but you still want them to have a pet to love and learn to care for (with your guidance of course), let me make a case for gerbils. But before I do, let's run through a few other pet options that may seem appealing but may not be as suitable for a host of reasons. Other small animals and their drawbacks I suppose before I assume your little critters will want one of the furry and cuddly variety, I should address the cold-blooded sort. Personally I like snakes and lizards well enough, but I wouldn't necessarily want one living in my house. Also, young children are very tactile and many of these creatures need to be handled carefully or don't necessarily like to be handled at all. Beyond that, their set-up can be expensive and difficult to maintain. As reptiles can't regulate their own body temperatures it is crucial that their domiciles are maintained at a certain constant temperature. Their diets can also be tricky. For these reasons it is very easy for them to fall ill if not watched closely for signs of distress. Now onto our fluffy friends. Bunnies are some of the cutest animals around but experts will tell you that they are not good pets for young children. They are prone to biting, even with a lot of gentle handling and ""training"" to get them used to being pet and cuddled. Of even greater concern is the fact that they are a lot more fragile than they look. Rabbits have very delicate bones and even older children and adults need to be conscious of how they pick them up, handle them, and replace them to their homes. They also need a lot of care, and can be a lot of work to clean up after to keep their cages neat and odour-free. Guinea pigs have a lot of the same pitfalls as bunnies. Though they actually need a lot of love and attention which may seem like a match made in heaven for kids who want nothing more than to bestow hugs and kisses upon them, it's a lot more work than one would think. If you have one guinea pig, you must spend at least a couple of hours a day taking it out of its home and playing with it. If you have two (highly recommended as they are very social and get lonely), they still need to be taken out of their cage at least once a day for an hour or more for play time. They also require a lot of different toys to play with and places to hide and explore to keep them happy and healthy. Once again diet is crucial and clean-up can be a job unto itself. The benefits are well worth it - ask any guinea pig lover - but that's a lot of work for anyone. Rats (if they don't creep you out) are very social but the downside once again is that they require a lot of attention and care. Mice are great but they are lightning-fast, pee a lot, and need a lot of things to climb and play on to be happy. They are a great option though, as they are easy to care for in terms of diet, don't require a lot of attention from you if they are kept in pairs or groups, and don't require a large cage. And, the more you give them to play with, the more entertaining they become. I would definitely rank them in the number two spot. Hamsters, though one of the cutest little critters around, aren't all that easy to take care of. Diet is simple, and again they don't require a large cage (though with any animal the more space you can give it, the happier it will be). They do however need to be trained to be held without freaking out or biting, they are fragile, and they pee a lot too which means their bedding needs to be changed regularly. There are also different types of hamsters and each type has different requirements to be healthy and happy. Some can and should be housed in multiples, others need to be solitary, like Teddy Bear hamsters. And though this should be intuitive and applies to any pets you may have, don't house both sexes together or you will end up with more pets than you bargained for. Hamsters (any type) would be better for a slightly older child with a little more patience. Gerbils really are a great option We now come to gerbils. They should be housed in groups of at least two or more females to keep them happy as they are very social little munchkins. They are fast but they won't bite and they can be trained easily to get used to being held. They don't seem to mind too much if a child comes along, startles them, and scoops them up without warning. The only time a gerbil has even so much as nibbled on my finger was when I forgot to wash my hands after making a peanut butter-and-jam sandwich - who could blame the little guy? Gerbils are desert creatures which means they drink less water than other furry animals and thus they pee far less. This means their bedding stays cleaner longer and they should never have a smelly cage for you to deal with. They also love to dig and burrow but introduce a wheel into their environment and once they figure it out it will be their new favourite toy! Their diet is simple (you can buy a two-kilo bag of gerbil food at your nearest Walmart for $4.00 and it will last two gerbils quite a while) and so is their home set-up. The only thing I recommend you don't do is buy one of those Habitrail hard-plastic homes for them. They love to chew and will make cracks in the plastic eventually, but this doesn't mean they are difficult to house. You may like the look of the store-bought sanctuary but trust me, they don't care. All they want to do all day is burrow and run on their wheel, and maybe box a little - this is typical of gerbils, especially sisters like the gerbils I have, Lola and Yvette. They may squeak and fight but so long as they cuddle up together at bedtime, you know they're fine. I bought my little duo the biggest Rubbermaid container I could find, filled it with recycled cardboard bedding (also available at Walmart and pet stores of course) - as wood chip bedding is not safe or healthy for any animal as it can cause respiratory issues - a wheel, a $5 wooden hut, food, and a water bottle and they're in hog heaven. They live an average of one to 3 years and mine have already passed the 3-year mark! A reminder - lots of space is key to your new pet's welfare As an animal lover I am a huge advocate of making sure you do all of your research before adopting a pet of any kind. This is essential to ensure that everything from their bedding to their food and home set-up is appropriate and of the highest quality. Another crucial issue is space. Commercial cages aren't that big and pet store ""experts"" will be only too happy to direct you to a cage with all of the bells and whistles and convince you that this will keep your new pet happy, but this is not the case. Again, if you do your research you will find that commercial cages are made to be big enough to house the appropriate animals and give them room to move around a bit, but that doesn't mean they're adequate by any stretch of the imagination. Imagine if someone had you in a cage for almost twenty-four hours a day. The issue is that manufacturers need to make cages that are easy to ship, can be easily stacked once they reach the pet store, and can be sold at an outrageous mark-up for what is little more than heavy wire and/or plastic. Down the road when the kids are older and you decide you may want to graduate to one of the animals I have mentioned, have a look online for easy and inexpensive DIY pet homes. It if often more fun to design and create your own habitat and this way your pet will have all the room it needs and then some. This will be evident in its behaviour and you'll all reap the benefits of a happy, healthy, and playful new addition to your family. Original article published by Ardra on Ezine Articles"
19,Green Pets - How You Can Make Pet Ownership More Eco-Friendly,pets," Pet ownership is a big responsibility - you have to care for the animal for its entire life, buying food, bedding, clothing, toys, and other supplies. But did you ever stop to think about the environmental responsibilities of owning a pet? There is, in fact, a significant environmental consideration in owning a pet. Consider, for instance, the manufacture of pet foods and all the packaging involved, and consider the synthetic rubber and plastic toys pet owners often buy for their animals. Here are some tips on how you can make pet ownership more eco-friendly. Pet Wastes Dogs - When you walk your dog, you really need to scoop its poop. Leaving it outside pollutes the water supply and is unsanitary. It also changes the composition of the soil and kills grass and other plants. When you dispose of your pet's waste, the most eco-friendly thing to do is seal it in a biodegradable bag and put it in the trash. Cats - Scooping kitty litter is one of those tasks that most cat owners dislike, but you can at least make it a more eco-friendly venture by also using biodegradable bags to place the ""scoopings"" in. Also, effective, biodegradable kitty litter is available and is a good, eco-conscious choice. Food Interestingly, pets produce more of that problematic waste material (i.e. poop) when they are fed cheap pet food that's full of fillers and artificial colors. Also, the manufacture of pet foods on such a massive scale may not be the most environmentally friendly thing. Consider making your own pet food, or buying sustainable, pre-made pet foods that are simple and natural. It's not too hard to make your own pet treats, either - they are basically just hard biscuits made in pet-friendly flavors. Does Your Dog or Cat Really Need That? Let's face it - its fun to buy little cute toys and things for your pets. But does your dog really need another rubber squeaky toy, and does your cat need another plastic dingle ball? Many dogs are happy with a stick or a favorite toy or two and many cats just enjoy an inexpensive piece of string. Rope toys made from natural hemp are an option for dogs, and cats enjoy rolling on catnip, which you can grow yourself. Flea Control Controlling fleas is important for your pet's health and comfort. But using pesticides on your pet's body may be harmful both to your pet's health and to the environment. Consider eco-friendly, herbal flea collars, sprays, or spot-on treatments. It's also a good idea to comb your pet daily to remove fleas that were picked up outdoors before they get established. By implementing some of the suggestions in your article, you can enjoy your pet and help the environment at the same time."

2,Finding the best cat food for your kitty does not have to be high-priced.,pets," Being aware of what is better for your pet's diet is always an intriguing dilemma to answer because there are countless selections to choose from. For starters I am going to inform you what cat food is produced from. And I'm talking about the one that comes processed or bagged and that you can buy just about at any food store. The dry and wet foods are basically leftovers of meats from local butchers and supermarkets once they have obtained the ""high grade"" sections from the animals. Such as, beef, poultry, turkey and pork. These remains of meat, unwanted fat plus bones will be taken to companies that make cat food like Purina, Procter and Gamble,  Whiskas and many others. They will buy this kind of cheap""meat""  and process it through degrading it by temperature, pressurizing it and also by incorporating several substances to it. After they develop this type of paste they'll add the chemicals as well as vitamins and minerals that the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) requires them to contain in the final product to meet up with specific quality standard. Then depending on what type of presentation the end product is going to be they either extract or include water to it. When  it's destined to be bagged then they will get it dry and in case it's going canned or maybe in pouches they may need to add some moisture content to it. The prevalent denominator of these food products is definitely the content of proteins, fibers, fats and taurine. The next thing will be incorporating the corresponding vitamins and minerals  depending about what the specific health condition is going to be. As an example, if your cat has hairball issue then the food will contain a bit more of crude fiber in it. Another example would be food targeted for healthy bones and teeth, which just like in human beings, calcium is an essential part for keeping them strong as well as healthy. Just like the couple of targeted health problems I mentioned you could find many more such as bad breath, healthy joints, food allergies, weight loss, etc. A few brands will incorporate Omega-6 and Omega-3 essential fatty acids which will help protect against disorders like high-cholesterol, renal system condition and also allergies. Although these kinds of acids are not required by the AAFCO I find them to be very helpful for your pet's healthy live style. To conclude, the best cat food could be just about any brand name at the nearest market. It does not necessarily must be the highly-priced famous brands in order to be looked at good. Basically look at the proteins and fibers contents  particularly and your cat  should be fine. This is applicable with regard to already healthful adult cats. Should you have indoor cats simply get them the indoor cats formula because it is made up of grains and greens which will help them with their digestive system minimizing hairballs. In case your cat has some sort of distinct health problem simply grab the food intended for this. In general all brands contain the same recipe they simply have various brands and displays.Thus for my part there's not a best cat food brand particularly, it's much more about the content."
3,Warning Signs and Ways to Stop Flea Allergy in Dogs,pets," Flea allergy, commonly referred to as flea dermatitis, is the most common form of allergy diagnosed in dogs and is brought on by a flea bite. It is the primary cause of itchiness in dogs, and it merely takes the bite of a single flea to induce an allergic reaction on the pet's skin. Flea bite allergies could cause a pet to scratch for anywhere between a few hours to a few days and can take up to three days to a week to appear after the initial bite of a flea. How Do Flea Allergies in Dogs Occur? Fleas are only found on an animal when they are feeding. Just like the mosquito, the flea will bite a canine and draw out blood for nutrition. When fleas do this, they will inject a tiny measure of saliva under the animal's skin which could have nearly fifteen individual allergy inducing substances. If the canine is sensitive to any one of the allergens that were injected by the flea, it will prompt an allergic response that leads to the canine scratching. Roughly one half of all canines will have to endure flea allergies, and while the allergies are more often diagnosed in mature canines, pups could likewise suffer from flea dermatitis. Diagnosing Flea Dermatitis and Recognition of Its Signs Dog owners normally are not aware that their pet has fleas because of their relatively tiny size and because of how challenging they often are to get rid of. Making diagnosis of flea allergies especially difficult is the fact that it just takes one solitary flea to cause flea allergies and symptoms may not be evident for up to seven days after the bite of the flea occurred. It does not take an infestation of fleas to bring on allergies in canines. The signs of flea dermatitis in canines frequently include ceaseless itching or biting of the coat and skin, inflammation of the skin, roseolas, and reddening of the skin. As a result of the ceaseless itching, loss of fur across the dog's posterior, primarily in the region beginning in the center section along the spine to the start of the tail and also in their back legs area, may also be a pretty good indication of flea allergies in your pet. A veterinarian can also find dermatitis employing innovative blood and skin tests to look for particular allergy causing substances and to eliminate other conditions including fungal, yeast and bacterial infections. Flea Treatment Should Start With a Sound Flea Extermination Program The first stage to any successful kind of flea treatment takes into consideration getting rid of fleas on your dog as well as in your pet's nearby surroundings. Even with an impeccable flea eradication plan instituted, it isn't unusual for canine's to still experience an occasional bite from a flea. Canines which are often outside may pose an even harder challenge. Traditional Drugs and Desensitization as Dermatitis Treatments A vet may propose using desensitization as a technique of flea allergy treatment. This involves giving the dog a shot with minor measures of flea antigen over an extended amount of time, possibly even the remainder of the dog's life. This type of treatment is usually a success in approximately one half of the cases, and could become very costly over the long term. Antihistamines and conventional medicines, like cortisone, are also ordinarily prescribed by the vet to alleviate flea dermatitis in dogs. These medicines can usually provide relief for flea dermatitis; but, it has been proven that there are adverse side effects associated with taking corticosteroids. As an end result, this method of treatment might be counterproductive. All Natural Relief for Flea Allergies Due to the side effects associated with taking steroids, a lot of dog owners are turning to holistic remedies when trying to defend against flea dermatitis in dogs. There are numerous all-natural ingredients in these herbal remedies that are both effective and safe for your dog. German Chamomile has been utilized to soothe and clean the skin for many centuries. A few other herbs have also been proven to help promote enhancing overall skin health and give restoration and soothing qualities to the skin, and include Witchhazel, Marigold and Cleavers."
4,Testing Your Doberman Puppy,pets," Should you test your Doberman puppy to determine how to train it, or should you just play it by ear? It happens that even if you checked the bloodline, followed all the breeders' tricks on determining temperament, you end up with a Dobermann puppy totally unsuited as a guard dog. He's playful and loves to have fun! He is unable to follow direction and the last trainer just gave up on him. What should you do? The first you should do is to NOT GIVE UP.  Your Dobermann puppy still has all the potential to be the one you've always dreamed of owning, and it won't hurt to adjust your timetable a wee bit, just to get it all right. In the process, you can bet that little pup will grow on you. The trick is finding that one tickle spot that will get your Doberman dog to follow you. It may be a special treat or a specific time of day where he or she responds to most favorably. Your objective would be to find your Doberman puppy's weak spot in order to get the training done properly. You can conduct a series of informal tests to help you do this.  Here are some suggestions: a)	Try restraining the puppy by turning it on its back. Watch for the reaction.  If the dog allows you to put him on this position for even for a couple of seconds, then it will follow and is more receptive to instruction. This would signal that the dog appears to have a good temperament for training as a guard dog. If the dog freezes, then you need to find out the reason why the dog acts unnaturally. b)	Let the puppy lose in an area enclosed by fences. Start walking and encourage the puppy to follow you. If it does, then it is friendly and shows interest in having contact with humans.  This is an excellent sign that the puppy could be a great pet, as well as a security dog c)	Have a special dog treat and let your puppy smell it. Then, toss it but keep your puppy restrained for a few seconds. Release and let him find the treat. Test different kinds of treats to find out which one he likes the most d)	Interact with the puppy, and look for clues about the Doberman puppy's response to treats, praises, touch, and trainability e)	Expose the puppies to strange, new sounds like loud clanging, and watch for their reaction to the noise stimuli. Just be careful not to frighten them to the point of causing trauma Testing is something that is done by most breeders, not just in Australia and the surrounding areas like Queensland, Victoria, Canberra, and NSW, but also around the world from other parts of Asia to the United States and Europe.  If you are unsure about handling the testing, find a breeder from any of these areas: NSW, Canberra, Victoria, or Queensland. Australia is a well-known for its breeding techniques and high quality of testing. The Doberman puppies for sale around these parts are of excellent breed and bloodline. You will have a hard time finding  Dobermann dogs or puppies that are not well cared for, not in Australia where animals are considered precious and highly regarded as part of a household, and this bodes well for you and your dog if you got your Dobermann from within Australia. If you have more than one Doberman puppy, know its history. If the puppy is mixed breed, then be sure to run the tests several times over his training. The results will often swing erratically until it finally settles in. Remember that as your Doberman grows, he or she will change in temperament and maturity. It will help to record the progress, not just for your puppy, but also for yourself. It can uplift you when you feel like throwing in the towel, or just donating the dog to charity. It can happen, no smirking now. Don't give in to these kinds of urges. You will regret an impulsive decision like this. Doberman dogs are one of the most loyal and intelligent breeds around. They will never leave you if you are in a crisis, and will stand by you throughout your troubles. Finally, keep in mind that while testing is encouraged, it is not 100% accurate. Thus, keep an open mind. As long as the Doberman puppy is treated fairly, then there's no harm in testing, and you create a bond that will outlast any test."
5,Home-Made Dog Food for Dogs With Allergic Reactions,pets," Food allergic reactions are responsible for about 10 % of all of the allergic reactions observed in dogs.  Additionally they are generally what make up 20 % of the causes of itchiness and constant scratching in dogs.  Precisely how a dog becomes sensitized to a particular agent within the food, which produces an elaborate antibody response within the dog’s digestive tract, is not so well understood.  Despite our lack of knowledge of how these food allergic reactions affect our dogs, we do, however, understand a lot of things: the signs and symptoms, how you can identify food allergic reactions, as well as how you can treat them.  Food allergic reactions affect both male and female dogs, and may appear as soon as twenty weeks and dogs that are 12 years old.  But many cases occur once the dog is between 2 and 6 years old. The signs and symptoms of food allergic reactions act like most other allergic reactions observed in dogs. The main symptom is scratchy skin that mostly affects the face area, feet, forelegs, ears, underarms, and also the area surrounding the anus.  Signs and symptoms may also include chronic or recurrent hair thinning, ear infections, hair thinning, hot spots, and skin ailments that do react to antibiotics, but then reoccur after antibiotics are stopped.  Dogs with food allergic reactions sometimes come with an elevated incidence of going number 2 throughout your day. To be able to identify food hypersensitivity correctly, owners can begin their dog on a food trial.  A food trial means feeding your dog a meal source the animal hasn't eaten before - composed of protein and carbohydrates - not less than 12 weeks.  Rabbit or venison are great options of protein since they're rarely utilized in most manufacturers’ dog food.  For the carbohydrate, you can use potatoes.  The brand new meal source must be the only food the dog should consume for that full twelve weeks.  What this means is no goodies, flavored medicines, pig’s ears, or rawhide.  Only the special food and water are allowed during the food trial time.  Plus, your dog shouldn't be permitted to roam as he could get access to other food outdoors or garbage. When the dog shows a reasonable reduction or removal of the signs and symptoms following the 12 weeks, then your animal can go back to its normal food routine. When the signs and symptoms return after returning to the original diet, the diagnosis of the food hypersensitivity is confirmed. Feeding dogs a home-made meal is a terrific way to avoid giving your pet meals that they're allergic to.  You are able to periodically offer your dog new food elements that will determine the precise elements which are leading to the food allergic reaction.  When the dog's signs and symptoms have gone away using the special diet, you'll be able to include a meat that they have experienced previously -- like beef or chicken -- for 2 weeks.  When the dog shows no signs and symptoms, you'll be able to include an additional different component.  When the dog starts to exhibit signs and symptoms again, you'll be able to conclude that the latest component put into this diet was one thing your dog was allergic to.  Home-made diets are an easy way to make sure that proper ingredients are utilized and balanced as well as the correct quantity of minerals and vitamins."
6,The Importance Of Mares In Horse Breeding,pets," When it comes to horse breeding, the stallions are often the ones who get all the attention. They take centre stage in advertisements and stud issues of equestrian magazines, with many people assuming that they are the most influential part of the horse breeding equation, especially if they consistently throw successful foals. However, it is important to remember that the stallion is responsible for only fifty percent of the resulting progeny. Some breeders even argue that the mare has slightly more influence on how the foal turns out than the sire, as the way she raises the foal helps shape its own personality and how it reacts to certain things. How the mare brings up her foal certainly has an impact on its temperament. After all, she is the one nurturing and teaching the foal for the first six months of its life. So many characteristics and behaviours can be picked up during that period, both good and bad. If the mare is skittish and hard to handle, the foal will follow her lead and probably act in a similar fashion. If, on the other hand, she is relaxed and calm natured, it is likely that her offspring will have a more laid back disposition as well. Breeders also need to think very carefully about what they hope to achieve in breeding a foal. Bear in mind that a flashy stallion paired with a nice mare won’t necessarily result in a great foal if they are not complementary types. Breeders should be uncompromising when it comes to the quality of their broodmares. Some people wear rose-tinted glasses and just can’t see that their mare is not suitable for breeding. They think that their mare is special and that if she has done well in her discipline, she will produce a good foal. They forget about type, blood and how the mare is put together. In any horse breeding programme, the mares should be a good type and have correct conformation and a nice trainable temperament. If the aim is to produce a competitive animal, it is also preferable to use mares that have an impressive performance background. It is not just the stallion that should be expected to prove himself under saddle. Although many studs specialise in high performing sport horses, it should be pointed out that the quality of the mare is key, whatever the foal’s end job is going to be. Even if all you want to do is breed sensible, versatile all-rounders, it is important to pay attention to the standard of the mare. Any broodmare’s conformation should be fundamentally sound to give the best chance of the foal living a long useful life, free of lameness and health problems. At the very least, the mare should have nice straight legs, a clean throatlatch, a well set on neck of adequate length and a good strong back. Broodmares are the cornerstone of a breeder’s success and can make or break a horse breeding programme. If people remember that and invest in only the highest quality, best conformed mares, the standard of stock being produced, whether it is for casual riders or individuals aiming for Olympic gold will continue to go from strength to strength."
7,Horse Studs: A Guide To Sending A Mare Away To Be Bred,pets," For many horse owners, breeding that dream foal from their very own mare can seem a dream come true.

The downside of relocating the mare to a horse stud is that she will undoubtedly find the shift away from familiar surroundings a stressful experience, even if she has been through the process before.

Keep an eye out for protruding nails and any potentially harmful rubbish hidden in the grass. Also check that the grass is of good quality and is well maintained. Good grass pasture is necessary for a broodmare both before and after giving birth, providing her with vital nutrients that she will then pass on to her foal. If the mare is going to be kept in a foaling box for the final part of her pregnancy, it should be large enough for her to move around and lie down comfortably. The stable should be from 12ft x 12ft to 14ft x 14ft, depending on the size of the horse. It should be clean, warm, well lit, have good drainage, and include nothing that could damage a mare and foal. Some horse studs also use surveillance equipment in their stables which can be hugely valuable. The closed circuit television (CCTV) can be used to effectively monitor the mare as she nears labour without unduly disturbing her. When the owner is happy with the horse stud and the stallion, all they need to do is organise a time to drop off the mare. Also bear in mind that horse studs will usually ask for details of the mare’s diet, when she was last wormed and vaccination information, among other things, so make sure this is all recorded and kept in a convenient, easily accessible manner. It can be a good idea to give the horse stud a file containing all the information they might need, and also sending them an electronic copy via email. After those final few details are handed over, the mare owner can rest easy and let the professionals do their job. Most horse studs will keep in touch with the owner and let them know how the mare is progressing and whether there are any problems. They will also allow the owner to visit the mare when they choose. It is well worth taking the time to research all the available horse studs. Having the right team on board caring for the mare and foal when it arrives will make the entire breeding experience as stress free and enjoyable as possible."

Zoonotic diseases, sometimes referred to as zoonosis are infectious diseases that can be passed from animals to human beings. In this article we will address some of the more common ways these illnesses are passed from animal to human, what your risks are and how to reduce the possibility of acquiring such an illness. Recently, a series of reports were released by the medical community regarding zoonotic diseases and the risks involved for pet owners. Some of these reports bordered on near hysteria. How much of the hype was the medical community and how much was the media feeding on public reaction is difficult to assess. While zoonotic disease is a concern and should be addressed, the reality of the situation is that you are more likely to contract an illness from another person than you are from your pet. Zoonoses are passed in several ways. Some are passed directly from animal to human through contact of bodily fluids such as saliva, one example of this would be rabies where an infected animal bites a human and the disease is passed on the saliva from the animal to the open wound of the bite. Others are vector borne meaning that a vector such as an insect must spread them; West Nile virus would be an example of a vector borne zoonose where mosquitoes spread the disease from birds to humans through their bites.  Another common way these illnesses are spread is through soil, water, or food that has been contaminated by infected feces. Examples of these illnesses are Salmonella, toxoplasmosis, or E-coli. The reality is that risk of contracting a zoonotic disease is minimal. With the current vaccination protocols in place for both humans and animals many of these illnesses are kept in check. How often do you hear of an outbreak of rabies or bubonic plague? This is because of the controls in place to help keep such outbreaks in check.

Even though some people may be more susceptible to zoonoses there are several simple and easy steps to take to lower the risk associated with these illnesses. First and foremost, keep your pets healthy. Make certain that they are up to date on their vaccinations; address any problems such as fleas and ticks immediately to reduce the risk of vector transmission of any disease. Other steps to take are as follows. Do not handle any wildlife unless it is absolutely unavoidable. If you are bitten by an animal wash the wound out immediately and then seek the care of a doctor as soon as you can. Control unwanted pests such as mice, rats and insects around your home. Use the various means of insect bite protection available for yourself and your animals when ever possible. Cook meat and eggs thoroughly and wash vegetables and raw foods well. Practice good hygiene habits especially after cleaning up after your pets, such as cleaning cat litter boxes or scooping the poop in the back yard. In spite of some reports the reality is that you have as much chance of winning the lottery as you do of contracting a zoonotic disease from your pet.

19,Elevated Dog Bowls for English Bulldog Puppies,pets," We’ve all seen the raise dog bowls with their cute stand and decorated bowls.  And many of us probably think these are mainly for large breed dogs.  The truth is, these elevated bowls are great for all dogs of all sizes, especially your English Bulldog puppy! Elevated dog bowls allow dogs to eat at a more natural stance, keeping their neck, back and hips in a standing position without putting undue stress on these joints.  They also keep your puppy from swallowing too much air while eating which can cause indigestion, vomiting, choking and bloat which can be deadly.  This is particularly important for English Bulldog puppies as they have a deep chest cavity that is more prone to bloat than other breeds. You may think that because English Bulldog puppies are short and low to the ground, eating out of an elevated bowl would be unnecessary.  The opposite is true.  Because English Bulldogs have such a short, stout stature, bending down to eat can be uncomfortable and stress the joints in their bodies. The best option for your English Bulldog puppy is to get a feeding station that is adjustable.  This will allow you to raise the bowls as he grows and save money from having to purchase a new station as he gets older.  It will also give you the freedom of choosing a position perfect for your puppy since no two dogs are made alike. The feeding station should be adjusted so that the bowl reaches just below your puppy’s neck so that he is not straining to reach his food.  When your English Bulldog puppy eats, he should be able to stand in a natural position while easily reaching his bowls.  This is why an adjustable feeder can be so helpful! There is a wide variety of materials from iron to wood for the stands and plenty of choices for bowls.

20,Building Urban Chicken Coop Runs – Don’t Let Local Ordinances Stop You,pets," There are lots of people who are enjoying the benefits of raising chickens, like the fresh eggs, insect control in their garden as well as the free fertilizer - maybe your thinking of becoming one of them? If you are, then building a chicken coop that includes a run is probably the best option for keeping your chickens safe. A run is just another way of saying cage or fenced in area.  A well built run takes into account your local predators that you’ll be protecting your birds from.  This includes cats and dogs – even if they are your own. To insure your birds don’t end up on your local predator’s dinner menu, you’ll want to make it so they cannot dig under the fencing, squeeze through any opening or reach into the run through the fencing and if you’re an urban dweller, you’ll need to do this while making sure it looks good. But before you put the run up you’ll want to build a coop that also protects your poultry from the elements as well as predators. What is a chicken coop anyway except a shed given a different purpose in life? Now people who live in the country usually have the option to build a coop however they like and maybe they don’t need to be as concerned with the looks as their urban dwelling counter parts. If you live in an urban area and you are allowed to have chickens, there is no doubt some rules you’ll have to live by in order to keep them.  Such as the number of hens you are allowed to have, noise ordinances, your coops appearance and cleanliness, to name a few, are most likely on top of the list of rules. If you’re concerned about noise ordinances then just keeping hens is a good idea because their fairly quiet and you still can get plenty of eggs without having to worry about a rooster crowing at four o’clock in the morning.  Roosters don’t crow any louder than a dog barks, but the timing of it is what can become the issue. The amount of room you have available and the local livestock and poultry ordinance is what will determine the number you can keep, so its best that you contact your local officials to guide you along with that issue.  If you have room for say ten birds but your local laws only allow three then that is a good problem because you’ve got plenty of room and should have no issue with this. The one thing you have total control over is how good you make your coop and run look which can determine whether you get any grief from your neighbors over the local blight ordinance.  If I lived in town I would make it look so good that people would stop by to ask if they could see it instead of complaining it was an eyesore. Why give anyone a single reason to make an issue of you having chickens?  Having chickens in an urban area isn’t a given so it’s up to those who can to give it a good name and help educate the general public by setting a good example. Raising chickens in town certainly has its challenges, there is no doubt there, but you won’t regret the fresh eggs or the satisfaction of raising these versatile birds and gaining a little bit of self reliance and independence from the grocery store."

1,Normally Handicapped Puppies Develop A Strong Impact On People’s Feelings,pets," We’ve seen and observed about therapy pets. The lovely working k9s that can be brought around town-in hospitals, in care establishments, in treatment centers, and a lot of other places-to cheer up the sick and often, the lonely.

Besides, it’s not easy to turn far from an adorable pet dog that frequently tries to get the focus by aiming to lick your face."
2,A Complete Introduction to Hamsters,pets," These rodents are found in a wide range of habitats, from northern Europe in a broad band across much of Asia, apart from the southeastern corner. Twenty-four species are known but, as in the gerbils, only one - the Golden, or Syrian, Hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) - has become popular as a pet throughout the world. The Golden, or Syrian, Hamster The Golden Hamster was first discovered in 1839 and, forty years later, live specimens were brought to England from Syria by James Skene, who had been serving there in the diplomatic service. This group seems to have thrived for thirty years, with the final progeny dying in 1910. Subsequently, there seems to have been none of these rodents in captivity until April, 1930. Indeed, it was suggested that the species was extinct, until Dr. Israel Aharoni discovered a nest of Syrian Hamsters on Mount Appo in Syria. The young hamsters were transferred to the Hebrew University at Jerusalem. The breeding program was not entirely successful at first, since four of the eight hamsters escaped, and then a female died as a result of a fight with the only surviving male. From this unpromising beginning, however, the male mated successfully with both the other females and, within a year, three hundred and sixty-four offspring had been reared. Some of the progeny were sent to Dr. Edward Hindle in England and, possibly via breeding stock at the London Zoo, Golden Hamsters became available to the pet-owning public. It was not until the start of the Second World War that these hamsters were seen alive in North America. It is amazing to reflect that all such hamsters kept throughout the world today are believed to be the direct descendants from that nest found on Mount Appo more than half a century ago. Hibernation An unusual and often disconcerting habit of hamsters is their ability to hibernate if environmental conditions are unfavorable. This is a natural trait, which to some extent is now less apparent in domesticated stock. The hamster's body temperature falls from the normal level of about 37 C (98.7 F) to a little above the environmental temperature. The respiratory rate is barely one breath a minute, whereas under normal circumstances the figure reaches up to one hundred or more. Since the heart beat can also be as low as four contractions per minute, compared with five hundred per minute in the active animal, to the casual observer a hibernating hamster appears dead. A fall in temperature, coupled with declining periods of light, will trigger hamsters to enter this torpid state. Clearly, in a room in the home heated during cold weather, such behavior is less likely to occur. To encourage a hibernating hamster to wake from its sleep, transfer it to a warm position where it can awake gradually. A temperature in excess of 20 C (68 F) is ideal. Gradually the hamster's breathing will become apparent, and its body will warm up as blood flow to the skin increases. If you discover a hamster apparently dead in the nest, treat it in this way to establish whether or not it has simply entered a torpid state. Other factors also influence a hamster's readiness to enter a state of dormancy. These include the provision of a very deep layer of bedding material and, significantly, an opportunity for the hamster to store food. Hoarding behavior is quite natural, with food being taken back in the cheek pouches and stored in the nest."
3,Smoother Moving  -- Making it Easy for Your Pets,pets," Having pets around may just be as hard as having kids around the house. They tend to be more prone to accidents as they cannot easily be seen especially when people start to get busy moving and carrying things and stuff around the house. Just like preparing kids, prepping up your pets for the whole moving process is essential to make their move smoother. If there is anything that could be said best about moving with them, Local Movers in Boynton Beach says it would be to place them inside your car instead of having them travel all the way to your new home in a separate trailer. They need as much attention as you give your kids. They will also feel stressed out and uneasy which is why it makes sense to make everything easier, familiar, and comfortable for them. Let them travel with you in the same car you're in. The thought of being able to see you with them can be a big thing to make them feel a little more comfortable. It might be necessary to make stops in between to let them rest and stretch a little. Not only will this be good for them. It will benefit you, as well. Prior to all these, make sure that you are able to visit your pet's vet before your scheduled move. If your pet is prone to motion sickness, this might be the right time for you to ask for any medication that they might need to avoid any further mess in the car. Never forget to bring them any toys or activity stuff that will keep them busy all along the trip and thus, lessen their chances of becoming fussy. Inside your car, try to avoid letting your pet/s poke their head outside the window. It may look fun and cute, but may also irritate your pets in the long run. When you let your pets hang out of the car window, dust and small insects could infect and irritate their eyes, which would only lead to another problem and give you more delays. Make sure that power windows are locked, especially with cats present, to prevent them from moving or jumping out. Also, when your car doesn't have air conditioning, it is wise to leave the windows cracked open to an inch or an inch and a half for better ventilation. This is especially important on a hot weather and when pets are prone to motion sickness. Lastly, if you do need to make an overnight stop in between your trip, make sure that you have canvassed for a lodging that would allow for pets to stay inside the room. Directory listings are available in the Internet. Better yet, search through pet-friendly lodging directories in your local library. Contact them as soon as possible and require about their restrictions. If you should leave your pet/s alone in the room, make sure you have informed the management. It would be a good idea to leave the, ""Do Not Disturb Sign,"" too on the door. Keeping all of these in mind might just make your day. It will be helpful to remind yourself that your pet/s would need all all of these precautions. Again, pets are almost always like your kids. Make things smoother for everyone by staying prepared."
4,A Complete Introduction to Gerbils,pets," Gerbils form the subfamily Gerbillinae, a large group consisting of over eighty species. They have a wide range of native land throughout most of Africa and parts of Europe, extending across Asia into Mongolia and China. Gerbils tend to live in arid areas, having adapted, in several ways, to the scarcity of water. By burrowing during the hottest part of the day, they protect themselves against dehydration. Then, at night they venture forth to forage for seeds and similar foods that, in the rapidly falling temperatures, gain a covering of dew. This provides the a vital source of fluid. Not surprisingly, the gerbil's digestive system is very effective at absorbing water and the kidneys are capable of producing a very concentrated urine, ensuring that vital water loss from the body is kept to a minimum. The fur coat color of gerbils reflects their natural environment. Those which live in sandy areas, for example, may have very pale fur coats. The furred tail does have a darker bushy tip, however, and this may serve to confuse predators. Like some lizards, gerbils can lose part of the tail and survive, although it will not regenerate. The tail is an important piece of their anatomy, however, since it helps to provide balance for the body when the gerbil is standing on its hind legs or jumping. Indeed, they can jump considerable distances, relying on the powerful muscles at the top of their legs to provide the necessary impetus to clear long distances. Similar to other creatures that live in open country with little natural cover, gerbils have very acute hearing, in spite of their rather small ears. The bony capsule that encloses the middle ear is greatly enlarged, and serves to amplify even the smallest sound. Their sense of vision is equally well developed. The eyes are prominent and positioned so as to provide a wide field of vision and give them the ability to detect the slightest movement nearby. Gerbils are social creatures, living in groups. For part of the day they may even seal the entrances to their burrows. This helps to keep the internal temperature slightly lower, and may cause condensation of water droplets in the burrow. A typical colony may consist of up to three males and as many as seven females, with some juveniles coexisting in the group. They will forage collectively, digging if necessary for roots that can serve as an emergency supply of water. Since an established group will not tolerate newcomers, it may seem that there would be a high degree of in-breeding within each colony, but studies of captive stock have revealed a unique system that avoids this need. Reproductively active females leave their colony and mate with a male of a neighboring group, before returning to the established family colony to give birth and rear their offspring. Since many species of gerbils live in remote and inhospitable areas of the world, however, we still have much to learn about their natural lifestyles."
5,Three Tips To Build The Best Chicken Hutches,pets," If you want to start building a chicken cage but haven’t settled on which one will give you what you need, consider the following.  You can get plans to build anything and download it right from the internet or buy them at a variety of building centers or farm supply centers. Chicken hutches, chicken coops, barns, sheds you name it there is a building plan out there for it. First you need to know what number of birds you plan on keeping and what you plan to keep them for, such as eggs, meat, for show or maybe just a pet. Chickens are a fun and enjoyable bird no matter the reason you’re raising them. There are some who raise chickens to get large yields of eggs so they can sell them for a small profit and others who are into being more self-sufficient and providing eggs to friends and relatives. Still others raise them for meat and eggs because they want organic foods. If you aren’t into raising large number of birds for meat and eggs and fit more into a category of people who have very limited space and just want a few birds as pets or maybe a rooster for the county fair, then a chicken hutch will work very well for you. They are compact with a lot of the same features as the larger coops but scaled down for fewer birds. They are pretty easy to build and set up and because you are using much less material to build it than a bigger cage, it is also much less expensive. If you really want to try raising chickens just to see if it’s for you, the small size and easy upkeep is ideal for you to get your feet wet. Tip #1 – Making It Easy for Chickens to Access To make it easy for your birds to get in and out of their hutch it is important to get the door sized properly. This is actually important no matter what type of coop you’re building, but because hutches are smaller people tend to make the doorway proportionate to the size of the hutch, which doesn’t work to good. The door way would be the same size on a large coop as it is on a hutch unless you got some Bantam Chickens, then you might want it to be a little smaller. The reason the doorway is so important is because chickens need a sense of security and if your birds have trouble moving in and out of their hutch they’ll get stressed out. That can cause them to molt or lower their egg output and can lead to some other stressed related conditions. Adding a door to cover the doorway or a flap will add to their security and will help protect them from the elements and predators, which is always a good thing to do. Tip #2 – Making It Easy For You To Access A hutch is too small for you to walk into and clean, collect eggs or any other number of chicken care related activities. To access a hutch for many of the same activities you will put a hinged access door on the top that doubles as the roof. To give yourself easy access to the inside you’ll want to raise it to a height that is convenient and comfortable for you to reach inside and clean, collect eggs etc, without straining your back. You will most likely need to build a ramp of some sort so your hens and roosters can get to the doorway easily.  To make sure you’re not aiding any predators in gaining access to your hutch you’ll want to make sure the ramp is removable. Tip #3 - Additional Security Chicken is one of the most popular dishes in the world and most predators would totally agree with that statement. Since you’re not trying to build a snack bar for raccoons or coyotes it’s a good idea to put a latch on the top hatch and if you have a door on the doorway it’s not a bad idea to put a latch there as well. Securing both latches with a small pad lock is recommended since animals like the raccoon are fairly adept at opening things and serving themselves."
6,What to Feed Your Pet Rabbit,pets," Hay Many commercial breeding units do not offer their animals green food or, indeed, perishable foods of any kind, preferring instead to feed a commercially balanced ration of pellets. Even so, hay can, usually, be featured in the feeding regimen. Hay provides more energy and more protein than the equivalent amount of grass.. Although, there may also be a significant difference between the various grades of hay in this regard, even the poorest hay tends to be better in nutritional terms than the equivalent amount of fresh grass. The drying process, which produces hay will, also, render it safe for either guinea pigs or rabbits. Certain plants which, if fresh, would be dangerous. Buttercups (Ranunculus) are a typical example. Nevertheless, keep a careful watch on the material you feed for undesirable plants and occasional harvesting debris. A strand of rusty barbed wire can get bound into a bale of hay from time to time so remain alert and discard anything which could, potentially, be harmful. In the south-west of the United States, close to the Pacific Ocean, the condition of Milkweed poisoning is seen in rabbit stocks. Also known as 'head-down disease' because it results in severe, if not fatal, paralysis. This illness is caused by ingesting the Woolly-pod Milkweed (Asclepias eriocarpa) from contaminated hay. In areas where such problems arise regularly, use an alternative bedding such as rice straw so that the animals are not exposed to this risk. Dry Food and Pellets It is possible to keep rabbits on a diet of dry food, but in this case they will drink more water and may become overweight because of the regimen's high energy producing level. Suitable mixtures from your local pet store are likely to include crushed oats, flaked maize, and wheat in equal quantities. Plus, smaller quantities of pellets and other ingredients such as crushed peas and locust bean pieces are commonly included, as well. While you can buy the individual ingredients separately and mix them together, it is probably best to obtain a prepared ration. Pellets are specially made to contain all the necessary ingredients required for an animal's good health and those for rabbits may even be medicated with drugs known as coccidostats. Do not feed medicated diets routinely, however, especially if the rabbit is kept alongside a guinea pig because the drug may prove harmful to your rabbit's companions. A pelleted ration provides a very concentrated food source and, therefore, only a small quantity will be required, otherwise the rabbit will become overweight quite rapidly. Hard Bread and Mash In order to keep the teeth of your animals healthy provide bread which has been dried in an oven until it becomes very hard. Wholemeal bread is probably best for this purpose, with small pieces being given regularly. Another useful food is a mash of some kind. Stored dry, mashes typically consist of bran and items such as middling - a rough ground flour. Place the required quantity in a mixing dish with a small amount of warm water. Take care not to flood the mash.  It, ideally, should be damp to the touch but not mushy. You can include other available ingredients such as boiled or mashed potatoes or a powdered vitamin and mineral supplement. Once moist, however, the mash will not stay fresh for long, especially in a warm climate, and neither will perishable foods such as mashed potatos, which will sour and turn black."
7,The Basics of Keeping an Aquarium,pets," Keeping an aquarium may seem to be a daunting task for many but it’s easy to understand why so many people enjoy keeping fish as pets. Their visual appeal is captivating, their movements soothing and reduces stress just by observing them in their element. In fact aquariums can often be found in places of business to decrease tension and stress. Having fish is not just about picking out a few fish and putting them in a new aquarium with some fish food. There are several factors that must be considered such as size and compatibility of the fish and size of the tank required. Regardless of whether you choose tropical fish or cold water fish, by learning a few fundamental rules you can enjoy your own tank with minimal maintenance. The Basics Here are some of the basics needed for setting up your aquarium.  In time you can add to and modify to your collection but for the most part, these will be your staple items. Tank – make sure this is the proper size for the fish you plan on keeping Filter – there are many variations, but the bottom line is to keep the tank clean and oxygenated Plants – help oxygenate the water and provide hiding places for fish Gravel – mainly for decoration but some fish like to hide in gravel Heater – dependent on the fish you are keeping but an essential part of keeping your fish warm The Most Important Rule The most basic rule is not to over feed your fish. Very often, novice fish keepers are tempted to keep feeding their fish simply because of a lack of better understanding. You must always remember, an aquarium is a closed environment and everything that goes into the water becomes a part of this environment. When excess food breaks down it releases phosphates and this encourages the growth of algae. With excess food come excess waste and inevitably a dirty environment encouraging disease. A good rule of thumb is to feed your fish only once a day and when feeding them, they should eat everything inside of a few minutes.  They will feed at the top and chase after the food, diving down when necessary to get to it. Any excess food will sink to the bottom and by giving your fish a day of rest without feed, it will encourage them to search for food and keep their tank cleaner. Adding scavenger fish or algae eating fish to your tank help will keep it clean naturally.  They are quick to clean up any excess food and keep too much algae from forming. Providing the Right Environment All aquariums require some kind of maintenance with the buildup of phosphates, evaporation and water hardness over a period of time. Many fish means more waste matter, which in turn means pH levels, will continue to decreasing. Freshwater aquariums need 25 percent water change at least once a month depending on how heavily stocked it is and how clear you prefer your tank. Maintaining the temperature that is best for the fish is very important. Tropical fish do v best in temperatures of approximately 25 degrees centigrade, while cold water fish do well in lower temperatures. Aquarium temperature should always remain constant, abrupt changes will result in a shock to the fish, which could cause death. The safest thing to do is to attach a thermometer to the tank and monitor it regularly. Your fish need light and typically it comes from natural light and artificial light. The plants in the aquarium need light for their growth and the fish need light for feeding. The optimum light requirement for your aquarium is approximately 12 hours a day. Do not put your tank in an area where there is direct sunlight, this will increase algae formation and will heat the water to an unhealthy temperature. Another important factor to be considered in aquarium maintenance is the pH levels of the water.  The pH levels that are easily tolerated are between 6.6 up to 7.4 with the optimum being a pH of 7.  Check with an aquarium specialist if you need to modify your levels for additional fish.  They can give you advice on what works and what doesn’t. Adding vegetation and other ornamental rocks will not only give your tank visual interest but it provides your fish with places to hide. It is important to understand the kind of natural environment your fish require. Visit your local aquarium shop to find the best plants and accessories for the type of fish you have. As with any kind of pet, knowing how to keep them, and making every effort to provide the best environment can only mean healthy, happy fish that will be with you for a long time."

Brushing your doggies fur will also help to prevent mats and tangles and protect him or her from having to be shaved or from endless brushing (which your pet will not appreciate!) A groomer will brush your pet, normally before shampooing, and will let you know if they detect any parasites on the skin. Shedding is a natural process for your pet. Many groomers use a Furminator to remove loose fur from your pet. The tool comes in many shapes and sizes so that it will work with any fur type. Your dog's coat will look great once all the old hair is removed during brushing and grooming! WASHING & DRYING: After brushing your pet, it is time for a bath! It is a good idea to place a cotton ball inside the dog's ears prior to bathing. This will help to prevent ear infections and it will keep the ears dry. Most dogs should be bathed every four weeks. Human shampoo should never be used because the pH balance is harmful to your dog's skin, which can lead to rashes and skin irritations. If you and your dog have very active lifestyles and more frequent bathing is necessary, be sure to use a very mild shampoo that is chemical free with a natural base such as Earth Bath. Don't forget to use a conditioner on your dog's fur! Be sure to thoroughly wash the shampoo and conditioner from your dog's body. Residue from the products can dry out your furry friend's skin and can cause irritation. After the bath, you need to dry your pet. Air drying your pet is best, especially if you have a long haired dog as wet long fur easily creates mats. If you are drying your dog with an at home hair dryer, be aware of how hot the air is on your dog's skin. If your dog is afraid of the air dryer, try to introduce him or her slowly and towel dry in the meantime. If you are not a professional pet groomer, a towel dry is an option as you can easily dry out or burn your pets skin with an at home hair dryer. EAR CLEANING: Cleaning your dog's ears is also important. Your dog groomer will use a mild cleanser around the entrance of the canal, which will simultaneously clean the ears and reduce any odor. If your dog is prone to ear infections, veterinarians will often prescribe and ear solution which is used to clean the ear canal. As a dog owner, you should check your pet's ears often to make sure they are not infected. Breeds such as Cocker Spaniels or Basset Hounds with fallen ears often suffer from ear problems because of the lack of air ventilation. Ears that are not kept clean and dry could lead to ear infections and sometimes even deafness at an early age. If you notice an odor or if your dog has very dirty ears, you should see your vet to determine the problem and to get the right medication for your doggie. NAIL TRIMMING: Most dog owners prefer not to take a chance when it comes to nail trimming which is 100% understandable. Trimming your dog's nails can be tricky, especially if your pet has black nails. The inside of a dog's nail houses a nerve and the nerves are different lengths depending on the dog. An inexperienced executor could accidentally cut the nerve, and the nail will bleed when it happens. If the nail begins to bleed and the nerve has been severed, the dog will feel pain and will fear having his or her nails trimmed. Most dog's nails should be clipped every four weeks. If you are unclear, unsure, or have never clipped your dog's nails, be safe and allow your professional groomer or your vet to cut your pet's nails! If you choose to trim your dog's nails yourself, remember to always use a clean, sharp nail trimmer. Also, trim the nail at a 45 degree angle and cut slowly. Watch your dog for any signs of pain or bleeding and if you notice any, stop immediately as you are too close to the nerve. Always keep quick stop near to stop any bleeding in case of a mishap. TEETH CLEANING: Maintaining your dog's oral health is also important. Between visits to your groomer, brush your dog's teeth. This should be done at least twice a week. Brushing your K9's teeth will keep his or her breath fresh and will help to avoid gum disease. Your local pet store will have tasty toothpaste flavors like beef, chicken or peanut butter! FACE WASHING: It is important to wash your dog's face. Your dog investigates everything with his face and nose, so keeping it clean is essential! Washing your dog's face is especially important if you have a flat faced breed like a Pug or a Bulldog. These type dogs have many folds in the skin, which attract dirt and oil. Regular face washing will prevent any smell."
9,Choosing the Best Dog Breed as Pet,pets," When it comes to the choice of pets, dogs are definitely one of the most popular. The idea of having a new pet dog is always an exciting idea. But having a pet dog is not all about having fun and playing around, because it also entails responsibility. One of the things that you should consider if you plan on bringing a dog into the family is the breed of the dog. Each dog breed does have its ups and downs, so there is no such thing as a bad breed of dog. What matters is that you choose a dog breed that suits you and your living conditions best. First this to consider is the grooming of your dog. Are you willing to groom your dog? Do you have the time to groom your pet? These questions needs to be answered and is detrimental when it comes to choosing a dog breed. Dog grooming is a must because it can also affect not only their looks but their health as well. If you think you won't have the time to groom your dog or you are not willing to spend for a professional dog groomer, then get a short-haired dog that requires very minimal grooming. Long-haired dogs would obviously need more effort when it comes to grooming. Dog grooming is an aspect of dog care that you should never ignore. Another factor to consider is the size of the dog in relation to your living conditions. Just apply common sense with this one. If you have the space to spare or have a big backyard, then it is acceptable for you to get a big or an active dog. Exercise is one of the most important requirement for a dog. Without it, it could lead to obesity and other health problems. If you have a small space, small dog breeds such as a Pug or Chihuahua are good options. Laidback dogs such as the Bassett Hounds and Greyhounds are also good for small spaces. On the other hand, active breeds like the Golden Retriever would definitely need a good yard space. Choosing a dog also means that you will have to prepare your home for the arrival of your pet. Choosing the best dog breed that suits will not only mean your happiness and convenience but also for your dog as well."
10,What Size Dog is Right for You?,pets," The dog is the most popular domesticated animal on earth. Humans originally kept dogs to help them hunt. Domesticated from the gray wolf about fifteen thousand years ago, dogs played an important role in early human settlements. In addition to hunting, they helped pull heavy loads and were expert herders. It wasn't until they became a companion animal that buying a pet dog became popular. Based on a recent survey, there are more than 400 million dogs in the world. Alone in the United States, there are more than 75 million people who own this loyal friend. Their popularity as pets can be ascertained from the fact there are more animal lovers in the United States that have dogs as their pet animals rather than the cats. The popularity of the domesticated dog has encouraged cross breeding. Though the American Kennel Club only recognizes 157 distinct dog breeds, there are several thousand if we include mixed breeds. As you might expect, this can make selecting the right dog a chore. The single most important consideration is the recipient of the dog. A single person often looks for different characteristics for their pet dog than families. Generally, a single person is more likely to select a bigger, more aggressive animal than parents who look for a dog that is good with children. Dogs such as Rottweiler, Pi Bulls and German Sheppard are not recommended for houses with kids as they are more aggressive and not very kid friendly. On the other hand, small sized dogs such as Cocker Spaniels, Beagles and Golden Retrievers are in the category of friendly dogs and are suitable for families with kids. Some dogs require more maintenance than others. The Poodle, for example, requires almost daily grooming. Its coat must be brushed for at least twenty minutes each day, especially if the dog is allowed outdoors. Other dogs like the Siberian Husky are prone to nonstop shedding in the spring and summer months. So, if you can't handle daily grooming or big white clumps of fur, it's best to steer clear of these breeds. Diet also needs to be considered as the bigger the dog, the more it will eat.  A St. Bernard or a Great Dane requires an enormous amount of food to keep their big bodies going. Feeding a larger dog can be very expensive compared to a smaller breed. Like humans, the more intelligent the dog is, the less time it will take it to learn things and get friendly with people around the house. This feature may also be given consideration when selecting a dog as it may save you good amount of time in training the dog. Some intelligent breeds of dogs include Poodles and Border Collies, which are much preferred choices as household pets. Most children love dogs but rarely enjoy walking them. For many children, walking the family pet is a chore and generally, the more energetic a dog is, the more needs to be walked. According to experts pugs, bulldogs and French bulldogs have noticeably lower activity levels than other breeds and are said to be great with children."
11,The True Animal Lover : Nico Samara,pets," Animals too like human beings deserve a decent way of living. They shouldn’t succumb to harm, abuse and exploitation. So to prevent them from cruelty and exploitation, Nico Samara has come forward to give stray animal’s shelter and proper care. There are many ethical and non-ethical reasons to take care of them. First thing is to minimize the sufferings and to provide them nutrition. Second thing is that we have to balance the ecosystem and preserve the species. Cats and dogs are the major victims as compared to other animals. Why Nico Samara is so concerned about these animals is that the government is collecting these stray pets to kill them. They are doing these things every year before the start of the tourist season. The stray animals have to go through starvation especially in cities where people do not have time for pets. However, Nico Samara has managed to save 60 dogs and cats from brutal killing. The mission is still going on to save as many lives as possible. This animal care person is trying to say that life is the same for both animals and humans. There shouldn’t be any difference and so they should not be the victims of ill treatment.

It is necessary for the owner to take them to the nearby animal clinic in order to keep them in good health. Whatever may be the reason, the stray animals need food and shelter like us. Undoubtedly the services of Samara are awesome and laudable. Be merciful to animals and help Nico Samara to look after pets in every way possible."
12,Teach Your Little Ones About Your Dog’s Ailment,pets," Usually, if an injury or perhaps a disease attacks, we presume of just the quick goal for the only one affected. In the case of a pet coming ailing or perhaps wounded, or sentenced to life-time attachment to a dog wheelchair, this will not be obviously, more mistaken. Mostly, a whole family’s living has to get used to make differences also to focus on the loved pet’s rehabilitation or their unique condition. Your dog interacting with incapability complications is a huge job for a family group with young children to take care of. However, it's always one they may be more willing to deal with. For the advent of lower priced dog wheelchairs and also other movability aids and services, caring for their pets are, if not quite easy, tend to be easy when compared anything they were in the past. Getting your rest of the families to help out may well be a little hard when they don’t have an understanding of what’s really occurring and also particularly if they’re shy. It’s especially crucial to sit the younger kids down where you can talk to them to reveal what’s transpiring. One example is, in case your dog is actually requiring a dog wheelchair, start with this. Talk to them about it, allow it to become remarkable, make sure they know how it may help your pet maneuver around and eventually get to perform some of the things all of you used to perform before. Offer them a thing positive to look toward; nevertheless tell them that it's going to become a family effort, that even the littlest one will really need to pitch in. This can infuse a feeling of genetic work as well as security at the same time. You’re all gonna be going after looking after a pet you all absolutely love. It’s a bit scary but everybody can help. Kids do grasp things when they're mentioned to them. In some cases they neglect the details, oftentimes, they don’t fully grasp the consequences. That’s why any patience is required when doing business with them. So, with a pet on just the dog wheelchair, they have to be lightly reminded each and every time out-in the initial few weeks or so- that there is limits, specially when your family dog is still establishing to its disability aid."
13,Siberian and Neva Masquerade cats,pets," Domesticated cats have been in America for many centuries (which are believed to have originated from Britain and Europe), but Siberian, and Siberian ""Seal Tabby Point"" (Neva Masquerade), an offspring of cross breeding Siberian, Siamese and Birman cats are still rare in America. The Siberian cat has a long history which dates back to the 17th century, living on the tree tops in the dense Siberian forest. Over the centuries this breed adapted to Siberia’s harsh climates which no other breeds could do. Siberians have a triple fur coat; guard hairs, awn hairs, and down, which enabled them to withstand the harsh climates of Siberia. Siberians, and in particular, Siberian Neva Masquerade cats, are known to be one of the most intelligent cats in the world, although they have very humble beginnings. With a long history of survival in the harsh climates of Siberia, these cats have proven their endurance and worth many times over and now have reached championship status with many feline clubs around the world.  In the 1930s, Siberians were discovered in the south central area of Russia, living on the streets of Novosibirsk and nearby small towns. Breeding with Siamese and Birman cats (whether naturally, or with man’s interaction) the Siberians offspring is known as a Seal Tabby Point, due to its color. Soon after, this breed was transported to Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) and announced as a ""New Breed"" called Neva Masquerade. This name was derived from the nearby Neva River, and the masquerade parties so prevalent among the wealthy people living near the river.  My source, and the owner of Cattery is an expert with Siberians who has owned, handled, and bred this breed of feline for more than 40 years in her native Novosibirsk, Russia and is very familiar with Siberian’s and the later arrival of Siberian Neva Masquerade’s.  My source also told me that she first begun seeing the Siberian Seal-tabby-point (Neva Masquerade) long before 1993 and it was first born in her home town of Novosibirsk. The Neva’s traits are pointed coloring (different coloring on their feet, nose and tops of the ears), with much white fur and blue eyes. The origins of the color point is obviously met with some dispute, but as long as proper records have been kept (1980’s), color points are noted to have been produced, although to this day the jury is still out on its true origins. Siberians take five years to fully mature physically, but keep their kitten-like personalities throughout their life.  The first Siberian was imported to America in 1991, and the first ""Neva Masquerade"" was imported in 1996.  Although Neva Masquerades (Seal-tabby-point) where imported later to America and became quite popular with cat fanciers, they are still rare in the United States, and many breeders have waiting lists for their kittens. The Siberian was accepted into TICA (The International Cat Association) New Breed program in 1992 and given championship status in 1996. In the world of cat show competition, all standards that apply to the Siberian Cat, apply to the Color point (Neva Masquerade) variety, according to TICA.  In January 2009, the Neva Masquerade was accepted into the Fife registry (Fédération Internationale Féline) as a new breed known as ""Siberian Color Point"". Siberian cats were accepted for registration by CFA (Cat Fanciers Association) in February 2000 and advanced to championship status in February 2006, although some countries still do not accept color point Siberians as a variety of the Siberian cat breed. Although Siberians do shed and require regular grooming, the coat is not inclined to mat which makes grooming easier and quicker than most longhaired cats.  Siberian and Siberian Neva Masquerade’s, are considered hypoallergenic due to the lower levels of a protein in their system (Fel d 1). Most cats have approximately 63,000 microns while Siberians have a mere 200 microns of this protein in their systems, which is a source of allergies with all cat breeds.  Although Siberians are less likely to trigger allergic reactions, its best to spend some time around one before considering adoption. Neva Masquerade’s, as well as all Siberians, adjust easily to their lifestyle surroundings and make a very good house pet. Siberians are very sociable cats and want to be near their owners.  They will usually greet you at the door when you come home, not unlike the family dog.  Often described as dog-like, the Siberian is loyal and not shy around guests, they are intelligent animals and quick to learn.  Their meow is sweet, and when they come to greet you, they make a unique chirping sound.  Many Siberians find water fascinating and like to be around it and watch running water, it’s said that some like to bring their toys and drop them in their water bowls. They also will not only monitor your shower or bath, but possibly join you, too. This affectionate breed makes an ideal lap cat and a wonderful companion who will bring their owner years of happiness, as their lifespan can exceed 16 years.  Siberians and Neva Masquerade’s are completely trusting of humans, making it quite a responsibility when placing these kittens in new homes, according to the owner of siberianking.org nursery. A social breed which loves the company of humans, and enjoys other animals,  along with all the other fascinating traits the Neva Masquerade has, let it not go without saying, this breed is so intelligent it learns different languages very fast too.  Since the Neva’s of, my sources cattery, are transported directly from the south center of Siberia and then raised in a multi-lingual household, they understand both Russian and English languages, according to this nursery’s owner.  She also went on to say that this cat really understands different languages, and not just the tone of a person’s voice.  The fact is, she said, is that no matter what tone is used with Neva Masquerades (Siberian Seal-tabby-points), they understand the language and respond better than most dogs. The following are some fascinating facts about all domestic cats as well as Siberians, which you may not have known: •Domestic cats can run about 30 miles (48 kilometers) per hour. •The cat's tail is an extension of its backbone, and the flexible tail helps a cat keep its balance and land on its feet when it falls. •A cat can move each ear independently, and improve its hearing by aiming the cup of its ears in the direction a sound is coming from. Although domestic cats have lived for centuries in Europe and America. The Siberian Neva Masquerade is still very new and unique to most Americans.  From its wonderful personality to its incredible disposition, and dog like attitude, this is one breed that is sure to warm the hearts of cat lovers, and maybe make some Dog lovers (who never thought they would care for cats), into cat fanciers as well."

15,Some Good Reasons Bettas Turn Out To Be Rewarding Pets,pets," Throughout my years of keeping pets, Betta fish have without a doubt been one of the most fun to raise. These active little guys go so far beyond being just fish, and make great companions and roommates as well. In this article, I'm going to cover a few reasons why Betta fish make great pets and why you might consider getting one. They are highly intelligent and social. First of all, a Betta fish isn't just a fish. They are not like goldfish, in that they're mindlessly wait for food and have no personality of their own. In fact, they really are quite social and you will notice that they develop their own unique properties the longer you keep them. For example, I have a Betta fish that will always stick to the side of the tank I'm closest to when working in the office. Another pet I had in the past would jump up to grab food off of my fingertip and then flit around excitedly once he had grabbed it. They are low-maintenance pets. Another score in the favor of Betta fish, is that they are relatively low maintenance that's after their initial setup. While the tank does require a heater and filter, it becomes relatively self-sufficient after that and all you have to worry about is a daily feeding and a weekly water change, which takes just five or 10 minutes. They take up very little space.  Betta fish take up very little space, even in a tank of recommended size (of 5 to 10 gallons).  Outside of the tank, you'll need a small space to keep things like their food, filter cartridges, chlorination drops, and maybe some water set aside for the next change. They keep you company.  Another great thing about Betta fish, is that they keep you company. Even if you are living in an apartment complex that does not allow pets, fish are usually an exception and these fish make excellent pets indeed. Usually fish seem like they are at the low end of the pet scale, but because they do have unique personalities and are generally active during the day, they can still provide companionship and moral support when you're home alone. You can show them off. Not only do Betta fish make good pets to care for, they're visually appealing as well. When friends come over, they always like to see the Betta swimming around in their tank with their flowing fins and vibrant colors. In addition, you can even train your pet to do simple tricks, like jumping through a hoop for food, or swimming through the water. Other tricks you can do include having the fish follow your finger on the side of the tank, and jumping out of the water to grab food from your fingertip."

17,Canine Heat Stress,pets," It is very important that you pay attention to your dog in the hot months. I know from experience that dogs being field tested during the summer months occasionally slow down and if you are not aware what is happening, you may cause the dog irreparable harm or even death. One of my friends had that happen to her Springer Spaniel. This dog was an eager retriever that loved to fetch tennis balls. You could throw the tennis ball, as far into the woods as possible and the dog would bring it back within minutes and drop it at your feet. You could literally keep throwing the ball until your arm got tired. If you fainted as if you were throwing the ball into the woods towards east, the dog would charge into the woods while you threw the ball unseen by the dog into the woods towards west. The dog would search and search and even if it took the dog 45 minutes, she would eventually come back with the ball, because she trusted you that the ball was somewhere and she wanted to bring it back. Her owner did a lot of retrieving with the dog, and one summer when the temperatures were about 95 degrees F and the relative humidity at 90%, she took the dog for its normal run and threw balls for the dog and kept doing it until the dog collapsed.  The dog got its leg caught on a ground vine, flipped over and never stood up again. The owner thought that the dog had broken her neck and since she couldn’t carry it out of the woods, she came to get Vibeke and me and we brought a spade with us and buried the dog in the woods where she had loved to run. She had clearly died of heat stroke, but we never had the heart to tell our friend the real reason the dog died. Canine Heat Stress – Prevention Although any dog may suffer from heat stress, certain dogs are more vulnerable. They include puppies and geriatric dogs. Overweight dogs are especially susceptible because the fat insulation reduces the dog’s ability to radiate heat. Dogs with a history of heat stress are short-nosed breeds like bulldogs and pugs, which normally have difficulty breathing and panting, but as the saying goes: ""It can happen to you"" – so look out. Dogs with cardiovascular or respiratory disorders may be more easily affected than other breeds. Some basic guidelines: Never leave a dog in a closed automobile, an unventilated garage or other enclosure for any length of time in hot weather. Kennels should have adequate ventilation to provide adequate air circulation in summer months. When dogs are outdoors, some type of shade cover should be provided. Avoid excessive exercise during hot weather. Keep plenty of fresh drinking water available at all times for dogs. Canine Heat Stress – Treatment In heat stroke cases, high fever must be reduced rapidly to save the dog’s life and prevent brain damage. Body temperatures of 106 degrees F and above can be tolerated for only a few minutes before irreversible damage occurs to the central nervous system. If heat stroke occurs: Gradually immerse the dog in cool water if possible. Spray it with cold water from a garden hose. Apply ice packs to the head and neck. If you are in the field, bring the dog into the shade and try cooling the inner ear flaps and inner thighs with cold water. Above all, treat the dog promptly and take it to a veterinarian as soon as possible. A veterinarian must also treat heat exhaustion or heat cramps."
18,Popular Methods to Exterminate Irritating Fleas,pets," Fleas are a significant problem that all pet owners will have to contend with. Anybody who owns a dog has probably dealt with the difficult battle of trying to get rid of fleas, a battle which has usually proved to be harder than it looks. Fleas aren't merely a worry because they bite and bring about hours of irritating scratching for your dog, but they can also trigger additional critical troubles that could include tapeworm infestations, flea bite dermatitis and in critical situations, anemia. As a result of their amazing stamina, fleas are very problematic to manage. The female might lay more than 2,000 eggs during the span of her life, this implies that infection may arise briskly and the eggs that are laid may subsist for a number of months in the environment while merely waiting on an appropriate victim. Thus it is imperative to get rid of both the fleas on your dog and the fleas residing in the dog's living area. The perfect areas to look for fleas are sand, rugs, bedding and carpets. The Best Ways to Eliminate Fleas To totally exterminate fleas on your canine and in his surroundings, it is fundamental to understand the flea's life span. There are four phases which makeup the life cycle of the flea. Like nearly all insects, the fleas starts life in the egg phase, grows into larva, then progresses into the pupa phase before eventually making it to the adult phase. The Flea Egg Phase The eggs of the flea are pale in color and are so minute that they're tough to locate without the use of a magnifying glass. Despite the fact that the eggs are first laid on the dog's skin, a lot will ultimately fall onto the ground to perpetuate their trek to adulthood. Approximately 50 percent of the total flea populace is comprised of eggs. Depending upon the surrounding conditions, the eggs hatch in anywhere from a couple of weeks to a month. The greater the warmth and moistness in the living area, the faster the eggs will hatch. The Flea's Larvae Stage As soon as the flea egg hatches, it enters the larva stage where it grows to nearly 1/4 inch in length. The flea larvae survive on natural waste substances and on the adult flea's feces. They are uncomfortable in intense light and tend to go underground deep within their current living space, if at all possible in a balmy and damp place. Climate controlled houses are the perfect surroundings for the life cycle of the flea to prosper. Outside, larval growth will only come about in wet, shady regions. The Flea's Pupa Phase After going into the pupae phase, the flea pupa form a velvety and sticky protective chrysalis. The shell swiftly forms a useful camouflage as it gets sheltered by debris and dirt. If stimulated by temperature, carbon dioxide or by manual influence, like that in a hot and muggy environment, an adult flea might emerge from its cocoon in as quickly as five to ten days. Just as the adult flea emerges from its cocoon, it could survive for only a few days unless it's able to find a host. Pre-emerged adult fleas are able to exist within the cocoon for as many as nine months. This is important for the reason that adult fleas still living in the cocoon are resistant to insecticides applied to the environment and can appear a significant time after you utilize insecticides in your house. The Flea Adulthood Stage After the adult flea appears from the chrysalis, it must rapidly locate a host since it must have blood in order to exist. Two days subsequent to locating a suitable host, the female flea will start laying in the vicinity of forty eggs each day. Adult fleas can live as long as three weeks. The full lifecycle of a flea can be ended in as little as 2 to 4 weeks, or as long as 10 months contingent upon environmental climate. Treating Your Dog For Fleas There are lots of powders, sprays, shampoos and spot on measures offered to liberate your dog of fleas. Be certain to confer with your vet to opt for the most effective and safest flea pesticides for your house and canine. Methods For Clearing the Indoor Area of Fleas Most pesticides are merely useful against the adult flea, but environmental pesticides are becoming more highly developed. Your veterinarian can offer you flea products having insect growth regulators that will help destroy the flea eggs and larvae. Before applying any environmental pesticide, you ought to vacuum the carpets and rugs to entice the pre-adult fleas to surface from their protective cocoon. Be certain to throw out the vacuum bag afterwards. You ought to also wash all bedding the pet has lied on. Methods For Clearing the Outdoor Area of Fleas Pay particular attention to darkened, shady spots. Apply an insecticide containing an insect growth regulator and repeat it every 14-21 days for 3 to 5 applications. The newer oral and skin flea deterrents ought to profoundly aid you in solving the flea troubles. With dedication and patience, you and your dog should be flea free in short order!"
19,Canine Hip Dysplasia,pets," Canine hip dysplasia is a complicated and serious problem for dogs. It results in minor to severe crippling of the animal due to excessive looseness between the ball and socket joints in the hips. The bone forming the socket apparently fails to develop sufficiently to form a good joint. Also the ball part of the joint may be poorly formed, resulting in a joint that doesn’t work properly. Studies of hip dysplasia indicate that the problem often occurs in large breeds more often and more seriously than in smaller breeds. However, there is probably some incidence of hip dysplasia in nearly all breeds. Hip dysplasia is thought to have a genetic component. It also, is believed to have a nutritional cause, which may be aggravated by mistaken ideas of what is considered good feeding practices. The genetic part cannot be overcome entirely by nutrition treatment, but poor nutrition can further complicate matters. Good balanced feeds that help reduce the effects of the genetic weakness may cover up the genetic problem so that dogs are bred that will retain this tendency. Good breeders are aware of this situation and are doing their best to select for breeding only those animals, which do not exhibit hip dysplasia regardless of the diets they have been fed. Canine hip dysplasia (CHD) is a complicated and serious problem for dogs. It results in minor to severe crippling of the animal due to excessive looseness between the ball and socket joints in the hips. The bone forming the socket apparently fails to develop sufficiently to form a good joint. Also the ball part of the joint may be poorly formed, resulting in a joint that doesn’t work properly.

The genetic part cannot be overcome entirely by nutrition treatment, but poor nutrition can further complicate matters. Good, balanced feeds that help reduce the effects of the genetic weakness may cover up the genetic problem so that dogs are bred that may retain this tendency. Good breeders are aware of this situation and are doing their best to select for breeding only those animals that do not exhibit hip dysplasia regardless of the diets they have been fed. A requirement of the Small Munsterlander Club’s breed council is a prerequisite that a dog will not be allowed to breed if it exhibits a tendency to hip dysplasia. The dog foods that are available today for puppies all contain the good bone building nutrients, calcium, phosphorous, vitamins and trace elements that pups need. Over-consumption of puppy food and rapid growth of large breeds of dogs has been found by researchers at Cornell University to increase the severity of hip dysplasia. The pups should not put on more weight than their skeletal development is ready for. This can aggravate the problem of a poorly developed joint. If you are raising puppies, it is better to keep them a bit hungry rather than letting them eat too much. Letting a pup grow a bit more slowly won’t hurt anything and it may help your dog enjoy a better, longer life. A dog needs to be X-rayed to ensure that it doesn’t have canine hip dysplasia (CHD). Years ago there was only one organization that would qualify a dog’s lack of evidence for hip dysplasia. It was the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals, Inc. (OFA). OFA required that the X-rays not be taken earlier than two years of age for certification. Veterinarians would perform the X-ray examination and mail the result to OFA to certify the dog employing the expertise of 3 trained veterinary radiologists. When an agreement was found among the radiologists subjectively reviewing the photos, a certificate would be issued with an excellent, good or fair rating for the hips if it were determined that hip dysplasia was not evident. Since 1993 another method has gained prominence. It is the PennHIP examination and certification, which can be carried out with greater accuracy. PennHIP exams can be used for dogs as young as 6 months of age. Dr. Gail Smith at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine conceived the PennHIP method in 1983. After about ten years of laboratory tests PennHIP was developed as a cooperative scientific initiative to serve as a multi-center clinical trial of the new hip dysplasia diagnostic technology. The PennHIP certification is a quantitative method that relies on actual measurement of the hip joints’ distraction index (DI) as a determination of the joint’s laxity. The interpretation of laxity is breed dependent and the values are therefore compared to other dogs of the same breed to determine where in the distribution a particular dog falls. The lower the distraction index, the lower the chances of the dog developing arthritis. This is often called degenerative joint disease (DJD) because of excessive wear on the hips’ cartilage. The idea behind this method is to keep breeding on dogs with low distraction numbers to ensure that hip dysplasia does not show up in your breeding. Several studies have shown that dogs with tighter hips are less likely to develop CHD. To learn more about the two methods please check out www.offa.org and www.PennHIP.org."
20,Choosing a Pet for Your Family--Mixed Breed or Purebred?,pets," Trying to choose between a mixed breed and a purebred dog as your pet can be very difficult.  Here is some information that may help you decide which would be best for you and your family. Mixed Breed Dogs Unfortunately, there is a huge selection of mixed breed dogs at your local animal shelter.  You may be able to give a dog a good home and give him his only chance of being adopted.  There are adult dogs, puppies, and older dogs in all sizes and variations of breeds.  The advantage of a shelter dog is that they have already have been wormed, received their shots, have had a general health exam, and most shelters have already had the dog neutered.  You can usually adopt one of these dogs for free to $100, depending on the shelter. With some of the dogs that were left at the shelter by their owners, you may be able to get some information about the dog, such as their health history, temperament, and habits before you take it home.  Some people may prefer an adult dog or older dog to avoid the puppy ""chewing"" stage, and many of these dogs are already house trained. Many people like the individuality of a mixed breed, as they may be part shepherd and lab, and have some characteristics of both, which results in their own unique look and disposition.  In each mixed breed dog there can be two or even more purebreds. Purebred Dogs The main reason for choosing a purebred dog is the expectation of specific characteristics of a certain breed.  Most purebred dogs have certain attributes that some pet owners may be looking for.  As an example, Border Collies are known for their herding skills, Labs are known to love the water and have a sociable nature. In purebred dogs, their ancestors are members of the same breed, and usually conform to a specific breed standard, meaning you will have a good idea of their size and what general physical and behavioral characteristics they will have. They are generally very predictable in terms of what you can expect as they are growing up. Many purebred dogs may cost from $200 to $1500, depending on the breed.  Be sure to find a responsible breeder.  Many puppies for sale in pet stores are obtained from inhumane puppy mills. There are also dogs at the animal shelter that have been left because someone moved and could not take them, or they were unable to handle the responsibilities of owning a dog.  Many shelters do have purebred dogs due to these reasons.  Always check your local shelter before purchasing a purebred, because there may be a dog at the shelter that is the breed you are looking for, and they need a good, loving home. In Conclusion Some breeds of dogs, such as Labs, are prone to health problems such as hip dysphasia, but this can also be true in mixed breeds.  Even though purebreds are bred to have certain characteristics, the dog you choose may not inherit these traits. Both mixed breed and purebred dogs can have different health problems, different temperaments, and characteristics.  It is recommended to take a trip to the animal shelter before choosing your new best friend to see what they have to offer."

1,Diagnosing Dog Allergies and Locating Treatment Options,pets," Have you began to find your dog scratching and itching excessively? Is the scratching causing open wounds and loss of fur on your canine pal? If so, this is a pretty good indication that your dog might be distressed by dog allergies. Dogs don't get the normal red eyes and a watery nose similar to what people do when we are suffering with an allergy. Additional signs can include excessive itching of a given area, or gnawing of the paws causing them to bleed. What Are The Causes of Allergies in Dogs? An allergy occurs when a dog's immune system overreacts to certain allergens. The body will then produce antibodies as a means of protection after the trigger of the animal's allergy comes into the body. The antibodies will then bind to immune cells in the skin and different body tissues. So, when the allergens slowly breach the tissue, the antibodies incite the immune cells to emit virulent chemicals (named histamines) into the nearby tissue. This will then lead to inflammation and itching in the dog. There are several factors to take into account when locating the cause of dog allergies. An allergy that affects a dog's skin is normally triggered by at least one of the following: food, fleas, and airborne particles. Flea Dermatitis or Flea Allergy is usually triggered by flea saliva. That is why it's so important to liberate your canine of fleas on a regular basis. An atopic allergy is incited by the breathing in of airborne particles in the natural environment, such as tobacco smoke, pollen, dust and mold spores, instigate atopic allergies. If a pet has pollen allergies, the pet will manifest signs, even if you keep it indoors as the allergens will come inside. Coughing, sneezing and wheezing frequently are symptoms of this variety of allergy. Food allergies are the next most frequent kind of allergy in dogs. The most likely reasons for food allergies in dogs include: chicken, soy, corn, milk, eggs, wheat and beef. Nausea and diarrhea usually go along with this type  of allergy in dogs. Contact allergy is the least seen variety of allergy in dogs and is set off by contacting something. Triggers could include plastic, wool and grass. A few dogs can have allergic reactions to specific chemicals in the household, however, this isn’t very common. How to Diagnose Skin Allergies in Dogs A vet might be able to detect the problem, however,although it could entail a process of elimination to uncover the root of the skin allergy and could possibly refer your dog to a veterinarian that’s a dermatology specialist. In the case where fleas are ruled out, the animal might be put on an elimination food regimen for a couple of months. The dog is given food it hasn’t eaten before, such as chicken, lamb, and potatoes, with the old food being introduced in stages until the allergy reemerges. The allergen is thought to be at least one ingredient if the dogs scratching decreases by about 50% of what it was before. To check for contact and atopic allergies, veterinary dermatologists utilize an intradermal allergy test that functions by mildly anesthetizing the animal with minute amounts of possible allergens which are injected into the shaved area of the skin. If your dog is allergic to a specific substance, the skin will become inflamed near the area of injection. Treatments for Skin Allergies in Dogs Keeping the pet away from allergens and curing the symptoms of dog allergies are the most beneficial approaches to treatment. Drugs like steroids and antihistamines are frequently suggested to alleviate consequences of itching and inflammation in dogs, although like all medicines they could be accompanied by unwanted side effects and the long-term effects are still undetermined. Long-term treatment using steroids is not advocated because these drugs work by repressing the immune system. Continued steroid use over time could leave your pet vulnerable to infections, diabetes and further conditions. All Natural Remedies Luckily for dog owners, there are plenty of non-toxic and natural herbal and homeopathic remedies for animals living with skin allergies. Melaleuca alternifolia is frequently used externally to advocate skin health and keeping your pet’s skin clean while Althaea officinalis root is an excellent and popular remedy for soothing the skin. Homeopathic remedies such as Apis and Ledum have impressive healing attributes and are remarkably beneficial in healing reddened and chafed skin, or minor stings and cuts."

The body will then manufacture antibodies as a form of protection when the cause of an allergy enters the body. The antibodies will then join to immune cells in the skin and other organs of the body.

If your pet is allergic to a certain substance, the skin will become inflamed surrounding the area of injection. Treatments for Dog Allergies Keeping your pet away from allergens and treating the symptoms of dog allergies are the top methods of treatment. Treatments that include steroids and antihistamines may be prescribed to ease symptoms of scratching and swelling in dogs, although like all drugs they might come with unwanted side effects and the lasting effects are still undetermined.

6,Canine Osteoarthritis - Treatments for Arthritis in Dogs,pets," Dog arthritis is a common condition that is seen most often in animals that are older, overweight and relatively inactive, but younger animals can also suffer from this condition. Some cases are hereditary and occur in animals with hip dysplasia. There is no cure for degenerative joint disease but there are options available to veterinarians for treatment which will improve quality of life. Osteoarthritis is a disease that attacks the joints and is mainly caused by wear and tear. The cartilage cushioning the affected joints becomes worn down and the bones start to grind against each other. As the bones become deformed, it is more painful to move. The joint becomes inflamed and the animal will struggle to stand up or lay down and show signs of restricted mobility. A traumatic injury to the joints can cause similar symptoms and there is a chance that it can lead to osteoarthritis down the road. Rheumatoid arthritis is a condition that occurs when the immune system is compromised. The joints will become swollen and painful. Stiffness and pain results in a loss of function. Symptoms of joint disease are usually more apparent after the animals wakes up. Cold weather and damp conditions will increase the stiffness and pain. The progressive nature of this disease makes it more and more difficult for the animal to get around comfortably. X-rays of the joint will reveal bone spurs developing at the attachment between the bones, ligaments and joints. The space between the bone and joint narrows while bone density increases. Early intervention has been shown to be effective in treating the symptoms. Dogs are prone to developing this condition and one way to prevent its onset is to feed the animal a balanced diet. Overweight animals will experience more pain in the joints. Good joint care will reduce the effects of this condition. Regular exercise is also important for joint health. This condition is often treated with glucosamine and chondritin. These substances work to develop healthy cartilage rather than just mask the symptoms. Animals that are predisposed to the condition can be treated ahead of time to reduce loss of function. Glucosamine extracted from the exoskeleton of shellfish including shrimp, lobster and crab. It acts to stimulate cartilage cells to produce collagen, a substance that acts to reinforce all joints. It is also used to make hyaluronic acid, an ingredient found in synovial fluid. Chondroitin is a substance that works in conjunction with glucosamine to produce a greater effect than either substance used alone. It inhibits the production of enzymes that destroy the joints. These agents work together to repair cartilage and prevent additional damage. Corticosteroids and analgesics may be prescribed to manage the pain and make it easier for the animal to function normally. Regardless of cause, veterinarians have the tools necessary to help relieve the symptoms of dog arthritis. Treatment methods are designed to help the animal get around easier and improve quality of life. Diet and exercise, combined with medication, will eliminate or ease most symptoms and allow the pet to live a long, happy life."
7,A Quick Overview Of Common Dog Parasites,pets," The dog has been a household pet for ages and is highly regarded as a companion of man. As much as the animal is reputed as very loyal, there are other attributes that at times may force others not to adore it. This includes some of the common dog parasites that could affect even those who live in the same environment as the animal. It is important to note that as much as there may be lots of problems related to the animal, there is also a great deal of good that comes from keeping the animal.

The good news is that most of the problems that often afflict this domestic animal can be adequately treated or even prevented as long as good measures are taken during the interaction with it. There are two main groups of dog parasites or general parasites that affect all animals whether domestic or wild. These are basically the internal and external ones and therefore we must be able to take a quick preview into both groups before we can be sure to have a healthy animal free from any scares. Important to note is that the animal pests often cause diseases and other infections that could further interfere with the well being of the animals. The internal pests basically consist of warms and they are in many cases consumed in the food or water that dogs take in their daily meals. Roundworms, whip-worms and hookworms are some of the most common internal parasites that attack dogs besides other farm animals. In order to contain the spread of these pests, it is important to give your animals dewormers since it is not so easy to entirely guard against the possibility of consuming the eggs and other stuff that contribute to their growth in the body of the animal. The services of a veterinary officer are important and it is therefore highly recommended that you should not wait until your animal gets down with some illness before you decide to call one. A regular checkup is necessary and will save your animal from severe attacks that could even be fatal. This principle should apply to human health and it is thus no different when dealing with animals. The external parasites on the other hand are much easier to manage if you are a keen observer of your animals. By taking the first initiative of ensuring that your dog or other pets such as cats that stay around your home are cleaned using the right solutions, you keep away a great number of possible attackers and save your animal from the possibility of catching diseases that may be caused by bites from the pests. Lastly, most common dog parasites such as ticks and fleas thrive in a dirty environment and by the simple observation of cleanliness; you keep lots of them away and save your animals from possible attack. After all, they say prevention is better than cure."

10,Dog Allergies:  Everything You Need To Know About Them,pets," Dogs have always been considered a human's best friend ever since they were domesticated several years ago. They are intelligent and if well-trained, dogs can do almost anything. Over the years, reports of dogs saving people, especially children, have been all over the news. For their good nature therefore, dogs should be well-bred. However, one grave challenge that dog owners face is dog allergies. Dogs are not like human beings who can easily identify what they are allergic to and find the necessary medication for the allergy. For dogs, it is up to the owner to figure out what the dog is allergic to and the symptoms for its allergy. There are four common dog allergies. These are categorized as food, flea, contact and atopic allergies. For each, a dog will exhibit certain symptoms which a good owner can understand and interpret easily. Dog allergy symptoms include itching, raw paws, sneezing and diarrhea. Itching is the most profound symptom of dog allergies. The most common areas you will find your dog itching are the abdomen, the paws, face, ears, hindquarters, groin and back. Almost each part that the dog tries to scratch or lick always points to a distinct allergy. If the itching does not stop, the pet could have sores on its body which will eventually be filled with pus and that could be fatal. Flea allergy usually results in the dog licking or trying to scratch the hindquarters and the back. These allergic reactions are usually triggered by the flea's saliva. Contact allergy on the other hand will be exhibited by the dog excessively itching in areas with less hair cover like the armpits and the abdomen. Atopic allergy, also known as inhalant-related allergy, will also result in the pet trying to scratch its face, feet and even chest. Raw paws also symbolize that the pet is allergic to something. Usually, when the dog scratches and bites its feet a lot, the paws turns reddish brown. Sometimes the paws could even be bloody. Of all the symptoms, sneezing is the clearest symptom of atopic allergy. However, on rare cases, this could mean that your dog is suffering from contact allergy. When the dog sneezes, there is usually a clear discharge from the eyes or the nose. Diarrhea is often a symptom for many dog diseases. However, it also shows that your dog is suffering from food allergies. If you suspect the dog is suffering from this allergy, you should the change its diet and check whether it will improve. Feeding your dog food rich in minerals, vitamins and fatty acids will definitely help in fighting this allergy. To prevent contact and flea allergies you should wash your dog occasionally with cool water and shampoo with Aloe Vera and eucalyptus to relieve the itching. Grooming and brushing your dog regularly, changing its toys and the sleeping area will also be effective in fighting the flea allergy. If the symptoms persist, you should contact a veterinarian because it could be more than just dog allergy."
11,Tips for Planning Healthy Diabetic Dog Foods,pets," Once your dog has been diagnosed with diabetes they must follow a strict meal plan or diet to counter the effects of diabetes. Most veterinarians may prescribe specially formulated commercial diabetic dog foods for your pet. This means that you might have to do away with commercial dog food that you normally give your pet. But some vets may ask you to prepare your dog’s meal yourself. If this is the case here are some very helpful tips to remember when preparing homemade diabetic dog foods: •	In preparing a well-balanced diet for your diabetic dog, it is very crucial to know what to feed your pet. Dog foods rich in fiber are good for diabetic dogs. The extra fiber in the food allows your dog to easily absorb and digest carbohydrates. •	If you feed your dog high fiber foods, the episodes of glucose level spikes can be avoided. Good examples of fiber rich foods would include brown rice, oats and certain vegetables like carrots and peas. •	Not all dogs with diabetes have the same diet plan. You have to listen to the vet's advice so you won't end up making the situation worse for your pet. Dogs with problems in the pancreas are normally advised to stay away from high-fat foods like canned dog foods. •	In preparing homemade diabetic dog foods it is always best to use natural ingredients. Make two or more meals for your dog so that you can serve different meals for your pet. •	Plan your dog’s meal ahead of time. To save money and time it is best to make a schedule of what you would like to feed your pet for the entire week. Homemade dog foods can actually be stored in the fridge to last for days. •	Diet control is very essential. If you have other pets at home, try to feed them all at once, according to the set schedule of your diabetic dog. By doing so, you don't run the risk of your sick dog eating out of the bowls of your other healthy pets. While diabetes can't be transferred from one pet to another, eating food that isn't in your diabetic dog's special diet can be lethal. Proper Diet and planning is very important for your diabetic dog to manage his condition. If you have other healthy dogs at home, it is best to feed them all at once, according to the schedule of your diabetic dog. By doing this, you don't run the risk of your sick dog eating out of the bowls of your other healthy pets.

But paying careful attention to diet, feeding times, exercise and medications, a pet owner can ensure that a diabetic dog can live a long and happy life."

14,Why You Should Give Your Dog Vitamins?,pets," Yes you should, but they do not have to be the way you think.  Usually you will get extra vitamins for your dog at their first puppy visit.  There are many reasons why your dog should get vitamins and why they might need extra vitamins.   All dogs have different nutritional requirements and not all dog food There are many reasons to give your dog vitamins range from the fact that all dogs have different nutritional requirements to your dogs food not having enough.   Even if your dog is on the raw food diet, they still might need additional nutrients depending on their breed sometimes.   Older dogs especially need vitamin supplements because they are not eating as much food as they used to and could be lacking certain nutrients. So what kind of vitamins do dogs need?  Well, it helps to know what each vitamin is for.  Vitamin A is for the skin.  This might help prevent flaky skin and irritable skin in your dogs.  Vitamin D is your dogs bone and teeth.  Breeds like golden retrievers who are very susceptible to arthritis and hip problems will probably benefit greatly from taking a supplement of vitamin d.  Vitamin E is an antioxidant vitamin and Vitamin K is the blood clotting vitamin.  You also have vitamin b which is for healthy muscles, skin and blood and then vitamin C which is a vitamin for stress and antioxidant. Some people will argue that a good quality pet food will contain all the vitamins and nutrients your dog needs.  Others will tell you that is simply not true.  The cooking process that some of the pre made dog foods go through might kill essential nutrients that are needed.   While most pet foods will contain the ""average"" amount of recommended vitamins, they do not provide additional vitamins for protection against diseases. Vitamins help regulated your dogs metabolism.   Vitamins fall into two categories.  One is water soluble (vitamin B and C) which have to be replenished every day.  Vitamins A, D, E and K are what’s known as fat soluble vitamins.  They are stored in fatty tissue and the liver and do not need to be replenished daily. Also included in these supplements are minerals.   Minerals keep our dogs body fluids balanced.   Your dog needs minerals like calcium, magnesium, sodium (just a little) and potassium just like we do.   You need to be careful though with minerals because they can affect each other if too much is taken. When we talk about vitamins we do not just mean the pills that you can get from your vet.  We are also talking about adding certain foods to their diets to make sure they are getting enough vitamins.  If you are following the raw food diet, you want to make sure your dog gets a variety of vegetables to keep their vitamin intakes up. If you are not giving your dog a vitamin or supplement, take a good long hard look at him.   If you see he is losing weight, has skin lesions, or losing his fur he might have a vitamin A deficiency.    Vitamin D deficiency is apparent when your dog loses some of his muscle tone.  If you notice your dog might have a vitamin deficiency, talk to your vet to find out for sure.   Your vet will either suggest that your dog begins to take the necessary vitamin or for you to change his food. Most of the time vitamins deficiencies are more common in packaged dog food that you can get from your local supermarket.  This is why it is important to read the labels on the dog food you buys if that is your feeding method.  You want to make sure it contains all the vitamins your dog needs.  If it does not,  and you do not feel comfortable going to the raw food diet, talk to your vet about giving your dog vitamin supplements to keep him healthy."
15,The Cool Pet Pad,pets," With Spring in full swing and Summer almost here, the warm weather has been a huge factor lately with our two dogs.  Our daily walks are starting earlier to make the most of the cooler morning, and the heat has been making our baby Mochi to take frequent shelter under the trees during our walk, and our nightly walks are occurring way past our dinner time.  In between and throughout the day, Gido and Mochi are in the house, chillin' on their new dog cooling pad. When we return home from our walks, instead of going to their bed or favorite spot to rest, Gido and Mochi have been going to our kitchen to lay out on the tile floor.  We found Mochi one day in our bathroom tub (no water of course)!  I soon realized that our two dogs were just doing all they could to stay cool, and I wanted to do my part to help them.  After a little research, I found a company named The Green Pet Shop that makes a cooling pad for dogs called the Cool Pet Pad.  We recently received our Cool Pet Pad, and it is honestly one of the coolest things we ever got for our boys. The Cool Pet Pad uses patented technology that brings together a proprietary cooling gel and cutting edge design that is safe, and stays dry and cool for a long time.  It is essentially a gel pad like the ones you would put in a cooler to keep your drinks cold, but on steroids!   However, no refrigeration or water is necessary.  The cooling effect is activated by pressure or weight, lasts for three to four hours, and will automatically re-charge itself.  When activated, the pad feels similar to sitting on cold tile floor in an air conditioned room, but a lot more comfortable! Now, these claims seem pretty lofty but trust me, it was very hot this weekend ? in the 90's and humid, and the dog cooling pad has exceeded all of my expectations. Thanks to the warm weather, the dog cooling pad has quickly become a favorite of Gido and Mochi.  It is the first place they go to after their walks, and they stay on the pad for almost all day. As dog lovers, we are responsible for providing a safe and healthy atmosphere for our four-legged family members, especially in the coming warm months.  Along with providing water and shelter, why not take it several steps further by providing them with a place they can go to cool-down.   A dog cooling mat could do just that."

19,Animal Transportation,pets," Pet lovers cherish their little buddies. Some of us go so far as to treat them more like a child than a pet. It’s easy to do! They depend on us for virtually everything; they love us unconditionally and are always happy to see us… even if we’ve been gone for literally 5 minutes. You don’t have to put them through college, you don’t have to buy them school supplies, and they don’t grow up to hate you. What’s there not to love? But what happens when you have to uproot? You can hop on a plane or behind the wheel of a car in complete comfort and style. What about your best friend? How do we move them from one place to another humanely?

1,Kennel cough causes and cures,pets," Kennel cough is medically referred as Infectious Tracheo bronchitis. Kennel cough is a resultant of inflammation of the upper air passageways in dogs and cats. The pathogen responsible for this condition is called as Bordetella bronchiseptica. Majority of the kennel cough infections are caused by this single pathogen , however canine adeno virus and canine parainfluenza virus can also contribute to this infection. Kennel cough is a fairly common disease and is also call as dog common cold. Dogs who are frequently boarded or are exposed to humid conditions have a higher susceptibility to catch kennel cough. Many vets recommend that that dogs be immunized with bordetella vaccine once every six months. Kennel cough is not transmitted to humans but rabbits, pigs and cats can contact this infection very easily. Symptoms The onset of the infection starts with dry and harsh cough. As the infection progresses the dog may develop gagging and retching cough. This is mainly due to the irritation in the air pipe and dryness of the trachea. Many people suggest giving their pets a lot of fluids to combat cough but this has very less effect on the overall condition on the situation. Generally after the first strike of the infection it takes about 3 – 4 days for the infection to fully develop and show full symptoms. In some cases the progress can even be faster. Puppies develop this infection faster than adult dogs. The severity of this infection can be attributed to contributing factors like immunity, ventilation and improper nutrition. The Kennel cough symptoms are more or less similar to that you would see in humans, The difference being the gagging and choking noise. Unlike humans where the flu virus is destroyed within a couple of weeks. The kennel cough pathogen stays embedded in the tissue linings even after 2 months. Treatment Kennel cough is generally not fatal but in some cases it can be a cause of a much bigger disease which can turn fatal. Many vets have reported dogs developing pneumonia due to kennel cough. Many people resort to giving their pets cough syrup meant for humans. Well this can prove fatal as dogs are not tolerant to pheniramine and Guaifenesin. These two ingredients are found in almost all of the cough medications available today. Guaifenesin can cause increased heartbeats, palpitations and even liver failure in dogs. The best way to deal with a kennel cough infection is by a combination of holistic and natural approach. Here are a few pointers – Insulate the pet from other dogs. This ensures that others do not catch the infection. Ensure proper ventilation and cleanliness Humidity only makes the condition worse. Keep your pet in a damp free environment. Feed your pet at regular intervals and ensure adequate liquid intake. Chicken soup or even watery boiled rice with veggies/ meat is a good option. Milk with a little turmeric power works wonders in soothing dry cough. The Bottom line While your vet might suggest giving your dog antibiotics and a cocktail of chemicals, but the truth is that the best way in dealing this problem is a natural approach. Dogs just like other animals by instinct seek natural cures. Animals in the wild have been known to sniff out herbs and plants that would help them to get rid of the ailment. It is important to remember that the root cause of the infection to spread is due to low immunity. Immunity can be boosted not by allopathic cocktails but only by natural ways . Just like humans, animals too show a remarkable response to natural healing treatments, such as homeopathy. Contrary to the popular belief that homeopathy works slow, Many people have actually reported excellent results just after the first dose. So the next time your pet falls sick or is a victim of kennel cough. Give homeopathy a try."
2,Basic Dog Training Made Easy,pets," You must remember that patience is your biggest virtue when dog training. Reprimanding or punishing your dog for wrong behaviour is completely counter productive. If you must show your displeasure then simply ignore your best friend and that will send him a clear signal not to repeat whatever he did wrong. He might still do it again but this is where you patience and consistency comes in, eventually he wont do it. Your dog lives to please you and it is this that unlocks the secret of successful dog training. Dog training should be fun for both trainer and dog and should never be boring for either of you. Bearing this in mind you should limit training periods to no more than about 15 minutes a day. Begin in a quiet area of your home or garden with four basic commands, these are heel, sit, stay and come.  Always give immediate praise as soon as he does something right and simply ignore incorrect responses. Reinforce the praise with a small treat. I emphasise the word 'small' because you don't want to make your pooch fat in the process. Do not move on from these four basic commands until your dog correctly obeys them every time. When your dog begins to obey these commands delay the treat but continue to provide instant praise. As time passes he will execute the command with no treat at all You also need to go to more distracting places, louder and busier which are more demanding for your dog to concentrate and obey your instructions. 'Instant positive reinforcement' is very important and is where a lot of owners go wrong. Instant in this context means within 2 seconds of the action. Anything longer and your best friend could make the wrong connection or none at all. It is so easy to confuse your dog if you are slow with the encouragement. As an example, take the case where you are teaching the 'Sit' command. Dogs will often sit and then almost immediately stand again when first learning the command.  If you are at all slow with the praise then you could cause your dog to associate the 'Sit' command with a 'stand' action. So beware! Only when your dog has mastered the four basic commands in all situations should you move on to other commands. Finally you have to be consistent. If more members of your family are involved in the training then they must agree on a unified strategy."
3,Unique Dog Beds To Make Your Baby Feel Special,pets," For a lot of you, your canine is like family and it also accompanies you and your family any place you travel. Regardless if your pet dog is not really dealt with like a human being at home, chances are that it really is really a fundamental part of your lifestyle. Dogs deliver bliss and laughter into a household. Analysis clearly shows that people today who have domestic pets live even longer when compared with people who do not. Even so, you will have to look at large and small canine beds to obtain a bed that pampers your pet dog the way you really should. Before anything else, consider a good solid custom made large and small dog bed design company which could supply you with superb dog beds for your littlest member of your family. You wouldn't lay your small children on a low-budget bed from Wal-Mart would you? Therefore, why shouldn't the dog receive an equivalent treatment? For anyone who is interested in large and small pet beds, you will find distinct items which you may want to hunt for to guarantee that you can get the proper dog bed for your four-legged friend and also your residence. One of the first items that you ought to look for is the level of quality of the bed. The particular raw materials which have been implemented really need to be comfortable but also sturdy at the same time. The very stitching should be done by way of a significant thread that would withstand misuse and ideally it ought to be at any rate double stitched to be sure that it then stays together. The next detail that you'll want to bear in mind is precisely how the bed likely will fit into your house. A lot of persons will invest in a dog bed and put it in their home only to get aggravated at what an eyesore it truly is. Custom dog beds may be created with your own furnishings in mind. When you select a custom bed, you get a dog bed which can look like it is an aspect of your actual furnishings instead of an item which was added in afterwards. Dog beds come in a number of shapes and sizes. In case you have a big dog, then you'll want to have a look at large dog beds. If one has a little dog, then you will want to consider exclusively contemplating small dog beds. You have got a whole lot more overall flexibility in terms of looking for a bed for a smaller dog. The size bed you ultimately choose for a small dog depends on how it reacts to being by itself. This could certainly sound strange, yet in case your canine likes to cuddle and also likes a whole lot of action close to it, a smaller bed will make it feel much more comfortable. If it loves to move around and play right before bed, a larger bed will be adequate. Both large and small dog beds have numerous stuffing options. Most of the time you'll be able to choose between a foam and cedar stuffing. Cedar is actually a natural repellent for fleas, which is the reason it is so common for dog's beds. Cedar beds have to be refillable to enable you to change the actual wood chips at the appropriate interval. Whatever kind of filling you ultimately choose for your dog's bed, be sure that the cover is actually washable. Dogs aren't like human beings; they shed, leave a mess specifically where they sleep and ever so often they smell like dogs do. A suitable machine washable cover means that you can clean the bed without wrecking the form or comfort for your dog."
4,Basic Dog Training Principles,pets," You must remember that patience is your biggest virtue when dog training. Fear of punishment will simply make your dog confused. Your dog will get the message soon enough that he has exhibited unwanted behaviour if you simply ignore him. He might still do it again but this is where you patience and consistency comes in, eventually he wont do it. Your dog just wants to please you and this is the key to him learning how to obey you. Training should be something that you and your dog look forward to, it should never be boring. Bearing this in mind you should limit training periods to no more than about 15 minutes a day. Initially you should use a quiet area of your home or garden and start with basic commands like heel, sit, stay and come. Ignore incorrect behaviour but immediately praise the right behaviour. Follow up the praise with a small treat. I emphasise the word 'small' because you don't want to make your pooch fat in the process. Persevere with these four commands, move on only when your dog obeys every time As your dog begins to master these commands you should continue to praise him instantly but delay the giving of a treat. As time passes he will execute the command with no treat at all Also go to louder busier places where your dog will have to concentrate more to obey your commands. Many owners go wrong in interpreting 'instant positive reinforcement'. Instant in this context means within 2 seconds of the action. Any longer and your dog will fail to connect the action with the reinforcement. It is so easy to confuse your dog if you are slow with the encouragement. For example, suppose you are teaching the 'Sit' command. An untrained dog when first learning the 'Sit' command will will sometimes sit and then stand almost immediately afterwards.  A slow praise could reinforce the stand rather than the sit in this case. So be careful! Only when your dog has mastered the four basic commands in all situations should you move on to other commands. Finally you have to be consistent. If more than one person in the family is training the dog then they should all agree on the commands and the general approach to the training."

The training factor There are some dog breeds which are very obedient and can be trained easily. While on the other hand, there are other dog breeds which are not so good to be trained easily. So you should ask yourself whether you want an already well trained dog breed or a breed that you will train yourself. Compatibility with other animals and dogs If you already own certain pets and dogs and are planning for a new one, then you should check the compatibility of the new dog with the already existing animals. Some of the dog breeds are very adjusting and happily live with other animals as well. There are contrary dog breeds as well. So you should keep a check on this factor too. Outward breed and inward breed This is yet another important factor that determines the dog breeds. Some of the dog breeds are more outward and love to travel and roam about here and there. On the other hand, some dog breeds just love to be at home and are more inward. So whether you want an outward dog or an inward one should be decided beforehand. Apart from the aforementioned points to be kept in mind before choosing dg breeds, there are several other factors such as whether you are prone to dog allergies or not, energy level of the dogs and several other factors.

Today's the Day to Celebrate the Life of Your Pet It's just human nature.  When we have people or pets around all the time, we assume they will always be with us.  Instead of taking your pets for granted, apply these three pieces of advice from human counselors to your relationships with your pets. First, set aside time to spend with your pet. Sure, you take Rover for a walk once a day, but do you enjoy that time?  Or is it just another thing to mark off your to-do list?  With the busy lives we live, it's hard to work it all in.  But, as a member of the family, your pet deserves his or her fair share of love and attention. Find something you both like to do.  Maybe it's throwing a ball or playing chase with a piece of string.  Whatever play activity you choose, your cat or dog will grow in appreciation that you created special time just for him or her.  What's more, candid photos of you playing with your pets make excellent pet portraits.  What a fun way to celebrate! Second, do something special for them.  Whether it's picking up his favorite chewy at the pet store or gently scratching her tummy until she falls asleep in your lap, your pet will quickly understand just how much s/he means to you. Third, don't procrastinate.  Life's too short.  It's time to celebrate your pets' lives now with professional-quality pet portraits. Creating a keepsake of this magnitude will not only provide you with fine art to hang in your home, but it will also enhance the bond between you and your four-legged friends.  In addition, pet portraits offer a way to capture lasting memories that will span decades into the future.

For the best quality, insist on hand-painted or drawn pet portraits rather than imitation computer-generated replicas. Don't wait for tomorrow.  Celebrate your pet's life starting now.  They enrich your life in so many ways, isn't it time to commemorate them with something truly unforgettable?"

12,Should I buy a wooden Chinese-made chicken coop from Ebay?,pets," If you search on the Internet or Ebay for a chicken coop, or even visit your local pet store, you'll likely stumble across one of the various styles of timber chicken coops available for sale. Many potential chicken coop owners question whether or not these types of imported chicken coops are worth purchasing. We all want to get value for money with any purchase we make, but are these coops really as terrific as the sellers claim they are? So let's address the most important aspects when looking to buy a chicken coop. You may have other criteria when looking to purchase a chicken coop, but these seem to be the most common areas of consideration. A product that will achieve what it's intended for  - i.e. you can actually house chickens happily in the coop Durability/ longevity - a product that will not deteriorate in the short term Pleasing to the eye - a product that looks physically appealing Value for money - is the product worth the money you've paid for it Can these chicken coops successfully house chickens? Customers of these coops have found that the area inside these types of coops is generally very limited and is not suitable for the number of chickens that the sellers claim these coops can house. Most of the photos on the Internet do NOT feature chickens inside the coop. If this were done you'd quickly see how small the coops are in comparison to an average-sized backyard chicken. Buyers of these chicken coops have also found that the dimensions provided by many sellers are exaggerated, with the overall length that is stated including the external nesting box. Additionally the section under the housing area is so close to the ground that this area cannot be accessed by the chickens at all, which means there's even less area for the chickens to scratch! Customers have also found that the perches inside these chicken coops are positioned too low to the floor, resulting in the chickens sleeping on the higher placed nesting box. How long will these coops last? Unfortunately, one of the most commonly mentioned issues about these coops is that they warp and fall apart very quickly. Complaints include: roof leaking ('asphalt' simply peels away over time), nesting box leaking, latches rusting, rain getting in the window and the coop warping after wet weather. If you don't want it to fall apart in less than a year, you'd need to spend an additional $100 or more to protect it from the weather, as soon as you take it out of the box. You'd need to apply many coats of marine-grade varnish and also silicon all the gaps in the framework. ""I have a smaller sized one and they are terrible. The first time in the rain it warped and I'm not able to open the house area door anymore and have to lift other door to get it back into the frame properly now. The colour kind of leeched straight out of it, and the latches and hinges rusted straight away. It literally didn't hold up a week!"" says a dissatisfied owner of these chicken coops. Do these coops look nice? One of the top reasons why customers purchase these coops is because of their attractive styling. With a little ladder going up to the sleeping section and a window to view the chickens, it seems like an cute addition to your backyard. While purchasing a chicken coop that actually looks nice is an important consideration for many, this needs to be weighed up with the other important, practical factors. Value for money? If you've got value for money, it means that you've got a product that is proportional in quality to the money you've paid for it If you're only wanting to spend a small amount on a chicken coop and don't need it to last for many years, then perhaps these coops are value for money, because you essentially get what you pay for. If, however, you're wanting something durable and well made that will house your chickens for many, many years, a timber chicken coop may not be the way to go. Re-sell value is something to consider if you're not sure if you'll keep your chickens for many years. Are all of these styles of coops made in China? A final point worth noting is that some Australian resellers don't make it clear that their products are made in China. While as a seller they may be based in Australia and their product is said to be 'designed in Australia' this doesn't mean that the product is manufactured in Australia. These coops are most likely made in the same factory in China as the rest of these styles of coops."
13,Examining the Psychology of Human Interaction with Dogs,pets," When looking for a new dog you are obviously going to want a smart one. The definition of smart is relative to our definitions; many people might say that the measure of a dog's intelligence is how well it responds to commands so they will call ""here, boy!"", ""sit nice!"", or some other inane command that the dog is supposed to obey. Chances are, if the dog does those sorts of things, he may be less intelligent than the crafty Golden Doodles or Pomeranians who know that they are cute enough to wrap the human around its paw and get anything it wants with a panting tongue and loving eyes. It sometimes gets confusing knowing who owns who, but there's no doubt that people need to express love and dogs can soak up all the love you care to give them. It's a common mistake for inexperienced dog owners to treat their pets like children which can lead to behavior problems for a puppy growing into maturity among humans. Dogs react based on instinct and sensory input, living in the here and now, while humans live in the past and future. In urban areas where people live in apartments and other cramped quarters, it's more practical to own a small dog breed like the miniature Goldendoodle, petite Goldendoodle, Chihuahua, Pomeranian, Pug, and other dogs with low-shed coats and smaller appetites. Whether the personality of the dog should be high-strung or mellow depends on the temperament of the owner and his or her resistance to cuteness attacks. If the dog is the type to jump on you and lick your neck excitedly you might be late for work enjoying the happiness you're giving the never-satisfied pet. It's wise to estimate how much barking will be going on once you purchase a puppy. Some will bark endlessly at the slightest sound, thinking they are protecting the area; other dogs might need a tap on the shoulder just to get them to turn around and pay attention. Dogs live in the present and don't retain very much past memory other than sounds or scents that they may associate with their master or a past fearful experience. As Cesar Milan the Dog Whisperer notes, dogs experience their lives mainly through their noses, eyes, and ears (in that order) so he interacts with dogs by thinking in terms they will understand. The reason that he stresses the important of leading the dog is that dogs are pack animals like their wolf ancestors. Every pack has a leader and if there is no one in the well-defined role of leader, then the dog will take over and become the leader. If no authority is set down for the dog to follow it results in the dog taking over the house and doing whatever he pleases wherever he pleases to do it. He will come to the refrigerator every time it's opened because he knows he can beg for food and get it instantly. Worse yet the dog can become aggressive if not brought up correctly and might snap at those who infringe on his territory. My earliest experience with aggressive dogs was in my pre-school years when my family was visiting a distant relative and I ran down a hallway when their dog barked at me. The dog quickly ran after me and bit me in the heel rather deeply. Nobody told me that you shouldn't run from a barking dog, and apparently the dog was running the show in that house. Now when a dog gets close to me I let it get a whiff of my scent while looking it in the eyes before extending a hand or rubbing its coat. Fortunately dog owners get more skilled at handling their pets all the time and the popular dogs for sale in stores are exceedingly loving and great around kids, but like children its possible to spoil a dog and end up with a brat."
14,Ideal Apartment Dog Breed the Miniature Goldendoodle,pets," Dogs have been bred over the centuries to carry out tasks and for companionship. In fact mankind has been living with dogs for some 14,000 years, using them as hunters, guards, soldiers, herders, guides for the blind, and pets. The friendly Golden Retriever/Labrador Retriever and poodle breeds were bred to create a dog with a no-shed coat that was smaller in size; they were reduced in size more by producing a hybrid from a mini poodle, resulting in the miniature and petite Goldendoodles and Labradoodles. The minis weigh between to 35 pounds and the petites weigh between 12 to 18 pounds. The retriever and poodle cross dubbed Labradoodles and Goldendoodles were first bred in 1989 by the Australian Guide Dog Association for Seeing Eye dogs that were also fairly hypoallergenic with no-shed or low-shed coats that would be comfortable for owners with allergies. Soon thereafter their reputation as healthy and low-maintenance pets spread to North America. The cute and friendly small dogs can live happily in confined spaces so apartment dwellers would do well to consider the miniature Goldendoodle and Labradoodle breeds when shopping for a pet. The petite Goldendoodles are even less complicated to care for with low food consumption and clean-up. The coat types and shedding qualities of these hybrid classes has been formalized into a table by owners and breeders. Done in numbers, 1 to 6 is the ""no shed"" category, 7 to 15 is ""very light shed"", 26 to 35 is ""moderate shed"", and over 36 indicated ""heavy shed"". The coats come in flat, wavy, or curly. As for allergies, family members should check for sensitivity to dog dander, saliva, or urine before making a purchase. There are really no 100% hypo-allergenic dogs, but the Lab and Golden Doodles are very close. A method of testing the amount of shedding is to brush the dog thoroughly then the following day you would put your hand in water and shake off the excess. Then stroke the dog from neck to rump three times with your wet hand, using gentle pressure. Then see how many hairs have come off in your hand. To test for aggression you can roll the pup on its back and gently stroke or scratch its belly. There will often be some struggling at first but as the puppy becomes accustomed to the petting and should relax and become calm. When you stop the stroking, the puppy should stay there for a short time before getting back upright and rushing off to play some more. If the puppy has picked up aggressive traits it will continue to struggle and won't get into a relaxed state. Poodles and Golden Retrievers share a common feature: they come in a wide variety of colors. Poodles come in shades of dark brown, white, red, cream, and gold. Similarly, Golden Retrievers come in gold, copper, red, and light cream. Color and size depend on the parents; the size is primarily determined by the Poodle parent, and the smaller sizes would result from miniature Poodles rather than the standard sized. Whatever the size and color, these dogs are uniformly adorable, affectionate, and intelligent."
15,Hartz Flea Control Products for Pests Free Pets,pets," If you like pets, flea control is something you will have to decide on sooner or later. Once they enter your home, fleas don’t restrict themselves to pets and enjoy feasting on human blood as readily as on their canine friends. Finding small red welts on your skin is as unpleasant as it is dangerous. Since fleas inject their saliva in the body of their hosts while drawing blood, they easily transfer various diseases to those they feed upon some of which can be fatal if left untreated. An ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure. Instead of putting off taking a decision on flea control until the little buggers practically take over your house, you should take steps to prevent them from entering your home.

16,Caring For Your Pet During An Emergency,pets," With the recent earthquake in Japan, the fires in Australia last summer followed by the horrific floods, of we are made aware of how devastating natural disasters can be for people, but it has the same effect for our beloved pets. In the event of an emergency, whether something as large as a natural disaster or as focused as a house fire are you prepared to take care of not only yourself and your family, but your pets as well?  In this article we will look at some basic precautions and preparations that will help insure the safety of your pet in an emergency. You must have a plan of action ready in the event of an emergency. When determining your best options for such plans consider your surroundings and what sort of emergencies you may be facing. For example, if you live in the midwestern portion of the country planning for a hurricane would be futile, however planning for a tornado would be quite prudent. Also think about what sort of industries are in your vicinity and whether an accident there could require your evacuation. Being aware of your environment will aid you in reacting quickly if you need too. Should the need to evacuate your home arise, your pets should go with you. Many people believe that if they leave their pet behind natural instincts will take over and they will get along just fine. Remember that your pet has been dependent on you for all of their needs for their entire lives. Even if they are capable of reacting instinctually it is important to keep in mind that if it is not safe for you to be there it certainly isn’t safe for your pet to be there. Therefore, an important part of your plan should be where to take your pets in the event of an emergency. As much as the Red Cross does in such situations to help those in need they cannot accept pets at their evacuation shelters. You may want to take the time to locate and make a list of places within a 50 to 100 mile radius of your location that you can take your pet. Places to consider for this list would be, other family members homes, animal boarding services, veterinarians with animal boarding facilities, hotels that allow pets and as a last resort animal shelters. Also with today’s efficient communications we are often warned well ahead of time of the possibility of an emergency, if this is the case it would be a good idea to keep all of your pets together so that you can round them up quickly should you need to. When you do leave make sure you have solid control of your pets, even the most docile or well-behaved pets actions can become erratic and unpredictable when they are frightened as may be the case during an emergency. The wisdom of an emergency kit has been highly touted and rightfully so. Your own kit may contain things such as a change of clothes, prescriptions and medications, travelers checks or even food and water. Your pet’s emergency kit isn’t much different by comparison. It should contain enough food and water to last a week in airtight containers to insure it stays fresh. You should replace this food and water every six months. If you opt to include canned food don’t forget to add a hand operated can opener. A bowl for food and water will be needed, a simple plastic bowl will suffice or you may wish to look into some of the innovative space saving travel bowls available. Because you are going into an unsettling set of circumstances and extra collar and leash as well as a portable kennel for each of your pets is advisable. It would also be wise to have a first aid kit specifically for your pet that includes items such as tweezers, gauze bandages, antibiotic crème, antiseptic spray or hydrogen peroxide. You should also include any special medications your pet may require in the first aid kit. Be sure to ask your veterinarian about storage requirements as well as how often this medication should be rotated. It is a good idea to review your pets’ emergency kit every 6 months or so to make sure that the items included are appropriate to any changes that may have occurred with your pet i.e. growth or weight gain. Even with the most thorough of plans in an emergency situation things can go wrong.  You must be prepared for the possibility of you and your pet being separated for this reason paperwork and identification are must have items for your pets. The most obvious form of I.D. is a collar tag with your name and phone number. Many dogs carry this sort of identification but a large number of cat owners don’t have tags for their pet. If you are a cat owner please give serious consideration to some sort of I.D tag for your cat. When deciding what information to place on a collar I.D. tag you may want to consider a second number separate from your own such as a family member or friend who lives outside of your area. This way if the communications in your area are disrupted there is still a way for someone to reach you if they have found your lost pet. One of the most effective forms of identification are microchips, they are relatively inexpensive, there is no risk of they’re being lost and can be easily updated should you move. It is a fairly common practice for all shelters and Veterinarians to scan for microchips when a lost pet is brought to them.  Finally, make sure you have your pets’ paperwork and vaccination information at hand. Most boarding facilities will not accept an animal whose vaccinations are not up to date and many shelters require that animals be vaccinated before releasing them With a bit of careful thought and pre-planning and emergency situation does not have to become a life disaster for you or your pet."
17,The Facts About Microchip Identification For Pets,pets," It’s fairly safe to assume that we have all seen the flyers or posters about a lost pet at one time or another. Behind each of these posters is a sad story; a little boy hoping somebody finds his puppy or an elderly person longing for the company of their missing cat. Unfortunately, the odds are stacked against these lost pets ever finding their way home. Based on statistics from the American Humane Association about 17% of lost dogs and only 2% of lost cats are reunited with their owners. Close to 10 million pets are euthanized each year because their owners can’t be located. However, in the event your pet gets lost you can easily improve the chances of their retuning home safe and sound with some simple steps to help identify them. The most common and easiest way to identify your pet is with a collar and nametag. Not only do nametags provide your contact information, the presence of a collar and tag may help to indicate that your pet is not simply a stray and help to illicit action on the part of people who see your pet. Since tags can fade, rust, or become damaged it is a good idea to check them periodically to make sure they are readable. If the tag is not easily read or if your contact information has changed replace them immediately. The small cost of a new tag is well worth avoiding the heartache of a lost pet. While nametags and collars serve a vital role in identifying your pet tags can be lost and collars can slip off. A secondary and secure form of identification is the Microchip. When Microchipping your pet a veterinarian injects a computer chip about the size of a grain of rice just under the skin between your pets’ shoulder blades. Each chip has a unique number that is then entered into an international database such as the Central Animal Registry or PETtrac. Any animal hospital, veterinarian, animal shelter or humane society can read the I.D. number on the chip with a scanner. The number is then searched for in the database and your contact information retrieved. The microchip can’t be lost or destroyed and will last for your pets entire life but it is important for you as the pet owner to keep your contact information up to date. Even though Microchip pet identification has been safely used for several years now there are still misconceptions regarding its use. Because of this many veterinarians and humane societies have ongoing programs in an effort to educate pet owners about the value of having their pets microchipped. Here, we will address some of the misconceptions and misinformation concerning microchip identification. Some pet owners believe that the procedure for implanting the chip is extremely expensive. While there is no absolute set price to have a microchip implanted it usually costs between $25 and $50 dollars. Often times veterinarians will offer the procedure at a discount if you have it done at the same time as another service such as annual vaccinations or spaying or neutering. This is a one-time procedure; the chip does not have a battery or other type of power source to wear out and no moving parts. The chip draws a small amount of power from the scanner when it is passed over allowing it to transmit the I.D. number. There is no monthly or annual service fee, the chip is maintenance free, and it never needs replacing. There may be a small fee for entering your contact information into the database or for changing your contact information at a later date should the need arise. Many people are concerned that implanting the chip will be painful for their pet. The procedure to implant the microchip is not much different from your pet receiving their vaccinations. The identification chip is injected just under the loose skin between your pets’ shoulder blades. This leads us to another common question, and that is whether or not it is safe your pet to have a foreign object in their body. Of course there is some risk with any foreign material being in the body but these are very minimal in comparison to the risk of your pet becoming lost and not finding their way home. The microchips are comprised of an inert and biocompatible material so they will not cause an allergic reaction in your pet. While the earlier versions of the identification chips would occasionally ""migrate"" from the point they were originally implanted the newer types have been designed to prevent that from happening. This means that the chip won’t move all around your pets’ body or come near any vital organs or nerve tissue. Your veterinarian will take the time to explain all of the risks before the procedure and will most likely recommend that you keep your pet as calm and quiet as possible for the first 24 hours after the injection to allow the implantation to heal securely. Another common belief is that it is impossible for every microchip to have a unique number. With today’s technology it is possible for these tiny microchips to hold incredible amounts of information and can produce up to 275 billion different I.D. numbers. Moreover, each chip manufacturer add product and manufacturer codes to the microchips they produce creating even more possible number combinations assuring that every pet who has a microchip implanted has their own unique number. In fact these numbers are so exclusive that both the American and Canadian Kennel Clubs recognize microchip identification as absolute proof of a dog’s identity. Some people may say that all of the aforementioned attributes of microchip identification are all well and good but of little consequence since many shelters or veterinarians don’t have microchip scanners. While it is a fact that in order for the microchip to help identify your pet it needs to be scanned the truth is that there are very few shelters or veterinarians who do not have access to a microchip reader. There was a time that each brand of microchip could only be read by its own brand of scanner. However, recently the primary chip manufacturers have begun to offer a universal reader to shelters, humane societies and veterinarians for free or for a very nominal fee. This means that no matter which company manufactured your pets I.D. chip it can be easily scanned with a universal reader. While Microchipping is very safe and effective it is no guarantee that your lost pet will be found and returned to you. It is very important that you have more than one type of identification. If for example, your pet were turned over to a shelter that did not have a chip scanner, a collar and nametag would save the day. There are also tags available that indicate that your pet does have a microchip identification thereby allowing the shelter to contact a local veterinarian or other organization that may have a scanner. A nametag will also allow for the possibility of someone finding your pet and contacting you directly. Some pet owners also opt for a small identification tattoo on the ear. If one form of I.D. fails, having secondary identification greatly increases the chances of your pet coming home to their loving family where they belong."
18,Understanding Cushing's Disease In Pets,pets," Hyperadrenocorticism, more commonly known as Cushing’s disease is relatively common in our pets. Although it generally affects dogs more often it is an issue for cats as well.  Unfortunately, many pet owners are not aware of this disease until their pet has been diagnosed with it. Another issue is that Cushing’s disease displays many different symptoms that are also common to other ailments making it difficult to diagnose. In an effort to help educate pet owners about this rather common malady we will address the following questions. What is Cushing’s disease? What are the symptoms of Cushing’s disease? How is Cushing’s disease diagnosed? How is Cushing’s disease treated? In essence Cushing’s disease is caused by an overactive adrenal gland that creates an over abundance of steroids as well as other hormones in the blood stream. Cushing’s disease can occur in two different ways. The first is pituitary related, in which case the pituitary gland over produces Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH), which in turn leads to cortisol overproduction in the adrenal gland. The second is adrenal related in which growth tumors are evident on the adrenal gland affecting the production of a wide variety of hormones. Cushing’s disease commonly occurs in pets in their middle to senior years but can be present in younger pets as well. Because the adrenal gland produces a wide range of hormones and Cushing’s disease can affect the production of one or more of these hormones, the symptoms of Cushing’s disease are many and often subtle in their appearance. The symptoms of Cushing’s disease are as follows: Sudden weight gain, Excessive shedding, and Hyper pigmentation of your pets skin. Because it affects the ability to concentrate urine, it can lead to increased thirst and frequent urination. The disease can also cause the over production of certain steroids that cause some muscle breakdown creating muscle weakness and lethargy and giving a thin legged appearance. This is often accompanied by a potbelly or swollen abdomen. Another symptom of steroid over production can be a suppressed immune system making your pet more susceptible to secondary infections. The pancreas can be adversely affected as well leading to vomiting and or diarrhea. Other symptoms may include an increase in appetite, calcified lumps under the skin, high blood pressure, skin that is easily broken and skin infections. It should also be noted that left untreated Cushing’s disease could lead to obesity, heart disease and diabetes in the pet. Obviously if your pet is showing any of these symptoms it is a wise decision to make an appointment with your veterinarian. Cushing’s disease is very difficult to diagnose and unfortunately there is no one single test to identify the ailment. Your veterinarian will most likely run a battery of tests such as blood and urine tests and compare the findings to what normal levels should be. Depending on these results the veterinarian may find it prudent to follow up with x-rays or a sonogram to determine if there is a tumor present. Your veterinarian will determine treatment for the disease based on the severity of the affliction as well as your pet’s health. Most often medications that cause a decrease in the amount of cortisol produced are prescribed. In extreme cases of adrenal based Cushing’s disease the surgical removal of the adrenal gland may be necessary, however if the disease is pituitary based surgery is not an option. It should be noted that the surgical treatment of Cushing’s disease carries severe risks and should be considered only when all other options have failed to keep the disease in check. For those pet owners who wish to pursue a more natural remedy there are homeopathic blends that have proven quite effective in alleviating the symptoms of the disease. When searching out homeopathic remedies look for the following ingredients: Astragalus, this ingredient is effective as a nutritive and helps promote healthy liver function. In addition, Astragalus has proven useful in maintaining the immune system. Borage, this is an herb that possesses precursors of the hormones produced by the adrenal gland that aid the functions of your pets endocrine system. Bistorte possesses anti-inflammatory properties and has an energizing and refreshing effect on your pet’s liver and kidneys. Dandelion helps create a healthy appetite and supports the liver and adrenal gland function. It also aids in proper digestion. Wild Yam acts as an anti-inflammatory. Cushing’s disease is seldom a life-threatening ailment. Obviously it can make your pet more susceptible to secondary infection and disease because of its affect on the immune system. It can cause fatigue and intolerance to strenuous activity. However it can also show no symptoms at all. Most importantly by using a mixture of traditional as well as homeopathic treatments the symptoms of Cushing’s disease can be kept in check allowing your pet to live a long and happy life with you."
19,A Totally Cool Summer With Your Pets,pets," Spring has sprung and summer is just around the corner, bringing with it the fun of barbecues, softball and pool parties. To make all of theses activities more enjoyable many people include their pets. Here are a few tips to keep your best four-legged friend healthy and happy while having fun in the sun. It seems amazing that this tip must be shared time and time again yet every year there are tragic stories of pets dying in hot cars. Under no circumstances should your pet be left in the car on a sunny day. Even if the temperature outside seems mild the sunshine can raise the temperature inside of your car to 120 degrees Fahrenheit in just a few minutes. At this temperature brain damage occurs in a matter of minutes, followed by death. On especially hot days even parking in the shade is of little benefit. If you must go out to run errands it is best to leave the fur babies at home. When out in public locations such as parks keep your pet on a leash. This will help keep them from getting lost in a strange place, or becoming involved in altercations with other animals in the area. It will also ensure that their curiosity does not get the better of them and keep them from eating or drinking things that may be harmful to them. Join the hydration nation. Water is of the utmost importance to both you and your pet. Arrange it so that your pet has access to plenty of clean fresh water. Check their bowls several times a day on those really warm summer days. If you and your best friend are out and about be sure to take along plenty of H2O for the both of you. Don’t allow your pet to drink from the gutter or puddles in the street. The water in these places may contain harmful substances such as oil, pesticides or antifreeze. There are many innovative travel bowls as well as pet water bottles that make it easy and convenient to provide water for your pet when you’re on the go. Sunscreen for pets? You bet! Sure they have all of that fur to help protect them from the sun but our pets can suffer the same affects from the sun as we do such as sunburn. Sunscreen is just as important for your pet as it is for you, especially for those pets with lighter colored hair and red/pink noses. Try to avoid going out in the high sun but if you do be sure to use some sort of sunscreen. Your sunscreen will work or there are sunscreens created specifically for pets. Simply apply the sunscreen to unprotected areas like the tips of the ears, around the lips and, of course, on the nose. Take extra precautions on humid days. Unlike people who sweat over their entire body as a cooling mechanism our pets only sweat around their paws and depend on panting to cool down. When your pet is panting air moves throughout the nasal passages picking up heat that is then exhaled through the mouth. This is an extremely efficient cooling method however it can be extremely limited in times of high humidity. Also, if your pet has long hair make sure they are well groomed. While their coat helps protect them, if it is full of mats and tangles it could possibly hold too much heat close to their body so a good brushing may be in order. Or if you prefer you could treat them to a spa day at the groomers. Exercise is an important part of keeping your pet healthy and in actuality a pet at their proper weight can stay cool more easily. Overweight pets are more likely to become over heated because the extra layers of fat cause them to retain more heat in their bodies. However, even if your pet is at their proper weight take care that they do not over do it on those extra warm days. Also keep in mind that some pets are less tolerant of the heat than others. Older pets as well as puppies have a more difficult time regulating body temperature. Pets with ailments, whether temporary or chronic, are more susceptible to heat as well. Dogs with short snouts, such as pugs or bulldogs, are not able to pant as proficiently as those with full snouts limiting their ability to cool themselves, with these breeds of dogs it is wise to avoid the high heat of day whenever possible. Most importantly, watch out for heatstroke. As with people, heatstroke in pets is a medical emergency. Even with immediate treatment heatstroke can be fatal. Without question prevention is the best medicine. Indications of heatstroke can be, panting, staring, anxious expression, will not obey commands, high fever, warm dry skin, rapid heartbeat, vomiting, and collapse. If you think your pet is suffering from heatstroke prompt action should be taken.  Make contact with a veterinarian immediately and it is imperative that the body temperature be lowered. Get them out of direct sun, soak a towel, t-shirt, or whatever is available in cool water and apply it to the hairless areas of their body such as their underbelly. Often the pet will respond to this treatment in a very short amount of time, however they may quickly relapse as their body temperature goes back up. Once your pet has suffered heatstroke veterinarian care is required. The treatment your veterinarian gives your pet may include, further action to lower the body temperature, intravenous fluids to hydrate and treat possible shock, and medications to help prevent brain damage. While extreme temperatures can be hazardous to both you and your pet with some common sense and some simple precautions summer can be a time of great outdoor activities and fun for all."
20,Removing and Preventing Fleas on Dog Is Easier Than You Think,pets," What can be more annoying for a dog than fleas biting their skin? Your poor pet can do nothing but scratch and scratch away relieving the itchiness only temporarily. You’d go needs your help to fight these pesky parasites. Do you know what steps to take to not only get rid of fleas but also prevent them from coming back? While it is important for you to be on top of flea and tick control for your dog or cat, you do need to be careful of what you use and how you use it, especially when applying flea treatments to you or your pets. I recommend only using treatments specifically intended for the animal you are using it on. For example, only use flea treatments meant for dogs on dogs. A treatment meant for dogs can be harmful and sometimes deadly for cats. Always be careful of what you buy and read through all the labels on any treatment you purchase before applying it on your pet. Begin by giving your dog a good bath in warm, soapy water. It really isn’t necessary to use insecticidal dog flea shampoos. Fleas don’t really like soap but if you want a shampoo meant to kill fleas, look ones that promote flea & tick control and are made from all natural ingredients. Never use shampoos or products that contain DEET. This toxic chemical can cause serious adverse reactions in your pet. I like to give my pet a thorough combing daily using a special flea comb. This tool is designed to remove any fleas so you can then kill in soapy water. Many pet experts like to record the number of fleas you find every day as a way to keep a semi-accurate means to tell if you have a flea problem or not. Another way to remove fleas from your dog is by getting some sticky tape, wrap it around your hand and then pat your dog with it. This works great on short-haired breeds. After you have successfully removed the majority of the fleas from your dog, your next step is to follow a strict prevention routine. This is done to kill off any remaining stragglers while ensuring they remain under control. It is very important you kill the remaining few fleas before they get a chance to begin reproducing at an alarming rate. Keep up the routine for a few weeks even after you stop seeing fleas as a way to guarantee flea eradication success."
